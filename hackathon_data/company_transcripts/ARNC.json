My name is Shelby and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter 2018 Arconic earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Luther, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul Luther","Thank you Shelby. Good morning and welcome to Arconic's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. I am joined by John Plant, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will take your questions.","I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings.","In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix to today's presentation.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to John.","John Plant","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining the call today. I am going to begin with a brief introduction and then pass it across to Ken. He will take you through the financial results and guidance in a little bit middle bit more detail. And after that, I intend to provide an update on the strategy going forward of Arconic and then that will take your questions.","Let me begin by saying that I plan to lead Arconic through its new direction. I am going to try to explain that plan in more detail during the call. My background is that I was CEO of TRW Automotive from 2003 to 2015 until it was sold to ZF, a German Corporation. At that time, TRW employed 65,000 people, plus a minus, 190 facilities and generated nearly $18 billion of revenue per year. It was ranked amongst the 10 top global automotive suppliers. I have been a Director of Arconic since early 2016.","Joining the team with me is Elmer Doty, also a current director of Arconic and he will serve as President and Chief Operating Officer and he is going to focus on enhancing the company's operations. He has extensive experience in Arconic's core markets, including aerospace and defense. And Elmer is going to help support me in charting a new direction for the company and deliver value to the shareholders.","Turning to slide five and commenting on the fourth quarter and the highlights of 2018. Revenue for the fourth quarter was up 6% year-over-year and if you adjust out for things like FX or aluminum, it's up 10% organically. Revenue for the full-year was up 8% and 7% organically. Volume was up in each segment and all our main end-markets remain healthy. Demand for products is strong. Excluding special items, operating income was down 6% in the fourth quarter and down 4% for the year.","The unfavorable aluminum price impact was $36 million in the fourth quarter and $94 million for the year. Without the unfavorable impact of aluminum prices, operating income was up 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, compared to 2% for the full-year. And so we exited 2018 with momentum to grow profits in 2019. Operational improvements are taking hold in a number of our businesses. For example, in aero engines, the yields are improving. In rolled products, scrap utilization is increasing. In commercial transportation, automation and flow path optimization is being driven by our smart manufacturing initiatives.","In addition to our operations, we continue to focus on overhead and SG&A, as a percentage of revenue and that dropped to 4.1% of sales in 2018. We have made structural improvements in cash generation reflected in the adjusted free cash flow of $465 million for the year, about three times that of 2017. Working capital improved eight days resulting $392 million of inflow and improvement year-over-year. Not included in the $465 million is another $300 million for the proceeds of selling Texarkana and this enhances our overall cash position and optionality going forward.","We continue to attack legacy liabilities reducing net pension and OPEB liability by almost $0.5 billion while improving our cash position, liquidity and leverage ratios. Approximately 90% of the gross pension liability associated with defined benefit pension plans has now been closed to future accrual. Finally, our return on net assets improved 90 basis points to 9.2%.","And with that, I am going to hand it across to Ken to take us through the results for 2018 in a little bit more detail.","Ken Giacobbe","Thank you John and good morning everyone. Now let's move to slide six and the key financial results for the quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $3.5 billion, up $201 million or 6% year-over-year. Organic revenue, which adjusts for aluminum prices, currency, Tennessee packaging and the divestiture of the Latin American extrusions business was up $306 million or 10% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis. The reconciliation for organic revenue can be found on slide 22 in the appendix.","Revenue growth was driven by volume gains in all of our segments. All of our key markets continued to be helping. Organically, our aero engines and automotive were up 14%, commercial transportation was up 12% and aero and defense was up 26% year-over-year. Double digit growth in these markets was supported by solid organic growth of 8% in aero airframe. The growth in the aero airframes is notable as you may recall that we experienced weakness in aero airframes due to wide-body production mix in the first three quarters of the year. In the fourth quarter, growth in single aisle aerospace volume more than offset the wide-body decline and we will have a tailwind as we go into 2019. We have included year-over-year market growth rates on slide 24 and 25 in the appendix.","Excluding special items, operating income was $323 million in the fourth quarter, down $20 million or 6% year-over-year. Without the unfavorable impact of aluminum prices, operating income was up 5% year-over-year, which represents the third straight quarter of year-over-year improvement when we exclude the price impact. In the fourth quarter, operating income was favorably impacted by $56 million due to higher volumes across all segments, particularly in aerospace and defense in our EP&S business, as well as automotive and commercial transportation in GRP. Aluminum prices unfavorably impacted operating income in the fourth quarter by $36 million on a year-over-year basis and operating income margin percent by hundred basis points.","While average aluminum prices decreased sequentially, aluminum prices were still 4% higher in the fourth quarter versus last year. The favorable impact of declining aluminum prices on LIFO was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of metal lag in the quarter. Lower aluminum prices at the end of the year resulted in an unfavorable mark-to-mark loss on aluminum derivative contracts in the quarter. Higher scrap spreads continued to impact us unfavorably as we are net seller of aluminum scrap. The components of aluminum price impact as well as aluminum price impacts by segment can be found on slides 20, 21 and 23 in the appendix.","Finally, our operating income was driven by $33 million unfavorable mix primarily caused by new product introductions in aerospace. In our aero engines, specifically more than half of our product mix is comprised of the new engine platforms. Operating income margin percent excluding special items was 9.3% for the fourth quarter, down 120 basis points year-over-year with 100 basis points of the decrease due to higher aluminum prices. We have also included a reconciliation of operating income excluding special items on slide 34 in the appendix.","Adjusted free cash flow, as John mentioned, in the fourth quarter was $478 million or $102 million more than the fourth quarter of 2017. The improved free cash flow generation was driven primarily by favorable operating working capital that drove a $116 million benefit year-over-year. Days working capital improved eight days year-over-year. Compared to last year, lower pension contributions offset the increase in capital expenditures. Two-thirds of our capital spend in the quarter was for return seeking projects as we continue to expand our wheels capacity at Hungary, install the horizontal heat treat furnace in Davenport, Iowa for the industrial and aerospace markets and expand aero engine capacity in Whitehall, Michigan and Moorestown, Tennessee.","Diluted earnings per share excluding special items was $0.33, or $0.02 higher than the fourth quarter of 2017. Lower pension and OPEB expense and lower interest expense offset the unfavorable earnings per share impact of higher aluminum prices. Finally, operational results largely driven by strong volumes across all segments improved earnings per share by $0.02.","Now let's move to the segment results on slide seven. In the fourth quarter, EP&S' revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Organic revenue was up 9% due to double digit volume growth in aero engines and aero defense. Segment operating profit was $220 million, down $8 million or 4% year-over-year. Growth in the aerospace and defense markets as well as a favorable impact from aluminum prices were more than offset by the unfavorable impact of new product introductions in aerospace and lower pricing particularly in our fasteners business as we continue to gain share in fasteners. Additionally, manufacturing challenges in the engineered structures business unfavorably impacted results, including a $10 million impact in the fourth quarter due to Cleveland press outage. Presses was repaired and operational at the end of the fourth quarter, which was four weeks ahead of our schedule. Segment operating profit margin percent was 13.6%, down 170 basis points year-over-year.","In the fourth quarter, GRP's revenue was $1.4 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year. Organic revenue was up 13% due to double digit growth in automotive, aero airframes and commercial transportation. Segment operating profit was $77 million, down $14 million or 15% year-over-year. Growth in the automotive and commercial transportation markets as well as favorable pricing in aerospace and the industrial markets were more than offset by the unfavorable impact of aluminum prices and higher transportation costs. Segment operating profit margin percent was 5.7%, down 160 basis points year-over-year, including an unfavorable 150 basis point impact from aluminum prices.","In the fourth quarter, TCS delivered revenue of $497 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Organic revenue was up 4% as we continued to see strong growth in commercial transportation. Segment operating profit was $63 million, down $14 million or 18% year-over-year. Higher volume in commercial transportation and building construction along with net cost savings were more than offset by pricing pressures in commercial transportation as well as the unfavorable impact of aluminum prices. Segment operating profit margin percent was 12.7%, down 190 basis points year-over-year, including an unfavorable 330 basis point impact from aluminum prices.","Now let's move to the fourth quarter key achievement slide on slide eight. For the fourth quarter, EP&S' revenue was over $1.6 billion which was a record quarter for any quarter in EP&S' history. The record revenue continues to be driven by unprecedented customer demand for our products and reflects double digit volume growth on a year-over-year basis in aero engines up 13% and aero defense up 26%. Regarding GRP, in the fourth quarter, we continued to deliver strong growth in the major markets as automotive revenue was up 13% organically and commercial airframe revenue was up 15% organically as weakness in wide-body volume was more than offset by strength in single aisle volume. In TCS, organic growth in commercial transportation continues to be strong with a 6% increase year-over-year. And the TCS team continues to consistently deliver improved net savings, driven by smart manufacturing initiatives.","Now let's move to slide nine and I will touch on some of the key themes for our full-year 2018 results. Revenue for the year came in at $14 billion, up $1 billion or 8% year-over-year. Organic revenue increased $843 million or 7% year-over-year. As we have been saying all year, our key markets remain healthy and strong with double digit year-over-year growth in automotive, aero engines, commercial transportation and aero defense. Excluding special items, operating income was $1.4 billion for the year, down $60 million or 4%. Without the unfavorable impact of aluminum prices, operating income was up 2% year-over-year.","Higher revenue and strong markets resulted in a $195 million favorable volume impact to operating income while a weaker aero airframes production mix and new product introductions in aerospace contributed $115 million of unfavorable mix to operating income. Aluminum prices unfavorably impacted operating income for the year by $94 million on a year-over-year basis and operating income margin by 90 basis points. The unfavorable aluminum price impact was evenly split between unfavorable mark-to-mark losses on aluminum derivative contracts, higher scrap spreads and operational losses. For the year, the impact of LIFO and metal lag essentially offset each other, which is expected given the rise and fall of aluminum prices throughout the year.","As I mentioned before, adjusted free cash flow was driven by strong working capital improvements as we achieved an eight day reduction in days working capital. Two-thirds of our capital spend for the year was for return seeking projects. 2018 diluted earnings per share excluding special items was $1.36 or $0.14 higher than 2017. Lower pension and OPEB expense, lower interest expense and lower taxes more than offset unfavorable earnings per share impact of higher aluminum prices.","Now let's move to slide 10 for our 2019 guidance. Supported by growth in most of our key end-markets, we are expecting to see organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% in 2019. That would put revenue at approximately $14.3 billion to $14.6 billion. The aerospace and defense markets are expected to continue to experience robust growth. We are also uniquely positioned in automotive and commercial transportation to continue with solid revenue growth, which we also anticipate strong growth in our industrial markets.","As we continue to focus on operational performance and driving further cost reductions, we expect that earnings per share excluding special items in 2019 will be between $1.55 per share to $1.65 per share, which would represent a 14% to 21% improvement in earnings per share excluding special items versus 2018. The guidance would exclude any favorable impact of share repurchases. Favorable impacts from volume, net cost savings, aerospace pricing and lower aluminum prices will be partially offset by new product introductions in aerospace as well as transportation costs in aluminum scrap spreads.","Regarding aluminum prices in 2019, we expect at least a $25 million tailwind based on our current metal assumption of $2,400 per metric ton, including LME and Midwest Premium. One of the key drivers is the adoption of a new accounting standard which allows most of our hedge contracts to qualify for hedge accounting which will significantly reduce our mark-to-market exposure. Regarding free cash flow, our target for 2019 is in the range of $400 million to 500 million. I will note that this is an annual target and reflects an expected first quarter usage of cash based on the anticipating timing of interest payments and pension contributions as well as working capital increases.","On slide 11, we have provided key assumptions to derive the 2019 guidance. I will note the following. As previously mentioned, aluminum price assumption used for guidance is $2,400 per metric ton for LME and Midwest Premium. The capital expenditure assumption is approximately $700 million including a potential expansion of our Tennessee operations to capture growth and demand for industrial and automotive aluminum sheet.","Before turning it back to John, let me cover a few items that can be found in appendix. On slide 18 in the appendix, we have summarized four special items for the fourth quarter. The first category relates to restructuring, which resulted in income of $11 million pretax which consisted primarily of the following four subcategories.","First, income of $154 million related to the gain on the sale of Texarkana rolling mill. The transaction closed on October 31 and resulted in cash proceeds of $302 million plus an additional continuing consideration of up to $50 million.","Second, a non-cash charge of $43 million related to the loss on sale of our forgings business in Hungary. The transaction closed on December 31 and resulted in cash proceeds of $2 million. This was a small plant in our portfolio with about $30 million of annual revenue.","Third, a non-cash charge of $92 million related to pension settlement accounting for one of our larger U.S. pension plans, which was previously disclosed in our third quarter 10-Q.","Finally, a non-cash charge of $9 million related to pension curtailments associated with the U.K. pension plan freeze announced in the fourth quarter 2018 and is effective in the first quarter of 2019. As John mentioned earlier, 90% of our gross pension liability associated with defined benefit plans are now closed to future accruals.","The second category of special items is a $4 million charge for external legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower which were recorded in SG&A. This level of spending has been consistent with previous quarters.","The third category of special items is a $7 million charge for external costs related to the strategy and portfolio review, which were recorded in SG&A.","Our last category is related to a number of discrete tax items in the fourth quarter. I will touch on these quick. First, we recorded the tax charge of $45 million related to the finalization of our analysis of the U.S. tax reform that enacted at the end of 2017. Second, we recorded a $74 million benefit related to the reversal of foreign tax-deferred liability. And finally, we recorded a $30 million benefit associated with the current tax year law and tax rate changes as well as another listing of various jurisdictions. All of that information will be detailed in the 10-K, which will be issued later this month.","The last item I would like to talk about is on slide 19 in the appendix. We have provided an update on our capital structure as we continue to manage debt and reduce our liabilities. We finished the year with $2.3 billion of cash, up $750 million sequentially. Gross debt is $6.3 billion and net debt stands at $4.1 billion. Net debt to EBITDA continues to improve and stands at 2.05 times, which is an improvement of approximately 39% since the fourth quarter of 2016.","With that, I will turn it back to John.","John Plant","Thanks Ken. And I would now like to give you an update on our plans. The plan involves three things to talk to, cost reduction, portfolio and capital allocation. So let me start with cost. We have commenced plans to cut operating costs by approximately $200 million on an annual run rate basis. The plan is designed to maximize the 2019 impact. We will further examine this potential as we move through 2019.","Second item is portfolio. We determined that we will separate the portfolio into two fundamental areas, the engineered products and forgings business and the global rolled products. The determination of which company is the RemainCo and which SpinCo will be optimized to maximize future shareholder returns.","In addition, we will consider the sale of businesses that do not best fit into the engineered products and forgings or the global rolled business. We will have more details to share with you on these actions as they develop. We plan to follow accelerated timelines and provide quarterly updates on our progress.","Regarding capital allocation, we intend to execute the $500 million of previously authorized share repurchases in the first half of this year. The Board has also authorized an additional $500 million buyback effective to the end of 2020. We will also reduce the quarterly dividend prospectively to $0.02 per share from the current $0.06 per share. This will provide us with a $60 million cash benefit in 2019 and $80 million in 2020.","And with that, I wills top and open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research.","Carter Copeland","Hi. Good morning gentlemen. Just a couple of quick ones. John, on the split that you have talked about here, how do you get truly comfortable with the standalone EPN&S, given the potential volatility we may see on some wide-body programs, I think most notably the A380, should that shutdown relatively soon? I would assume that would have an impact similar to what you have seen in the last couple of years. As well as, I think there will almost certainly be a lot more investment in Whitehall and Moorestown to get to the rates the airframers are talking about and pushing for a couple of years out?","John Plant","Okay. So let me start with, I would say, airplane builds. Every projection that I have seen says the total aircraft build increases, narrow-body in particular. And my understanding is that we have at least a seven year backlog of airframe deliveries which are [indiscernible]. If anything, it's increasing. So while I wouldn't claim to be an expert in the aerospace sector, that's the future demand profile that I have never enjoyed previously in my life. And I think it's just a tremendous platform that we have and it gives us the ability to grow into the future.","So if we the A380 will be cancelled, yes, I guess we would lose some sales, but assuming that people are still buying aircraft, they will buy other ones and maybe that will work out just fine. So I wouldn't get too concerned about one individual, I would say, airframe and focus more on the whole market. That's the first comment I will make.","And the second part of your question was, I think, additional capital. I think I answered that pretty clearly by saying that we are going to spend less capital in 2019 than we spent in 2018. That's been reviewed and being reviewed already. In fact, I am going to say, after a day on the job, it's about $100 million lighter than I think it was envisaged. And by tomorrow or the day after maybe, it will be a lower number, I don't know. But the guidance that I have given of $700 million is what you should assume. And that contains within it all of the investments required to drive the investments in Whitehall and elsewhere to provide the ability to meet the engine ramp.","And so I don't feel concerned about that. I am hoping that we continue with the increasing yields that we are currently seeing in those, say, turbine blade plants and hopefully we begin to work our way through the backlog. Right now, I am not aware if we have any major, I would say, customer deliveries but we certainly have a backlog and look forward to trying to clear that with the investments which we have already made in 2018 and the high yields which are beginning to come through and which you have seen in the run rate in the fourth quarter that we talked to earlier.","Does that answer your question?","Carter Copeland","Yes. I guess I am just wondering if you affect the transaction to spend by the time it closes, I completely understand the capital plan for 2019. But when you look at what the capital plans will need to be is we talk about rates on the narrow-bodies that are 70 and higher or investments in the military, should we need to be higher and I am just wondering about the capital structure of that smaller entity, especially as you continue to deal with the new program impacts on EBIT and cash and whatnot, just as it pertains to capital structure, as it pertains to how much wriggle room you will have in that, that's really just what I was looking for.","John Plant","Yes. I mean, I just don't see that is the fundamental worry that I should have at this point. I am hopeful that EPS margins will improve, cash flow will improve. There will be a keener eye to investment. We will invest to make sure we meet customer demand and also improve efficiency. And I am particularly focused on driving up OEE in the plants and that will be one of the critical metrics going forward. And coming from an auto industry background, I expect to see ongoing improvements quarter after quarter in that. And you should assume that those questions will be being asked.","Carter Copeland","Okay. And just for the follow-up. On the new program EBIT impacts, you called that out in GRP, but excuse me, but I missed it in EPN&S, but were EPN&S new program impact on EBIT better or worse than GRP? And how are those trending? Any color you can give us there, I think would be helpful?","John Plant","I think that's more of a Ken question at this point in time and so I will ask Ken to respond to that as it's interplay between them.","Ken Giacobbe","So we think the wide-bodies and the jumbos from the GRP side with sheet and plate, it's pretty much stabilized, right. They have been coming down. We have taken a hit this year. But now we are seeing the single-aisle leapfrogging the wide-body. So that is a heck of a lot more single-aisle planes to offset the wide-body. But we actually saw a net increase leaving Q4. So we feel confident as we go into next year. That should be a tailwind for the GRP business in terms of sheet and plate.","On the EPN&S side, on the engines piece, we are about a little over 50% is the new engine platforms. As we are going through that, we have we got new products. Our learner call cost on those new products takes us a little bit more. But at the same time, our engines team has been working through the operational improvements, getting cost out. And on most of the products that we have were at or above our contractual share. So as the commercial teams look at additional volume to come through the plants, we are looking to get incremental price associated with that.","So we feel optimistic on both the GRP. As we go into 2019, there will be a tailwind and cost structure improving in EPN&S along with the commercial effort to get more price.","Carter Copeland","So Ken, embedded in your plan, just to be specific in EPN&S in the guidance, do you envision that there will be new program EBIT headwinds, 2019 versus 2018? Or will those flip to tailwind since you are still going up significantly in volume?","Ken Giacobbe","I think that net net there would be puts and takes here, but I think it will be a net tailwind as we going to next year, margin expansion.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, we asked participants that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up only. Your next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Co.","Gautam Khanna","Thank you. First question would be, what do you envision the cost to actually due to breakup to be? Cash costs over what timeframe? And anything you can say there about cash cost and to synergies?","John Plant","I would like to give you a number. I can't today. I would hope it's fundamentally a lower number than the split numbers for Alcoa in 2016. I will update you on that next quarter when we have got more detail.","Gautam Khanna","Thank you. A follow up question would be and please forgive the question, but I get it all the time. What happened? Chip Blankenship was just recently put in. It looked like the operational processes were improving. You guys talked about abating losses and improving profits on the next-gen engines. And yet, we are at our fourth CEO in four years. I am just curious if you can give any context around what's really going on? Thank you.","John Plant","Well, I think the most important thing is to look forward not backwards. I don't see why my answering that question provides, I would say, anything to do with quality of revenues and quality of profits going forward. So I will give you some commentary but those things which were in the past, you can do nothing about and what we really about is managing, driving and mapping out the future. So that's the most important thing.","And so I would say, my approach is, I spend 95% of my time looking at the front windshield and maybe 5% of my time looking through the rearview mirror. And I think that's the most important aspects of leadership. So let me first of all take issue with, I will say, the four. I mean, certainly if I am the fourth, one of them was someone who voluntarily stepped in for a period of time in the immediacy of the aftermath after the 2017 proxy battle that went on.","And as you can imagine, directly after a proxy battle, you are not in any great shape to immediately stick someone into the job. And so we carried out the search process. Chip was appointed. I have only good things to say about the things that Chip did. And to carry us forward, to carry out the direction that I have talked to this morning, the Board felt it is appropriate to make not only, I would say, a new direction in terms of the strategic intent of the company, but also it is appropriate to make a change in leadership. It's that straightforward.","Gautam Khanna","I appreciate it. I had to ask. Thank you.","John Plant","Of course, I mean I guess I expected that somebody. It just happened to be you, Gautam, that asked the question. If not you, it would be somebody else. So don't feel worried or concerned about it.","Gautam Khanna","Thank you.","John Plant","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani of Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi. Good morning gentlemen.","John Plant","Good morning.","Rajeev Lalwani","I am actually going to pick up after the last question. So I will apologize in advance too.","John Plant","Okay.","Rajeev Lalwani","John, just from a Board perspective, can you just provide some color as to what happened over the last couple of years. I know you prefer to look forward. I get that. But just why did it take so long to come to a decision to split up the company?? I mean it seemed like that was potentially a logical decision couple a years ago as opposed to today. So that's the first part of the question.","John Plant","Let's just track back through time. I mean, I don't really know that much before 2016. I saw, I am going to say, reports maybe the first thoughts, speaking from the analyst community, about spitting Alcoa was around about the 2010 or 2011 timeframe. And I can't exactly be that sure about how that decision was formed in 2015. So I came into the Board just after and was really, I would say, experiencing the full, I will call it, tumult of trying to split a corporation that's over 100 years old and all of that entailed. And it wasn't an easy split by any means, given some of the, I will say, legacy issues and some of the joint venture relationships that was occurring or had been put in place.","And so we had to find the means of minding all of that. And so let's call it a new Alcoa was spun out and Arconic was a new name but the historical company was RemainCo. You can argue about which was better to have a clean, I will say, future entity or not, but it is what it was. And we are sure, at that time that was the best arrangement. And I mean that in itself was a pretty momentous activity and really I think the company probably needed to have some period of stability for a period of time. And that's, I will say, what we have had in terms of trying to be together, the single Arconic. And I will say, management in place to do that.","Now when I look at, I will say, the thoughts that the Board has considered over the recent months, it's a plan that I feel is entirely right. I was highly engaged in, say, crafting if not originating it and say this is the time to move on. And it strikes me that there are fundamentally different rhythms, return profiles, capital allocation requirements in terms of investment between raw products in aerospace. So the logic, I think, is there. I mean you could argue, well, maybe it was there before, but it's unusual that we would have done that in 216. We got to it in 2019 and most important thing is we are doing it now.","So maybe you could critique us for timing, but I don't think you could critique us for intent. And so you again, going back to let's look through the windshield and look forward, we are on our way. The path is determined and the teams are being wound up to achieve that with what I believe will be a higher clock speed of an organization which is what I believe in. And that's it.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thanks for that, John. And then I have a follow-up to Ken. Ken, you talked about improving margins going into next year. But if we look at the fourth quarter, it looks like and correct me if I am wrong, there was a sequential decline in a number of fronts, specifically to EPN&S from 3Q to 4Q. Can you just provide some comfort on the improvement going forward? Was that just a mix dynamic, the Cleveland press outage? Was that what was creating the weakness is 4Q? And so maybe the trend in 4Q isn't the right run rate to use, if you will?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes. That's right, Rajeev. So the Cleveland press outage, that's a one timer of $10 million that impacted the results. That press is running operationally. It's delivering on customer demand. There is other things that are going on in the business. Again, as were getting incremental volume going through the plants as we move into 2019, we have got better absorption. There has been a lot of very good work in terms of operational improvements in, I will use rings as an example and we talked about, I believe, on the last call about deploying continuous improvement engineers to the rings business. We put five resources there. We have seen substantial improvement. They cut their past dues by around 28% in 2018. They improved their quality by reducing PPM by about 25%. They had record revenue for the year as we exited out as well. So we are getting these bottlenecks improved and you can see it sequentially as we go into next year as well. So I see that as a favorable item as we move forward for margin expansion.","Rajeev Lalwani","I will leave it there. Thank you gentlemen.","John Plant","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. So one question, I guess a two-parter about strategy and the portfolio. John, do you intend to preside over the split of the company during your time at CEO? And secondly, I noticed that the release mentioned potentially selling businesses, but not specifically the BCS business which had previously been on for sale. I wonder if you can address that including in the context of any potential Grenfell Tower exposure which is an entity that came up frequently in the press in recent months.","John Plant","Okay. I guess it's better to make a note because you rounded about three or four things into that one. So I didn't comment on BCS because that's previously announced and I will say, the process is underway. I have no update on that to provide to you today.","In terms of my timeframe, I agreed to step in. I understand that I have put a time expiry date on that. The plan is that starting next week, teams are going to be engaged and focused on the separation and all of us are required to do that and it's obviously a major project when you do that. And that's probably I am going to guess nine to 15 months. So the spin, I am going to say, will be either done or largely underway and certainly framed in the timeframe that I envisage my engagement with the company.","You mentioned asset sales. Obviously there's work required to get from intent to implementation. I deliberately didn't call out what those might be today and I have no plans to do so in answering any questions. But obviously financials are put together and strategies developed to maximize the outcome of those, whether it's in the form of sale or some form of Reverse Morris Trust transaction. All the things are up for debate. And I will say though the plans may be a little bit more advanced than you think.","Regarding Grenfell. Yes, it's certainly got a lot of the press and some of that, I think, is regrettable in terms of stuff that's somehow got leaked into the press while we are examining the whole company transaction and then may be what may have seem to be an impediment to that. My update for you on Grenfell is that there is a public inquiry. I think the Phase 1 is just about complete. I guess a report is going to be produced. Maybe there will be a second public inquiry developed from that which comes out of the first one. And outside of, I will say, the derivative claims we may have had, there is currently no current, I will say, specific claims for compensation or anything like that coming from it and neither does the company believe that it was the cause of this incident. And obviously lawyers are engaged. We will continue to examine the facts. But right now, I think we have a reasonable view of the fact pattern.","Seth Seifman","Great. Thank you very much.","John Plant","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays.","David Strauss","Thanks. Good morning. John, the cost reduction program that you highlight today, can you give any detail there in terms of what it consists of and how this might be different than prior cost reduction programs we have seen the company undertake?","John Plant","Yes. Well, first of all, I am not that familiar apart from seeing the numbers in terms of the approach. So the I way I look at it right now is that, I will say, I am here in New York dealing with this and the portfolio stuff. Meanwhile, Elmer is in between Cleveland and Pittsburgh developing a level of granularity on those cost reduction plans, which I am going to be reviewing over Saturday and Sunday in Pittsburgh and with a view that we are going to implement sooner rather than later.","There is nothing magical about cost reduction programs. It's always the same stuff in terms of, I am going to say, both semi-fixed costs and that's obviously staffing levels. It's all about matters of efficiencies. It will look at discretionary spend. It will look at things like indirect spend. The only thing that I haven't put on the agenda for the first wave of this is any direct material cost focus beyond jus the normal things that are going on. So it will just be traditional looking at fundamental benchmarking compared to competitor sets and in particular, I do like to see efficiency and productivity developments each quarter of each year.","So I am interested in things like value added per employee, seeing progression in all of that absolutely. And I don't really know what else to say to you. There is nothing magical about cost reduction. It just is. And I am hoping that everybody gets the sense of urgency that I believe is required around all of this. I recognize that if I look back over a decade, I could argue that shareholders haven't seen sufficient returns and it will be, maybe the word is inappropriate, it would be nice to see them improved. That's about it really.","David Strauss","As a follow-up, so I know that you have this ongoing sale process for building construction. What is left of TCS? Where is that contemplated going as part of all this? And then could you maybe give us a little bit of help on the pension liability and how that potentially could be divvied up among the separate businesses, separate companies on a go forward basis? Thank you.","John Plant","The words I have given you today around the two fundamental businesses, give me enough, I will say, room to decide whether the commercial wheel business is part of the first segment I have talked about. It's not part of the rolling assets for sure. And we will just look at that amongst, is that the best fit and best destiny for it? Don't know yet. So that's the answer to the one question.","What was your second one, again?","David Strauss","Pension.","John Plant","All right. Pension.","David Strauss","Obviously you have a large pension liability, how that might be allocated among the go forward companies?","John Plant","Well, the first thought is straightforward in terms of what naturally belongs there and then in a company with the, I will say, size legacy of Arconic, will have a lump left in corporate and I think that has yet to be determined exactly where that would reside. And it's all going to be into intertwined with, I will call it, RemainCo versus SpinCo and what's the best profile and ability to have, I would say, the liabilities attached to which entity which has to be a good future for both of them, because there is only good intent to have two strong businesses emerge which hopefully, I will say, trade at multiples that they could hope for. And so just don't think I can give you a number nor should I, if I was even been able to, let's say, to where am I going to allocate that corporate pension part of the liability against any specific business at this point in time. But whatever it is, it's going to be there to benefits, I will say, the outcome in terms of the, I will call, shareholder value.","David Strauss","Thank you very much.","John Plant","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Korn of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Korn","Hi. Thanks and good morning. John, a question for you on autos. The auto OEMs globally have offered a pretty dire outlook into 2019. How are you qualifying the risk as you see it in your automotive business, in particular on weak demand and production outlook overall?","John Plant","Okay. So I guess I have some perspective, having come from the auto industry and I get peripheral understanding some segments of various, I will say, Boards I am on to look into it. And I still get like a daily summary of auto world. So it's interesting. I haven't completely gone to the beach, if that was the thought of it.","In terms of outlook, my guess is that we are into a level of auto sales and production, which is been sustained at a high level, particularly here in North America for some time. I think the thing which I find particularly encouraging about the Arconic position is probably the underlying, I will say, direction of light weighting in the industry. And therefore the opportunity for a secular growth trend in putting in lighter weight metals into the vehicle. And I will say aluminum is right at the forefront of doing that. And it's much cheaper, I think, than for example putting in magnesium sheets into body panels and structures.","So I think the, I will say, tensile strength, lightweight characteristics of aluminum are rights in that sweet spot of the lightweighting of vehicles. Currently, the majority of the outlet for Arconic's product is into the light truck market and the pickup truck in particular. And I think there is a feeling that that's still very strong. But when you look at the cadence of future platform launches and each of those having additional aluminum content on them, then I can persuade myself that the trend is good. I haven't had the time to calibrate, I will say, points of the order cycle and what the demand profile might be by way of production of just underlying quantity versus that secular growth. That's something I am just not at that level of knowledge about yet. It's something I will be interested in looking at.","Matthew Korn","I appreciate that. It sounds that it's a matter of penetration. It's a matter of platform. And I believe I heard you earlier, I think you mentioned a potential expansion there at Tennessee for ABS, if I am correct. Could you give any more detail there? Is that approved? Is that still under consideration? And what would be cost and timing and additional capacity there, if I heard you right?","John Plant","Yes. I am not sure whether we have made any announcements on the Tennessee investments. But I can tell you, it had a lot of scrutiny in December. And we have looked, I am going to say, I looked at it to a high degree personally, even as Chairman and decided that when I look at the demand profile of what we see going forward for the next few years, I will say, the path of investment, which starts off slow but we can use, I will say, a lot of leverage to get the benefits from that investments as you go through. It's something which and the returns that I envisaged, we have a contingency again. So it's returns in terms of coming at a lighter level of capital than we authorized. But the answer is, it's been agreed. So it's going ahead. I think it's is great for the future revenue stream for the rolled parts business. And I think that's going to be particularly important when rolled products is its own independent entity and being able to articulate a good future.","Matthew Korn","I appreciate it, John. Good luck to you.","John Plant","Thank you. Yes, I appreciate the lat comment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Olin of Longbow Research.","Chris Olin","Yes. I was wondering if we could get a progress report on the restructuring efforts that were going on with the aerospace frames and disc business. And I got the sense that Chip was personally leading the efforts to basically restructuring those two operations. And I guess, now what, would be my question?","John Plant","Well, I am certainly familiar with the issues which emanated from the 2015 decision to buy Firth Rixson. In fact, that was my first exposure in February 2016 to, I will say, something which was a little bit different to what I thought was the case. Rings and discs, my understanding is that it's showing some improvement. There is still a long way to go. It's receiving and will receive a lot of scrutiny with a view to, I will say, controlling the cash flow and looking at the pricing of such business, again to basically make an improved outcome for that business going forward. So it's certainly one of the big things on the radar screen. And I am not sure that Elmer and I are going to get through it this weekend inside the engine business. We will be spending time looking at that for sure.","Ken, is there anything else you would like to add at this point?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes. I think you hit on it, John. As we look at the revenue of that business, it was good. We were up about 8% year-over-year. We are seeing the impact of the debottlenecking. I mentioned the rings comments earlier in terms of what they are doing there. The disc business is well. Volume growth. We invested some CapEx down there as well in the disc business to in-source some of the material, but we are seeing improvement as we exit the year second half more favorable than the first half in terms of profitability. So a lot of work to still be done down there, but the resources are deployed and the team knows what to do.","Chris Olin","Okay. Thanks. And then just quickly, when you look at the two new segments for the portfolio, I guess I was curious if there's anything that will be done to enhance the GRP value? And I guess, what I was thinking is, would the titanium business stay within EP&S or the Forgings business or would that move? And then my second question was, in terms of the $200 million cost goal, is that broken out by each segment? Thanks.","John Plant","No. I can't give you that analysis between the two at this point in time. That will be the, I guess, one of the things we will talk about in the future. In terms of trying to make raw products as good as it can possibly be, I think that's just normal stuff that management should do. And I think it is a solid business. Again, I am looking for further throughput and yield and uptime in terms of those mills and being very selective on any investment going forward. It should be good cash generative business.","Chris Olin","Thanks. Good luck.","John Plant","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Martin Englert of Jefferies.","Martin Englert","Hi. Good morning everyone.","John Plant","Hi Martin.","Martin Englert","I wondered if you could touch on the scrap spreads as it still remains a headwind for the company? Talk a little bit about what's being done there to mitigate the cost headwinds? What's factored into the guide for 2019? And then, will the company remain scrap long as they exit the year?","John Plant","Yes. So scrap spreads right now were up still 40% on a year-over-year basis. We will probably have a headwind for the first half of 2019 as we start to overlap last year's performance. What the GRP team is doing a nice job is greater scrap utilization in the business. If you look at Q1 and you go out to Q4, it's about 180 basis points improvement in scrap utilization, 180 basis points. Each 100 basis points is worth about $10 million of profit. GRP team sees more opportunity for that as we go into 2019. There could be anywhere between 200 basis point plus as we going to next year.","Martin Englert","Okay. Thanks for that detail there. And then on the guidance there and you provide a good sensitivity around the LIFO impact for aluminum. Can you talk about your assumptions for LIFO impact from other non-aluminum base metals and inputs?","John Plant","It should be small, somewhere probably in the range of $20 million to $25 million on an annual basis.","Martin Englert","Okay. Thanks for that detail.","Operator","Seth Seifman has another question.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much. Ken, you mentioned that you are taking some share in fasteners. You also talk about declining prices. Can talk a little bit about the state of the market there? How much price competition is intensifying and the trade-off between price and share gain and earnings?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes. Similar to last quarter, we talked about fastener prices. Well, we mentioned where we did give us some price to get more volume and more share. The advantage of the increased volume in share more than offset the price reduction. We talked about margin expansion in Q3 in the fasteners business. We are seeing the same thing from an operational perspective in fasteners in Q4. So we have margin expansion given up little bit of price but more volume, better mix, as we run that through that business. So we are confident as we going to next year. That's a favorable in terms of margin expansion.","John Plant","I am going to come in and give a comment as well, is that one thing that I have been introducing and now look at it from a Board perspective was getting reported out in the second half of last year and obviously now we are looking at it is basically a view each quarter in terms of pricing getting stronger or weaker. And in particular looking at the profitability of new contracts is an important discipline in the company. And so philosophically, I don't believe in buying business. We have to earn the right technologically and so it's one where the rigor in pricing is important. So I just wanted to make sure that attitudinally, you know where I come from.","Seth Seifman","Okay. Thank you very much.","John Plant","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you everyone for joining us today. That's all the time we have. Thank you for your patience for connecting. You me now disconnect.","John Plant","Thank you."],"2987":["Arconic Inc (NYSE:ARNC) Q3 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2018 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Paul Luther - Director of IR ","Charles Blankenship - CEO","Ken Giacobbe - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Company","David Strauss - Barclays","Seth Seifman - JPMorgan","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","Chris Olin - Longbow Research","Josh Sullivan - Seaport Global","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Company","Phil Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital","Brian Reilly - Barclays","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Arconic's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Julie and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Paul Luther, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Paul Luther","Thank you, Julie. Good morning and welcome to Arconic's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. I\u2019m joined by Chip Blankenship, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by Chip and Ken, we will take your questions.","I would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today\u2019s presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings.","In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release and in the Appendix in today\u2019s presentation.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Chip.","Charles Blankenship","Good morning. Thank you for joining the call.","I\u2019ll begin with an update on the strategy review and third quarter highlights, then Ken will take you through our financial results. I\u2019ll conclude with guidance, and we will take your questions after that.","As a reminder, the goal of our strategy review is to develop actions that will enhance shareholder value, streamline the portfolio, tighten our strategic focus and strengthen our financial profile. We have completed significant milestones as reported last quarter; however, we are extending the scope and duration of this activity. We now anticipate completing the strategy review in the fourth quarter.","Two publicly-announced outcomes of earlier phases of the strategy review are already in motion. The sale process for the Building and Construction Systems business is well underway and has drawn robust interest. We signed an agreement to sell our Texarkana aluminum rolling mill to Ta Chen, monetizing a substantially idle facility for $300 million in cash, as well as $50 million in earn-out potential. This is one element of the GRP transformation and growth strategy that we are developing.","Before Ken takes you through the financial results, I\u2019d like to share some highlights from the third quarter. Revenue was up 9% year-over-year, 7% organically. Volume was up in each segment. Earnings per share increased by 28% year-over-year. Segment operating profit was flat overall for EP&S with engines and fasteners posting growth, offset by performance shortfalls in structures. Segment operating profit increased for both GRP and TCS.","Adjusted free cash flow was $115 million, up from $41 million in 3Q the previous year. Working capital improved by eight days, ending the quarter at 54 days. Our liquidity remains strong with $1.5 billion cash on-hand and access to a total of $5.3 billion.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ken.","Ken Giacobbe","Thank you, Chip.","I will move rather quickly through the slides, so that we can get to the updated annual guidance and your questions. We\u2019ve also included several slides in the Appendix for added transparency.","Now, let\u2019s move to Slide 5. Revenue for the third quarter came in at $3.5 billion, up $288 million or 9% year-over-year as aluminum prices accounted for $108 million or almost 40% of the increase. Revenue growth was driven by volume gains across all segments. All of our major markets were healthy. Organically, automotive is up 21%, aero engines is up 16% and aero defense is up 34% year-over-year.","Double-digit growth in these markets was supported by solid organic growth of 7% in the commercial transportation market and 5% in the building and construction market. Organic revenue, which adjusts for aluminum prices, currency, Tennessee Packaging and the divestiture of the Latin American Extrusions business was up $233 million or 7% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis. The reconciliation for organic revenue can be found on Slide 15 in the Appendix. We\u2019ve also included year-over-year market growth rates on Slide 18 in the Appendix.","Excluding special items, operating income was $348 million in the third quarter, up $12 million or 4% year-over-year. The increase in operating income was driven by higher volumes across all the segments, particularly in aerospace in EP&S and automotive in GRP.","The higher volumes were offset by unfavorable aero engine mix, lower aero pricing principally in our Fasteners business and unfavorable net cost savings driven by transportation cost increases. The unfavorable net cost savings include the favorable impact of a lower annual incentive compensation accrual and an unfavorable impact of higher scrap sales.","Approximately 75% of the aero price reductions is with our Fasteners business. We\u2019ve seen an increase in fastener volume and net cost savings. The net cost savings are driven by our low-cost country production strategy in Mexico, Morocco, Hungary and China.","The net impact of the price, volume and net cost savings is an increase in fastener operating profit dollars and a 90-basis-point margin improvement in the third quarter versus last year. The third quarter impact of higher aluminum prices unfavorably impacted operating income by only $1 million on a year-over-year basis and operating income margin by 30 basis points.","As you may recall, last year in the third quarter, we recorded a $46-million LIFO metal lag charge as aluminum prices increased in the quarter. This year, we recorded a $25-million LIFO metal lag charge, resulting in a favorable year-over-year impact of $21 million as aluminum prices decreased in the quarter. This favorable year-over-year impact was offset by higher scrap sales and higher operational impacts.","Although aluminum prices have come down sequentially, aluminum prices were still 15% higher in the quarter versus last year. Although there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces in there, the net impact of higher aluminum prices versus last year was small and only $1 million unfavorable. The aluminum price impacts are detailed by segment on Slide 14 in the Appendix.","Operating income margin percent excluding special items was 9.9% for the third quarter, down 50 basis points year-over-year including an unfavorable 30-basis-point impact due to higher aluminum prices. We\u2019ve also included the reconciliation of operating income excluding special items on Slide 28 in the Appendix.","As Chip mentioned, adjusted free cash flow generated in the third quarter was $115 million or $74 million more than the third quarter of 2017. The improved free-cash-flow generation was driven primarily by favorable operating working capital that drove the $70-million benefit year-over-year. Days working capital improved eight days on a year-over-year basis.","Lastly, compared to last year, lower pension contributions and lower interest rate payments partially offset the increase in capital expenditures. Two-thirds of the capital expenditure increase in the quarter was for return-seeking projects as we expanded our wheels facility in Hungary. ","We also installed a horizontal heat treat in Davenport for industrial and aerospace markets and started the expansion of the aero engine capacity in Whitehall, Michigan and Morristown, Tennessee.","Diluted earnings per share excluding special items for the third quarter was up 28%. Lower pension and OPEB expenses, lower interest expense and a lower operational tax rate drove the improvement.","Now, let\u2019s move to the segment results on Slide 6. In the third quarter EP&S\u2019s revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Organic revenue was up 6% due to volume growth in aero engines and aero defense. Segment operating profit was $238 million, relatively flat to the third quarter of 2017.","Growth in the aero engines and aero defense markets, as well as favorable impact from aluminum prices, was offset by unfavorable engine mix, lower aero pricing principally in our Fasteners business and manufacturing inefficiencies on the Structures business. Segment operating profit margin percent was 15.2%, down 100 basis points year-over-year, including a favorable 30-basis-point impact of higher aluminum prices.","In the third quarter, GRP\u2019s revenue was $1.4 billion, an increase of 16% year-over-year. Organic revenue was up 9% due to volume growth in automotive, industrial and commercial transportation.","Segment operating profit was $74 million, up $10 million or 16% year-over-year, driven by strong volumes in automotive, industrial and commercial transportation, as well as favorable aluminum price impacts. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher transportation costs and higher scrap volumes.","Segment operating profit margin was 5.2%, unchanged year-over-year, including a favorable 30-basis-point impact of aluminum prices. In the third quarter, TCS delivered revenue of $530 million, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Organically, revenue was up 8% as we continue to see strong growth in building and construction as well as commercial transportation.","Segment operating profit was $77 million, up $3 million or 4% year-over-year. Higher volume in commercial transportation and building and construction as well as net savings in favorable product mix were partially offset by an unfavorable aluminum price impact driven by mark-to-market losses on open hedges. Segment operating profit was 14.5%, up 40 basis points year-over-year, including a 280-basis-point negative impact of higher aluminum prices.","Now, let\u2019s move to the third quarter key achievements on Slide 7. In EP&S, we continue to see unprecedented customer demand for our products. We remain focused on improving throughput and capacity to meet that demand. As a result, on a year-over-year basis, aero engines was up 15% and aero defense was up 38%.","In GRP, we continued to deliver strong growth in major markets. Automotive is up 20% organically, industrial is up 6% organically and commercial transportation is up 7% organically. In TCS, both of the major markets remain strong. Commercial transportation grew 8%, building construction, 7% both organically.","TCS continues to deliver improved margins despite headwinds from aluminum prices. In the third quarter, margin expanded by 4 0 basis points despite an unfavorable aluminum price impact of 280 basis points. And for the company in total, we continue to focus on managing our legacy liabilities as our pension and OPEB payments were $20 million higher on a year-to-date basis versus last year. Lastly, as a result of our actions this year, our unfunded pension and OPEB net liability has decreased $519 million since the start of 2018.","Before turning it back over to Chip, let me cover a few items that can be found in the Appendix. On Slide 11 in the Appendix we have summarized special items for the quarter. I\u2019ll touch on some of these briefly.","Restructuring related special items resulted in income of $2 million pre-tax which consisted of the following four items. First, income of $28 million associated with the elimination of pre-Medicare retiree medical for U.S. non-bargain employees. Second, a charge of $15 million related to the consolidation and closure of a facility in Mexico.","Third, severance charges of $8 million for the elimination of 8 5 positions primarily in EP&S and corporate. And fourth, a charge of $4 million related to a pension settlement accounting for one of our smaller U.S. pension plans.","Also, in the third quarter, similar with previous quarters this year, we incurred a $5 million of external legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower, which are recorded in SG&A. As previously disclosed in our 10-Q, for the second quarter, the company recorded two discrete tax items in the third quarter, which explain the majority of the discrete tax items for the quarter.","First, we recorded a tax charge of $59 million related to an unfavorable decision from Spain\u2019s National Court, which disallowed some certain interest deductions. In conjunction with that booking of the tax reserve, we had a related benefit of $29 million that was recorded representing Alcoa Corporation\u2019s 49% share of the net liability pursuant to separation-related agreements.","Second, we recorded a tax benefit of $38 million after receiving notification from a foreign tax authority that our inquiry related to 2016 tax return was complete.","On Slide 12 in the Appendix, we provided an update on our capital structure as we continue to manage our debt and reduce our liabilities. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion up $80 million sequentially. Gross debt remains at $6.4 billion and net debt stands at $4.8 billion. Net debt to EBITDA continues to improve and stands at 2.4 times, which is an improvement of 28% since the fourth quarter of 2016.","Finally, I\u2019d like to give you some context on aluminum price impacts for the remainder of the year. Our updated guidance that Chip will cover in a minute assumes that aluminum price of $25.20 per metric ton for the remainder of the year. The third-quarter average was slightly lower than that at $25.10 per metric ton with a downward trend throughout the quarter.","As a result of the lower aluminum prices experienced in the third quarter and the lower aluminum price assumption in the fourth quarter, the full-year average aluminum equates to about $25.61 per metric ton or roughly $100 per metric ton lower than our previous full-year view.","As a result of the revised aluminum assumption, our estimated unfavorable aluminum-price impact for year is now approximately $100 million, which is $30 million better than the previous estimate of approximately $130 million. We provided two slides in the Appendix to help you understand the revised aluminum price estimates and impacts.","Slide 16 in the Appendix will be familiar to you as it provides the detail of the LIFO charge by quarter and then Slide 17 in the Appendix provides a breakdown of the year-over-year unfavorable aluminum price impacts.","Briefly, a breakdown of the $30-million improvement from prior guidance associated for aluminum price can be broken down into a couple of components. First, the recent reduction in aluminum prices improved the year-over-year LIFO metal lag non-cash impact by $35 million. Second, our current estimate for the trading desk remains unchanged.","Third, scrap spreads, this one actually has gotten worse as they\u2019ve doubled \u2013 more than doubled since the third quarter of last year. The current guidance is more unfavorable on scrap spreads by $20 million. The driver of this increase in scrap spreads is less scrap going to China due to Chinese imposed tariffs on imports.","Aluminum scrap has a tariff on it, going into China right now of about 25% and we expect that that will continue through the fourth quarter of 2018. Lastly, the change in our operational estimates is roughly in line with our sensitivities and has improved by $15 million from the prior guidance.","Finally, before turning it over to Chip to cover the 2018 annual guidance, I\u2019d like to note that the updated assumptions used to derive the annual guidance can be found on Slide 13 in the Appendix.","With that, I will turn it over to Chip.","Charles Blankenship","Thank you, Ken.","Before I provide updated guidance, I\u2019ll share some news regarding a forging press in our Cleveland Works facility. Our 15,000-ton press experienced a hydraulic leak resulting from a cracked cylinder that caused operators to shut down the press. The length of the outage has not yet been determined but we do not anticipate return to service in the fourth quarter. We are moving work to other presses in the facility and working with our customers to prioritize shipments.","On the topic of guidance, we are raising and tightening our guidance range for the full year from the range of $1.17 to $1.27 to the new range of $1.28 to $1.34. This $0.07 to $0.11 increase reflects updated aluminum prices of $2,520 for fourth quarter, as Ken mentioned, decreased variable compensation accrual, operational improvements in engines, fasteners, GRP, wheels and BCS with pressure coming from the 15,000-ton press outage in structures.","With that, I\u2019d like to open the line for your questions. Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Sam Pearlstein","Was wondering if you could update us on the performance in the Rings and Disks since you didn\u2019t mention that. And certainly, during this last quarter we heard a lot from OEM customers and engine makers about on-time yield, et cetera, from various parts of the supply chain, so can you just talk a little bit about your own on-time performance versus past yields, really how you\u2019re faring in that.","Charles Blankenship","So, if we just get to the bottom line with the Rings and Disks, we feel like these operations are stabilizing. As I\u2019ve said earlier, last quarter, we conserved resources into these locations and helped them with their operational capability.","Revenue is up 11% year-over-year for the quarter. This is actually the third consecutive quarter of adjusted operating income improvement from each of these operations in Rings and Disks.","We\u2019ve taken some pretty substantial actions on in-sourcing, which reduces overall lead time, especially in the area of machining. We\u2019ve reduced our costs there by over 50%, just by bringing those operations in-house with the also improvement in reducing lead time.","Our on-time delivery is up substantially in both Rings and Disks. So, I\u2019d say as of now, we\u2019re pleased with the progress. There\u2019s more work to do. And the teams continue to put their shoulder to it and continue to improve.","As I\u2019ve said before, really from being able to attack substantially the arrears position in Rings, we really need to bring on the 10-K press, which is under construction right now. We anticipate that in the first half of 2019 coming online. The team and the project bringing that to fruition is on schedule and on budget and we\u2019re pleased with that progress. That would be my update on Rings and Disks, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","And can you tell us a little bit about what happened in the engineered structures this quarter?","Charles Blankenship","So, it really comes down to four categories, Sam. Manufacturing inefficiencies, outsourcing costs, transportation expedites because of a little bit of increased lead time with the inefficiencies and the outsourcing, and also raw material cost mostly in the area of vanadium. So, the master alloy addition that we had, AlV is up substantially year-over-year in terms of cost.","So, we\u2019re attacking each of these areas mostly in terms of equipment OEE, sales, inventory and operations planning to make sure we\u2019re putting the best mix possible through the factory to get the most out of the assets, as well as we\u2019re increasing our utilization of scrap to lessen the need for AlV additions to the melt. So, we\u2019ve got teams on it. We\u2019re seeing improvement month over month and trying to bring that back in line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","I was wondering if you could just expand upon the 15,000-ton press, what products it makes and what the P&L impact will be from it being out and what the cost to repair will be, et cetera. Anything you can give us on absorption, opportunity cost of revenue and the like.","Charles Blankenship","So, this is a press that\u2019s dedicated almost completely to the aerospace arena. The customer, working with the customers, all of the parts are qualified on other presses in the facility and we\u2019ve already he begun making those parts across the other presses in the Cleveland facility.","As far as the cost to repair it really is going to depend on what scope of action we choose to take. We want to make sure that the return-to-service condition of this press, we have a lot of confidence that it will run for a substantial period of time with high confidence to deliver for our customers. So, we\u2019re taking the time to do the complete work scope and make sure we\u2019ve got the right plan of attack on that.","We have the spare parts and the plans in terms of how to take this action that we\u2019re developing, so we\u2019re ready to act and we\u2019ve already begun the process. We just need to make sure we have the work scope right for return to service.","Ken Giacobbe","And on top of that, Gautam, in terms of the P&L impact as Chip mentioned, we can move some of that production onto other qualified assets. However, we do have some absorption that we won\u2019t be able to take. However, we\u2019ve included that in the increased guidance that we\u2019ve given for the year. So, we\u2019re assuming that that absorption is lost and it\u2019s been completely lost for the fourth quarter and that\u2019s baked into the guidance.","Gautam Khanna","And then, if you could just give us some color on what you\u2019re doing at Rings and Disks. Do you have kind of the root cause identified on some of the challenges you\u2019ve had on yield and the like and do you now have the personnel in place to scale whatever improvements you\u2019ve identified across the entity? Where are we in terms of know-how at the facility?","Ken Giacobbe","Gautam, I\u2019d say that we like very much our current state of progress. We have the \u2013 we\u2019ve gotten some technical help from the rest of the Engines business. We have the quality team. That was one of the reasons we put Rings and Disks with our investment of Cast Engines business because that expertise for Six Sigma quality, daily management, problem solving, application of the Theory of Constraints, what are the bottlenecks, how do we solve them, how do we make sure that there\u2019s - the sequential bottleneck is not going to starve the asset that we - lock the asset what we really want to focus on.","We\u2019ve got the right people on the ground and we\u2019ve seen double-digit improvements in daily and weekly output from these plants. First pass, yield up substantially and we like our progress, so I think we\u2019ve got the right people on board to help make it happen.","Gautam Khanna","Chip, any update to the free-cash-flow guidance for this fiscal of, I think, it was $250 million previously. What are you expecting?","Charles Blankenship","We\u2019re sticking with that $250 million, but I\u2019ll turn it to Ken for any other color.","Ken Giacobbe","I think we made some good progress. You saw it on the days working capital improvement of eight days year-over-year. Some terrific work by our procurement organization renegotiating with our suppliers, particularly on the metal side. Inventory is showing improvement as well and receivables very high percent current on receivables, over 90%. So, we feel good about that, Gautam. We\u2019re going to hold to the $250 million. You could call me conservative on that, but we\u2019re going to hold to that number right now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","Just want to see if you could give a little bit more color around extending the strategic review into the fourth quarter, what exactly you mean by addressing additional scenarios. I think previously you had said you were evaluating 25 product lines, maybe an update there in terms of how far through the 25 you actually are.","Charles Blankenship","It\u2019s been a robust process. We\u2019ve had lots of dialogue with our board, with customers, with Arconic leaders, employees. I mean, the more I travel around and ask questions and observe really what our capabilities and strengths are, the more we learn and we ask further questions.","Really glad we embarked on such a holistic project. The dialogue has led us to really examine additional opportunities and perform more analysis. We\u2019re looking at all those 25 product lines that you mentioned. We\u2019re just trying to make sure we put our very best foot forward in our recommendations to the board and the output of the review. It\u2019s very good work. It\u2019s a big team effort. We\u2019re just not quite done yet.","David Strauss","So, would the expectation be - I think you had been talking about you were going to share the outcome at Investor Day in Q3. Is the plan now to do an Investor Day in Q4?","Charles Blankenship","I think we\u2019re focused on wrapping up the study and getting our board approval and we\u2019ll communicate kind of how we\u2019re going to do that based on the output of that.","David Strauss","And as a follow-up, Ken, you talked about the pension improvement year-to-date in terms of under-funding situation. Could you talk about what that could mean in terms of \u2013 I guess, talk about what you\u2019re thinking about for discount rate and where you\u2019re running your rate of returns running year-to-date and what that might mean for pension expense next year and your contribution level.","Ken Giacobbe","What we\u2019ve included in our estimate for the $519-million reduction was based on our original assumptions that the discount rate would be 3.75% and the asset returns would be 7%. We normally talk about what those actual rates are when we publish the K. Right. But what we\u2019ve done is we looked internally.","As you know, discount rates have gone up. Maybe our asset returns aren\u2019t in the 7% range, but we\u2019ve done an estimate for the full year and we feel that the $519 million will stick for the remainder of the year. And really if you had to break that down, that net reduction is made up of really four major items.","We\u2019ve made $288 million of pension contributions year-to-date. We froze the U.S. salaried and non-bargained plan that generated $136 million reduction. As we talked about in my opening comments there, we\u2019ve eliminated retiree medical benefit. That was worth $32 million, and we\u2019ve made OPEB payments of around $59 million. There\u2019s other of about $4 million left, but that\u2019s how we get to the $519 million and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll be able to hold that at the end of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Chip, I wonder if we look at the Engineered Products business and we see $238 million of EBIT in the quarter, which is around what it was in Q2 if you add back the inventory write-down. There\u2019s a lot of different puts and takes in terms of different pieces of the business growing versus shrinking and the outage you talked about versus operational improvement. At what point do you think we can see that number start to grow?","Ken Giacobbe","Well, let me take that one first and then I can turn it over to Chip. If we peel back within the EP&S business, the Engines business is growing year-over-year on an operating income basis. So, we\u2019re happy with the progress there. We see it on the top line. We see it flowing to the bottom line. Same thing on the fastener side. I mentioned that earlier. Dollars are going up, percentage is going up.","Where we\u2019ve got the challenge right now is in the Structures business that Chip talked about earlier. We have deployed SPAs to the key plants in that portfolio where we think we have opportunity. So, we see that we should have a sequential improvement in the Structures business Q4 versus Q3 that even includes the impact of the press outage, but we expect to see improvement in the fourth quarter.","Seth Seifman","And then, maybe as a follow-up, is there anything you can share about the Grenfell Tower liability and how that plays into the sale process of building and construction and whether that stays with the company or not.","Charles Blankenship","Well, as of right now, Seth, we see no material update in the liabilities associated with the tragedy. Let\u2019s just get that out there in the open. As for the sale process, that\u2019s an ongoing process and we really don\u2019t want to comment about the details of how we\u2019re structuring that approach at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Two relatively-quick questions for you. One just a straightforward one. You did a nice job with selling the Texas rolling mill for $300 million or so despite no real profit there and how much more opportunity is there like that within Arconic overall that we\u2019re just not aware of? That\u2019s one.","And then, the other. On the EP&S side as we think about the business over the next maybe couple of years, can you just talk about on net do you see more of a pricing headwind or tailwind? I know you\u2019ve got more content on next-gen platforms going forward. There\u2019s also the dynamic of price step-downs from the engine and the structure OEMs.","Ken Giacobbe","Let me jump into it first. Just a couple of notes on Texarkana. I don\u2019t think we have other assets. That was an idle asset for the most part. I don\u2019t think we have any additional ones of that size. But you\u2019re right, a $300-million sale with a $50-million earn-out. Just so you know, the net book value on that was about $62 million, so a very nice work by the team.","Charles Blankenship","That was a big opportunity generated through our strategy review. And Ken\u2019s right, there\u2019s nothing other very large opportunity like that of an idle asset but we do see opportunity in each of these 25 business units for us to further prune and improve the portfolio returns going forward and there will be some actions that announced associated with the strategy review that reveal some additional value that can be monetized and improve our focus at the same time.","Rajeev Lalwani","And on the EP&S side, just as far as pricing headwinds and tailwinds going forward, given all the puts and takes?","Ken Giacobbe","In EP&S, I think it\u2019s a mixed bag of some pricing pressure in certain parts of the industry and certain parts of our portfolio, but also coupled with price-up opportunity in places where the industry is constrained and we have very high value to contribute.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Olin from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Chris Olin","Just wanted to circle back on the pricing commentary and really more specifically what you were saying on aerospace fasteners. I guess I was just curious how the movement in pricing this year compares to previous years. Was the headwind in the second quarter? I don\u2019t recall that. And I guess I\u2019m just wondering if the pricing weakness has anything to do with the shakeup that\u2019s going on within the distribution channel.","Ken Giacobbe","We\u2019re continuing to get pricing pressure across the entire portfolio. We had pressure again in the prior quarter as well on fasteners but we\u2019re trading off volume for that, so we\u2019re getting incremental volume which is helping with absorption in the business but at the same time we\u2019re moving some more of our production down into Mexico, Morocco and more of the standard fastener parts, so we\u2019re getting labor arbitrage which is significant.","Some of that we share with our customers through the price impacts but net-net when you look at that labor arbitrage, look at the incremental volume we\u2019re getting, giving up the price, it\u2019s a net impact benefit on both a dollar and a percentage basis.","So that trade-off is working for us. So, if you look at the total pricing impact that we mentioned for the quarter, 75% of that is related to the Fasteners business. As Chip talked about in the other part of the business, you have puts and takes, but most of our differentiated product right knew now we\u2019re able to either retain price or get some incremental price so tremendous amount of demand in the market.","Chris Olin","Then, just shifting gears quickly. I realize you do have your hands full with the whole turnaround at Firth Rixson, but I guess I\u2019m curious as to how you think about future isothermal forge capacity. And the reason I asked is because if you start looking at some of these numbers, it looks like capacity gets pretty tight three, four years out. I\u2019m just wondering if that is a place you could see adding more capital or greater investments.","Ken Giacobbe","Look, Chris. As part of the strategy review, we are looking at how we serve the market with the isothermal forge we have at Savannah. We\u2019re qualifying parts for customers right now and we\u2019re evaluating further investment to what return we could get if we put additional capability and capacity around that press to be able to serve more volume.","So, no decisions at this time but we have proposals and plans in front of our strategy team, thinking about how we could serve that market. But right now, we\u2019re focused on using the asset that we have as it stands to qualify parts and participate in that market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan from Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Josh Sullivan","Just one on the automotive side. Given concerns around automotive SAAR rates, can you frame maybe how Arconic\u2019s Automotive business would grow if we had a scenario where SAAR was down, say, 5% or something along those lines?","Ken Giacobbe","Well, the problem is, Josh, looking at the total SAAR\u2019s percentage can be a little bit misleading for our business. The last breakdown that we had is if you carve is up, cars are down about 9%. Light truck, SUVs and vans are up 5%. That\u2019s more of our sweet spot right now. We\u2019re more in the light truck, SUV and van space.","So, it doesn\u2019t impact our business as much. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the organic growth rates of 20% in the business. Moreover, when we look at the aluminum content on, say, a light truck versus a car, it\u2019s about 3X.","So, we\u2019re comfortable with our position right now in terms of where we stand. It\u2019s not to say that we\u2019re moving away from cars; we\u2019re actually bidding on a lot of new business in the cars section but we think there\u2019s a lot more opportunity for us in the SUV and light truck space.","Josh Sullivan","And then, just one on the expansion of the engine capacity at Whitehall. What percent increase is this? Does this provide you with any speculative capacity if OEMs do take up production skylines or is it just related to announced production rates at this point?","Charles Blankenship","Our plans right now are to serve the business that we see going forward with our long-term contracts and the customer business that we\u2019ve won. We do quite often reserve the ability to put more equipment in the expansion, to take advantage of potential upside. But we\u2019re very careful with the capital outlay to make sure we have confidence in being able to get return on that investment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","Thanks for taking the follow-ups. A couple. Maybe I missed it. But the question regarding pension cash contributions in 2019. Did you actually give a number? I may have missed it if you did.","Charles Blankenship","No, we did not.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. Is there any framework you can give for what that might shake out to be?","Charles Blankenship","So, the latest estimate is around $440 million.","Gautam Khanna","And that\u2019s for 2019?","Charles Blankenship","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Gautam Khanna","To follow up on the fastener discussion, I thought last quarter you guys were talking about mix, more non-aero versus aero. Did anything get incrementally worse than aero this quarter? I mean, did price actually deteriorate further? Were there contract resets or something else?","Charles Blankenship","Not for the most part. Really, Gautam, what\u2019s driving it is we\u2019re getting more volume. We\u2019re getting it on the industrial side. We\u2019re getting it on the aero side. We\u2019ve talked a lot about destocking in fasteners. Airbus has been coming down, but we\u2019re getting more volume out of Boeing. When you push those two together it\u2019s a net favorable. ","So good net favorable on aero. Good industrial, really like what the team is doing around the net cost savings that we talked earlier and they\u2019re getting the incremental volume. So, we\u2019re happy with the Fasteners business.","Gautam Khanna","And then, just on the 15,000 press, I know you mentioned aerospace products. Can you specify what types of products are made? I know you\u2019re going to make up the volume elsewhere, but on the other presses, but just curious about the specific products.","Charles Blankenship","These are aerospace wheels and some blades.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. So, this is engine product?","Charles Blankenship","Engines and airframe wheels and brakes.","Gautam Khanna","Wheels. Okay. And last one, just someone asked about the KLX side, Boeing combination. Have you seen any impact yet on that or has there been any kind of change to purchase indications?","Charles Blankenship","We haven\u2019t seen any impact, Gautam.","Gautam Khanna","Would you expect to or not?","Charles Blankenship","We do not expect to. There\u2019s always room for the unexpected but we don\u2019t expect that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.","Phil Gibbs","Chip, can you point to the mix headwinds that you\u2019re talking about in engines and elaborate on that a little bit and when does that get better?","Charles Blankenship","The mix headwind is really associated with legacy parts that are all the way down the learning curve as it were to the next-gen engine products, be it leap-geared turbo fan, this sort of product that we\u2019re currently coming down the learning curve on and improving our profitability and our ability to serve the customers.","So, that\u2019s a mix headwind. It\u2019s not a big one. It\u2019s just the part of the ramp we\u2019re in and the new engine introduction process and the new part introduction process to support our customers.","Phil Gibbs","And I think you mentioned that vanadium is a bit of a headwind and the question what specific products that would be hitting and is there potential for a pass-through of that material embedded within your existing contracts?","Ken Giacobbe","So, it\u2019s a major alloying element in the alloy titanium 6%, 4%, 6% aluminum, 4% vanadium. So, that\u2019s the product whether it\u2019s sheet or plate or forgings coming out of our Structures business. That\u2019s where the majority of it is. There\u2019s some casting products associated with it but really the volume and what we\u2019re seeing is where it\u2019s associated with our titanium mill products and our Structures business. We are working with customers and other ways to abate that impact. Mostly focused on scrap utilization at this point.","Phil Gibbs","There\u2019s no way within the contracts to pass that increased cost through on that alloying element?","Charles Blankenship","We have a variety of contractual terms and at this point some of our contracts do not allow that pass-through.","Ken Giacobbe","Yes. So, some do.","Phil Gibbs","Okay.","Charles Blankenship","Some do, some don\u2019t.","Ken Giacobbe","Some don\u2019t. The net impact for the quarter was less than $3 million to give you, even though the price is more than doubled.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth Seifman","Chip, maybe to follow up on aero engines. If you can talk about how your share has been trending, maybe relative to your expectations three or six months ago. Are there any differences?","Charles Blankenship","As far as trending, I mean, our share is pretty stable. We\u2019re producing more than our contractual share on some parts and less than our share on others. It\u2019s really in a constrained environment making as many parts as we possibly can and continuing to creep our assets as much as possible to provide the maximum number of parts to our customers.","What we\u2019re seeing our customers do really is prioritize what they need and we\u2019re focused on supporting their assembly and their overhaul process needs and making sure that we stay ahead of that. So, I mean, our overall share, we\u2019re pleased with our share. Our focus right now with the full shop is trying to prioritize delivery to meet our customers\u2019 most urgent requirements.","Seth Seifman","And then, this might be - this is probably over-simplifying things a bit, if you were to characterize what inning you\u2019re in now in terms of having your capacity in aero engines on the narrow-body side directed towards new-generation engines versus the engines that are \u2013 that you\u2019re stopping the GSM56 and the V2500. Where are we right now?","Charles Blankenship","The new next-generation make up about 60% of the output of our investment cast business. But you\u2019ve got to be careful because the legacy parts don\u2019t go to zero. These are high usage parts in the overhaul business and the spares stream. So, we feel for a number of years will make very many of the last generation parts to serve that ongoing market and we will remain focused on that as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Reilly from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brian Reilly","Real quick one from me and I appreciate it may be difficult to answer as you continue to go through strategic process. But is it possible to give on the balance sheet side guide posts around how you would think about capital allocation under versus various scenarios ratings you talked in the past about wanting to maybe get back to investment grade if that option is presented to you, that would be I think helpful for the fixed-income side. Thanks.","Charles Blankenship","So, we\u2019re split rated right now, first S&P has us at investment grade and Moody\u2019s does not so we\u2019re split rated right now. I think through the strategic review we spent a lot of time looking CapEx in a couple of different buckets, what it required for growth to meet the demand, what is required for productivity to get more volume through the plants and help our working capital at the same time. And then, lastly, a lot of work around the sustaining part just to keep the normal maintenance of the business going.","So, there\u2019s been a lot of work in the 25 subsegments. I think we have some great visibility on that. We\u2019ll be releasing more information as we complete the strategic review.","Brian Reilly","I guess, if I could just follow up quickly. As you talk about creating shareholder value, I appreciate a lot of that can come from organic avenues like you said investing on the CapEx side. But is that something where you look to shift some of the capital allocation to shareholders and maybe in that mindset BB ratings, high yield makes sense, or I guess, again, how do you think about that versus a desire to be investment grade?","Charles Blankenship","We like being investment grade, but we look at the capital allocation based on relative returns and once we complete that strategic review, we\u2019ll be able to communicate more information.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue at this time.

I'm joined by David Hess, Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by David and Ken, we will take your questions.","We would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings.","In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussions. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix to today's presentation. Any reference in our discussion today to historical EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA, for which we have provided calculations and reconciliations in the appendix.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David.","David Hess","Good morning everyone and thanks for joining the call. You've seen our announcement this morning. I've been promising in prior calls that the board was taking the time and appropriate due diligence needed to select an exceptional CEO to lead Arconic into the future. Well, I'm very pleased to report this morning that we have achieved that objective.","Chip Blankenship, is both a collogue and someone I know well and respect. We had the opportunity to work together on a JV. We get to know each other when we were both in our aero engine days, so I can personally attest to Chip's excellent fit for Arconic. He brings significant aerospace and other industry operating experience, the right academic and technical prudential's, strong leadership qualities and a strong track record of delivering results, all of which making well equipped to help Arconic deliver on its full potential for shareholders and for customers.","I couldn't be happier with the board's selection and looking forward to Chip's arrival on January 15 and working with him on the transition, as I continue to serve on the Arconic board. Until then I'll continue to lead Arconic. I also wish to thank Pat Russo for her service as the Interim Chair. Pat stepped into the Chair role on a temporary basis at the board's request to help steer the company through the transition period.","I also welcome and congratulate John Plant, on his new role as the incoming Chair of Arconic. John has had a distinguished career in the automotive industry and many years' experience of service both leading a public company and serving on public company boards. In the short time that I've had the opportunity to work with John, I've quickly learnt him to be a superlative executive and I look forward to working with him on the board.","We also announced business management changes to streamline and strengthen our operational leadership. Both Eric Roegner and Tim Myers are proven operational executives with deep commercial expertise and market knowledge and a track record of driving profitable growth in beating or exceeding the expectations of our customers and our shareholders.","Now, moving to the third quarter results, in 3Q, Arconic delivered its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth. We're demonstrating consistent improvements in operating performance on the back of healthy organic revenue growth, coupled with better than planned progress on streamlining, restructuring and head cost reduction. Uniquely in this quarter, our results were negatively impacted by a non-cash LIFO charge resulting from the spike in aluminum prices.","Reported revenue was up 3%. Organic revenue growth was up 5% with the year-over-year volume increases in all three segments. Reported third quarter year-to-date revenue growth for Arconic is 3%, with 5% organic growth.","Looking at revenue growth by market, we have 3% revenue growth in our aerospace businesses, driven by 9% growth in engines and 12% growth in defense, partially offset by the continuing headwinds from destocking and select wide-body build rates, 16% growth in our auto segment driven by continued aluminization and 31% growth in our commercial transportation business, largely driven by a recovery North American heavy duty truck market, but also our growth in China and the rest of Asia.","Revenue growth in the quarter was partially offset by 12% year-over-year decline in our industrial gas turbine segment, due to continued weakness in that market. Reported EBITDA was up 14% with a favorable compare resulting 3Q 2016, separation spending.","EBITDA excluding special items and including the unfavorable impact of higher aluminum prices was up 2% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Higher aluminum prices in 2017 have resulted in an unfavorable LIFO and metal lag non-cash accounting charges at corporate of 49 million in the third quarter and 19 million year-to-date. And year-over-year negative impact to EBITDA in the segments of 11 million in the third quarter and 23 million year-to-date.","EBITDA margin excluding special items was down 20 basis points year-over-year, but up 3 basis points year-to-date. Aluminum prices and LIFO and metal lag negatively impacted the quarter by 250 basis points and 90 points year-to-date. We continue to make significant progress on restructuring and cost reduction in corporate SG&A and other overhead accounts.","Our SG&A forecast for the year has improved by 25 million from our original guidance and its favorable by 100 million, compared to last year with additional run rate savings going forward into 2018.","Net cost savings were 1.5% of revenue in the third quarter and 1.7 of revenue year-to-date. All these resulted in an adjusted EPS of $0.25 a share. Year-to-date annualized RONA of 8.1% was negatively impacted by our working capital as we got them inventory to support the aerospace engine ramp.","And finally we generated 41 million of free cash flow in the quarter to bring our quarter ending cash balance to 1.8 billion.","I'll now turn it over to Ken, so he can take you through the numbers in more detail.","Ken Giacobbe","Thank you, David. I will move rather quickly through the financial slides in order to leave more time for questions. We have several slides in the appendix, which will provide additional details if needed.","As we look at Slide 7, revenue for the third quarter came in at 3.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year driven by volume gains in all segments. Year-over-year the favorable impact of higher aluminum prices of 150 million and foreign currency of 17 million were more than offset by lower revenue from our Tennessee packaging business and divestitures of 170 million.","Organic revenue was up 5% year-over-year. Details of organic revenue growth for Q3 and year-to-date are in the appendix Slide 21. Combined segments EBITDA margin was 16.6%, up 20 basis point year-over-year as combined segments EBITDA increased to 4%. Year-to-date combined segment EBITDA margin is 17%, which is in line with our annual guidance of approximately 17%.","I will cover segment performance in the segment slides that will follow. Arconic's EBITDA margin excluding special items was 13.5% down 20 basis points, as Arconic's EBITDA increased 2% to 437 million on a year-over-year basis. Year-to-date Arconic's","EBITDA margin excluding special items was 14.5%, up 30 basis points versus prior year, which is in line with our annual guidance of approximately 14.5%, despite the higher aluminum prices. EBITDA dollars excluding special items were up 5% versus prior year.","As David mentioned, versus the prior year EBITDA results were negatively impacted $60 million by a higher aluminum prices in the third quarter and 42 million on a year-to-date basis. Higher aluminum prices also impacted our EBITDA margins, excluding special items by 240 basis points in the third quarter and 90 basis points year-to-date. The unfavorable impact is driven by three items, the LIFO method of inventory evaluation accounting, metal lag and processing cost in the segments.","Under the LIFO method of inventory accounting, the higher aluminum cost are charged to expense as opposed to inventory and resulted in an unfavorable $47 million charge versus the prior year. LIFO was a non-cash expense. The metal lag component was $2 million unfavorable versus the prior and includes our ability to generally pass through aluminum price increases to customers or mitigate price increases through hedging.","Finally, higher aluminum prices resulted in higher processing cost such as melt loss and regional premiums that reside in the segments. Segment costs were $11 million higher versus the prior year quarter, the details of these impacts are provided on slide 20 in the appendix for both the third quarter in the year-to-date.","Since the rise in Q3 aluminum prices were significant I wanted to provide our estimated impact for Q4. At current aluminum prices, we expect Q4 LIFO and metal lag impact on corporate to have a negative EBITDA impact of approximately $10 million to $15 million versus Q3's negative impact of 46 million.","Regarding the Q4 segment impact of higher aluminum prices, we expect Q4 impact to be similar to Q3, with a year-over-year negative impact of $13 million. On an annual basis, we expect the year-over-year negative impact from LIFO and metal lag of approximately 55 million at corporate and approximately 35 million negative in the segments for a total year-over-year impact of approximately $90 million.","Our capital efficiency RONA was 6.8 on an annualized basis for the third quarter and 8.1% on an annual basis year-to-date. RONA has been negatively impacted by higher working capital levels as we grow volumes and increase our aerospace rate readiness to meet customer demand, particularly in the EP&S business. Gross debt is at 6.9 billion and cash is at 1.8 billion and we are approximately the same as the second quarter as free cash flow was $46 million in the quarter.","Now let's take a closer look at the financials starting with the income statement on Slide 8. We've talked about revenue, so let me cover a couple of other areas. Overhead reduction continues to be a key focus area for Arconic. In the third quarter SG&A was impacted by external legal and other advisory cost related to Grenfell Tower of $7 million pre-tax. Excluding special items our SG&A as a percentage of sales was 4.6% for the quarter, with SG&A being down $27 million year-over-year and $14 million sequentially.","EBITDA for the third quarter was 430 million, if we exclude the external legal and advisory cost related to the Grenfell Tower, as mentioned earlier; EBITDA was 437 million up 2% year-over-year. Restructuring charges of $19 million include 11 million related to headcount reductions in the EP&S segment and incorporate, as we continue to focus on reducing corporate overhead.","Year-to-date we've reduced approximately 600 positions which will result in approximately 70 million in cost savings on a run rate basis. The remaining 8 million of restructuring charges related primarily to cost associated with decisions made prior quarters to exit certain facilities in 2017 and 2018. Approximately 60% of these costs were cash. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.8% and the operational tax rate was 33.3%. We continue to expect 2017 annual operational tax rate to be close to 32%.","Net income was 119 million at $0.22 per share. Excluding special items net income was 132 million or $0.25 per share. As David mentioned, net income was impacted by higher aluminum prices, which drove an unfavorable $30 million in net income from LIFO and metal lag in the quarter. This compares to a favorable $2 million net income impact in the same quarter last year.","On the right hand side of the slide, you can see the special items for the quarter, sort of $13 million after tax. I've already discussed the first two special items listed, now just note the amounts listed of pretax. The last item associated with taxes includes not only the tax impact for the first two items, but also $5 million of favorable discreet tax items in the quarter.","Now let's turn to the cash flow statement on Slide 9. As I mentioned before, free cash flow was 41 million for the quarter and we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash on hand. CapEx spending year-to-date is 360 million, as we managed cash particularly in light of our higher working capital requirements; we continue to rigorously manage capital expenditures. As a result, we expect to come in approximately $50 million to $75 million below our full year CapEx target of $650 million. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA continued to be below three times, as we finish the third quarter at 2.85 times.","Now let's move to our segment performance starting with EP&S, on Slide 10. EP&S' third quarter revenue increased 5% versus the prior year quarter. Aerospace revenue increased 5% as commercial aero engines were up 9%, commercial aero airframes up 2% and aero defense up 6%. In the EP&S' other major markets commercial transportation was up 13% and IGT was down 14%. Year-to-date commercial aero engines were up 8% year-on-year and we expect to be up in Q4, 5% from Q3.","For the full year commercial aero engine revenue is expected to increase approximately 9% or $150 million. Aero defense is expected to continue its positive trend, while aero airframes are expected to be down sequentially as wide-body build rates on select platforms to decline in the near term. The effect on fasteners of destocking is stabilizing as expected. Regarding EP&S' other major markets we continue to expect weaker demand in IGT, particularly offset by strength in the commercial transportation market.","Turning to EBITDA, I will note that EP&S' EBITDA as well as its EBITDA margin are up for the third consecutive quarter. In the third quarter EP&S' EBITDA of 312 million was up 5% versus prior year quarter, as EBITDA margin was up 20 basis points sequentially and flat on a year-over-year basis at 21.1%. Volume was favorable 21 million due to growing aero demand and net cost savings of 1.4% or 20 million including the higher impact of aero ramp up cost. The positive impacts were offset by unfavorable pricing of 16 million, which has been declining as a percentage of revenue.","Regarding cost, our aero engine ramp up cost are not coming down at the arte that we had projected, and are creating a headwind for EBITDA growth and EBITDA margin expansion. During the second quarter conference call, I outlined the challenges associated with transitioning a large number of new product introductions into high volume production, in the face of this unprecedented ramp up in the next generation aero engine deliveries. These costs includes impacts from customer driven configuration changes, lowered implant manufacturing yields, direct labor variation and premium and expediting fees associated with shipping and capacity constraints, outsourced operations like our heat treat, non-destructive testing and machining.","Ramp up cost will down over time as we work down the variation levels it can bring in, internal capacity online to reduce outsourcing and expedite cost. Before moving on from EP&S, I wanted to provide an update on Firth Rixson and RTI. Firth Rixson revenue for the quarter was 235 million or an increase of 7% versus the prior year quarter, which leaves us on track to meet or exceed the target range of $970 million to $1 billion for the year.","Third quarter EBITDA was flat to prior year quarter at $31 million. EBITDA margin was 13% versus 14.2% prior year quarter for all the reasons that I outlined above, including the hurricane Irma impact on our Savannah, Georgia facility, which was approximately $2 million of EBITDA and about a 100 basis points of margin. As a result annual EBITDA margins are anticipated to be closer to 14% for the full year versus our prior guidance of 16%.","Regarding RTI, RTI continues to perform with revenue of 193 million in the third quarter, which is up 10% versus Q3 of 2016. EBITDA was 40 million in Q3, which is up 11% versus Q3 of 2016. EBITDA margin was at 21.1%, which is flat to the prior year.","Now, let's take a look at our GRP segment on Slide 11, revenue was down 4% compared to the third quarter of 2016 and up 1% when excluding Tennessee packaging, divestures as well as higher aluminum prices and foreign currency. In the quarter higher aluminum prices, higher order sheet, commercial transportation revenue were more than offset by planned ramp down of our Tennessee packaging business, airframes supply chain optimization, lower aero wide-body build rate platforms and pricing pressures on regional specialty products.","Looking forward we continue to see year-over-year growth in auto sheet, but still destocking in airframes which will stabilize by the end of the year. We'll also see continued declines in wide-body build rates for select platform.","In the third quarter, GRP's EBITDA of 140 million was down 2% versus the prior year, while its EBITDA margin increased 20 basis points to 11.3%, year-over-year lower volumes in packaging and aerospace and pricing pressures in regional specialties more than offset cost savings of 1.6% or $20 million. The increase in aluminum prices impacted GRP's EBITDA margin in the quarter by 170 basis points. While higher aluminum prices continued the unfavorable impact, the EBITDA margins, GRP's EBITDA dollars are expected to meet the prior guidance.","Finally, let's move to the TCS segment on Slide 12. Revenue was up 15% versus the prior year quarter driven by strength in commercial transportation of 30% and North America and non-residential construction markets of 5%. Looking forward, we continue to expect full year growth in North America non-residential constructions and recover in the North America heavy duty truck market.","In the third quarter TCS's EBITDA of 83million was up 9% versus the prior year, while its EBITDA margin decreased 80 basis points to 16.1%. Volumes were stronger and net cost savings of 1.4% more than offset pricing pressures and mix. The increase in aluminum prices impacted TCS's EBITDA margin in the quarter by 120 basis points.","Now let's take a look at SG&A in a little bit more detail. On Slide 13, you can see as I previously mentioned, we remain committed to reducing our overhead spend, excluding special items SG&A as a percent of revenue was 4.6 in the quarter. This level of spend compares favorably to our key peer groups. Given progress to date we're further reducing our SG&A target from 5.4% of revenue to 5.1% of revenue for the full year. The reduction would yield $100 million reduction in SG&A, full year 2016 versus 2017. At the same time, we continue to accelerate plans to lower corporate overheads to be 1% of revenue for 2017 versus our original guidance of 1.1%.","So in summary we are confident in our full year guides and we expect a strong Q4, year-over-year we expect double digit volume increases in aero commercial engines, automotive, commercial transportation as well as favorable mix. We expect continued improvement in net cost savings particularly in SG&A which should be lower by about approximately $40 million in the quarter. Lastly, although the impact of our higher aluminum prices were unfavorably impact the year-over-year basis, it will be significantly less than Q3.","Now let me turn it back to David to wrap things up and then we could take your questions.","David Hess","Thank you, Ken. So, we continue to make solid progress for delivering on our full year guidance for Arconic, with better than planned for performance in GRP and TCS and greater than planned cost reduction in SG&A and other overhead accounts, being offset by the negative impact of higher aluminum prices and higher than planned production cost in EP&S associated with the next generation engine ramp. EP&S delivered 5% year-over-year revenue growth and 5.5% year-over-year EBITDA growth in the quarter and the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion with EBITDA margins now are 50 basis points over Q1 of 2017.","For the full year in EP&S, margin expansion is now expected to be about flat, recognizing the impact of higher than planned production costs associated with transition in more than 600 new part numbers in the high volume production as the GTF and the LEAP engine deliveries more than doubled on an annual basis. These parts include lower manufacturing yields, direct labor variation and expediting the premium fees for logistics and outside operations in our supply chain that's capacity constraint.","We are not satisfied with our cost reduction progress here and are taking actions to ensure better performance and continued margin expansion going forward. The reductions, in margin expansion guidance for GRP and TCS are a function of higher metal prices. After the increase in aluminum prices, both segments would be up over prior guidance. Full year EBITDA dollar expectations for both these groups translated to better than planned performance. So for Arconic in total, we are raising our revenue guidance to the range of 12.6 billion to 12.8 billion, primarily to reflect the higher aluminum prices and we are reaffirming our EBITDA and margin expansion guidance for the full year. This results in an earnings per share range of $1.15 to a $1.20, revenue guidance is now a 8% to 8.5% and we remain focused on a strong finish to 2017.","So thank you and now we will open up the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.","Carter Copeland","Hi, good morning gentlemen.","David Hess","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Dave, I hope this means we'll still see weather, you don't get too much beach time out of this?","David Hess","No, as I said I will be here completely focused on delivering on our commitment to our shareholders and customers until January 15 and even going forward after that. I'll be serving on the board and continue to stay involved, so you'll see me around.","Carter Copeland","That's great. I will stick to the one question, but hopefully I can have a sort of party and be here. I just wanted to dig into the cost headwinds in EP&S that you called out and specifically the chart in the appendix, you had the 20 million two quarters ago and then 9 million around up in the last quarter and then you didn't specifically call out that number this quarter. I wondered if you might, from an apples to apples basis be able to give us a sense of what that is, presumably that's included in the cost headwind number that you've provided in that chart. And then maybe just to give us a sense of what you are dealing with there, within that 9% engine growth that you've got in the quarter, I mean, how much of that is new engines, positive growth versus older generation engines, negative growth, anything you can help us with? Color on that, that 72 million bar would be helpful?","David Hess","I mean, on apples to apples basis, the ramp up costs roughly flat, but what we are talking about now, I guess, I characterized as a more comprehensive definition of ramp up cost. And, I mean you well understand the historical portions of the ramp that we are in the midst of now, with the next generation aero body engine delivery is more than doubling on an annual basis. So, you're right in terms, we've got a number of things going on here, we got legacy engines ramping down along with the next generation engines ramping very steeply right now. And so, the cost that we are talking about are essentially various forms of variation, I mean there is the more traditional forms of variation in terms of direct labor variation, lower manufacturing yields and things like that sort, but as we continue to work - to climb up the ramp here, we are incurring expediting and premium fees, particularly where we got outsourced operations and machining and heat treat and things like non-destructive testing, where we are in the midst of adding capacity. So, as we add capacity overtime, those operations will come back into house and those premium fees and expediting fees, for all those external operations as well as transportation will diminish over time, along with direct labor variation diminishing and improving manufacturing yields. So, we are not happy about it, we are taking actions to work harder on the cost side of the equation and make sure that those costs come down as we had committed to our shareholders. And, we are working hard on that, and will be talking more about that in our guidance, as we deliver guidance early next year. But, it's basically variations of different types.","Carter Copeland","So, I totally understand the expedited fees and a lot of the stuff is pretty normal and it's temporary, but in terms of rough quantity here, are we talking, 5s of millions of dollars or 10s of millions of dollars in a quarter. How big of an impact was that on your cost performance and EP&S?","David Hess","On apples and apples basis, the way we were characterizing ramp up cost, I think we were at the order of about $10 million. But, what we are talking about now, this is a more comprehensive definition of ramp up cost.","Carter Copeland","Great thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thanks, good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on some of the management changes, not just to see your change, but the division changes, what precipitated that and what skill sets the new personnel bring, especially at EP&S. And relatedly, do you anticipate, your new permanent CEO to update the 2019 targets that were laid out at the cost about a year ago? And if so, do you expect them to kind of affirm that, or do you expect any major changes operationally under his new guidance that will maybe change those numbers in a meaningful way? Thank you.","David Hess","Well, with respect to the management changes, we made, we were down to a number of changes that are intended to accelerate our progress here. We've announced Eric Roegner to now be in EP&S, Eric's a veteran of that organization, so he's got I think more than 11 years of experience here at Alcoa and Arconic, with most of that in EP&S and he had other experiences in industry, operating experiences in industry prior to that. So, he's a proven executive, he's got deep knowledge of the EP&S business and we know that he'll be able to hit the ground running and drive improvements in EP&S.","I'd say the same thing about Tim Myer, he's a proven executive here, here in Arconic, he's demonstrated strong performance leading our TCS business and I think is ready to kind of take the next step with taking on the GRP business as well. With respect to Chip, I don't want to presume to speak on behalf of the new CEO. I'm sure when Chip gets in here, he'll possess the plan the targets and do what he thinks is right for Arconic and for our shareholders.","Gautam Khanna","If I'm allowed one follow-up, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about - last quarter we'd asked if you guys were a bottleneck in the LEAP or GTF production systems and if I am going to ask the same question again, you mentioned the external suppliers the cost tax right? Is Arconic a bottleneck in the production systems of either of those engines, and have you seen any share erosion perhaps resulting from it, if there has been? Thanks.","David Hess","Well, I would encourage you to talk to our customers to get -","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. I apologize, but there will be a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold and the conference will resume momentarily. Thank you for your patience. You are reconnected to the call.","Patricia Figueroa","Thank you.","David Hess","Hello, this is David Hess, we are back on the line, if there are additional questions.","Operator","Okay, your nest question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with Seaport.","Josh Sullivan","Hey good morning. Just what on the GRP side, can you update us on the scope and timing of the ramp down on the Tennessee packaging facility? And I guess relatedly, are you seeing any upside pressure to your automotive sheet needs, where you may need to add any capacity?","Ken Giacobbe","Hey, Josh, it's Ken. In Terms of the Tennessee ramp, as we have previously communicated, that will be completed by end of 2018. That is going as planned. There is no issues there, so that is working out nicely. In terms of capacity on auto, auto was strong for us in the quarter, both from a revenue and a shipment's perspective, we don't see any current issues with any kind of capacity constraints on the auto side.","Josh Sullivan","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, I wanted to just follow up, a year ago, you guys had laid out some content figures at your investor day on each platform, and I was just wondering how those have evolved over the past year, if it still kind of anticipate a 3% or 4% step down in content across the platforms or how at all they have changed. Thank you.","Ken Giacobbe","Hi, Gautam, it's Ken. I think the driver is - there's - we got two things going on. We have got the legacy platforms declining, and we have got the next generations increasing. Next generations of course are more profitable for us, but as we are working through the ramp-up costs, that's got a little bit of a hang on the margins until we can eliminate those ramp-up costs going forward, but we are starting to see the shift between the legacy and the next-generation platforms.","Gautam Khanna","But the actual revenue per ships on each of these platforms as you outline them has not changed or -","David Hess","No. It is up dramatically.","Ken Giacobbe","No. And we see the aero engines Gautam, this year being up, as I mentioned earlier, about 9% for the full year. Our year-to-date performance is up about 8%, so we are seeing it on the engines, airframes are a little bit tighter just because of some of the supply chain optimizations that is going on right now. We are definitely seeing it on top-line revenue.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And speaking to seasonality, since we are in a pretty steep ramp on the new engines, does this block normal seasonality on an aggregate basis as we look at EP&S in Q4 and into next year where normally you would have a softer Q3 and Q4, but - if you can talk about that a little bit.","Ken Giacobbe","Yeah. Absolutely, Gautam. Normally we see a little bit of a depth in Q3 and then a decline in Q4, but as you can see from our current results, our Q3 was actually up sequentially versus Q2 and as we see that ramp in Q4, we anticipate positive performance in Q4 as well, so the historical seasonality specifically on the EP&S business doesn't carry going forward just because of the ramp on all the next generation platforms. So our biggest challenge is meeting the customer needs and getting those ramp up costs down.","Gautam Khanna","And I presume that would prevail as well in 2018 and 2019 just given the trajectory on those programs, normal seasonality would not apply in Q3 and Q4 of next year and the year after.","Ken Giacobbe","Yeah, we will be giving guidance in 2018 around the January timeframe, Gautam, but yes, the historical seasonality in this business really doesn't carry based on this unprecedented growth that we have got.","Gautam Khanna","Last one for me. You have heard a lot from Boeing about pursuing - getting a bigger share of the after-market and I know you guys supply the fastener market through distributors to address the after-market , I am just curious, what if any changes that you anticipate in any of your businesses, from Boeing's kind of reenergized focus on the after-market.","David Hess","We don't anticipate any impacts with respect to our kind of commuters [ph], we have a different model and Tier 1 or system or engine level suppliers with respect to the after-market. I mean, from our perspective, a part is a part, so we provide the part to our customers and they take the after-market for their parts, so we get the volume benefit, but it is not a differential in pricing as you would see in next year or up.","Gautam Khanna","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Seth Seifman","Thanks, very much and good morning. I wanted to start off with a clarification on one of the prior question. I think we had understood from before that the 2019 targets, were not really classed as targets, they were the board's target and not necessarily the function of who is the CEO, is that still the case?","David Hess","The basis for the targets were the management team and the board through extensive work put together the three year plan, so that is the basis for the targets and the three year plan.","Seth Seifman","Okay, and then may be to follow up on the engine side, definitely appreciate a lot of the challenges here with the ramp, but it is also fairly clear coming into the year that it was going to be a challenging ramp. Are there one or two things that you would point to that have surprised you on the engine side this year and then I guess how much of the added ramp-up cost would you associate with Firth Rixson and are you still planning to be shipping out of the isothermal forge in Q4 and if not, when?","David Hess","Well, let me talk to Firth Rixson in particular, the short answer to the question is, yes, we still expect to be generating in revenue out of Firth Rixson specifically Savannah in the isothermal press, so the answer to that is, clearly, yes. With respect to Firth in total again, we have been very clear, in the past about some of the challenges we have had with the Firth Rixson integration specifically with the ramp-up of Savannah and the isothermal press, we're making sure that we're taking appropriate actions now to ensure that we get that on track. In fact, I will be visiting - spending a day in Savannah myself this Thursday to review operations and review their improvement plans, so we continue to focus very heavily there.","With respect to the question on ramp-up cost in total, I don't think we have been surprised, obviously we're forecasting that our cost would come down at a faster rate than we're seeing. I mean, this is a very challenging ramp. I understand the difficulty. I think, as you appreciate, I mean, this is a historic ramp of the likes of which probably haven't been seen since literally World War II in terms of the steepness of the ramp and everybody in the supply chain, I think is challenged by the ramp-up in next-generation aero-body engine deliveries. And that's part of the issue that we have had as we are going into the supply chain to get heat treat machining and non-destructive testing, our supply chain is challenged as well. So again, as we continue to push through there to make sure that we are supporting the ramp and meeting the needs of our customers, our engine customers and our airframe customers, again we are having to pay some premium and expediting fees to make sure that we get our spot in line and we get priority and we are able to deliver on time.","Seth Seifman","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani","Good Morning. Just going back to the EP&S, what does it going to mean for working capital and capital expenditure going forward and just on CapEx, it seems like you are pulling in the number a bit this year, any forward implications there as you think of next couple of years.","Ken Giacobbe","In terms of the CapEx I think we are in very good shape. We've made the substantial investments already, particularly in the EP&S, the LaPorte facility which is up and running as per the large structural castings business and then the aluminum lithium forging operation in Lafayette which is now the world's largest aluminum lithium cast house and then lastly the titanium aluminide, so in terms of the CapEx spend in the business, that is done, that is taken care of. There are always opportunities to optimizing the portfolio, but I don't see any spikes on the CapEx side. On the working capital, we are carrying more inventory as we get ready for rate readiness, so that is a bit higher than I initially anticipated for the year, but that is all around, making sure that we have enough products for our customers and we are working through some of the bottlenecks in the supply chain.","Rajeev Lalwani","And the working capital, is that going to be contained this year or should we think of it as carrying forward, may be the next year or so as the ramp continues?","Ken Giacobbe","I would say it wouldn't increase next year, probably at constant levels to this year.","Rajeev Lalwani","And then just real quick on the CapEx one, a follow up there, at 600 million or so this year, is that a good number to use going forward?","David Hess","Well, we said that 650 was our target this year, and we're seeing anywhere between 50 to 75 million less. I would look at it more as a percentage of revenue, as we move forward somewhere in the 4% to 5% range.","Rajeev Lalwani","Great, thank you gentlemen.","David Hess","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.","Jorge Beristain","Hi, good morning, I guess my question is for Ken. Sorry, Ken at the November investor day, you gave a guidance of working capital reduction of 3 to 7 business days for 2017 I believe. Could you just update whether you are tracking on that, it might understand that because of this rate readiness that some of those calls have been put on the back burner?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, Jorge, you are correct, we gave guidance of 3 to 7 days. I think, we are probably more in this 0 to 3 range right now and that's all driven by the EP&S additional inventory that we've got in the chain.","Jorge Beristain","Thanks. And then just in terms of when we could expect the next kind of mark to market update of your three year plan with the new CEO coming in until January 15, would we be looking at a March, April time frame for him to kind of roll up the sleeves and come up with this view of the three year plan update or are you still going to have your typical end-of-the-year update cycle? Just trying to get a sense on what the next timing window would be?","David Hess","I expect we'll be giving you guidance for 2018 in the first quarter of next year.","Jorge Beristain","Following 1Q results, sorry, 4Q results, thank you.","David Hess","Yes. Right.","Jorge Beristain","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning. So should I think about the $50 million to $75 million reduction in CapEx is roughly what the working capital build increases since net income doesn't change?","Ken Giacobbe","Now, the working capital, right, the day on the working capital Sam is worth about $15 million, excuse me $35 million, right. So, the offset of CapEx and working capital should be approximately in the same range.","Sam Pearlstein","And are these projects that you no longer have to do because you found other efficiencies on the CapEx or are they things that will be pushed out into subsequent years?","Ken Giacobbe","Well, as you know, Sam, one of the things we've done with CapEx is, David and I are now reviewing approximately 85% of all the CapEx that comes across. And, it's been good interactions with the businesses, these are not deferrals, these are not cancellations, it's more efficiency in the business, not only on the growth side, but on the sustaining CapEx or maintenance CapEx as well. So, I believe our processes this year that we implemented early in the year is working very well for us.","David Hess","Yeah, let me just build on it Sam. I mean, why we've introduced some rigor into the process, I want to be very clear; we are not constraining growth capital and wherever we need, capital supports the ramp, we are approving it without hesitation.","Sam Pearlstein","Thanks, if I could just follow with one. The management changes that you announced putting both GRP and TCS under one person, is that a temporary change or is that how you envision things being run in the future?","David Hess","Everything is permanent until it changes.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with Seaport.","Josh Sullivan","Just another follow-up on the jet engine ramp, is there a LEAP or a GTS production number, where we can look to get together side of the ramp up cost, any way to frame the learning curve at this point?","David Hess","Well, the production numbers have been communicated by the engine manufacturers, so I don't want to comment on their numbers. But, I mean it's clear what they've talked about publicly probably or engine build rates and deliver rates more than doubling on an annual basis, last year to this year and this year to next year and going forward.","Josh Sullivan","Okay, I mean is there any way to time it, maybe not a specific engine number, but just as we look into 18' maybe whenever we get on the other side of it, first half, second half?","David Hess","We are working through all that now. As we work toward our improvement plans and our cost reduction plans, we are accessing all that and you will hear about that and a lot more details when we give guidance for 2018.","Josh Sullivan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.","Carter Copeland","Dave I like that pearl of wisdom on the permanent that was a good one? I want to ask a question about the - I know you don't want to give 2018 guidance, but conceptually I just want to understand, in the growth rate that you guys are calling out for engines this year, that 9% that you mentioned Ken, is there an element of inventory stocking at your customer at the engine OEM's similar to the stocking - the working capital dynamic that you are seeing in your own facilities? Meaning, are you are you ahead of what the underlying unit growth in production, I mean is there a de-risking affect that's making your 17' numbers in flayed some what? I just want to get a sense of it, if there's something that we should know about?","David Hess","I guess what I'd say Sam is that it's not unusual seeing a working capital build like this. Heading into a seep ramp, so, you know, that sounds. I guess it's not surprising. But, we are making sure here that, we do what we'll need to do, to protect our customers and deliver on our commitments to our customers. So that means caring a little bit more inventory, that means having to incur some higher expedite and premium fees to make sure that we are getting our fair share of capacity in our supplied chain. We are going to do what we have to do, to protect our customers.","Carter Copeland","Okay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] You have a follow up question from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company","Gautam Khanna","Hey, just a follow-up, I was curious if you anticipate any changes to the incentive comp or kind of the operating philosophy at the company now, given the management changes at the segment levels.","David Hess","Well, I mean we review that every year as a board Gautam. I mean as you can imagine. It will be something that gets discussed in our fourth quarter, December Arconic board meeting. As you know there's been considerable change in terms of the board composition and some of the experiences that our new directors have may at some point resolved and adjustments to the compensation plan going forward. So, it's always something that we take a look at, we take a look at what the industry benchmarks are doing, what are peers are doing, what's proven to be successful in terms of motivating the right behavior with our employees here in Arconic and, give them the new board composition, I'm sure that something will revisit on an annual basis.","Gautam Khanna","As you stand here today, you've been in charge for a while now, would you say that there have been - that the company is in need of material operating philosophy change, which was something one of the major shareholders that made a point up in January. I'm just curious was that your impression as well or do you think a lot of the criticism has unwarranted or maybe overstated.","David Hess","The Arconic needs improvement in performance across the board. We need better - we need to do a better job in terms of meeting our commitments to our shareholders. As you know there's been some disappointments in the past and we need to continue to deliver on our commitments to our customers. So I think, as I've said before, I think opportunity is at a bounce here in Arconic, to continue to improve operations to deliver higher levels of performance, both to our shareholders and to our customers. And I think our new CEO, Chip Blankenship, is the perfect CEO to deliver on those commitments and to help Arconic to realize its full potential.","Gautam Khanna","Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Thanks ma'am. One quick follow-up on the question of cash deployment, do you anticipate having the new CEO come in and participate in that decision with the board and maybe announced something about that later next year in terms of the excess cash that you talked about deploying or is that something the board might determine before Chip steps into the role?","David Hess","Chip will participate that, Chip will be obviously delivering 2018 guidance and as part of that guidance we'll talk about capital allocation, but we're not waiting for Chip, we're having serious discussions with the board and the finance committee around capital allocation now. It's brought in center on our agenda in December and we'll be in a position to make some recommendations to Chip when he arrives in January 15 of next year and then in position to discuss our plans when we give guidance for 2018.","Seth Seifman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.","Jorge Beristain","Hey, guys. If I could get a follow up and I just was wondering if you could give us any color on how some of your non-aerospace segments are doing such us oil and gas related sales, energy, transport. If you could just talk about, are you seeing any kind of demand fold for some of these heavier forgings in castings from some sectors that may have gone quite in the last few years and how you would kind of balance that against the paramount need to obviously focus your guidance on the aerospace ramp, but if you could just tell us, do you see some improved utilization coming from those other sectors as well.","Ken Giacobbe","Yeah. Hey, Jorge, hey, it's Ken. Just a few items, on our commercial transportation business, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing double digit growth in that market and that will continue as we move forward. I think there's two things going on there, one is just the market dynamics, but the second part is just related to our differentiated products, right. Again, our aluminum wheel is, I believe the benchmark in the industry at 47% less weight than steel and it's a quick payback for our customers as we move forward there. Building a construction business as well continues to be on a nice trajectory as we move forward not only in North America, but in Europe. So we're happy there. In terms of automotive, that will continue to aluminize, shipments are still strong on a year-over-year basis. We have not seen any of the impacts or real significant impacts from hurricane demand yet based on what's happened there, but that's more - continues to be strong. So I would say across all of our major markets, with the exception of IGT, IGT is down, we feel very confident that we're in the right markets and we have differentiated products to help us grow profitably.","Jorge Beristain","Okay. Well, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karl Blunden with Goldman Sachs.","Karl Blunden","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Lot of focus just on your operating goals, for the coming months, I do appreciate that. As you think about the balance sheet, is there anything you can do there to optimize to increase return on equity for the equity holders overtime or has that not really been in discussion. I know you go back a year and you were thinking investment grade, that hasn't really happened, but is there more room to flex that in order to satisfy all stakeholders?","Ken Giacobbe","Yeah, in terms of the investment grade, that's important to us as we move forward. In terms of what we're doing with the balance sheet, we were fortunate as we monetized the - our corp state earlier this year that gave us more cash, but as David mentioned, we're continuously working with the board actively in terms of uses - of excess uses of that cash and that could span multiple areas. Could be debt pay down, share repurchase, initiatives on our pension program, potentially dividends, but we're looking at all different aspects and the relative returns of each one of them, so that is actively working right now and we'll provide guidance with that in terms of January as we grow through Q4 earnings.","Karl Blunden","Yeah, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, thanks for the follow up. So a relatively quick one on Grenfell, any update there may be we're going to hear on the various investigations and then enquires. And then maybe just the extent to your involvement as you've been getting questions et cetera, that would be great.","David Hess","Nothing really new to communicate, obviously there's an ongoing investigation and we're absolutely supporting the investigation. So really there's not much new to say.","Rajeev Lalwani","Any color on timeline?","David Hess","On timing?","Rajeev Lalwani","Correct.","David Hess","I mean it's hard to predict briefly or speculate on that, but it is not unusual for these things to take a number of years to resolve.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thank you, David.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna","Hey guys, I apologize for asking all these questions, but I think I disconnected when you were answering, so I'm just going to ask it again. Is there any - are you guys - were you a bottleneck, are you a bottleneck in the production of GTF and Li, I seem to have disconnected when you were answering it. And also, do you have any view on whether you've lost share on these programs. I'm just curious because again a lot of this models the business on the revenue per ships that disclosures you've given and I'm just curious if there has been any change either because of the share or anything else so that we don't overshoot on consensus. Thank you.","David Hess","Yeah, I apologize for the line drop content. But with respect to bottleneck, what I said is, you've to go ask the engines manufacturers, but to my knowledge, no, we've not been a bottleneck or pacing or stopping engine deliveries to the airframers. I speak very frequently with both senior level executives at the engine manufacturers at Safran, at GE and at Pratt and at Rolls Royce and to make sure that we're not getting in their way or pacing deliveries. But again, I would encourage you to talk with them. With respect to share, there's always puts and takes, but I've seen no evidence that we've lost share, in fact I've seen evidence that in certain areas we picked up share.","Gautam Khanna","Okay, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Ken Giacobbe.","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, thank you. Before we turn it back to David to close here. This will be David's final quarterly earnings. David has worked tirelessly with our team, spending a lot of time with employees on the plant floor, staying very close to our customers and calling out on investors, many of the people that are on this call. We've no doubt that David will continue that pace right up to the day that the new CEO arrives, but on the sake of the entire management team and employees, David, we like to thank you for all your efforts.","David Hess","Thank you all and thank you again for joining the call today and I look forward to listening in for the fourth quarter earnings report with our new CEO. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"2984":["Arconic Inc.

My name is Jennifer and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Patricia Figueroa, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Patricia Figueroa","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Arconic\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. I am joined by Chip Blankenship, Chief Executive Officer and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by Chip and Ken, we will take your questions.","I would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today\u2019s presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release and in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation. Any reference in our discussion today to historical EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA, for which we have provided calculations and reconciliations in the appendix.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Chip.","Chip Blankenship","Good morning. Thank you for joining the call. I will begin with a brief production, then Ken will take you through our financial results and we will take your questions after that. Let me begin by saying I am very excited to be here and I am here, because I admire the work that Arconic does. I was an Arconic customer, so I ride with some perspectives and baseline knowledge about the company. I intend to use that insight for the benefit of our employees, our customers and our shareholders. I joined Arconic, because I believe this company has foundational strength and incredible potential arising from a strong team, material science knowledge and deep customer relationships. As mentioned, my experience aligns well with the work that Arconic does.","Let me give you a little background on me. I completed undergraduate studies at Virginia Tech and earned a PhD at the University of Virginia both in the field of material science and engineering. I am a metallurgist by training. So joining a company focused on making things out of high performance, metallic materials is a natural fit. In addition to being a metallurgist, I spent 24 years at GE primarily with the Aviation division. I spent the past 5 years running the GE Appliances business, all the way through its sale plus a year on the other side with higher global appliance company. As you all know, I am 3 weeks into this job. I spent most of that time on the road visiting 3 of our major customers and 7 of Arconic\u2019s operations, including Hampton, Cleveland, the Tech Center, Davenport, Whitehall, Savannah and Toulouse to learn more about our businesses, technology and the capability of our team. My first impressions are that I see both great potential and great opportunity for improvement. While I saw some operations that I would consider world class and as good as anything I have seen in my experience, I saw others that are below that benchmark. So, the challenge for Arconic is to bring all our operations up to world class.","Now, I would like to discuss my priorities. First, customers, the most effective approach to winning more business is to understand customer requirements and deliver on current commitments. I have a relentless passion to win. So, we will emphasize these two points going forward. As I said in my first 3 weeks as CEO, I visited three of our largest customers to hear their views on Arconic regarding what we do well and where we need to improve. Strengthening our customer connections will help us solve their biggest challenges and consistently deliver on our commitments. Second, people, team work wins over silo mentality every time in my experience. People make all the difference in any company and having the right talent in a right place, aligned and rewarded as a team is important to our success.","Third, operational excellence, across the company we will be focused on safety, quality, delivery and cost. If we do that right, strong financial performance will result. While the company has many strengths, there are clearly areas that need improvement. Free cash flow and the performance of the former Firth Rixson assets were disappointments for us in 2017. These are areas of increased focus for us in 2018. In the end, it comes down to execution and I am working with our team to improve here. Going forward, robust continuous improvement system across the company using Lean principles will allow us to achieve better workforce engagement, new levels of problem solving accuracy and velocity, process control and quality of delivered product. Our goal is to be the industry leader and sustain that leadership with continuous improvement.","Fourth, technology, the right technology investments help us win more business and achieve profitable growth, creating relevant differentiated technology that solves our customers\u2019 biggest problems or makes their products more valuable is one way to win with technology. Another way we win is developing technology that makes us more competitive on quality, delivery or cost in the marketplace. Our goal is to succeed on both fronts. By focusing on the four elements on this list we will create value for our shareholders. Additionally, we are initiating a comprehensive strategy and portfolio review to assess our capabilities and determine how best to unlock our potential. We will determine and clarify our strategic advantage or lack thereof in each business and examined the business models including the prospects of the markets served and the returns available with world class performance. We will conduct this review with an eye on the purpose of the company as it relates to synergies available in technology, manufacturing and management focus. We expect to complete this review and develop our action plan by the end of the year.","Now, I will address some important announcements. Last year the team made meaningful progress reducing SG&A expenses at corporate and in the businesses with a total of $111 million of annualized benefit. Consistent with our focus on reducing costs, today we announced our decision to move our global headquarters out of New York City to a more cost effective location. We intend to complete the move by year end. We also made the decision to move retirement benefits from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan for all U.S. non-bargained participants. This was a very difficult decision, which balanced the need to maintain a competitive benefits plan for our employees with the imperative to attain a more competitive cost structure and better manage company liabilities. Today, we also announced $500 million, an early debt reduction and the share repurchase program of up to $500 million. The timing of repurchases and the exact number of shares to be purchased will depend upon market conditions and other factors including our seasonal cash needs. These plans demonstrate our commitment to return cash to shareholders, reflect our confidence in our financial strength and the long-term outlook of our company. Returning cash to shareholders and investing in our future remain top priorities for us.","I know there are questions in my thoughts about the company\u2019s 2019 targets that were established in December of 2016. I joined Arconic because I am convinced we have great potential. Having said that, I need time to understand our capabilities and the magnitude of our challenges and opportunities before addressing this question, I will be in a better position to comment on 2019 when we get to 2019, meanwhile this year the focus is on execution. Last but not least, I would like to thank David Hess for his leadership as Interim CEO. He made huge contributions guiding the company in uncertain times. I will continue to count his advice and counsel as a Board member going forward.","Now, I will turn it over to Ken who will take you through our results for 2017 and provide guidance for 2018.","Ken Giacobbe","Good morning. Thanks Chip. I will move rather quickly through the financial slides. Please note that we have several slides in the appendix, which will provide additional details if needed. Starting on Slide 5, revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $3.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Organic revenue, which adjusts for aluminum prices currency and portfolio change, was up 6% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis and up 5% for the full year versus 2016. Organic revenue growth for both quarter and the year was driven by volume gains across all segments. The reconciliation for our organic revenue can be found in the appendix.","EBITDA for the fourth quarter came in at $436 million, up 54% year-over-year. EBITDA, excluding special items, was $446 million in the fourth quarter up 24% year-over-year and $1.854 billion for the full year up 9% versus 2016. EBITDA improvements were driven by volume growth in all three segments and net cost savings, which were partially offset by pricing pressures and unfavorable mix. Higher aluminum prices were a headwind that unfavorably impacted EBITDA by $42 million in the fourth quarter and $84 million for the full year versus 2016. The reconciliation for EBITDA excluding special items can be found in the appendix. EBITDA margin, excluding special items, was 13.6% for the fourth quarter, up 150 basis points year-over-year. For the year, EBITDA margin was 14.3%, up 60 basis points versus 2016.","As I mentioned on the third quarter conference call, our EBITDA and EBITDA margins have been negatively impacted by higher aluminum prices this year as aluminum prices have increased approximately 30% in 2017. In the fourth quarter, higher aluminum prices unfavorably impacted EBITDA by $42 million year-over-year and EBITDA margins by 190 basis points. For the full year, higher aluminum prices unfavorably impacted EBITDA by $84 million versus 2016 and EBITDA margins by 110 basis points. On the third quarter conference call, we had estimated that the annual full year impact to be unfavorable approximately $90 million. Our actual impact was unfavorable around $84 million. The aluminum price impacts are detailed in the appendix for the fourth quarter and the full year. We will continue to brief you on aluminum prices impacts on future earnings calls. Net cost savings were approximately 2% of revenue for the quarter and the year, including over $100 million of year-over-year reductions in corporate and segment SG&A expenses. We finished the year with $2.15 billion in cash and our liquidity remained strong.","Now, let\u2019s review our results versus guidance on Slide 6. Slide 6 shows Arconic\u2019s 2017 results versus our last guidance as well as the year-over-year aluminum price impact. As I mentioned on the previous slide, higher aluminum prices created a significant headwind partially offsetting strong operational improvements across the business in 2017. Overall, we delivered on or exceeded guidance for revenue growth, net cost savings and EBITDA performance as well as earnings per share growth. Two areas of disappointment were cost reduction progress in our rings and disc business, the former Firth Rixson and free cash flow performance. For both of these areas, you can expect to see increased focus in 2018.","With respect to free cash flow higher than planned working capital was the primary driver of the free cash flow variance. The days on hands reductions that we contemplated in our guidance were in the end not achieved in our efforts to support the delivery ramp and continued strong growth in many of our end markets. The three main drivers of higher working capital were as follows: first, we continue to build inventory in our aerospace engines in advance of the engine ramp to ensure that we protect our customer delivery schedules and commitments. Our first priority in 2018 going forward will be to continue to protect our customers\u2019 delivery schedules, while optimizing working capital. The second driver was higher raw material prices which have increased inventory values. And the third related to increased pressure from our customers on payment terms and shorter payment terms for our suppliers on expedite fees. Having said that while we expect the continued strong end market growth in many of our segments in 2018 we are confident that we will make progress on driving operational improvements in working capital efficiency, which will translate into better free cash flow performance.","Now, let\u2019s review our results versus guidance for the segments on Slide 7. On this slide you can see that GRP and TCS segments achieved or exceeded the latest guidance. Both GRP and TCS had record EBITDA margin years despite significant aluminum price headwinds. As with the previous slide the last column shows the year-over-year impact of higher aluminum prices. For EP&S we achieved our revenue growth guidance including a record fourth quarter. However, we did not meet our expectations on cost reductions and operational performance which was concentrated in the rings and disc business. And this resulted in an EBITDA margin miss. I will cover the segment performance in more detail in the segment slides that will follow.","Now let\u2019s take a closer look at the quarter starting with the income statement on Slide 8. We have talked about revenue and EBITDA, so let me cover a couple of other key areas. Overhead reduction initiatives in 2017 were a success as we delivered $111 million of SG&A savings versus 2016. In the fourth quarter SG&A was impacted by external legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower of $7 million pretax and Delaware re-incorporation cost of $3 million pretax. Excluding special items our SG&A as a percentage of sales was 4.3% for the quarter with SG&A being down $52 million year-over-year. Restructuring and goodwill impairment charges were $766 million in the fourth quarter which includes a non-cash, non-tax deductible impairment of goodwill of $719 million, primarily associated with the disc portion of the Firth Rixson acquisition.","We perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year and the estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units are compared to their corresponding carrying values. The $719 million impairment is a result of favorable performance that impacted the fair value of the forgings and extrusions business which included the disc business from Firth Rixson. The testing of our six remaining goodwill reporting units resulted in no additional impairment of goodwill. Restructuring related charges include a $41 million non-cash non-tax deductible asset impairment related to the sale of our Latin American extrusions business which we expect to close in the first half of 2018. The remaining $6 million of restructuring charges related primarily the costs associated with decisions made in prior quarters to exit certain facilities in 2018. All restructuring charges this quarter were non-cash.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was a negative 59.8% as a number of items including the goodwill impairment charge are not deductible. The operational tax rate was 29.6% for the quarter and 31.3% for the year. Net loss for the quarter was $727 million or $1.51 per share. Excluding special items net income was $152 million or $0.31 per share. This compares to $71 million and $0.12 per share on the first \u2013 fourth quarter of 2016. For the year net income including special items was $618 million or $1.22 a share, up 24% year-on-year.","Moving to the right hand side of the slide you can see that special items for the quarter totaled $879 million after tax. I have already discussed the first three specialized items listed. As mentioned before included in the fourth quarter is an item for the Delaware reincorporation, this was $3 million of SG&A costs in the quarter associated with legal fees and transfer taxes. Moreover, the Delaware reincorporation required a $23 million tax reserve in the quarter related to certain NOLs in our foreign entities which may be attributed and moved forward with future tax attributes.","Continuing down the list, as part of the Firth Rixson acquisition, Arconic entered in an earn-out agreement with the seller related to the Savannah, Georgia facility. Currently, we do not anticipate any making any payments under the agreements and have reversed the remaining $81 million liability associated with the potential earn-out payment. This item was recorded in other income line of the income statement and is non-cash. We also reversed a guarantee liability of $25 million that was setup at separation related to an Alcoa Corporation Power contract that has been terminated. This item was recorded in the other income line of the income statement and is non-cash.","Second and last item on the list relates to U.S. tax reform legislation that was enacted on December 22, 2017. As a result of the decrease in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, Arconic revalued its U.S. deferred tax assets resulting at a non-cash charge of $272 million. Based on our estimates, we do not anticipate an impact to Arconic for the one-time transition tax on forward earnings included in the new U.S. tax legislation. Foreign tax credits will be utilized to negate this tax.","The last item associated with taxes includes not only the tax impact of the items listed above, but also includes a favorable discrete tax item in the quarter. The majority of this relates to a release of U.S. tax valuation allowances. Following separation, Arconic now has a normalized U.S. taxable income profile as anticipated to support realization of certain U.S. state deferred tax asset and thus a portion of that state valuation allowance was released in the fourth quarter.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the cash flow statement on Slide 9. Free cash flow was $376 million for the quarter. As you heard Chip comment in his introductory remarks improving cash generation is a top priority for 2018. We ended the quarter with $2.15 billion in cash on hand, which is well above our minimum operating cash level of $600 million to $700 million. CapEx spend for the year was $596 million in line with our updated guidance and consistent with our efforts to rigorously manage capital expenditures. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA finished 2017 at 2.53 times versus the end of 2016 when it was 3.66 times. That\u2019s an improvement of approximately 30%. Finally, as Chip discussed, the Board of Directors has authorized a $500 million early debt reduction program to further enhance our financial position. We will target the 5.72% bonds that are due in February 2019.","Now, let\u2019s move to our segment performance starting with EP&S on Slide 10. As I mentioned earlier, EP&S exceeded expectations for revenue growth, with a 6% increase in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis and a 4% increase for the full year versus 2016. Most of the aerospace markets as well as commercial transportation exhibited strong growth versus 2016 while industrial gas turbines declined more than expected. However, while the revenue exceeded expectations we were short of EBITDA growth and margin expansion. EBITDA was up 12% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis and up 2% for the full year versus 2016. EBITDA and EBITDA margins for EP&S legacy businesses were roughly in line with our expectations, but we did not make the cost reduction progress planned in our rings and discs businesses. For rings and discs, we have been able to deliver on the revenue projection as the full year revenue was $980 million or 6% higher than 2016, which is in line with our guidance. However, EBITDA was $120 million or $16 million lower than 2016 as EBITDA margin was 12% or 250 basis points lower than 2016.","To address the ramp up challenges with our rings and disc businesses, we have initiated the following. We have deployed targeted CapEx to increase velocity through our plans. We would deploy additional quality systems and technical experts from Arconic to these sites and we have changed relevant segment business unit and location leadership personnel to bring about faster changes. Lastly in January, we consolidated the EP&S organizational structure collapsing four business units into three and by reducing layers in the process. These changes will save approximately $15 million in 2018, but equally important have resulted in streamline organization, which will accelerate progress, increased focus, speed up decision making and improve delivery performance to our customers.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at the GRP segment. Slide 11, as I have mentioned earlier, the GRP segment delivered revenue growth and improved EBITDA margins versus 2016. Organic revenue was up 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and up 5% for the full year. For the full year double digit growth in auto sheet and commercial transportation was somewhat offset by weaknesses in packaging and commercial airframe, which was driven by airframe supply chain optimization and lower wide-body build rates on selected platforms.","In the fourth quarter, GRP\u2019s EBITDA was $124 million, up 7% versus prior year. Its EBITDA margin decreased 80 basis points to 10% as higher aluminum prices unfavorably impacted EBITDA margins by 160 basis points. For the year GRP\u2019s EBITDA was $599 million, up 4% versus prior year, while its EBITDA margin increased by 10 basis points to 12% despite the unfavorable 140 basis point impact due to higher aluminum prices, overall a solid year for the GRP segment.","Finally, let\u2019s move to our performance in the TCS segment. Like GRP, the TCS segment delivered strong revenue growth and improved EBITDA margins versus 2016. Revenue was up 14% compared to the fourth quarter of \u201816 and up 10% for the full year. For the full year, TCS experienced solid organic growth in its two main markets of commercial transportation and building and construction. In the fourth quarter, TCS EBITDA was $84 million, up 12% versus prior year. Its EBITDA margin decreased by 20 basis points to 16.2% as higher aluminum prices unfavorably impacted EBITDA by 170 basis points. For the year, TCS\u2019 EBITDA was $321 million, up 10% versus prior year. Its EBITDA margin increased 10 basis points to 16.2% despite an unfavorable 120 basis point impact due to higher aluminum prices, a very strong performance by the TCS team.","Now, let\u2019s look at our SG&A. On Slide 13, as I have mentioned previously, we have delivered on our overhead reduction initiatives for 2017. Excluding special items, our SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 4.9% for 2017, 120 basis point improvement or $111 million compared to 2016. Corporate overheads finished the year at less than 1% of revenue for 2017 versus our original guidance of 1.1%.","Now, let\u2019s move to the end markets on Slide 14 and 15. Slide 14 provides a breakdown of our 2017 revenue by end market. As you can see aerospace comprises approximately 40% of our revenue, while automotive and commercial transportation account for another 25% of the total revenue. Slide 15, shows the growth in end markets. For aerospace and defense, we saw a 2% increase in 2017 and we expect to see higher growth in 2018. As aluminization of the automobile continues, we expect to see strong growth again in 2018 for auto after seeing 22% growth in 2017. In commercial transportation, we expect to see continued strong growth with another 6% to 10% increase in the market. Building and construction will see moderate growth in 2018 of roughly 2% to 3%. Industrial gas turbines is more of a challenge. The market declined 7% in 2017 and we are expected to see continued reductions in that market by at least 40% in 2018. During the IGT downturn, we will adjust volume and redeploy capacity and talent to fully utilize our existing assets.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 16 for our 2018 guidance. Supported by the growth in most of our markets, we are expecting to see organic growth of 2% to 4% in 2018. Current aluminum prices and currency rates that would put revenue at approximately $13.4 billion to 13.7 billion, while we see strength in many of our main markets and overall see 2% to 4% organic growth, it\u2019s important to note that we are ramping down the North American packaging business. We also have other packaging businesses outside of North America and we expect those markets to be flat. We also have a significant part of our revenue coming from industrial and other markets and we expect that to be flat in 2018.","As Chip mentioned in his comments, we have taken a number of difficult actions to improve performance, including overhead reductions, relocating our global headquarters by the end of this year and freezing pension for non-U.S. bargained employees just to name a few. We expect that these actions as well as improved operational performance will result in earnings per share in 2018 between $1.45 per share and $1.55 per share. That would represent a 19% to 27% improvement versus 2017. We expect to see continued pricing pressure in many of our markets, particularly aerospace and higher raw material prices.","Overall, we see a net favorable market and cost profile for Arconic in 2018. For free cash flow, our target for 2018 is approximately $500 million. I will note that this is an annual target and reflects expected first quarter usage of cash based on anticipated timing of interest payments and pension contributions. We did not perform well in 2017 in terms of managing our working capital and delivering free cash flow. This will be a priority in 2018. The combination of improved earnings and working capital performance will accelerate our improvements in RONA or return on net assets. Slide 20 in the appendix provides some additional key assumptions that we use to build the guidance.","Now, let\u2019s move to Slide 17, capital allocation. As you look at Slide 17, we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders. As announced today, the Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase of up to $500 million of Arconic stock. We will also continue to return cash to our shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends, which is targeted at $0.06 per share. As I mentioned before, working capital efficiency and improved cash flow will be a priority for 2018. Finally, we have remained committed to de-lever the company. The announcement today that the Board of Directors has authorized a $500 million early debt reduction program is further evidence of our commitment.","In summary for 2017, we had favorable performance in terms of revenue growth, net cost savings, EBITDA performance and earnings per share growth. Arconic\u2019s total shareholder return in 2017 was 48% compared to the S&P 500 return of 22%. However, it is clear that we have opportunity for improvement in delivering free cash flow as well as performance in our rings and disc business. As you can see, we will increase our focus in these areas to produce better results in 2018.","Now, before turning it back to Chip let me cover a couple other items that will help you understand our results as we move forward in 2018. First on Slide 20, you will notice that our operational tax rate assumption, including the impact of the U.S. tax reform is 27% to 29%. This range is based on the geography of our earnings and tax rates in each jurisdiction as well as our current understanding of the U.S. tax reform legislation. We will update guidance as necessary and as the details become more clear. I will also note that we do not currently pay U.S. cash taxes. So, there is no immediate cash benefit from the U.S. corporate tax rate reduction. We do not anticipate incurring U.S. federal cash taxes in 2018. For 2018, we expect that our global cash income tax rate will be approximately 10% of pre-tax earnings.","On Slide 21, I will also point out that you will see details related to our pension and OPEB obligation. As mentioned previously, we froze the defined benefit plan for U.S. non-bargained employees effective April 1 of this year. Pension and OPEB related expense in 2018 will be approximately $50 million less than 2017. Also as a result of the new pension accounting standard that is effective for Arconic in 2018. Pension and OPEB expense will be split between operating and non-operating accounts. While historical expense data for 2017 will be restated and available for our first quarter earnings release, Slide 21 shows the impact of the change between 2017 and \u201818. You can also see on Slide 21 that we expect our pension contributions to be higher in 2018 as a result of our lower pension asset returns in 2017, which were about 5% and also the update to the IRS mortality tables for funding purposes.","Finally, I will note that for 2018 we expect that 7% will be the expected long-term rate of return for our pension assets. The previous view was 7.75% return. Finally, we will be changing our segment profit measure from adjusted EBITDA to operating income effective 2018. This change will allow a direct comparison of Arconic\u2019s income statement as the operating income is a separate line on the income statement. As part of this change, LIFO and metal lag will now be included in the operating income for each segment. Historical segment information will be restated for 2017 and will be available for release in our first quarter earnings release.","Now, let me turn it back to Chip to wrap things up and then we will take your questions.","Chip Blankenship","Thank you, Ken. Just to reiterate I am excited to be here leading the Arconic team and serving our customers. I see a good foundation in place in terms of people, process and technology. There are areas that are right for improvement where the next level of performance can be achieved. The kind of work that is ahead of us is not easy work nor is it quick work. Shortcuts won\u2019t get us there. It will take a refined execution mindset to deliver improved business performance. I have met many Arconic employees so far that I believe are up to this challenge. Our customers have declared their support for us. My attention and my leadership team\u2019s attention will be focused on supporting the factories and the team members on the frontlines that will deliver on our customer and company commitments to maximize value for shareholders.","With that, I\u2019d like to open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Chip Blankenship","Good morning.","Sam Pearlstein","I was wondering if you could talk how you are thinking about the buyback activity, I know you are assuming none in the guidance with the 505 million shares, but just what\u2019s the criteria for deploying it, how should we think about how you are going to deploy that buyback?","Ken Giacobbe","Hey, Sam. Yes, you are correct our guidance does not contemplate any change in share count. So, the buyback will be incremental to that. We will be opportunistic based on where we see the value of the stock as well as we will have to take a look at our cash \u2013 seasonal cash needs as you know in the first quarter. We normally have pay-down of debt, interest payments and also our pension funding, which causes a drain in the first quarter. So, we are going to look at opportunistic place here as well as what our cash balances are.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And then Chip if you can talk a little bit about the portfolio review, I mean, what does the review entail and what do you see in terms of how we will hear about it, is it a series of individual announcements or is there going to be one big kind of release in terms of the completion of the review?","Chip Blankenship","So, we are initiating a comprehensive review. It\u2019s going to be a thoughtful approach regarding our strengths and weaknesses and really like I said in the script to determine the best way to unlock our potential, Primarily, it\u2019s a tool to refine our commercial and go-to-market strategies and really look at capital allocation. It\u2019s a very important exercise, but I don\u2019t view it as an urgent exercise. So, we are going to take the year to do that in a really thoughtful way, Sam and we will reveal the outcome of that as well as the action plan going forward at the end of the year early 2019.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay, thank you.","Chip Blankenship","Thank you.","Operator","Your question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, good morning. Welcome, Chip.","Chip Blankenship","Good morning. Thank you.","Rajeev Lalwani","Just a follow-up on the last question there, when you are looking at your portfolio review, will you take a look at potentially exiting certain businesses or selling certain assets whether it\u2019s GRP, TCS maybe the company as a whole? And then just related to that what are your thoughts on just the synergies between the various segments that you have and essentially the benefits of having the three under one umbrella?","Chip Blankenship","Well, it\u2019s a little bit early to offer my opinion on the synergies. I think that\u2019s really as I highlighted one of the things we really need to look at across the board how do these segments perform together and what are the advantages for having them together. As far as more radical actions like you suggested we will look at everything, but like I said primarily this is a tool for us to understand how do we compete, where are we strategically advantaged, where are we not, so that we know whether we are investing in the right technologies to further a strategic advantage or if we are less advantaged can we utilize our assets better by really targeted and opportunistic sales and operations connections to improve our utilization and productivity and lowest cost per pound to produce.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thanks. Ken\u2026","Chip Blankenship","Is that helpful?","Rajeev Lalwani","Yes, it is. Thanks Chip. And then Ken, a quick one for you, can you just maybe provide a bridge between the 2017 and 2018 free cash flow figures, I mean going from 100 to 500 a pretty big shift, especially given what we are seeing on the CapEx side? So we just love some color there.","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, the biggest change, Rajeev, in \u201817 was the working capital, right. We carry too much inventory in our EP&S business that was related to our engine business. We hit a milestone in our engine business where our revenue went up to $2 billion. We did carry a little bit of extra inventory there more than expected, but that was the main drivers. In terms of 2018 earnings is going to drive our free cash flow. We are also going to invest opportunistically some more CapEx in the business. CapEx guidance is in the $700 million range for 2018. Now, a lot of that incremental CapEx on year-over-year basis, Rajeev, will be for productivity CapEx and growth CapEx. Our sustaining CapEx will probably be still around 45% of our depreciation, the actual raw numbers coming down on a year-over-year basis. So, while these investments will be to improve our flow through the plants, improve our working capital performance that will help cash. On the other side, we are growing revenue in 2018 by roughly $600 million. Although we will get days improvement in our days working capital, we won\u2019t see a cash contribution in terms of working capital dollars, because you\u2019ve got a lot of incremental revenue, but the drivers will be still improvements in our earnings in the business, we\u2019ll fund that extra capital through the business and cash should be around $500 million for 2018.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thank you, gentlemen.","Chip Blankenship","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. So, I guess my question about the portfolio review is where is it taking place, who is going to be involved in conducting it, Chip maybe besides you and how often and intimately is the board going to be involved?","Chip Blankenship","So, we are going to use our team to do this portfolio analysis and that\u2019s one of the reasons why the length of time is as we have specified, because our urgent activities really are to get on PO with customers, support them with the right quality and at the right cost. So the same folks that are leading our businesses and supporting that activity will also be involved in the portfolio review. So really, that\u2019s the answer to that question. We will reach out to external consultants if we think they can add value on very targeted specific items, but I think we have a good view internally on our business and we can step back and take that neutral view that we need to look at everything.","Seth Seifman","Great. Thanks. And then as a follow-up maybe given your experience at GE in the aviation business, looking at this engine ramp I think we all know and management has made the point before and I think it\u2019s a valid one that there is a very steep edge in production going on? And just sort of how you view the challenges ahead on that fund and maybe talking about little bit more broadly than the Firth Rixson and Savannah, where are the opportunities that you see for improvement?","Chip Blankenship","So, on the engine ramp this is one of the biggest challenges I think industrially that the aviation community has faced whether it\u2019s engines or otherwise getting on rate for the narrow-body build rates that in my experience are higher than ever imagined, but we are performing well. We are behind in a couple of areas, we are ahead in a few areas and we are right on time in with some other part numbers. So, we are doing everything we know how to meet the customer demand. I would say that the challenge is really to get the capital that was approved last year in play, so we can increase velocity through the plants, reduce our costs, limit the amount of outsourcing that we need to support the customer and it\u2019s really about achieving both the same time on PO with the customer as well as our reduced cost to achieve that.","Seth Seifman","Great, thanks. And then maybe as a final one, if you could just give an example of maybe one or two of the types of capital projects here that are going to allow you to work faster in the plants and I guess you keep inventory at a reduced level?","Chip Blankenship","Yes, just briefly I would say that it spans the realm from just rate tooling to support additional lines and additional loads into furnaces as well as it involves a major equipment in terms of bringing online abreast to reduce the number of operations and reheat cycles to support our customer.","Seth Seifman","Okay, thanks very much.","Chip Blankenship","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question is from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse.","Curt Woodworth","Yes. Hi, good morning everyone.","Chip Blankenship","Good morning.","Curt Woodworth","First question is on the EPS segment and the performance in the fourth quarter you noted about a $50 million annualized headwind from product mix, but then you also noted that the jet engine revenue ramp was 9% and you were flat on airframes. So, I would have assumed mix would have been tailwind on the jet engine side this quarter, can you just elaborate on sort of the mix dynamic this quarter and how you see mix evolving into 18?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes. To your point, jet engines as I mentioned earlier hit the milestone of $2 billion of revenue was about 8.5% growth year-over-year. It\u2019s interesting too as you dissect that engine build if you look at the next generation platforms, they were up about 60% year-over-year in our legacy engines which are smaller percent of what much bigger dollar amount declined about 7% we had a mix within the engines as you do that we got to learn out our cost on those next generation engines. They are not as profitable as the legacy engines. So, you have got mix within the engine component. That\u2019s the first major driver. And then the second one is his IGT, right, it\u2019s an attractive margin business for us and it\u2019s just pretty much dried up a lot of the orders that we received the combination of the mix within engines in terms of the profitability side in IGT.","Curt Woodworth","Okay, great. And then with respect to the $81 million contention earn-out at first, does that imply that you see less I think it was related mainly to the isothermal development, does that imply that you see significantly less EBITDA contribution from isothermal and can you just give us an update on the commercialization of isothermal? Thanks.","Ken Giacobbe","So, in terms of the earn-out that relates specifically to the Savannah, Georgia facility that does how was the isothermal press, although we wrote down the earn-out we are still driving performance in that business. We are investing a lot of capital down there not only in 2017, but will continue that in 2018. To improve the throughput of the plant as Chip mentioned brings some of the outsourcing expense in-house in getting rid of those expedite fees. So, we are continuing to drive this is Savannah operation. In terms of the isothermal technology, we will continue to invest and we are making progress. However, we are behind in 2018 our revenue for isothermal will be probably in the $10 million to $15 million range. There will be a greater contribution in \u201819 and \u201820, but I wouldn\u2019t expect a lot of revenue out of isothermal in 2018.","Curt Woodworth","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thank you. On Slide 16, you mentioned some of the headwinds in the guide this year none of them is your best destocking what specifically is going on there?","Ken Giacobbe","Hey, Gautam. Good morning. There is two items with Airbus. First on the fastener side, we are seeing that there is some drawdown on some of the inventory with Airbus. That is impacting our fasteners business that primarily relates to the A350 platform. However, we have bit of an offset in terms of now we are seeing Boeing is actually behind us. So, those are kind of offsetting, but we do see in the sheet and plate business for GRP is at there is some inventory corrections going on and that combines with the wide-body build rate reductions is impacting the performance.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. So, last quarter when we asked the 350 was not an issue, so it just started to actually pickup in Q4 for the first time?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, we are starting to see it now, Gautam.","Gautam Khanna","See it now this quarter, okay. I know Chip you don\u2019t want to comment on 2019\u2019s standing guidance, but just looking at the math, $100 million of free cash in \u201817 to $518 million and you have a very steep ramp as you describe them new engines, which brings with it a need for whip inventory and the guide is $750 million for free cash in 2019. I just wonder can you say anything over, under on that number from where you sit and how much work needs to be done to get there? Can you give us anymore comfort that\u2019s actually a number you are going to hit or exceed or is this something that we are just going to have to wait and see?","Chip Blankenship","Yes. So nice to meet you over the phone at least, I am sorry to say that that\u2019s just something we are going to have to all wait on. I am not prepared to comment on the 2019 number. We are focused however on delivering on 2018. These numbers are something that were taken to harden the team is deployed on and we are prepared to deliver on.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And last thing I just want to make sure I understand on Slide 16 the negatives that you cited are those in order of increasing impact \u2013 I am sorry descending order, IGT\/Power is the biggest absolute impact on guide illustrates pricing as the second largest headwind except there as we move down that slide?","Chip Blankenship","Well, we didn\u2019t stack it that way Gautam by order of magnitude, but I think the bigger impacts will be the IGT, that business has just dried up for us unfortunately. And then the wide-body will impact the GRP business as we are seeing some reductions in selected platforms. And raw material cost we don\u2019t think it will be as significant as it was in 2017 as we just had a significant ramp especially in the aluminum price has gone up about 30%. There will be some raw material cost but not at the magnitude that we had in 2017.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.","Chip Blankenship","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global.","Josh Sullivan","Good morning. Good morning Chip.","Chip Blankenship","Good morning. Thank you.","Josh Sullivan","One on the automotive side, what\u2019s driving that growth, any share gains you can point to and then how do you serve that market going forward, can you continue to swat the assets here for additional capacity or continue to make some incremental investments at some point?","Chip Blankenship","I think I can handle that one, Josh. Automotive, it\u2019s just we are seeing the continued aluminization in the market. Fortunately, we are on four programs as we have mentioned in the past, but we are on about 58 other platforms in the portfolio right now. So, just the market in general, how we are positioned bodes well. We have given the commitment of $1.3 billion of revenue in 2018, which is about an 18% increase year-over-year. We still feel comfortable in that number and that\u2019s out internal view, but we look at Ducker a lot as well and they are just saying this is unprecedented growth in terms of automotive, I think it\u2019s simply been tracking it, it\u2019s the biggest increase that they have had. So, the market is good, our product is differentiated, we are on 58 different platforms and we feel comfortable that we can hit on our commitment.","Josh Sullivan","Okay, great. And then kind of a similar question on aerospace, Boeing exploring higher narrow body rates, would you need to step outside of your footprint to get above 57 on the 737?","Chip Blankenship","No, we are not above the footprint we have a pretty good network on engines that we have the right level of assets for sheet and plate to support that.","Josh Sullivan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Kramer with Morgan Stanley.","Jeff Kramer","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Hi, Chip. Just curious to how your view of the balance sheet fits into the overall strategy, I mean, obviously previously in your career it wasn\u2019t an issue for you, but different situation at Arconic is being investment grade a priority, how does the share repurchase program fits in that strategy and if you are interested in accelerating the transition to investment grade?","Chip Blankenship","So based on my background of being part of General Electric and then actually being part of a standup U.S. entity for higher where we did worry about all things balance sheet, I do have as a priority investment grade for a variety of reasons, risk averse and liquidity being among them. So those are my comments. I will transfer the rest of it over to Ken.","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, Chip and I are in violent agreement on that. If you look at our performance to ensure that we are investment grade. So as we have mentioned our net debt to EBITDA is decreased about 30% in 2017 to \u201816 we are right at about 2.5 times right now, which I think is healthy. We have also made a concerted effort around the pay down of debt, with \u2013 in last 2 years we have taken our interest expense down around 25% that had nothing to do with U.S. tax reform that\u2019s just part of our capital allocation strategy. And our liquidity remained strong in the portfolio, we have got about $6 billion of liquidity and we are comfortable within our covenants for the business. So, to answer investment grade is very important to us, we think our balance sheet is strong and our liquidity is good.","Jeff Kramer","Great, okay. And just as a follow-up, you are little bit north of $2 billion of cash right now, you have guided to about $500 million of free cash flow in \u201818, about $1 billion of that is accounted for between the debt reduction and the share repurchase program. So just you have about another $500 million to $1 billion of excess cash for allocation? Just how would you think about deploying that?","Ken Giacobbe","We\u2019re going to look at a bunch of different options. For that residual, you\u2019re correct, we normally need about $600 million to $700 million of operating cash to run the business. So we are working with Chip in terms of the alternative uses for that excess cash.","Jeff Kramer","Okay, thank you.","Chip Blankenship","Welcome.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue at this time.

My name is Nicole, and I will be your operator today. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Paul Luther","Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, and welcome to Arconic's fourth quarter 2019 and full year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined by John Plant, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will take your questions.","I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we've included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix in today's presentation.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.","John Plant","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call this morning. I have a lot of ground to cover today and I do recognize that we have lots of moving parts between the cost reductions, performance program, restructuring, after sales, the share count movement, aluminum metal assumptions, and then finally Boeing MAX, and I intend to provide as much visibility into these as possible.","I plan to cover the quarter and the full year performance and the results of these major priorities and then move on to discuss the approach that we've taken begin to the 2020 outlook.","Let's start on Slide 4. Today, we are announcing that we are targeting the separation to take effect on April 1. The majority of the work has been complete. We are on track with all separation steps. The planned operating date for the two future companies is next week, the first of February and the [indiscernible] into the two listed future public companies is April 1.","Regarding the strategic priorities including capital structure, capital allocation, and financial outlooks for the two future companies we are targeting an Investor Day on February 25 in New York for both companies.","Let's move on to Slide 5 to cover the fourth quarter results. The results were solid. We had record fourth quarter performance for operating income excluding special items and record operating margins and earnings per share. Operating income excluding special items was $444 million and the effective tax rate was 29.7%. This was an unusually high number for tax at the prior quarters and driven essentially by the geography of earnings.","In the quarter Engineered Products and Forgings year-over-year operating margin expanded 480 basis points, while GRP expanded by 370 basis points. Both EP&F and GRP demonstrated progression in year-over-year margin for every quarter this year and in EP&F sequential quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.53 up 61% year-over-year and at the maximum end of our guidance range. Earnings per share for the year was [indiscernible] at $2.11 and up 55% year-over-year.","Free cash flow was $870 million up 87% year-over-year and this exceeded the midpoint of guidance by $120 million and has made a very good improvement in free cash flow for Arconic from prior years and achieved a free cash flow conversion of 90% to net income. Please note that the free cash flow conversion guidance are provided for the two separate companies at the time of the last earnings call.","The year-end cash balance was $1.7 billion after 1.15 billion of share repurchases and the repayment [indiscernible] $400 million of convertible notes. The 1.15 billion of share repurchases included a fourth quarter market share repurchase of 1.6 million shares. For the year we repurchased approximately 55 million common shares at a weighted average price of $20.97. This leaves open [indiscernible] purchase authority of $350 million which will carry over into the future Howmet company if not utilized before separation.","Net debt to EBITDA was 1.81 times which was a record low and an improvement from fourth quarter 2018 which was 2.05 times. And lastly, [Arconic\u2019s] [ph] return on net assets improved year-over-year by 450 basis points to 13.7%, another record.","Now let me turn it over to Ken to provide a more detailed view of Q4 and the year.","Kenneth Giacobbe","Thank you, John. Now let's move to Slide 6 and financial results for the quarter. In the fourth quarter organic revenue was up $38 million year-over-year with EP&F up 2% and GRP flat. EP&F had 5% organic growth in aerospace which represents more than 70% of its revenue, while Commercial Transportation declined 8%. GRP was flat as industrial products had 21% organic growth, packaging 6% and aerospace 3%. These increases were offset by a decline in Automotive of 9% as the Ford F-150 is transitioning to the next generation model and we had lower volumes due to the GM strike.","Building and construction was down 8% due to softness in Europe and intentional exits of less profitable products. Operating income excluding special items for the fourth quarter is $444 million up 37% year-over-year. We delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of price increases with a $42 million favorable impact year-over-year. Price increases span across all segments driven by Aerospace, Industrial and Commercial Transportation and we expect favorable pricing to continue.","Weakness in our Automotive and Commercial Transportation markets unfavorably impacted operating income by $29 in the fourth quarter. Favorable raw material cost including aluminum price was a benefit to operating income of $34 million in the quarter. Similar to price, we had our fourth consecutive quarter of net cost reductions.","Net cost reductions were led by cost out program which generated $76 million of year-over-year benefit in the quarter. This was partially offset by higher variable compensation and equity costs which were driven by improved performance on profit, free cash flow and equity value. As expected, the transition of our Tennessee plant to more profitable industrial products showed year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter. The impact was $13 million. We have included the reconciliation of operating income excluding special items on Slide 35 of the appendix.","In the fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was a record at $728 million or $250 million more than the fourth quarter of last year. Please note, consistent with our guidance, we have excluded $2 million dollars of unfavorable cash flow in the quarter related to planned separation. Days working capital improved one day on a year-over-year basis to 43 days with the main driver being collections. The year-over-year cash improvement was $103 million.","Pension contributions and OPEB payments were $69 million in the quarter, which was $38 million more than the fourth quarter of 2018. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $167 million, which was down $104 million on a year-over-year basis. Diluted earnings per share excluding special items was $0.53 per share and 61% higher than the comparable period. The higher diluted earnings per share were primarily driven by operational improvements of $0.13, lower share counts of $0.05 and lower raw material costs of $0.05.","Now let's move to the year-over-year margin expansion on Slide 7. In the fourth quarter Arconic's margin improved 380 basis points on a year-over-year basis while EP&F improved 480 basis points and GRP improved 370 basis points. It is noteworthy that the year-over-year margin expansion has improved each quarter in 2019. This improvement reflects the trajectory of ongoing operational improvements, improved pricing, and cost reductions.","Now let's move to the special items summary on Slide 8. In the fourth quarter our reported results included a net favorable impact of $75 million [ph] special items. The special items in the quarter primarily related to three items. First, we recorded a $94 million tax benefit related to a U.S. tax selection which caused the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary's assets into our U.S. tax parent. The second special item was a cash charge of $34 million associated with the planned separation. Third, we received $21 million in closing cash related to an earn-out associated with the Texarkana plant that was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018.","I would point out costs incurred in the quarter for legal and other advisory fees related to Grenfell Tower and the fire at our fasteners plant in France, but were largely offset by related proceeds. More details concerning special items for the quarter can be found on Slides 28, 29, and 35 appendixes. For the year, majority of the special items have been consistent with the stated plan of divesting assets or businesses that do not fit our focus, require significant capital investment with unacceptable returns or are not material to our bottom line. As you would expect, approximately a percent of the charges for the year were non-cash.","Now let's move to the segment results on Slide 9. In the fourth quarter EP&F's revenue was $1.7 billion, organic revenue was up 2%. Segment operating profit was a record for the quarter at $354 million up 32%. The increase in segment operating profit was driven by several favorable items including volume growth in Aerospace, higher pricing, lower raw material costs, and net cost reductions. The resulting segment operating margin expanded by 480 basis points year-over-year to 20.4%.","In the fourth quarter GRP's revenue was also $1.7 billion, organic revenue was flat year-over-year. Segment operating profit was a record for the fourth quarter at $150 million up 61%. The favorable year-over-year improvement in the segment operating profit was driven by favorable pricing in the Industrial and Commercial Transportation markets, lower aluminum prices, net cost reductions, and improvement in internal scrap utilization.","The Tennessee transition to Industrial Products helped offset the declines in Automotive and Commercial Transportation. Despite the challenges in aluminum extrusions and flat organic revenue growth, GRP's segment operating margin increased 370 basis points year-over-year to 9%.","Let's move to the fourth quarter key achievements on Slide 10. Our EP&F business had record fourth quarter revenue and segment operating profit on a year-over-year basis. Aerospace organic revenue was up 5%. Favorable pricing improvements in EP&F continued in the fourth quarter as we achieved $29 million in year-over-year price increases. For the year, price improvements in this segment were $78 million. Finally, in EP&F our expansion of the Aerospace rings and forged wheels capital expenditures are complete and ramping up in 2020.","Our GRP business had record fourth quarter segment operating profit. GRP's industrial revenue was up 20% organically year-over-year. Price improvements in Industrial Products and Commercial Transportations drove $13 million of year-over-year price increases. For the year price improvement in this segment were $75 million. GRP's internal scrap utilization improved 180 basis points versus the same quarter of last year. Arconic's full-year free cash flow of $870 million resulted in a free cash flow conversion of 90%. Return on net assets for the year was 13.7%, was 450 basis points year-over-year.","CapEx for the year was $579 million approximately 4% of revenue and was down $189 million year-over-year. Approximately 65% of the CapEx was spent on return seeking projects. A majority of our gross CapEx projects are now complete and we expect CapEx as a percent of revenue to be less than 4% in 2020. Our cash balance was approximately $1.7 billion after we repurchased $1.15 billion of outstanding shares and paid down approximately $400 million of debt.","Now, let's move to Slide 11 and the key financial results for the year. For the year organic revenue was up $894 million with both EP&F and GRP up 6%. EP&F had 8% organic growth in Aerospace and 4% growth in Commercial Transportation. GRP's organic revenue increase was driven by double-digit growth in Aerospace, Industrial Products and Packaging. Operating income excluding special items for the year was $1.8 billion up 29% year-over-year. Price increases were $153 million for the year and split almost equally across the segments.","Higher volumes also favorably impacted operating income by $80 million for the year, mainly driven by Aerospace. Lower raw material costs including aluminum price was favorable to operating income $99 million for the year. Net cost reductions were led by cost out [ph] program which generated approximately $213 million of year-over-year savings. This was partially offset by three items; our Tennessee plant, operational challenges at one of our aluminum extrusion plants, and higher compensation costs driven by improved performance.","Adjusted free cash flow in 2019 was $870 million or $405 million more than 2018. Pension contributions and OPEB payments were $345 million which was $33 million less than 2018. At year-end the pension and OPEB net liability was approximately $3.2 billion up approximately $200 million year-over-year as lower discount rates impacted the liability by approximately $900 million. U.S. pension asset returns were approximately 20% and these returns partially offset the impact of the lower discount rate.","Capital expenditures for the year were $579 million which were down $189 million compared to 2018 while making significant investment in aerospace airfoils, aerospace rings, forged wheels and industrial products. Diluted earnings per share excluding special items was $2.11 per share and 55% higher than 2018. The higher diluted earnings per share were primarily driven by operational improvements of $0.47 lower raw material costs of $0.15 and lower share count of $0.12.","Before turning it back over to John, let me briefly provide an update on our capital structure which is on Slide 19 in the appendix. We finished the year with approximately $1.7 billion of cash after executing the $1.15 billion of share repurchases and reducing debt by \u20ac400 million. Gross debt is approximately $5.9 billion and net debt stands at $4.2 billion. Net debt to EBITDA continues to improve year-over-year despite the cash outflow associated with the share repurchases. Net debt to EBITDA stands at 1.81 times which is an improvement of 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.","With that, I will turn it back over to John.","John Plant","Thanks ken and let's move to Slide 12 where I will give you the results of the key focus items. Price increases for the year were $153 million and we saw good progress at both EP&F and GRP. Operating cost reductions were $230 million for the year and ahead of our annual commitment of $180 million. The annual run rate operating costs are projected to be reduced by $300 million which is a full $100 million higher than our original commitment.","As a result of the share repurchases which are detailed on the slide, year-end diluted common stock share count was $440 million down 13% year-on-year. Capital expenditure was $579 million excluding $7 million associated with separation. CapEx was approximately 4% of revenue. The major focus of our 2019 capital expenditures was the expansion of airfoils and rings capacity in the engines business; the European wheels expansion and the Tennessee industrial expansion in rolled products.","Annual divestiture proceeds of approximately $190 million are expected to exceed the operating and CapEx cash costs of separation. Divestitures signed or closed will reduce annual revenue by approximately $350 million with limited operating income impact. Two previously announced transactions will close in the first quarter of 2020 with proceeds of approximately $100 million.","Now, let me move to separation. We are targeting separation for April 1. We filed an amendment to the Form 10 on the 22nd of January where we providing even greater visibility to management, capital structure and pension allocation. The next step is the financing of Arconic Corp to spin entity. This financing commences today and is planned for completion by February 10. The Form 10 is planned to be made effective by mid February.","The planned operating date for the two companies is February 1, where everything will be done by the two entities and legal separation into the two listed future public companies on April 1. This will have accomplished a rapid execution of separation from the time that I announced the plan upon taking the CEO role in February 2019. One last, but very important item on separation is related to pension plans. The separation does not trigger any incremental cash contributions.","Let's move to Slide 13. As you know, this earnings call precedes the Boeing call which while is not ideal is important in effecting the separation timing and the debt financing starting this afternoon. We have had many exchanges with Boeing during late December and every week throughout January and hence have a reasonable feel for their current plans in 2020. Naturally, I will not provide any details of those conversations except to guide the Arconic numbers.","Today, I will provide Q1 earnings per share guidance numbers plus a view of revenue and free cash flow for Arconic. At our February Investor Day I will provide additional insight into how much Aerospace our new Arconic Corp which naturally will be of more interest going forward. The split as they did is set for April 1 and hence by achieving this early timing we will be able to see three clean quarters in 2020.","Now let me turn to the specific numbers, but noting firstly, that given the uncertainty to that which Boeing will exactly announce and their future increase in production plans, this causes me to provide a wider bandwidth of guidance than would be normal. Revenue is targeted to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.2 billion with organic growth in the range of 1% to 3%. Aerospace revenue is expected to increase year-over-year when we exclude the Boeing 737 MAX situation. If we were to include the impacts of the 737 MAX Aerospace revenue is expected to be flat year-over-year.","We expect continued Airspace price increases in 2020 and growth year-over-year in Industrial Products driven by the transition of our Tennessee plant into more profitable Industrial Products. Commercial Transportation is expected to experience headwinds in 2020 driven by slowing manufacturing and freight growth, lower new truck orders and the increased current inventory levels. We are targeting to mitigate those margin impacts for our forged wheels business by gaining market share supported by our differentiated lighter weight products.","We continue to penetrate steel wheel market with aluminum wheels. Moreover our low-cost manufacturing wheels expansion in Hungary is now fully operational and we will leverage our global footprint. The global rolled parts business will mitigate Commercial Transportation headwinds with cost reduction actions. Earnings per share, excluding special items, is expected to be in the range of $2.22 to $2.42 per share.","At the midpoint year-over-year growth is approximately 10% including our current view of the impacts of the 737 MAX. Year-over-year growth in earnings per share will be driven by run rate cost reductions action in 2019, as well as incremental cost reductions in 2020 plus the continued price increases. Earnings per share for the first quarter is expected to be $0.47 to $0.53 which is an increase of approximately 16% year-over-year at the midpoint.","Adjusted free cash flow forecast is to be between $800 and $900 million driven by earnings, capital expenditures of less than 4% of revenue and favorable year-over-year restructuring payments. Pension and OPEB cash contributions are expected to be approximately $220 million higher than in 2019, driven by the drop in the discount rates.","Free cash flow conversion is expected to be 80% with greater detail to be provided at Investor Day on February 25th. Finally, regarding Grenfell, there has been no activity this quarter, and nothing has changed regarding our stance towards the matter, nor our view of the expected outcomes of the litigation, nor liability.","And with that, I'd like to open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.","David Strauss","Thanks, good morning.","John Plant","Hey, David.","David Strauss","John, I want to - I want to follow up on the MAX. So I understand you're not going to talk about exactly what you've assumed, but can you help us at all on what your ship-set content is, it looks like it's maybe around $2 million and what kind of detrimental margins would you expect to see on lower volumes there?","John Plant","Those are the, probably the questions which I'm unwilling to provide answers on. I've always been reluctant and in fact on any earnings calls, I've never provided ship-set values. And I've read - I'll say guestimates in analyst reports, which I'd say probably aren't too far, but I don't really want to give specificity of what the ship-set value and what the margins are by any aircraft, because the next question will follow. It will be, well the next aircraft and the next aircraft and I feel disinclined to do that at this point.","What I would say to you is our assumption is we've got about a $400 million revenue hit plus or minus for the MAX. I've tried to take a fairly conservative view to guidance, especially in the light of \u2013 it's only when we actually know what the Boeing published position is, that I think we can be - have that greater certainty. And then, how we address cost structures. We've made assumptions and in particular of importance to us is, what will be the profile exactly of the future Boeing build both in 2020 and really importantly in 2021, because the - while it's I'm going to say relatively easy to shed labor, getting the sort of skills back given the \u2013 I'll say very high employment level in the U.S.. I mean those are all things which are really important for us to consider. And so you've got to see the whole thing and then also how the Boeing position itself evolves over time.","I mean what we've seen as you know, over the last six or nine months is fairly what has resulted in fairly optimistic assumptions and we see many changes to those and now we're in a situation where the production is currently halted with a view to restart and what's now viewed as a fairly conservative assumption regarding when the FAA will release the aircraft and according to statements made in the last week by the Chairman of the FAA.","So I mean, what I'll say is that it's pretty confusing and when we have that greater clarity and I tend to be in the optimistic camp that at some point, the aircraft production may rise above what we think it is and therefore, we need to be prepared for that. And how we manage labor is critical to it, what the carrying cost of that is and what we've built into the assumptions and that's why guidance itself is - it is particularly difficult at this point in time.","But neither I've given you something that I don't feel confident in our ability to achieve and I did call out the fact that provided a little bit wider guidance than normal to take account of some of this uncertainty and clearly we're going to be updating you as we go through the year.","We're going to give you further updates hopefully on the Investor Day on February 25th, and is the - I'll say the clarity emerges and I\u2019ve tried to give you color of how we've approached this whole situation. And the fact that we are having to come out really a little bit earlier than normal just to effect the financing that we are in the market for starting this afternoon and labeling that I\u2019ll say debt raise to occur to meet the separation timing.","So all these things are pretty much interlinked and I guess, preferably have been a week or two later, but the most important thing for the company was to achieve I believe the earliest possible separation timing. So hopefully that gives you a pretty wide view of where we've been thinking on this and how we have approached it, David.","David Strauss","Yes. That's helpful. Thanks, John. And as a followup, it looks like based on your guidance, your EPS guidance, you're assuming EBIT and EBITDA relatively flat at the midpoint, maybe up a little bit? Can you just help us with the walk there, obviously you have the cost savings, and pricing, and Tennessee benefit, but what are some of the offsets that you've got baked into that? Thanks.","John Plant","Okay. Well, I'll start and then hand it across to Ken. I mean essentially compared to where we thought we would be for a start, then clearly the reduced production of the 737 is the most significant negative item. There is some reduction associated with the - I'll say the commercial transportation business and not just essentially the assumption of truck and trailer build, both in North America and in Europe.","I'll say on industrial fairly flat in terms of volume and so that gives you some guidance on how we think about the drags on our EBITDA development. And then countering that the cost reductions, both the ones we have currently and the ones that we're trying to continue with going forward and then there's - the price, which I've mentioned. So those are the major, I'll say bridges and with that, anything else you want to add to that Ken?","Kenneth Giacobbe","I think to your point, John, that 737 MAX is the biggest items. But we did enjoy a little bit of an aluminum tailwind in 2019 that won't repeat in 2020. So that's a bit unfavorable, and then an offset to that would be variable comp was higher in 2019 just driven by improved performance in the free cash flow. So you have a little bit of an offset there. But the 737 MAX is the biggest driver.","David Strauss","Great, thanks for the time.","John Plant","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to ask about the new - good morning, the new aerospace capacity coming online for airfoils and rings and sort of the timeline on which you expect that to be sort of qualified and profitably producing during 2020, and the degree to which any of that is kind of had been expected to be directed toward the MAX or not?","John Plant","Okay, the critical engine assets, which are in Whitehall, Morristown for say the casting and coal production and then as you know, we've invested 10,000 ton press for our rings business in California. The trials and the initial production has commenced for each of those assets and in fact for shipments occurred in December, LTE [ph] in small numbers. Those assets in particular, I'll say the airfoil assets will see significant increased production in the first half of 2020, and they were not in - those investments were not there solely for the LEAP engine. It's going to provide welcome capacity relief for many of the - for the airfoil ring programs that we have.","And so I see those assets coming on progressively during the year shipping increasing quantities in a quarter by quarter, by the time we get to the exit rate of the end of the year, I'll say everything will be I think running, I expect to be running at a very high capacity utilization, but still leaving something left for 2021 as we also increase our NOL productivity program Seth.","Seth Seifman","Great. Thank you.","Kenneth Giacobbe","So I just see them as critical not just I'll say strategically important investments, but we're actually going to make big contributions to the bottom line as well in the year.","Seth Seifman","Great. And then as a followup just a similar question on the rolling side and Tennessee, when we think about what on the can sheet side what that facility was doing a few years ago. I think about kind of where things might ramp up to from here and now that we're kind of closer to it and in positive territory, is there any way to kind of size, the impact that new capacity will have either in 2021 or sorry in 2020 or beyond.","John Plant","I -- first of all, I do welcome the I'll say the sequential improvement in those Tennessee industrial assets during the course of 2019. I see that continuing in 2020. You'll recall from the previous commentary that the major impact of that is in the second half of 2020, when the majority of those assets will be brought on stream. I'm not saying, there won't be improvements along the way because there will be, but in the second half is when we begin to deliver in quantity.","That industrial production for which we've contracted with distributors and I'm going to look to Ken because I've got so many numbers here in my mind, I'm thinking it's capacity of 300 million pounds, but with about 100 million coming on in 2020 with the back-end being the most of the year - the most important part of that. And clearly, then the run rate into 2021 is highly beneficial.","Seth Seifman","Great, thank you very much.","John Plant","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, John, Ken.","John Plant","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland","John, just to expand a little bit on the - just in principle, how you're planning on managing the production capacity and the staffing? I mean, you hinted at, it's hard to put labor back on after you take it off, but it sounds like you're going to staff in 2020 your plan to staff or resource those facilities in a way that has some stranded costs, but you're doing that purposefully for 2021 is that fair?","John Plant","Yes, it's, it's the current way we're thinking about it. We're flexing, obviously, clearly deleting over time, we are looking at other means of trying to contain that labor, whether it's -- by, I'm going to say some maybe partially paid vacation. We're looking at shift patterns and also my expectation is that we will actually be reducing headcounts as well. The most difficult decisions that I see coming up are going to be as we move into the middle of the year and when we have a greater clarity, regarding the production what indeed Boeing themselves have greater clarity regarding production, and I've commented that because we have seen a lot of noise and different assumptions and then critical to that decision, the final decision of how much we're going to flex labor both the direct and indirect labor and all cost structure is going to be a view of 2021.","And if we feel as though, and if we are clear, that the production is going to become much more healthy in '21 and potentially with upside then that's going to -- that's going to effects and color our views upon our willingness to hold labor or not. And if we're not thinking positively, then we're going to -- I'm going to call die for the floor and just got the cost structure as necessary because that's what we should do as good custodians of shareholders money. But now I'd say it's a very balanced approach, trying to be as responsible and responsive as possible, while protecting the future because I am say personally I'm optimistic, even though we're not planning, we are not assuming that in our guidance.","Carter Copeland","Okay. It makes perfect sense. And then as a follow-up, just when you think about the offset embedded in the $400 million worth of growth to offset the $400 million headwind. How should we think about the biggest contributors to that given what's happening on the 787 and the A380 and what not -- where can you give us a sense of where the lion's share of that growth is coming from?","John Plant","Yes, the bright spot, because as you say, you can take through the assumptions, like what 787 and we've all seen I'll say recent rumor about whether that would be further cut or not and there is no certainty around that. We know is the 777X-es, is a first flight and where does that go, and then we have the 737 really also is a big decision. Obviously Airbus a brighter spot and then defense, I mean that is really been a bright spot for us.","And in fact in the fourth quarter, sales into defense sector were up 27%. And we see that as a very strong bright spot for us in 2020 particularly around the F-35 and increasing our levels of quick deliveries for that aircraft and engine program.","Carter Copeland","Great, thanks for the color, John.","John Plant","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna","Thanks, John and Ken. I have a couple of questions, first, I was wondering on the 737 I know you can't speak to specifics on a rate. But can you talk about differences between the engine side and the structure side and how different your assumptions are for each, just giving us the delta you've given that in the past?","John Plant","Yes. In the early part of the year, I'm thinking that the opportunity that we have -- I'll say in discussion with GE around the ability to bring forward and build some of the spare engines is going to be important, but it's pushing their production and our production to have a smoother approach to this because, while it's difficult to move production up and down on let's call it the structural side of the aircraft, but on the engine side, you flex up and down at your peril.","And if we were to cut that and then try to rebuild it back to a number of 42 or 52 or 57, then that will become almost impossible, not just for Arconic, but for the whole of the industry. So that does not flex. This is a matter of production. I will say difficulty and complexity that doesn\u2019t flex anything like the structural side even though not side of difficult.","And therefore what we are thinking about is, with, I'll say, some of the spares clearance and building spare engines, which I believe is being considered and planned, that should help smooth the year and in particular provide the ability to move engine production back up again as we move into 2021. But again, it's cloudy. I wish it were - we had greater clarity of what exactly those builds will be for the next 24 months and beyond, but yes we don't so we do \u2013 living in this world that we inhabit and so at the moment obviously we\u2019ve been cushioning it both ourselves and within GE and then seeing how we can manage the overall production both with a view of both of the material inputs for these specialty metals and also the critical skills that we have in that business.","Gautam Khanna","That makes sense. Has there been any discussion around cash terms on the shipments you make in the interim or were at lower rate with GE or the structural guys, I know GE put lot of cash right now on the 37, I'm wondering if that's flowing down to you guys.","John Plant","We've had no discussions with GE on that. When we \u2013 we get paid after we ship after certain time of course and there has been no dialogue around that at all.","Gautam Khanna","Okay and last one on the guidance, you did mention you're expecting to offset some of the commercial transport downturn with share gain. Can you put a finer point on what is embedded in your expectation for the decline and commercial transport sales at EP&F?","John Plant","Okay. Again due to memory I look at Ken for affirmation, I'm thinking that we have around about 75 million plus or minus 20 baked into our year-on-year assumptions for revenue. And then how it -- how it transpires in the bottom line is all to do with cost management is in new capacity and how successful we are in terms of both the share gain into - against steel and also the ability to influence fleet managers to take the new opportunity of even further light weighted wheels. So we are actively working at, trying to, I'll say maximize our sales while not deteriorating margins of the business.","Kenneth Giacobbe","Yeah. One thing that's going to help us out a lot is the K\u00f6f\u00e9m Hungary plant expansion that came online at the latter part of '19 rolling into this year, cost structure is much more favorable there. So that combination like John said, penetration of steel wheels. So if you look at all the wheels right now across the globe, only 19% of them approximately are aluminum.","So there is an opportunity there and we think we have a differentiated process, but team has a bunch of triggering events here depending on how fickle that market could be. So there's triggers already bundled up ready to go if we have to take more cost out of the business.","Gautam Khanna","Thanks guys.","John Plant","Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Korn","Hey, good morning everyone, thanks for taking my questions. First a question for Ken, I just want to confirm in your guidance for free cash flow, should we assume that excludes any of these expected divestments that you're incorporating over the first half of the year? And then secondly on that, I'm looking over at your - at the separation cost expenses outlined in the bottom of Page 12, how much of these should actually be full cash drags over 2020? Like for example, is this $130 million, $160 million expense? Is that a fiscal year '20 number only? Does that exclude any cost over the last quarter? Any clarity there would be great.","Kenneth Giacobbe","Yes. So the divestitures Matt are excluded from the cash calculation. If you look at the cash drag on separation, about $50 million of that was hitting in '19 and the rest of it will hit in 2021 in the first quarter.","Matthew Korn","Got it. Great, I appreciate that. Second thing regarding some of the end markets, expectations into 2020, particularly for Automotive and Building and Construction, you mentioned and highlighted the state of the four transitions, what's your expectations for autos overall? Are there any tailwinds into Europe into the spring that you're seeing, particularly on the Building and Construction side?","John Plant","So for BCS we're assuming roughly in line with GDP and we've taken our lumps now in terms of moving out of some of that low-margin business that we talked about and therefore, that gives you a picture for BCS. So, I would say, small growth in 2020 with the overall, an improved margin given the actions that we took during the course of last year and we've more than achieved the basis points improvement in margin that I talked about on previous calls, I think it was Q2 when I called that out.","In terms of order, it's difficult to gain anything if I called it out of $17 million, but North America as an example, you wouldn't gain much from that, you need to look more, be more specific in terms of what the underlying trends are of let's say truck versus parts car and you know as we are mainly aimed at the SUV and pickup truck markets.","And in fact, the really I'll say notable changes in 2020 is, one is less of a drag from the four changeover, less of a drag because hopefully well as the areas I can't think any reason why that would be another strike at GM and as the contract is all done, and it's a multi-year contract. So that's behind us.","And then, as you may recall from previous commentary, we were successful in increasing our business with a major U.S. OEM coming on stream in the middle of the year. I don't think we have called the name out, so I won\u2019t this morning. But that business comes on stream around about the sort of late May, June time ready for the next model year of a major SUV and pickup truck introduction. So that gives you a picture of how we think about automotive. So fairly, I'm going to say -- I would say fairly good outlook for that as it pertains to Arconic Corp in 2020.","Matthew Korn","All right, it sounds like it. Thanks very much.","John Plant","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Martin Englert with Jefferies.","Martin Englert","Hi, good morning everyone.","John Plant","Hi Martin, good morning.","Martin Englert","Can you provide a little bit more detail or maybe help us understand the lead times as it relates to your products and the airframe side and the engine side, specifically kind of how far ahead does this demand pull come for you when you look at units being built by the major commercial aero OEMs.","John Plant","But it's quite different by each of the - each of the products. So when we think about that reduction that was applied to 787 from I think it was 40-ish ach aircraft per month down the 12, I think that was just taking effect towards the end of 2020. So in terms of the impact on parts of the business it is in the \u2013 mainly starts in the first quarter of 2020. So there is a let's say at least nine months lead time on those sort of let's say more structurally based parts.","For engine, again it's in months of probably ultimately longer than the structural side, but those builds they change for the end of this year, then we will see the impacts of that in the first half of 2020. So it's a long lead times, both for our own - I'll say scheduling, getting material availability, and then the whole processing into an aircraft build, an engine build.","Martin Englert","Okay.","John Plant","I think the nine months plus or minus and mainly plus.","Martin Englert","Okay. And then the same would hold true for aero heat-treat plate on the aero structure side?","John Plant","Yes.","Martin Englert","Okay. And if I could, one last one here, can you discuss potential\u2026","John Plant","It takes a long time to get pulled in, but obviously it can be cut off much more quickly, like don't deliver.","Martin Englert","Okay, understood. And if I could, one last one, can you discuss the potential positive implications from increased metals content post USMCA plus the recent revisions on Section 232 on the 232 side, wherein it is going to include more downstream aluminum products like body stampings in autos.","John Plant","We saw the announcement this weekend. Regarding that inclusions for additional as secondary products and obviously as a producer of those parts and some of the metals guidance policy it's a welcome move because it's been very clear to us is that the effectiveness of some of those protections for the common alloy trade case in particular didn't really have the desired effects that was expected.","I mean, it had a short-term impact, but then not only were other the countries importing into the U.S., but it appears that some of those metals in terms of secondary parts has also been able to find its way into the U.S. So, natural fact the total North American aluminum production was actually negatively impacted and I think the current administration is trying to deal with some of that.","And so we've seen this. What we don't yet have is the listing of what those products are and therefore, it's really difficult today to give you clarity over what additional tonnage that may result in for the rolled and extruded business in the U.S. It's something that we've obviously noted, hasn't been part of the thought process for the guidance today. We've \u2013 hopefully it has a positive impact, but to quantify it right now is just not possible.","Martin Englert","Okay. I appreciate all the color there. And congratulations on the execution and progress with the separation over the past year.","John Plant","Thank you very much. I guess, I should apologize to everybody for my voice today. It's got a thicker tone than normal, must be the cold.","Operator","And we do have time for one additional question. This question will come from the line of Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse.","Curtis Woodworth","Hey, good morning.","John Plant","Hi Curt.","Curtis Woodworth","So the $400 million negative impact from the MAX, is that a gross or a net number, i.e., I assume you can offset some of the MAX issues by pivoting more capacity into Airbus or defense and then could you just comment on the cadence of that revenue impact you assume a much higher weighting of the revenue hit first half of the year versus second half?","John Plant","First of all, it is the gross number. It's not really very easy Curt for us to suddenly flip and say oh let's go and make a few more Airbus parts, it doesn't really work like that. The constraints around tooling and then I'll say specific specialty alloy requirements is such that you don't sell while we're making less of these and then so we can flip it up and make more of those. We do see Airbus trying to make more. We see the desire to build more engines and that will be great.","And that will be also for the Geared Turbofan, but we know that some of the issues there, which we can read about recently in India. So it isn't to say that capacity is fungible. You move it to somewhere else. It doesn't work like that.","Clearly, if it's a rolled sheet and I would say, but the aircraft itself is constrained by many other factors. So it just doesn't -- You can't say it's a $400 million, but that's now is going, offset by a $100 million or so we can go sell elsewhere. So hopefully that gives you that one. And what was the second part of your question?","Curtis Woodworth","Just the cadence of the $400 million given comments from the FAA and others that it's probably more like a mid-year selling ramped would it be safe to say that the majority of the revenue impact would be in the first part of the year. Or how are you thinking?","John Plant","I think it's going to again, I'm going to say you probably what this just sounds like a pretty unacceptable answer in that it's going to be pretty cloudy at noon because one thing is for sure, we know that the Boeing announcement about cessation of production. And then, I'm not going to comment on which months they said that they will recommence, because that's not for me to talk about on this call and then neither about the rate.","So if you think about it in a strictly logical sense, it would be obviously more impact in the first half of the year just because when they are not producing any, it is going to have a bigger impact when if the assumption, maybe the building certain quantity in the back end of the year.","At the same time, that may be smooth a little bit by the willingness or not of we wouldn't - it is to carry inventory, particularly by Boeing themselves. And so, we are in those \u2013 in a dialogue at the moment to try to see what how it flows exactly from the aircraft and what part of inventory management take into account of all this to again, all with a view to trying to help the labor management situation that I've talked about which is really the - probably the most complicated part of is in trying to come up with the right judgment and then with my comment, which I provided early, which was the critical thing is going to be how we see the exit rate for the year and what will be the 2021 production.","So, this also is a lot of things to consider. It's not just the strictly aircraft builds plus say the company no-build situation to hinder inventory management and labor management in all of this affecting both top and bottom line and each profile during the course of the year.","Curtis Woodworth","Yes, now, that makes sense. And then just one quick one on, it seems like at Tennessee, you still have at least 100 million pounds of capacity or more there, can you talk about your plan to fill that? And are you having any discussions with beverage can sheet suppliers, because it seems like there is a real clear emerging deficit in terms of what's going on, on the aluminum can side in the U.S. Thanks very much.","John Plant","Okay. We've had no discussions with any canning manufacturers at this point in time. In fact we\u2019ve precluded from doing so by the agreement with Alcoa [ph] through the third quarter of 2020. What we do note is the continued movements, let's say, particularly from the anti-plastic movement and which I think is going to be a net beneficiary to both glass bottle and to aluminum can.","And therefore with the capacity, which has been taken out of the North American markets by ourselves and others, then that might result in a position in the future, which might be interesting. But currently, but we're not - we're not participating in discussions with them about it. So, the assumption for this year is all about the industrial market not beverage can.","Curtis Woodworth","So then, thank you very much.","John Plant","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for participating and you may now disconnect."],"2842":["Arconic Inc (NYSE:ARNC) Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call April 25, 2017  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Patricia Figueroa - Vice President, Investor Relations","David Hess - Interim Chief Executive Officer","Ken Giacobbe - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company","Seth Seifman - JPMorgan","Curt Woodworth - Credit Suisse","Josh Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities","Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities","Rob Norwood - Goldman Sachs","Howard Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2017 Arconic Earnings Conference Call. My name is Doris and I will be your conference operator for today. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Patricia Figueroa, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Patricia Figueroa","Thank you, Doris. Good afternoon and welcome to Arconic\u2019s first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. I\u2019m joined by David Hess, Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by David and Ken, we will take your questions.","As a reminder, today\u2019s call is about our quarterly results and not the proxy context. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please focus on the quarterly results and business performance.","I would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today\u2019s presentations and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings.","In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release and in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation. Any reference in our discussion today to historical EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA, for which we have provided calculations and reconciliations in the appendix.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David.","David Hess","Thank you, Patricia. Good evening, everyone. One additional disclaimer. I have a bit of a cold, but I\u2019ll try to make myself clearly heard. Before Ken and I take you through the numbers, I want to briefly address last week\u2019s leadership announcement.","As you know, on April 17, I was named Interim CEO, while I continue to serve as a Member of the Board of Directors. Pat Russo who has been Arconic\u2019s lead director has agreed to serve as the Board\u2019s Interim Chair.","I joined the Arconic Board in March, and I\u2019m honored that I have been asked by my fellow directors to serve in this role, where the Board conducts a search for a permanent CEO. I expect to be able to leverage my 38-plus-years of executive leadership roles at UTC\u2019s Aerospace and Industrial businesses, including serving as President of both Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand at different points in my career.","In a short time that I\u2019ve been a member of Arconic\u2019s Board, I have come to be extremely impressed by the Board\u2019s level of expertise and knowledge there, heavy level of engagement, and strong commitment to meeting the expectations of our shareholders, customers and employees. And I\u2019m looking forward to continuing to work closely with the Board, the senior leadership team, and Arconic\u2019s dedicated and hard working employees to deliver on the plan it was created by the Arconic\u2019s senior leadership team in concert with the Board.","Arconic is a great company, built for the future, and built to create shareholder value and I\u2019m excited to be able to lead it through a challenging period as we conduct a permanent CEO search.","Now, as you can imagine, selecting the company\u2019s CEO is one of the most important responsibilities of the Board, and the Board has committed to taking whatever time is needed to select the perfect candidate with the right experience and capabilities to lead Arconic into the future. In the meantime, my focus will be on continuing to meet, or exceed the expectations of our customers and shareholders, and seamlessly deliver on our targets.","So enough about the future, let\u2019s talk about Q1 and full-year. Compared to prior year, revenue was up 4.5%, driven by volume and 8% when you normalize for the Tennessee packaging business. Arconic EBITDA was up 8% and a 11% on an adjusted basis, excluding special items. We had 90 basis points of margin expansion with help from strong net cost reduction of 1.9% of revenues, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.6 billion.","In summary, we had a great quarter, even stronger they have anticipated as we benefited from a number of items that we do not expect or repeat going forward in 2017. These items include a higher royalty payment in our GRP segment of $7 million, which will recur in the first quarter of 2018 and 2019 as well, and higher than anticipated contribution from Tennessee packaging. And as you know, we\u2019re ramping down our Tennessee packaging operations and we will start to see that effect in Q2.","Now, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Ken, so he can take you through the numbers in more detail.","Ken Giacobbe","Thank you, David. Similar to last quarter, I will move rather quickly through the financial slides in order to leave more time for questions. We have several slides in the appendix, which will provide additional details if you need them.","Now, let\u2019s move to Slide 6 for the financial overview. As David mentioned, revenue for the first quarter came in at $3.2 billion, up 4.5% year-over-year, driven by volume gains across all segments. The impact of higher metal prices in the quarter of $82 million was more than offset by the ramp down of our less profitable Tennessee packaging business of $96 million. Excluding Tennessee packaging, revenue would have been up 8% year-over-year.","We have previously announced our plan to exit the low margin North American packaging business in Tennessee by the end of 2018. Combined segment EBITDA margin was 17.2%, up 10 basis points year-over-year, as combined segment EBITDA increased 5% year-over-year. Arconic\u2019s EBITDA margin, excluding special items was 15.2%, up 90 basis points, as Arconic\u2019s EBITDA increased 11% on a year-over-year basis.","Our capital efficiency measure RONA, which is return on net assets was 8.9% on an annualized basis for the first quarter. This result puts us on track for a full-year target of 9%. Gross debt was flat at $8.1 billion and cash ended the year with a strong \u2013 ended the quarter with a strong balance of $2.6 billion, as we monetized approximately 64% of our Alcoa Corporation stake for $888 million.","Net debt to adjusted EBITDA finished at 3.2 times, excluding the favorable impact of our remaining Alcoa Corporation stake valued at approximately $400 million. Free cash flow was negative $403 million, driven by our normal working capital build in Q1 and semiannual interest payments.","Now, let\u2019s take a look \u2013 closer look into the financial starting with the income statement on Slide 7. We\u2019ve talked about revenue, so let me cover a couple of other key areas. As discussed, overhead spending is a key focus area for Arconic. In the first quarter, SG&A was impacted for the last time by separation costs of $18 million pre-tax, that was also impacted by proxy, advisory and government \u2013 governance-related costs of $16 million pre-tax.","Excluding these impacts, our SG&A as a percentage of sales was 5.9% for the quarter. EBITDA for the first quarter was $451 million. If we exclude separation cost and proxy, advisory, and governance-related costs, as mentioned above, EBITDA was $485 million. The other income line includes $351 million pre-tax gain on our several of the Alcoa Corporation shares, as previously discussed.","The restructuring line includes $60 million charge related to the sale of the Fusina rolling mill, as well as additional headcount reductions across all segments, including corporate. These reductions are part of our plan to reduce corporate overhead by $45 million in 2017. Approximately, 74% of these costs are non-cash.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.5% was \u2013 which was right in the midpoint of our guidance of 32% to 35%. The operational tax rate for the quarter was 29.9%. Net income was $322 million, or $0.65 a share. If we exclude special items, income was $169 million, or $0.33 per share.","On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see the special items for the quarter were a $153 million after-tax. I\u2019ve already discussed the first four special items listed, and I will note the amounts listed are pre-tax. The last item associated with taxes includes not only the impact of the tax for the first four special items, but also includes a $7 million favorable discrete tax item for the quarter.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the cash flow statement. Cash used for operations was negative $300 million in the first quarter. This result was driven by the normal first quarter working capital build in semi-annual interest payments. Cash used for finance activity was negative $43 million, primarily due to dividends.","Cash from investing activities was more than $1 billion positive for the first quarter, driven by the $888 million proceeds from the monetization of our 64% share in Alcoa Corporation, as well as $238 million in proceeds from the sale of Alcoa Corporation\u2019s Yadkin North Carolina Hydroelectric plant. Free cash flow was negative $403 million, as capital expenditures were $103 million in the first quarter.","Finally, as I mentioned before, we ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash on hand, which puts us in a good position as we look to reduce debt by $1 billion by the end of the second quarter of this year.","Now, let\u2019s move to segment performance starting with EP&S. To avoid any confusion with earnings per share, I will refer to engineered products and solutions as EP&S. Revenue increased 2% versus the prior year quarter. Strong growth in aero engines up 9% and aero frames up 3% was primarily offset by IGT, which was down 5% and commercial transportation down a 11%.","EBITDA of $306 million for the quarter was flat on a year-over-year basis. EBITDA margin decreased by 40 basis points to 20.6%. Volume was strong for the quarter and net cost savings excluding a ramp-up costs more than offset price declines. Mix was unfavorable with an aerospace and we had increases in our aerospace ramp-up costs. I said previously, we have detailed bridges in the appendix to help with the bridging for you.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at the GRP segment. In the first quarter, GRP improved its EBITDA by 10% and its EBITDA margin by 60 basis points, driven by automotive growth and net cost savings, which included strong Tennessee packaging performance.","Revenue was up 5% to the first quarter of 2016, as higher automotive shipments of 43% and higher royalty revenues that David mentioned of $7 million are partially offset by the ramp down of the Tennessee packaging business, airframe destocking, lower aero wide build rates, and the North America heavy duty truck demand. And lastly, some pricing pressures in our regional specialty markets. Excluding the impact of Tennessee packaging, revenue would have been up 16% in the GRP business.","EBITDA of $171 million for the quarter was up 10%, while EBITDA margin improved by 60 basis points to 13.7%. The year-over-year improvements by volume growth and automotive shipments, net cost savings of 2.9%, including the strong performance of the packaging business more than offset the pricing pressures in our regional specialty markets and our unfavorable mix in aerospace and commercial transportation. As noted earlier, we completed a divestiture of our rolling mill in Fusina, Italy this quarter.","Finally, let\u2019s move to the TCS segment. In the first quarter, TCS improved EBITDA by 13% and its EBITDA margin by a 110 basis points, driven by volume and net cost savings. Revenue was up 5% versus prior year quarter, driven by strength in global non-residential construction. We also saw a growth in European and Asian heavy duty truck markets though this was tempered by continued softness in the North America heavy duty truck market.","EBITDA of $72 million for the quarter was up 13%. EBITDA margin improved to 110 basis points year-over-year to 16%. Volumes were stronger and net cost savings of 2.7% more than offset pricing pressures in the heavy duty truck market.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at SG&A in a little bit more detail. As I\u2019ve mentioned previously, we remain committed to reducing our overhead spend. Excluding special items, SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 5.9% for the quarter. This level of spend compares favorably to our peer groups, namely the S&P 500 Industrial Index of 12% and the S&P 500 Aerospace and Defense Index of 10%.","Despite the favorable comparison to external benchmarks, we\u2019re constantly looking for ways to reduce overhead and have taken additional steps in the quarter, as I\u2019ve mentioned above. We\u2019re targeting to reduce SG&A to 5.6% of revenue for the full-year of 2017. Moreover, we are accelerating corporate overhead reductions to be at 1% of revenue by the end of 2017.","Now, let\u2019s take a moment to quickly review the sale of a portion of our retained interest in Alcoa Corporation. On February 14, we monetized approximately 64% of our retained interest in Alcoa Corp. for more than 23 million shares. The shares were sold at 38.03 per share, which resulted in $888 million in proceeds. The sale generated a pre-tax gain of $351 million than after-tax gain of $238 million. This transaction was the biggest driver of the increasing cash for the quarter and provided the financial flexibility to pursue debt reduction in the second quarter.","We still hold approximately 13 million shares worth around $400 million. We will continue to evaluate the best option to responsibly monetize our remaining stake in Alcoa Corporation.","Now, let me turn it back over to David to wrap thing ups \u2013 things up and then we\u2019ll take your questions.","David Hess","Thank you, Ken. So we had a very strong Q1 and we are on track to deliver the full-year guidance. Looking forward at the full-year, we\u2019re expecting to see continued full year-over-year growth in commercial aero engines, auto sheets, and North American non-residential construction and strong net cost reduction savings more than offsetting pricing pressures.","Going the other way, we expect headwinds from continued destocking in airframes, continued wide body build rate declines, tire aero engine ramp up cost that should decrease on a relative basis in the back-half of the year, and weaker demand in IGT. So looking at all the puts and takes, we are confident in delivering on the full-year targets and are reaffirming full-year guidance for Arconic of revenues in the range of a $11.8 billion to $12.4 billion, with EBITDA margin of approximately 15%, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA year-over-year growth in the range of mid to high single digits.","Thank you. And now Ken and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, guys. Good evening, I should say.","David Hess","Hello, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Just one quick one Dave. I wonder what feedback you may have had in the short amount of time since the announcement you\u2019ve had from customers \u2013 OEM customers on the aerospace side.","And I wondered, the second question, if you might share with us, when you got a bit of a different perspective on the destock as a customer than as a supplier, when does that find a bottom? What do you see in terms of the trends there? Clearly, it\u2019s something being talked about in the supply chain so far in the quarterly results. Can you help us with some color on thinking through how much of that is truly non-recurring, and when we find that sort of bottom and get the underlying demand? Thanks.","David Hess","Sure. Let me take the first question first on what the reaction has been from our OEM customers? I mean, quite honestly, it\u2019s been extremely supportive. I\u2019ve gotten wonderful notes, phone calls, text messages, et cetera, from a lot of the people that I\u2019m used to dealing with in the aerospace and defense industry.","So it\u2019s all been very positive and very, very highly appreciated by me. Support has been great from all the big airframers and from all the engine companies, including one engine company particularly they used to compete with. So that I think that the support has been great and overwhelming and very highly appreciated.","With respect to your second question on the destocking, clearly, we\u2019re seeing the effects already. We\u2019re in close discussions with our customers on destocking largely Boeing has been talked about, I think, publicly. And as we talked to and look at it and understand and communicate with Boeing, we kind of see the impacts kind of lasting through the end of 2017.","Carter Copeland","Okay. great. Thank you.","David Hess","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thanks. Good evening. To follow-up on Carter\u2019s question. Can you talk about where the destocking is by product categories in aluminum sheets and fasteners, or is it broader than that?","David Hess","Let me ask Ken to give you a little bit of additional more detail in that.","Ken Giacobbe","Hey, Gautam, how are you? Yes, you hit, and it\u2019s primarily fasteners business and\/or sheet and plate business in the GRP segment, exactly the right.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. You mentioned ramp costs \u2013 engine ramp costs at EP&S and I just wondered, if you could maybe unpack what the drivers are there and what program specifically and mindful that we\u2019re early in the leap ramp, as well as the PW1000. It\u2019s just something that becomes a \u2013 an incremental margin pressure as we move through the year, or where are you on that learning curve, if you could just talk about that?","David Hess","I mean, these are \u2013 when we talk about ramp up costs, these are normal costs associated with new product introductions. So the good news is, we\u2019ve got a lot of new product introduction going on right now. But of course, along with that, there\u2019s the normal things that you experience when your all-time and learning curve with a new program, direct labor variation, and slower manufacturing yields then you\u2019ll see as we start to move down the learning curve.","But as we look in the back-half of the year, we expect to see those costs increasing on an absolute basis, but diminishing on a revenue relative basis, compared to volume, as we continue to work down the learning curve and improve our productivity and efficiency and continue to improve manufacturing yields.","I don\u2019t know, Ken, if you would like to add anymore color there.","Ken Giacobbe","I think, exactly as David said, we try to put a definition for people that are new to the ramp-up cost conversation on Slide 16, at the bottom of the EPS bridge. But David is exactly right. We will have these costs continue to put as a relative percent of the revenue, they will decline over time, as we get better utilization through our plans and our scrap rates reduce. But we\u2019re very fortunate to be on these next-generation platforms and introducing the new products.","David Hess","I think what you\u2019ll \u2013 what you see if you look at it some of the waterfalls that we\u2019ve included in the deck here is the good news is, we\u2019re getting net cost reduction and net cost reduction in excess of some of the pricing pressure, we\u2019re seeing. If you exclude these ramp-up costs, which we know, will diminish over time. So I think, it\u2019s a good new story.","Gautam Khanna","Yes. And just two others, if I may, David. First, I was wondering, is Arconic sort of a bottleneck in the supply chain right now on either the leap, or the PW1000. And secondly, as we kind of look at the portfolio and the portfolio of R&D investment that\u2019s been underway, are there any things that you think \u2013 do you think, it will actually reduce the net R&D as we kind of are the Interim CEO, or do you think that most of these projects actually make a lot of sense? Thank you.","David Hess","Let me talk to the R&D. I mean, we\u2019ve given you the number for the year. Quite honestly, compared to where I came from a world, where R&D investments are typically 6% to 7%. Our revenue \u2013 the number here, I think, as you know, is somewhere along the lines of 1.2% of revenue. I mean that\u2019s a fairly modest number.","As always, I\u2019m going to dig into that number make sure that I understand, where we\u2019re spending our money and making sure that we\u2019re getting good returns on whatever investments we\u2019re making. But I mean, at this point, I have no plans to take down R&D and nor is that contemplated in the plans this year.","Ken Giacobbe","And we were a little like Gautam in the first quarter on R&D, we spent about $28 million. But we\u2019re \u2013 we will for the year still projecting about 1.2% of revenue. As we\u2019ve talked about in the R&D process, we believe we have an efficient process on R&D and there\u2019s a stage gate process. As we work projects through all the different stages of R&D development and they are co-funded by the businesses as well. So we\u2019ll continue to look at that with, David, based on his experience and evaluate the R&D budget.","David Hess","Gautam, I forgot the first part of your question. And I guess, your question\u2026","Gautam Khanna","You guys are [Multiple Speakers] Yes probably possible. And then the \u2013 is Arconic a bottleneck in either the leap production ramp, or the PW1000?","David Hess","I don\u2019t believe so, but I would encourage you to go talk to our customers.","Gautam Khanna","But as far as, you are on time and to spec?","David Hess","We are supporting the delivery of our customers.","Gautam Khanna","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good afternoon. Dave, you mentioned supporting the plan that senior management and the Board has put into place. From the Board\u2019s perspective, is it a precondition for the next CEO to sign on to the financial targets longer-term that the company has already given?","David Hess","Well, look, I would expect, as they look at CEO, they\u2019re going to when someone who\u2019s going to commit themselves to deliver on the targets that we\u2019ve committed to use for our shareholders. So I would say probably the answer is yes to that. I mean, my focus right now is on executing the plan making sure that we have a fair line of sight for Q2 2017. And then as I dig into start look more closely at 2018 and 2019 and make sure that we have adequate plans and actions in place to deliver on what we\u2019ve told you guys, we\u2019re going to do over the next three years.","And I would expect the \u2013 whoever the permanent CEO is, is going to have that same approach. The actual details of the plan could evolve over time to make sure that we have again sufficient actions in place to mitigate all risks and deliver the numbers. But I think, the plan is a plan for right for.","Seth Seifman","Great, thanks. And then, Ken, when you look at the margin progression through the year for GRP, I think you guys had initially talked about being up 30 to 80 basis points, you had a strong performance in the first quarter. But if we look at the trajectory of last year, the first quarter was the high point, and it kind of came down during the year. How do we think about the margin progression in GRP through the remainder of 2017?","David Hess","I\u2019m going to ask Ken to answer that one.","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, I think, a lot of it has to do with the margins. We\u2019ll have pressures primarily related to pricing, and then we\u2019ve got the destocking that we\u2019ve talked about. And recently wide body build rates some recent announcements there, that\u2019s our high margin area in aerospace. So there could be pressures in the back-half of the year.","As David mentioned, we had a higher royalty payment in the first quarter of $7 million, that helped out the margins. But we were happy with the performance of the GRP team in Q1.","Seth Seifman","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse.","Curt Woodworth","Yes. Hi, good evening.","Ken Giacobbe","Good evening.","David Hess","Hi, Curt.","Curt Woodworth","Hi. Just I guess a follow-up to the comment you made with regards to the wide body cuts. And what\u2019s the lead time that that you would have in the GRP business to when a cut comes down to the system then when you would see? And how much, I guess, how much visibility do you think you have in that business?","David Hess","Hey, Curt, it depends by business. But for the GRP business somewhere between six to nine months lead time.","Curt Woodworth","Okay. And have you seen any evidence of lead times starting to extend for either later sheet in aero?","David Hess","No, we haven\u2019t really Curt, we have not.","Curt Woodworth","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Josh Sullivan with Seaport Capital.","Josh Sullivan","Good afternoon.","David Hess","Hey, Josh.","Josh Sullivan","Just one on the automotive sheet side. Can you talk, at least, directionally how pricing is looking for auto sheet? I know you said aero has some pricing pressures. But are you seeing incremental interest, or is there any hesitancy around where CAFE standards might go?","Ken Giacobbe","Fortunately on the auto, you saw from our detail here that we\u2019re up around 43% year-over-year. We\u2019re seeing that continuing to grow. We just won a recent contract with Toyota to be the exclusive supplier on the Lexus SUV. So we\u2019re confident there. We believe we have a differentiated product, a great delivery model for automotive.","And on the CAFE standards, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to be an impact, especially I would say in 2018 \u2013 all the way out to 2018, because about 95% of our volume from 2018 is already backed by contract. And we just think the global trend with light-weighting and aluminum is going to continue, because we think it\u2019s value add for end customers. They get the better fuel efficiency, more towing and payload capacity. The safety scores are better on those vehicles. We have shorter braking distance and better performance.","So we think that this trend is going to continue and we\u2019ve been fortunate enough to win some recent contracts there as well. So, at least, out to 2018, I \u2013 we feel really confident about our volume.","Josh Sullivan","Okay, thanks. And then just one on with regard to the $500 million corporate trust. Have you made a determination, what constitutes the change in control?","Ken Giacobbe","I mean, given the litigation, I think that you\u2019re aware of its ongoing. We can\u2019t comment on that.","Josh Sullivan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Sam Pearlstein","Good evening. Welcome back, Dave.","David Hess","Hi, Sam, good to hear your familiar voice.","Sam Pearlstein","Can I just \u2013 so, Ken, first question is, just you talked about the $295 million in debt. So is there another roughly $700 million that\u2019s going to go in the second quarter? So in terms of the $1 billion reduction?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes. So the $1 billion reduction rate in the second quarter, we \u2013 that\u2019s what our debt reduction target is for the second quarter $1 billion. So we \u2013 yesterday, we purchased $295 million. We\u2019ve also tendered through the banks another $500 million. So that\u2019s roughly $800 million.","We\u2019re in the middle of our process. We still have a couple of weeks left. I think, we\u2019ll be settling in early May. We\u2019re in our second week right now, which ends \u2013 our second tranche, which ends on May 2. So we feel optimistic that we\u2019ll be in that $1 billion range for Q2.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And then help me understand on the engineered product side, just in terms of revenues looked like they were off, call it, $35 million or so in sales, but profits are flat. Is this all related to the engine ramp-up costs?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes. So, Sam, we put a bridge in the back on Slide 16, and you can see the ramp-up costs. A couple of things on the chart, you\u2019re right. The volume is up, which flows through about $22 million of EBITDA. We had a little bit of unfavorable mix of about $9 million and some pricing \u2013 the normal pricing pressures that we expected of $25 million.","As David talked about though that the net cost savings of $33 million more than offset those price declines. But the ramp-up cost that was worth $20 million. So you\u2019re exactly right. We will have those as we move forward, because we\u2019re on these new platforms. But that\u2019s what impacted the 40 basis points. If you back out to $20 million, right, we\u2019d be at about a 22% EBITDA margin.","Sam Pearlstein","Right. Well, I mean, but there are a lot of new platforms. I know the leap and the GTF are in service now. But there are still a lot of new platforms coming over the next several years. So is this ramp-up cost going to continue beyond this year, as new platform \u2013 every time the new platform comes out, we should expect to see it?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, I think you\u2019re going to see the absolute dollars to grow, Sam. But we should be getting incremental volume that would more than offset that. So on a relative basis, they should be declining.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And one last question is, GE had made some comments last week, they kind of implied, they may be short of the 500 leap deliveries issued. Does that affect your production rates at all? Have you seen anything back in terms of your ramp-up rates changing?","Ken Giacobbe","No, we haven\u2019t, Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. Thank you.","David Hess","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs.","Rob Norwood","Yes. This is Rob Norwood on for Andrew. Just a couple of questions for you here. First of all, you mentioned some additional tailwinds in the release. And then during the call, you mentioned royalty payments and then the Tennessee packaging business. Was there anything else in addition to that, or were those the two main tailwinds that help with the quarter?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, those were the two main ones. So David talked about the royalty payment was higher of $7 million of EBITDA, it hits revenue and it flows right to bottom line. So $7 million there, that will recur though. That royalty revenue will repeat in Q1 of 2017 and Q1 of, excuse me, Q1 of 2018 and Q1 of 2019.","The second is the Tennessee packaging business. The benefit of higher cost savings in the plans, as well as higher scrap value based on the price of LME and that was about $8 million of EBITDA benefit. So the combination of the two is about 15.","Rob Norwood","Okay great, thank you. And kind of shifting gears back into the aerospace business, what kind of visibility you\u2019re seeing now? How far can you see either on the EPS side, or GRP, just \u2013 are you starting to see any pricing from it all there, or is it still kind of weak to the wide body pressure?","Ken Giacobbe","Well, fortunately, we\u2019re seeing a lot of volume come through, which is helping out. But on the aero pricing for EP&S, the competition is increasing for more of the less differentiated product \u2013 products that we have out there. But our offset is a new programs right, where we\u2019ve got some higher pricing through innovation. So it\u2019s a mix.","We\u2019ve talked about the higher ramp-up cost in the new technologies. But it\u2019s a give and take with our customers. We think we have strong partnerships with our customers, and we have a good long-term view on the industry.","Rob Norwood","Okay. Great, guys. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. Just a couple of small items. First, Ken, to go back to capital allocation, at what point do you become satisfied with your debt balances and either look at pension, or go back for a ratings change?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, we\u2019re fortunate with the cash balance that we have right now and we\u2019ve been very happy with our net debt to EBITDA performance right now worried about 3.2. We ended last year at 3.7, roughly in that range. So what we\u2019re going to do, Howard, is based on our balance and what we see going forward, we\u2019ll prioritize, right, the first is going to be our CapEx.","We, as you know, we put in new approval processes, new levels of approval, new hurdle rates. So on our all of our growth CapEx, we have a 15% IRR requirements and a payback of less than five years. So our first priority is CapEx. As we talked about in Investor Day, we\u2019ll also look at opportunistic perhaps tuck-in acquisitions out there. They would be small. They would be in aerospace, if anywhere nothing on the horizon right now, but we will always continue to evaluate that.","And then we\u2019re also taking a look at three other areas. One is, perhaps additional debt pay down, potentially some share repurchases, or to your point, Howard, on the pension side, maybe we make some more pension contributions. But we\u2019re going to have to sit down with the Board and our new finance committee and David and look at the relative returns of each one of those actions.","But I think, we\u2019re firmly on track. We talked about a 2019 net debt to EBITDA target of anywhere between 2 to 2.5. So we\u2019re firmly on track of delivering on that.","Howard Rubel","I mean, without being without getting ahead, it looks like some of these things have played out a little bit faster than you might have first anticipated?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, we were fortunate on the retained interest stake rate. We sold at a historical high on Valentine\u2019s Day, that was very nice. And then we\u2019ve been really, really fortunate there. And the team has delivered as well in the cash and the business as we looked at Q1, we normally have a working capital build in Q1. But we were three days less than Q1 of last year. Our target was between three and seven days for the full-year, so we\u2019re on track there. The business is doing a nice job.","Howard Rubel","And then one last thing, the $91 million you show in corporate expense when we look at that we should exclude the \u2013 with the proxy and the final disengagement from Alcoa from those reported numbers. So look at what your run rate is, so that would\u2026?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, I\u2019m sorry, Howard. Yes, I would \u2013 on page 30 in the deck, I would take the $91 million. I would subtract out if you want to get a true view of the corporate expense, I would take out the impact of LIFO in metal lag and then we\u2019ve got the other category down at the bottom of negative 10, starting to give you so much detail here, and then I would do what you said take out the two specials. The separation cost of 18 and then the proxy, defense and governance costs of 16, so that lets you get down about 64.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much.","Operator","We do have a follow-up question from the line of Carter Copeland.","Carter Copeland","Yes, I wondered if I could \u2013 there are a couple more in here, Dave. Just to kind of explore a little bit, given your 35-plus years experience at UTX, it is \u2013 do you have any interest in staying on beyond the interim tag here, or any \u2013 anything you can share there?","David Hess","Look, I haven\u2019t made that decision yet as to whether I want to be the candidate for the permanent CEO job, as you might expect, I get that question quite a bit.","Carter Copeland","I would have\u2026","David Hess","I told the Board that I\u2019m going to stay as long as they need me to stay to conduct a thorough permanent CEO search to make sure that we have adequate time to find the perfect CEO to learn, to lead Arconic into the future. And what I\u2019ve told the team here, my colleagues and employees that Arconic is that for every day that I\u2019m here, I\u2019m going to behave as if I\u2019m here for the rest of my life and all by the way, you would treat me accordingly. So short answer is, I haven\u2019t made that decision yet. But again, I\u2019m approaching this job as if I\u2019m here for ever.","Carter Copeland","All right. Thanks for the color and good luck.","David Hess","Thank you.","Operator","We also have a follow-up from the line of Seth Seifman.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much. So just to follow-up, you guys have spoken a little bit earlier about the headwind from engine start-up costs increasing in dollars, but declining as a percentage of sales. I just wanted to verify if that was through the year, and if so, if that means you expect increasing sequential sales in EP&S through the year?","David Hess","That that\u2019s a fair assessment, Seth.","Seth Seifman","Okay. So then it looks like your versus your guidance for low single digits, you\u2019re on track to maybe come out a little bit ahead of that?","Ken Giacobbe","Well, we\u2019ve been fortunate. If you look at pretty much all of the markets and we have a slide I think gets really good in the deck Slide 21 that talks about the revenue for market year-over-year. You can see those aero engines up 9%, but we\u2019re fortunate as well that, defense is up 5%, automotive is up 33%, building and construction is up 8%, and commercial transportation is up 3% and industrial is up 13%.","So, the only \u2013 the pain points that we\u2019re seeing in the markets, the markets are healthy. We\u2019ve got airframes, which is pretty much flat year-over-year, it\u2019s down 1% in the slide. IGT something about 5%, that that market has been weak for us and we\u2019ll see that probably continue through the year. And then the packaging business are the way we\u2019re doing the tolling agreement in packaging as well as the ramp down, that\u2019s down about 24%. So we\u2019re fortunate that where we\u2019re positioned in these markets, it help this out.","Seth Seifman","All right. Okay. And then just as a follow-up there, just looking at the price headline, or the deflation in EP&S, it\u2019s about 170 basis points of headwind from a margin standpoint. And that that\u2019s more than we see in the other segments. But the revenue is driven by the engine ramp up, so maybe can you just square for us a little bit why we see such a big pricing headwind when the driver of the growth has kind of more of the proprietary differentiated technology that you have?","David Hess","Yes, I think on that, Seth, it comes down to with the revenue stream, that\u2019s in line exactly with our expectations for the price downs, and that\u2019s why we have put \u2013 been pushing with the team around the net cost savings in the business. So we\u2019ve got \u2013 we got on the platforms. You can see it from some of our previous decks around our positions on the next-generation platforms, there were some price that we gave to get that incremental volume.","Seth Seifman","All right. Okay, great.","David Hess","And then, the nice thing is those volumes, Seth, as you know, the platform staying in service for 20, 20-plus years in some instances right. So it\u2019s good to be on those platforms.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much.","Operator","We do have a follow-up from the line of Gautam Khanna.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thanks, again. I was wondering, if you could comment on how Firth Rixson fared in the quarter. I know it\u2019s hard to trace it maybe, but was there any improvement both on the top line and margins? And where are we on the isothermal qualification process?","Ken Giacobbe","Hey, Gautam, yes, for the first quarter, we had some good revenue roll through. Firth Rixson worried about $254 million of revenue for the first quarter. We had given guidance of anywhere for the full-year of around 970 to $1 billion. So we\u2019re firmly on track to deliver the full-year.","From a margin basis, we\u2019re pretty much flat year-over-year, as we\u2019re bringing on the new parts. We were at about 14.2% on the EBITDA margin side. But as you mentioned, the isothermal 78% \u2013 almost 80% of our parts on the isothermal that we\u2019ve got for 2017 are currently undergoing customer qualification. So we expect the revenue on the isothermal to hit late 2017, which is right in line with our expectations.","Gautam Khanna","And can you remind us on how large a revenue contribution that will be in 2017 and 2018, if things go according to plan?","Ken Giacobbe","We haven\u2019t disclosed that yet, but it will be small in 2017, because it\u2019ll be at the latter part of the year. 2018, it\u2019s just going to be dependent on the volumes that we ship through the plant. But we, Gautam, we haven\u2019t given any guidance on how much that\u2019s going to be.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And can you give us an update on how RTI has performed in Q1? And I don\u2019t know if you have that visibility. But if and also if there has been any plate destocking on the titanium side at airbus or elsewhere in the supply chain on the titanium side?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, in terms of RTI, just give me one second here, Gautam. We delivered and let\u2019s see here 19.8% margin for the first quarter of 2017 that compares to 19.3% of Q1 in the prior year, so up around 50 basis points. And you\u2019ll recall when we acquired RTI, they were in the 14.5% EBITDA margin range. So a substantial improvement and we had with them in 2016 and that\u2019s carrying forward into 2017.","Gautam Khanna","And on the plate side shipments, are they sheet and plate at Airbus, or is there any destocking going on in that channel? And maybe also on the F-35, are you starting to see the big ramp there?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, Gautam, I don\u2019t know the answer to that question. I can try to find out and get back to you, okay, I don\u2019t know the answer to that one.","Gautam Khanna","All right. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And that is all the time we have for questions. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. David Hess.","David Hess","Thank you very much. Thank you all for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and attention.

We are excited about it and we're going after it.","During the launch, we engaged with many investors to share our direction and hear your feedback. We have adopted state-of-the-art governance practice with our Board reaching out to shareholders. They have visited with some of you and received constructive feedback. Lastly, we have benchmarked other aerospace and industrial peers to understand their best practices and invest on communication.","Our priorities are clear. First, we are squarely concentrating on improving our operating performance through cost reduction, margin enhancement and profitable revenue generation. Second, we have intensified our focus on capital efficiency with an owner's mind-set. With respect to capital allocation, our scrutiny is greater, our hurdles are higher and our payback periods are shorter.","We believe that these priorities are essential to drive shareholder returns. They have all of our attention. We have laid out our short and mid-term targets and our action plans during Investor Day. We will continue to update you on the status. Now that we are a more focused Company, we are taking several steps to further strengthen operating management, Board oversight of capital allocation and profit improvement progress.","Third, to give you a deeper insight, we are and will continue to provide quarterly and annual guidance on revenue and EBITDA for Arconic as well as annual guidance for the segments. Fourth, from a communications standpoint, we will spend less time on prepared remarks and allow more time for Q&A. Our review will focus on operating results and its drivers. We know that those are the things that are of interest for you.","Before I get into the detail, I should add that the timing of earnings has been pushed back. Our reporting date is now after most of our customers have reported and provided their outlook. So let me now turn to the results. So the revenues are roughly flat in the quarter as well as in the full year. Combined segment EBITDA is up 7% for the quarter and 9% for 2016 for the full year. We expanded margins in every segment and this was very strongly driven by productivity, which resulted in net savings of 2.5% of revenue. We have strengthened the balance sheet. We paid down $700 million of debt in December. We ended the year with $1.9 billion of cash. Our priorities are clear. We are focused on margin and RONA improvement.","In 2016, we faced unexpected challenges from destocking, lower build rates and ramp-up issues to the drop off of North American heavy duty truck market as well as the underperformance of Firth Rixson. These challenges led us to change our guidance twice last year. I know and we've heard from some of you that this has been very frustrating and painful for you and also for us. Given what happened in 2016, we've pressure tested our target setting process and built-in additional robustness going forward. In general, for 2017 we are assuming that the destocking and the aero engine ramp-up issues will continue throughout the year. We are expecting a decline in North American heavy duty truck, not quite however at the same level than 2016. We also believe that mining and oil and gas markets are not foreseen to come back in 2017.","So let's talk about the groups. On engineered products and solutions, we expect the revenues to be up low single-digits driven by share gains of new aero platforms as well as new aero engine platform ramp-ups, at the same time, also pressured from market mix and comparative pricing and the negative impact of the aero supply chain risks. The growth here will be roughly in line with the market as we have intensely discussed at the Investor Day.","The margin is expected to be up 30 to 60 basis points, driven by strong productivity volume growth as well as -- the negative factors is pressure from market mix and competitive pricing and the industry engine ramp-up challenges. As we told you during Investor Day, we believe the earnings potential to be around 400 basis points improvement compared to 2016 in a three to five-year range. Let me also specifically address Firth Rixson. The 2016 results were in line with what we last told you, however, disappointing. Overall, we got it wrong on the non-aero side and our outlook substantially reduced for this market.","On the aero side, we are delayed but we will get there. We could have executed better and we recognize it and we own it. We are working diligently to improve the performance of this important asset. In terms of outlook for Firth Rixson, for 2017, we expect revenues to be $970 million to $1 billion range with margin improvement of 100 to 200 basis points over 2016. For 2019, we expect revenues to reach around $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, with additional EBITDA margin improvement of 100 to 300 basis points compared to 2017.","In regards to the three to five-year outlook, we expect the EBITDA margin potential to be roughly 600 basis points up from 2016. The aero business is delayed three years in revenue and closer to four years on the EBITDA side. The equipment reliability in Firth Rixson has improved. The idles done, the forge is operating, over 78% of the parts required for the 2017 revenue have now been produced and are undergoing customer qualification. The idle film Enforce is expected to generate revenue in late 2017.","We recognize the importance of improving the performance of Firth Rixson. We see the value of these assets having and still will continue to have to transform Arconic into a full range aero-engine component supplier which is critical to the success of Arconic. Our other substantial acquisition RTI is performing above our expectation. We acquired the business in July 2015 and at that time it had a 14.5% EBITDA margin. Within 18 months under our ownership, we have improved it by 500 basis points. The full year margin was 19.5%.","Let's move to our Global Rolled Products business. Revenues are expected to be down high single-digits driven by number one, strong auto sheet growth positively, negative impact of the 400 million from the North American packaging ramp down in Tennessee and continuous decline of North American truck build rates. The growth in the airframe auto sheet is expected to be below market and above market in brazing sheet and commercial transportation. We talked about that also during Investor Day.","The margin is expected to be up 30 to 80 basis points driven by strong productivity, strong auto sheet growth as well as on a negative side airframe restocking, wide body build rates coming down and pricing pressure in regional specialties. As we told you during investor day, we believe the earnings potential for Global Rolled Products will be around 200 basis points improvement compared to 2016 in a three to five-year range.","On our transportation and construction systems business, revenues are expected to be up low single digits driven by building infrastructure construction market growth as well as product innovation and distribution expansion. On the negative side, headwinds continue decline of North American truck build rates. The growth will be above market for building and construction as well as Phobias [ph]. We expect the margin to be up between zero to 20 basis points driven by strong productivity and headwinds from competitive pricing as well as inflationary pressures.","As we told you during Investor Day, we believe the earnings potential to be around 250 basis points improvement compared to 2016 and in the three to five-year range. Overall, we are targeting gross productivity for Arconic in total between 4.5% to 5.5% of the revenue and net savings of around 2% of revenue. This includes reducing the corporate overhead in 2017 to a 1.1% level of revenue. Our focus is clearly on margin expansion and capital efficiency. So let's also talk about capital efficiency. For 2017, we are targeting to increase our RONA to 9% and for 2019 to 11% to 12%, a 400 to 500 basis points improvement from today.","We will get there through margin expansion, working capital reduction, stringent CapEx management and overhead reduction. To be clear, these targets do not include the potential benefit from monetizing the retained interest of Alcoa Corporation. So with this, let me now turn it over to Ken for more in depth discussion of the 2016 results.","Ken Giacobbe","Thank you, Klaus. In order to get to all of your questions as soon as possible, I'll move rather quickly through the financial slides. We have added several slides in the appendix which give you additional information.","Now let's move to Slide 8 for the financial overview. You'll notice that as a result of the separation on November 1, 2016, Arconic has reported Alcoa Corporation's operational results as discontinued operations for both quarter and the year. I will focus my comments on continuing operations of Arconic with one exception. The cash flow statement including free cash flow represents both continuing and discontinued operations. Q4 and full year revenue were flat year-over-year.","Revenue growth was impacted by our decision to ramp down our less profitable Tennessee packaging business which is detailed in the footnotes. Combined segment EBITDA margin was 15.5% and 16.6% respectively for Q4 and the full year. All segments improved Q4 and full year EBITDA margins on a year-over-year basis. Our capital efficiency measure RONA, which is return on net assets was 4% for Q4, driven by lower Q4 seasonal profitability and it was 7.1% for the full year which was in line with our guidance.","Cash ended the year at $1.9 billion which was approximately $100 million better than guidance. Gross debt of $8.1 billion was reduced by $750 million resulting from the debt pay-down that we did in December of 2016. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA finished at 3.7 times. Free cash flow was positive $354 million for Q1, and negative $252 million in the full year including both continuing and discontinued operations. These numbers include approximately $135 million of separation of cash costs in Q4 and $375 million for the full year.","Now let's move to the income statement. We've talked about revenue, so let me cover some other key areas. Overhead spending continues to be an area of focus for Arconic. Our SG&A was higher in the fourth quarter as our separation spending reached its peak. Excluding the impact of separation costs, our SG&A as a percent of sales was 6.5% in Q4 and 6.1% for the full year. The impact of separation costs on EBITDA was $76 million in Q4 and $193 million for the full year. The loss from continuing operations was $1.3 billion or $2.95 a share for Q4 and a loss of $1.1 billion or $2.56 a share for the full year. Excluding special items income from continuing operations was $71 million or $0.12 a share for Q4 and $505 million or $0.98 a share for the full year. Special items for the quarter were $1.352 billion, which included four major items.","First, we took $1.244 billion of discrete and other tax items primarily related to the separation. This was all non-cash. As highlighted during Investor Day, we recorded valuation allowances for U.S. deferred tax asset that we transferred to Alcoa Corporation as well as certain foreign tax credits that no longer are considered realizable due to the separation. Although, we have taken a valuation allowance for the former tax credits, we retained the tax attributes for a period of time, usually 10 years when it occurs. The second charge was $92 million after tax for restructuring, which has three subcomponents. ","The first are costs associated with our Tennessee packaging business. As I mentioned earlier, we will be exiting that business by the end of 2018. There will be additional charges through the end of 2018 as we ramp down production. The second is a write-off of our Firth Rixson ultra large extrusion forging press in the UK. The write-off is the result of substantial decline in off-highway and mining markets as wells as our projections for those future markets. Third is a headcount reduction primarily impacting engineered products and solutions and our corporate business. These reductions are part of our plan to reduce corporate overhead by $45 million in 2017, which will result in overhead at 1.1% of revenue. The third item was a $72 million after tax charge associated with separation cost, which impacted SG&A. These were cash costs. ","Finally, $56 million of non-cash after-tax income due to the adjustment of the projected earn-out of our Firth Rixson acquisition. You can see the impact in the other income line of the income statement.","Now let's shift to the cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, the cash flow statement includes the impact of both continuing and discontinued operations. Cash from operations was $665 million for Q4, and $873 million for the full year. This reflects the majority of the charges included in the net loss were non-cash. Cash used in financing activities was $407 million for Q4 and $757 million for the full year. The main activity in Q4 was the pay-down of $750 million of notes in December, as well as our net cash settlement with Alcoa Corporation for positive $400 million.","Cash used in investing activities was $244 million for Q4 and $165 million for the full year, as capital expenditures on a full year basis were largely offset by nonessential asset sales throughout the year. Free cash flow was positive $354 million for Q4 and negative of $252 million for the full year. Excluding cash separation costs, free cash flow for the year would have been positive by more than $100 million. Again, we ended the year with $1.9 billion of cash after the debt pay-down of $750 million in December.","Now let's move to the segments. EPS had strong margin expansion of 150 basis points in the quarter driven by net savings. Net saving was introduced at Investor Day and it's defined as productivity less cost increases divided by revenue. In EPS, revenue was flat versus the prior year quarter, benefits of the strength in the aero engine and IGT demand were offset by continuing destocking in airframes. EBITDA of $265 million for the quarter was up 9%. The year-over-year improvement was largely driven by net savings in ATEP which is the RTI acquisition. EBITDA margin improvement 150 basis points to 18.8% driven by net savings of 3.2%, partially offset by pricing in aero engine ramp-up costs.","For the year, EP&S' revenue was up 7% driven by the RTI acquisition. Revenue growth was primarily in commercial aero engines, aero airframes and industrial gas turbines. EBITDA was 8% for the year, again driven by RTI acquisition as wells as strong net savings. EBITDA margin was up 10 basis points to 20.9% driven by net savings of 2.2%, partially offset by pricing and aero engine ramp-up cost.","Let's move to GRP. GRP also had a good Q4 in terms of margin improvement. They expanded EBITDA margin by 100 basis points driven by their net saving. Revenue was down 9% compared to 2015 as record auto sheet shipments of 56% were more than offset by the ramp-down of the Tennessee packaging business. Airframe destocking North America heavy duty truck, the EBITDA was flat year-over-year. EBITDA margin improved by 100 basis points as we said earlier to 10.8%.","Again, this was driven by continuous net savings improvement of 1.5% and favorable price mix. For the full year, revenue was down 7% as our continuing growth in automotive was offset by the ramp-down of the Tennessee packaging business and metal price declines. Despite the lower revenue, EBITDA was up 13%, driven by growth in automotive as well as strong productivity. EBITDA margin improved 220 basis points to 11.9% as net savings of 2.8% were partially offset by unfavorable price and mix.","Now let's move to TCS. TCS as well delivered a strong fourth quarter. Revenue increased 3% driven by solid results in our building and construction business, partially offset by continued weakness in the North America heavy duty truck market as well as more general weakness in the bill Brazilian market. EBITDA was up 15% driven by strong productivity and that was offset by pricing pressures and commercial transportation volume. EBITDA margin improvement in the quarter was 180 basis points to 16.4%, which was a record fourth quarter for TCS.","If we look at the full year, revenue was down 4% mainly driven by the North America heavy duty truck build rates, which were down 29% in North America. We also had overall market weakness in Brazil, which offset the growth in nonresidential construction business. EBITDA was up 7%. Our TCS team did an excellent job of overcoming this top line market weakness with net savings. EBITDA margin improved 170 basis points to an annual record of 16.1% driven by net savings of 2.8% and partially offset by pricing in North America heavy duty truck.","Now let's take a look at the outlook for 2017. Our guidance has not changed for 2017 from our Investor Day presentation last month. Revenue will be in the range of 11.8 billion to 12.4 billion. This includes the unfavorable impact of Tennessee packaging ramp down of approximately 400 million. EBITDA will improve approximately 130 basis points to 15%. Free cash flow will be 350 million plus.","As we focus on deleveraging, we tend to pay down 1 billion of debt in the first half of 2017. RONA is forecast to be 9% or 190 basis points above prior year. Earnings per share will be in the range of $1.10 to $1.120 per share, based on a share count of 470 million. The increase in share count is driven by our Firth Rixson mandatory convertible preferred stock, which converts in October of 2017. As a reminder, the 2017 targets mentioned above exclude the positive impact of monetizing our retained interest in Alcoa Corporation.","For Q1, consolidated revenue will be 2.8 billion to 3 billion driven by increases in aero engines and automotive offset by airframe and our Tennessee packaging ramp down. EBITDA is forecast to be 420 million to 450 million. Our diluted share count at the end of Q1 is expected to be 460 million shares.","Now let's take a look at our capital allocation priorities for 2017. Consistent with our Investor Day presentation last month, we're going to cap our CapEx expenditures in 2017 to 650 million with reinvestment rate on our sustaining capital of between 40% to 60% of depreciation and amortization. We'll be paying down $1 billion of debt in the first half. That's on top of the 750 million that we did in December of 2016.","We are targeting three to seven-day reduction in days working capital from our current level of 49 days. We're targeting a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share. This is consistent with the intent to pay out a dividend equal to approximately 10% of our operating cash flows. We'll also look at potential share repurchases. The criteria for the repurchase will be based on the attractiveness of the share purchase relative to returns of other capital deployment options.","Now I'll move to the last financial slide. We're confirming our 2017 and 2019 targets as discussed at last month's Investor Day as we close out 2016 and 2017 we're clear. As Klaus has mentioned, we're first concentrating on improving our operational performance through cost reduction, margin enhancement, profitable revenue generation. Second, we've intensified our focus on the capital efficiency with an owner's mindset with respect to capital allocation our scrutiny is greater.","Our hurdle rates are higher and our payback periods are shorter. We believe these two priorities are essential to drive shareholder returns. They all have our attention. Third, to give you deeper insight as Klaus mentioned we will continue to provide quarterly and annual guidance on revenue and EBITDA for Arconic as well as annual guidance for the segments. Fourth, from a communication standpoint, we'll spend less time on prepared remarks and now more time on Q&A. So let me turn it back to Klaus.","Klaus Kleinfeld","Thank you very much. Before we go into Q&A, let me quickly reiterate. We had flat revenues but we were able to expand our margin for each group and our profits are up. We strengthened the balance sheet at the same time, going forward we have actions underway and will continue to do so and we are squarely focused on margin and RONA improvement. With this, let's get the Q&A session started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.","Jorge Beristain","In the spirit of cost cutting, I just thought I'd give you guys the opportunity to maybe state some more explicit SG&A targets. You mentioned about 1.1% of revenue. So at about $12 billion run rate I guess that comes to about $135 million odd for SG&A. But could you just kind of give us those big buckets that we talked about at Investor Day? What you're looking at doing in terms of corporate SG&A, the change year on year, R&D, and then some of those legacy costs as well that we had talked about?","Ken Giacobbe","Sure, Jorge. This is Ken. So as we communicated at Investor Day, as we exit 2016, we have some dis-synergy as part of the separation, about $18 million. Our run rate exiting 2016 is about 1.5% of revenues. As we move forward into 2017, we've committed that on a corporate side we would get that number down to 1.1% of revenues. That's a $45 million reduction in one year.","Klaus and I have gone through all of the corporate overhead items line by line, from the finance organization all the way through HR, communications no lights [ph] came up with a very detailed plan on how to action it. You've seen the restructuring charge in Q4 associated with these moves. They'll have a payback of less than a year. But we've gone through a very detailed plan and we monitor that on a monthly basis.","So we feel confident that we'll be able to do that 1.1%. That puts us in good stead compared to our competition, about roughly half the rate of a PCC and others. We're also looking, Jorge, I know you talked a lot about R&D. We feel we have a very efficient model on R&D in terms of theirs work done at our technology center as well as a joint funding model and a stage gate process with our businesses. We can see a large percentage of our revenue has been generated through our R&D projects across the business. I'll give you one example.","Our new wheel which is the lightest wheel in the market, 47% lighter than steel, it's stronger than steel. We get our customers to get 5% more payload and 3% better fuel economy. That all comes through the joint work of the R&D and businesses teams together. So we'll be bringing those costs down in the R&D as well which is a very strict stage gate process that comes back down to that. We've actually cut some of the R&D cost in 2016. Jorge, when you see our detailed schedules we have taken some costs out of R&D already in 2016. We'll continue to do that in 2017 as well.","Jorge Beristain","Do you have just like an explicit goal for R&D spending for 2017 at the corporate level?","Ken Giacobbe","I believe it will be somewhere in the $130 million to $140 million level, Jorge, across the entire business, right. Because again, it's a joint funding model with the businesses; if a project doesn't make it and get endorsement from the business with associated revenue returns, the project gets killed.","Klaus Kleinfeld","Jorge, you were there at the ATC and you saw it with your own eyes and others did too. There was a lot of examples, a lot of critical examples that contribute substantially to the profitability as well as the revenues. Just to pick out a few, this very unique fly type fastener, the 787-mission critical fastener that allows for lightning strike protection. The A951, which really is the bonding, this is the bonding for the Ford F Series, which really allowed, enabled Ford to go all aluminum allowing for the benefits that we're already seeing here in GRP, the automotive ramp-up would not have been possible.","The 3D core blades on the F-135 engine, this is the engine that goes into the Joint Strike Fighter and the list is long. If you look at the 90% of the alloys that ever have flown that the west that's invented, buy what's today Arconic and past Alcoa, this all would not have been possible without the investments in R&D.","Jorge Beristain","If I could just get another one in quickly. Your monetization of the stake in Alcoa, any thought as to how that would happen? Is it aimed to be sort of a private placement maybe to a sovereign wealth fund? Or are you looking at a pulverizing that, at the market types of offers? How would you see kind of bleeding that stock out into the market?","Klaus Kleinfeld","I think, look, I mean, we will look at all options and to have in mind that the monetization will happen in a responsible fashion and will be based on market conditions. The dynamics are such that if it happens in the first 18 months, there is a tax benefit if exchanged against debt. The maximum time that you have is five years. The market value today that the retained interest of 19.9% has is $1.3 billion. We already said in Investor Day that we use the proceeds and\/or for debt pay-down and\/or share repurchases. The rest of the details is pure speculation at this point, Jorge.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global Securities.","Josh Sullivan","Just looking at the two destocking trends in aluminum plate and titanium fasteners, can you talk about how we should think about the cadence of the destocking cycles through 2017?","Klaus Kleinfeld","The destocking is a phenomenon that applies to the airframe side. This hits most strongly our GRP business and also affects the structural parts in our EPS business, right? We have assumed that the destocking will continue to last throughout 2017. So our assumption in the numbers that Ken and I have just disclosed to you for 2017 is that we believe it's going to continue to go through 2017, the full year.","Josh Sullivan","Do you think we're at the depths of it in the first quarter or do you think it eases its way out through the end?","Klaus Kleinfeld","Josh, we have assumed that they will go through the whole year. We have turned, taken a cautious approach after we probably the whole industry was too optimistic in regards to the destocking last year.","Josh Sullivan","Okay. Great. Then just one on the automotive sheet market. Can you give us any idea of a body and white pricing or any comments on how the automotive market is approaching the transition to BIW, given the new administration's posturing on CAFE standards?","Klaus Kleinfeld","Yes, Happy to talk about that. We will not disclose the pricing on the automotive side. I think you understand that. That's not in the interest of the shareholder. On the CAFE side, we do not believe that there is a near term impact because the way these automotive contracts are tailored, they are specific to a certain platform. When we look at the contract that we have locked in, we basically have 95% of all the volume that we have, which is Tennessee, as well as Davenport backed by contracts today until 2018. Then the question comes, what is going to happen longer term? That's obviously speculation and there's a discussion around this. I mean, I think there are three points that I would think one has to consider here.","The first one is, light weighting it's creating a value for customers and customers are seeing it and are appreciating it, always relative in their respective category. So, they will not buy a Prius but they will buy the lighter truck. Secondly, this is all related to North America, which is the relevant market for us here. I assume that's your question. The state of California has made very, very clear that they will keep demanding better fuel efficiency in spite of what happens on the federal side.","The third thing is the auto industry in North America has a strong interest in being internationally competitive and one thing is absolutely clear. If you just look at the Chinese market, fuel efficiency is essential, absolutely essential there given the environmental issues that exist there. We will obviously be watching the developments more closely and also touch with down with the White House, the President on that matter.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Klaus, actually just picking up on that last question, can you just talk about any opportunities for you around tax reform as well as any opportunities around infrastructure spending opportunities as you look forward?","Klaus Kleinfeld","On the tax reform side, I have been always supporting a reform on the U.S. business tax side and lower tax, lower corporate tax rate to make it more competitive on an international scale. The rest as I think pure speculation where this will go. And what was your second point?","Rajeev Lalwani","I guess just any infrastructure spending opportunities that you can --.","Klaus Kleinfeld","Infrastructure spend would affect us most strongly in the aspects of heavy duty trucks and trailer. As I told you, our assumption for 2017 is that the market will continue to be down, right, roughly around I would say 10% or so. So that's what hit. It would also hit on the general industry demand, right? So I assume -- that's mainly affecting our Global Rolled Products business. That's where that would hit. The other question is what happens on the defense spending side? Also, what happens to consumer confidence in general that can have a bigger impact on consumer confidence as we saw has been going up in the US. Also on the building and construction side obviously where this will have an impact, direct impact.","Rajeev Lalwani","Got it. Just one last question. In terms of more of a high level strategic question. As relates to the GRP segment, can you just talk about the strategic fit there within Arconic and whether or not -- that business is sort of playing a role in suppressing your overall margins and cash flow.","Klaus Kleinfeld","Well, first of all, we have been very good in bringing it up to this level. This has been a major work of shedding off those parts of the businesses that have been exposed to a stronger commoditization. The last big thing that we have done there is to basically ramp-down now the packaging, North American packaging. We will always look at opportunities here, how to further improve this business as we have done in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs.","Andrew Quail","Hi Klaus and Ken, I've got a couple of questions. First one's on aero, just wanted to know how much of your aero related business is priced at spot versus contract.","Klaus Kleinfeld","This depends on which segment you go into. If you go into the aero engine segment, I would say the majority, probably 80%, 90% or so is contract business. Same thing is true for the specific structural parts. If you for instance do a bulkhead for the F-35, the Joint Strike Fighter, that's obviously long-term contract and very few people can make it.","On the GRP side, on the global rolling side, there are sometimes opportunities here to have spot sales. We saw the last big one of this in I think it was 2012, end of 2012 when particularly Airbus had under-bought and was in great need to buy more. At this point in time, Andrew, I don't expect that because as I told you before the market is in a destocking mode, particularly in regards to those type of components.","Andrew Quail","Okay. I suppose you'd go with flagged about unfavorable sort of price and product mix in EPS. Is that the impact of destocking and the price weakness that you guys have flagged?","Klaus Kleinfeld","It is that and the -- on the EPS side, the destocking hits as I said earlier on, all the structural parts and particularly fasteners is very strongly affected, very strongly affected by this. Great effort also from our customers to further consolidate their supply chain, Right? So that's the biggest impact there really.","Andrew Quail","Last one is on TCS. It looks like the data in North American truck market is starting to improve. Are you guys seeing any signs of that?","Klaus Kleinfeld","Well, we are not, to be honest. That's why we are expecting a further decline in the North American heavy duty truck market, trailer market. Not as I said at the same level of minus -- more than minus 30 in last year, it was really like a cliff fall. But rather in the range of roughly minus 10% or so. But for us, the good thing is, will continue to build out our market share, not just in North America.","We're a worldwide presence and we have great products and we will continue to expand in Europe as well as in emerging markets like China. The Chinese market is a very good growth market for us because they are now enforcement rules for weight restrictions on trucks, this will allow us to grow there and that's also built into our assumptions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard Rubel","A couple questions. Maybe Ken, just first, interest expense seemed quite low and yet we've not gotten the full benefit of the refinancing or some of the other item. Could you just provide a general guide as to what you think that's going to be for the upcoming year?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes. If you take a look at our actuals, Howard, we committed that we would pay-down another $1 billion over the first half. If you look at our debt towers that we've got coming due, we've got $1 billion in 2018, about $1.130 billion in 2019, and another $1 billion in 2020. All different rates, anywhere from -- we've got some notes at around 5.7% to 6.6%. So I think if you do the math and you choose the blended rate there that will give you some idea in terms of what the interest expense will be going forward.","Howard Rubel","So I mean, it's going to -- if we just look at where you ended the third -- the fourth quarter, you could conceivably be reasonably well under a run rate of well under $300 million.","Ken Giacobbe","$300 million, I think it would be north of that, Howard.","Howard Rubel","Just two other things. From what we've seen from Pratt, they made a lot of progress with the GTF. I think you contributed to that, Klaus. Could you address a little bit of where you are on that? How you feel the ramp is going now?","Klaus Kleinfeld","Howard, first of all, I'm glad you're joining this call. I can obviously not comment on specific customers here. You know fair well, you have to ask Pratt. The thing that I can say is that all the OEMs in the engine side know that the supply chain -- the engine supply chain needs to be very, very stringently managed to live up to the expectations of these enormously ambitious ramp-ups. We are seeing as you just indicated good progress. At the same time, we also have to be clear that the ramp-up expectations are of historic proportion.","Howard Rubel","Is there any way for you to comment on where your yield is today versus what your plan is? Or how far you've come? [Multiple Speakers]","Klaus Kleinfeld","Howard, the yields wouldn't help you much because we are one component in a longer chain. So you would really, to get to this you would really have to understand what is the yield of the component once it leaves us, goes to other suppliers and then gets finished and build in at Pratt RG [ph].","Howard Rubel","No, I understand that. Then last, you talked about destocking. If we think about it largely being attributable to wide body aircraft, would that, and maybe some efficiencies in other places. Would that be equivalent to what you'd see as about a 5% headwind to revenues in those business units?","Klaus Kleinfeld","Ken, I think this really depends how our, I mean, on what you're looking at, because the effects here are different. I mentioned before, the destocking impact on fasteners. I think what you had in mind, in the fastener, it was very strongly driven by an optimization in the supply chain. This is different from the effect that you are referring to, which is simply a mix change or a reduction of the wide body build rate. So I would say you really have to look at it component by component, different for plate than for fasteners.","Howard Rubel","But that's an important, I mean, it is also wide body volume in addition to just optimization.","Klaus Kleinfeld","Sure. No, you are absolutely right. But on fasteners the impact is larger, is really much larger to what I just said, through the consolidation of the internal consolidation of long supply, internal long supply chain.","Howard Rubel","Okay. Thank you very much. [Multiple Speakers]","Klaus Kleinfeld","Howard, just one other thing. This is Ken again. You mentioned $324 million. I was wondering where you're getting that number from. That's on an after-tax basis, right? So our interest expense on a pretax would be about $500 million. Again, if you do the math that I talk about there, you're in the low $400 million. Okay? You were looking at after-tax, right?","Howard Rubel","Yes, that's correct.","Klaus Kleinfeld","Okay.","Howard Rubel","I'm sorry about that. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse.","Curt Woodworth","How should we be thinking about incremental margins in the EPS segment as volume starts to come back, if you I guess assume pricing is constant?","Klaus Kleinfeld","We've given you a good outlook here in regards to what we believe. I mean, first of all, in our plans, we have not built in volume to go substantially up in 2017. So that's the first important thing. We assume that volume in 2017 will go up low to single, up to low single-digits, right? That's the first thing. That is underpinned by our assumption that destocking will continue through 2017 and the ramp-up will have issues, right?","We believe that in 2017 in spite of all of this, the streamlining actions as well as the productivity and the net we will be able to get out of this allows us to expand the margin by another 30 to 60 basis points from the level of 2016, where EPS is at 20.9% EBITDA margin. Then we also have said that in the longer run or the mid-term in the three to five years we believe that we will be able to get a 400-basis point expansion based off the 2016 level.","So get into the mid-20s. To get there, you would need to see the ramp-up of the volume happening. We do believe and you know that, Curt, that we have the contracts. We have been signing more than $40 billion of aerospace contracts --.","Ken Giacobbe","$14 billion.","Klaus Kleinfeld","$14 billion of aerospace contracts. We have gained substantial share on the engine as wells as on the platform side. So the moment these issues are worked through, the market will lift up and that's what's built in there. I don't know, Curt, whether you had a chance to attend our -- or remember what Karl showed at our Investor Day. Karl Tragl showed a very, very nice graph where he indicated what our assumptions are in terms of the growth. The growth basically -- our assumption is the growth will start to lift up in 2018. The volume is there. This is all a question of getting the technical solution done and getting through the destocking.","Curt Woodworth","Right. But I guess with respect to trying to close the margin gap with precision cast parts. I've just seen the presentation for the Elliott. I guess if you think that -- do you think incremental margins to be up to 40% in EPS, i.e., if you -- would you need, say, a 10% volume environment to really close the gap with PCC?","Klaus Kleinfeld","The gap with PCC is a bit of a different question, because the biggest difference to keep it simple here is that PCC has the luxury of having a business of titanium and nickel large structural casts. They had almost a virtual monopoly in this business. The last time they published numbers, it had a size of around $1.4 billion and they had a profitability in the segment of over 40%.","So this is the biggest difference because we actually have just started to build up that business by building out our LaPorte facility. This has been ramping up and this facility even when it's in full swing will probably produce roughly around $300 million of revenue, at a nice margin, a very, very nice margin. But this is a structural gap that will take quite some time. We will be working it. We will be gaining share in this. We will continue to close the gap. But that's the biggest point there in terms of the PCC comparison.","Ken Giacobbe","The last few that we had on PCC, it was their Q4 was about an 18% margin business. For the full year, you can get to somewhere around the 20. But as you talked about with the volume increase in our business and the innovation and the richer mix, that's what will improve our margins. We also have the LaPorte facility, which does the large structural castings.","Curt Woodworth","Okay, that's helpful. Then on Firth Rixson, the revenue growth target to 2019 is potentially up $300 million to $400 million. How much of that target is based on ISO thermal?","Klaus Kleinfeld","Off the 2017 target?","Curt Woodworth","The 2019 target.","Klaus Kleinfeld","The 2019 target. Look, we have in the appendix of the presentation, we have put an extra chart in here that pretty much shows the Firth Rixson details. I don't want to go through all of this; happy for the IR team to do this offline. On ISO thermal, it is clearly that we are happy that the machinery is working, the forge is working. All of as I just said, all of the components that we need to get to the revenues in 2017 are currently -- have been produced and are undergoing customer qualification.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna","I had a couple questions. First, just wanted to understand why the IGT business was up so much in what was a relatively flat OE shipment market? Then looking forward, what do you anticipate the growth rate will be when you have guys like GE and others basically guiding flat to down?","Klaus Kleinfeld","Yes, that's correct. What happened here in IGT are really two phenomenon. One is there were a couple of large contracts worldwide that were tendered. The biggest one was probably the Egypt contract and then there was I think in Peru another big one. Also bear in mind, we are really supplying everybody who's in the IGT business. So we benefit from those. Then the biggest driver however was the very intelligent approach that GE had to put into the market by doing a revamping of the existing -- of their existing machinery and that has been a big success over the last, I would say, 18 months. But you're absolutely correct. GE has taken their forward projections down. We do also not expect for the market to grow in 2017.","Gautam Khanna","By products you mean the H Class? Or are you talking about the [Multiple Speakers].","Klaus Kleinfeld","Yes, exactly, H Class. Talking about H Class exactly.","Gautam Khanna","Just another question. I'm curious how you guys think about whether -- you're an innovative Company. You have a lot of proprietary products. Do you actually get paid for it? I just wonder, in terms of when we think of PCC because somebody brought it up on the call, when we think of them, they're a build to print manufacturer -- the name of the game is get cost out as opposed to any pricing power. How do you view that? Just innovation and what the returns on it are as you look out?","Klaus Kleinfeld","Yes. The question on innovation and what returns are I think I answered previously, but specifically in regards to the comparison to PCC and, therefore, the aero engine side. I think that on the aero engine side the market has undergone quite a dramatic shift in the last year. As you see, the new types of engines that are coming into the market now allow for basically 20% -- 15 percentage points out of the 20% improvement of the new planes, right? To get there, there's a lot of new technology in those.","This is one of the reasons also why you see these ramp-up issues currently in the aero engine supply chain. Also look at how much market share we have been able to win in the last years, also particularly on the engine side. So we believe that speaks for itself, or let our customers speak. They wouldn't have given this to us if they wouldn't be convinced that we are the right partner and have unique things to offer.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. That actually makes sense. One last one. I was just wondering if you could quantify how much on a percentage basis the fastening systems business was down in 2016? If you could help us size it? I think your last disclosure was $1.5 billion or so. So how much was it down? If you could just give us some context.","Ken Giacobbe","Historically, I don't know if we've gone, we've given the revenue, I believe.","Klaus Kleinfeld","I don't think we have.","Ken Giacobbe","But each of the business units, I don't think we've done that.","Gautam Khanna","I think in prior presentations the old Alcoa used to give $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion, then it was $1.5 billion. I'm just wondering where does it stand now? Because it seems like a big [Multiple Speakers].","Klaus Kleinfeld","So the total of, so, what's the fastener business in 2016? I think we can do that.","Ken Giacobbe","It was about $1.5 billion and that's the.","Gautam Khanna","How much was that down?","Ken Giacobbe","I'm sorry, Gautam?","Klaus Kleinfeld","How much was that down, was his question.","Gautam Khanna","How much was that down?","Ken Giacobbe","Okay. If you looked at it as a percentage basis, we're down approximately 5% year-over-year. Now, that's the pure fasteners like for like business. That doesn't include the rings business that we have with Firth Rixson. So that's an apples-to-apples comparison, about 5%.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. Your earlier point was that this related to kind of the supply chain min\/max changes as opposed to a 777 cut or so. So that's still.","Klaus Kleinfeld","No.","Gautam Khanna","Something that will [Multiple Speakers].","Klaus Kleinfeld","Howard, said it right. My point was the mix issue most substantially affects our global rolling business. Right. Whereas the mix issue is also, and in the global rolling business, you didn't really have a destocking effect through a consolidation of the supply chain. Whereas in the fastener business you had that as a very, very strong effect but the mix change also affects it. It's clear.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of John Tumazos with Very Independent Research.","John Tumazos","With the conversion to --.","Klaus Kleinfeld","I think, John, you have to speak up a little bit if possible, please.","John Tumazos","With the conversion of Knoxville into an automotive product, you'll have about 1.7 million tons of auto cold rolling. Knoxville was something like 40 or 50 billion cans worth of sheet, maybe 3 million autos worth of sheet. Do you expect to have the automotive programs in hand to run that full out automotive when you make the transition? Or might there be a lull while you wait?","Klaus Kleinfeld","No. First, two things, John. One is we are contractually obligated to supply Alcoa Corporation until they have qualified to deliver to their can sheet customers here in the U.S. from the rolling mill in Saudi Arabia. And the contractual obligation runs out in 2018. So they obviously have an interest to get this moved over as quickly as possible because that's beneficial to their profitability. But that's the first fact.","Second fact is, we do not intend to build-out the or change the packaging side of the Tennessee mill into an automotive line. We have -- because we have unique technology with the Micro-mill, you've seen it, John, so one of the things that we will most likely do, modify it and use it for some other value-add good but it will not go into automotive.","John Tumazos","So we shouldn't be waiting for five more F-150 announcements in the next few months?","Klaus Kleinfeld","Would be good.","John Tumazos","We're rooting for you, Klaus. We're rooting for you.","Klaus Kleinfeld","Thank you very much, John. Thank you.","Operator","There are no more questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Klaus Kleinfeld for closing remarks.","Klaus Kleinfeld","Okay. Thank you very much for listening in and our focus I hope has become very, very clear. It's on margin and RONA improvement. We are executing on the plans that we laid out during Investor Day and also showed more of it today. Thank you very much for listening. Looking forward to engage with you all soon.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation."],"2991":["Arconic, Inc. (NYSE:ARNC) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call November  5, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Paul Luther - Director, IR","John Plant - Chairman & CEO","Kenneth Giacobbe - EVP & CFO","Conference Call Participants","David Strauss - Barclays Bank","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company","Carter Copeland - Melius Research","Seth Seifman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Martin Englert - Jefferies","Joshua Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Arconic's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Dennis, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Paul Luther","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, and welcome to Arconic's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined by John Plant, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will take your questions. I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we've included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix in today's presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.","John Plant","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call this morning. We have a lot of content to get through, so let me start unpacking some of the items. Let's move to Slide 4. Starting this quarter, we will be reporting the results in two new segments. This is to provide increased visibility into the two successor companies post separation. On Slide 4, you will see that our previous three segments of EP&S, TCS, and GRP will now be reported as Engineered Products and Forgings and Global Rolled Products, GRP. EP&F contains 4 business units of engine products, fastening systems, engineered structures, and forged wheels. EP&F will be part of the new company, Howmet Aerospace, and will be RemainCo.","Regarding Global Rolled Products, we will be adding our building and construction business to this segment. This entity will be SpinCo and named Arconic Corporation. Throughout the presentation today, we will refer to EP&F and GRP as the new segments. ","Now move to Slide 5, and I'll comment on highlights for the third quarter. The third quarter was strong. Revenue was $3.6 billion. Organic revenue, which adjusts for currency, aluminum price, and portfolio changes was up 6% as we continue to grow in many of our key markets. EP&F organic revenue was up 8% year-over-year and GRP up 5%.","Operating income, excluding special items, was up 36%, and margin was up 340 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially from Q2. I would like to comment on each segment's year-over-year margin profit expansion. Engineered Products and Forgings segment's operating margin expanded by 330 basis points. Global Rolled Products segment's operating margin also expanded by 330 basis points. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.58 and up 81%. Q3 earnings per share was the best Q3 earnings per share performance for Arconic. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding separation costs, was $142 million in Q3 year-to-date and up $155 million from last year.","We continue to return money to shareholders with the completion of 200 million of common stock share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have completed $1.1 billion of stock share repurchases at a weighted average acquisition price of $20.67 for a total of 53.2 million shares. After tax, return on net assets was 13.8%, up 550 basis points year-over-year. Later in the call, I will comment on the regular items that I stated in the February earnings call, namely cost reduction, pricing, capital allocation, divestitures, and portfolio separation. I will then provide an update to our guidance. Earnings per share guidance will be raised for the third time in 2019.","Let me turn it over to Ken to give a deeper view of Q3 performance.","Kenneth Giacobbe","Thank you, John. Now let's move to Slide 6 and the key financial results for the quarter. Organic revenue was strong for the third quarter, up $220 million year-over-year with EP&F up 8% and GRP up 5%. EP&F had growth in all of its markets. Its highest growth market was aerospace, which represents over 70% of its revenue. GRP was up 5% and delivered double-digit revenue growth in aerospace, industrial products, and packaging with softness in automotive as the Ford F-150 is transitioning to the next-generation model.","In order to give you increased visibility into revenue for the 2 new segments, we have added organic revenue by market along with revenue distribution for each new segment in the appendix. Operating income, excluding special items for the third quarter, was $475 million, up 36% year-over-year. We delivered the third consecutive quarter of price increases with a $36 million favorable impact year-over-year. Price increases spanned across both segments driven by aerospace, industrial, and commercial transportation. We expect favorable pricing to continue as demand for our products remain strong.","Higher volumes in the third quarter also favorably impacted operating income by 22 million, mainly driven by aerospace. Lower raw material costs, including aluminum price was favorable to operating income, 39 million in the quarter. Net cost reductions were led by our cost-out program, which generated approximately $70 million of year-over-year savings in the quarter. This was partially offset by 3 items. First, the transition of our Tennessee plant out of North America packaging to more profitable industrial products. The Tennessee plant continues to improve each quarter. We expect Q4 to be the inflection point with year-over-year profit improvement.","The second item was performance at one of our aluminum extrusion plants. We are addressing the issues with operational improvements and pricing actions. However, we have additional opportunities for improvement.","Lastly, we had higher compensation costs driven by improved performance in profit, cash, and equity value. We have included the reconciliation of operating income, excluding special items, on Slide 32 of the appendix.","Adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter was $175 million or $60 million more than the third quarter of last year. Please note that consistent with our guidance, we have excluded $21 million of unfavorable cash flow in the quarter related to the planned separation. Pension contribution and OPEB payments were $96 million in the quarter, which was $26 million more than the third quarter of 2018. Year-to-date pension contributions and OPEB payments are $276 million, which is on track with our annual estimate of $350 million detailed on Slide 17 in the appendix.","Capital expenditures in the quarter were $108 million, which is down approximately $100 million year-over-year. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow excluding separation costs is $155 million higher than the prior year. Year-to-date, the improved free cash flow generation was driven primarily by 4 favorable items: higher net income, lower pension contributions, lower capital expenditures, and lower interest payments. These favorable items were somewhat offset by working capital to support our revenue growth.","Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.58 per share and 81% higher than the comparable period. The higher diluted earnings per share primarily was driven by operational improvements of $0.15, lower raw material cost of $0.06, and lower share count of $0.03.","Now let's move to the pretax special items on Slide 7. In the third quarter, our reported results included $149 million of pretax special items. Approximately 90% of the charges related to 2 items. First, $110 million noncash charge, primarily associated with the divestiture of the forgings business in the U.K. and an aluminum rolling mill in Brazil. Net proceeds associated with the divestitures are estimated to be approximately 110 million.","The second special item is a cash charge of $25 million associated with planned separation. More details concerning special items for the quarter can be found on Slide 18 in the appendix.","For the year, a majority of the special items incurred to date have been consistent with the stated plan of divesting of assets or businesses that do not fit with our focus, businesses that require significant capital investment with unacceptable returns or businesses that are not material to our bottom line. As you would expect, approximately 80% of the charges to date are noncash.","Now let's move to Slide 8. In the third quarter, EP&F's revenue was $1.8 billion. Organic revenue was up 8%. Segment operating profit was a record at $363 million, up 28%. The increase in segment operating profit was driven by several favorable items, including volume growth in aerospace engines, aerospace defense and commercial transportation. Additionally, we had lower raw material costs, higher pricing and net cost reductions.","The resulting segment operating margin expanded by 330 basis points year-over-year to 20.2%. In the third quarter, GRP's revenue was also $1.8 billion. Organic revenue was up 5%. Segment operating profit was $161 million, up 50% year-over-year. The favorable year-over-year improvement in segment operating profit was driven by growth in our packaging, industrial and aerospace markets. Also, we had favorable pricing in industrial and commercial transportation, lower aluminum prices and net cost reductions, including improvements in our internal scrap utilization. Despite the challenges in aluminum extrusions and the Tennessee transition, GRP's segment operating margin increased 330 basis points to 9.1%.","Now let's move to Slide 9 with the key achievements. Our EP&F business had record quarterly revenue for aerospace engines and aerospace defense. On a year-over-year basis, organic revenue was up as follows: aerospace engines, 11%; aerospace defense, 18%; and commercial transportation, 6%.","Favorable pricing improvements in the EP&F continued in the third quarter as we achieved an $18 million year-over-year increase in prices. GRP's commercial airframe revenue was up 12% organically year-over-year. Price improvements in the industrial products and commercial transportation markets resulted in an $18 million of year-over-year price increases. Improvements in internal scrap utilization resulted in more than a 25% increase in internal scrap consumption versus the same quarter of last year.","Arconic's return on net assets was 13.8%, which is up 550 basis points year-over-year. Year-to-date, CapEx is $412 million, down $85 million year-over-year. Approximately 70% of the CapEx has been spent on return-seeking projects as we expand aerospace airfoils, aerospace rings, industrial products and forged wheels capacity.","Lastly, a comment on our U.S. pension asset returns. As of September 30, our year-to-date asset returns were approximately 17%. At the end of the year, we will remeasure our net pension and OPEB liability taking into account the full year 2019 asset returns and end-of-year discount rates.","Through September, interest rates have declined substantially since 2018. If we remeasured having -- if the remeasurement had occurred at the end of Q3, the strong asset returns would have partially offset the lower discount rate.","Before turning it back to John, let me briefly provide an update on our capital structure on Slide 19 in the appendix. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion of cash after executing approximately $1.1 billion of share repurchases year-to-date. Gross debt is $6.3 billion and net debt stands at $5 billion. Net debt to EBITDA continues to improve year-over-year despite the cash flow associated with the share repurchases. Net debt to EBITDA stands at 2.25x, which is an improvement of 7% compared to the third quarter of 2018. We expect that based on our current guidance, fourth quarter net debt to EBITDA will be less than a year ago quarter despite executing approximately $1.1 billion of share repurchases.","With that, let me turn it back to John.","John Plant","Thanks, Ken, and let's move to Slide 10 on our key focus areas. For all items, we're either ahead or on track with our commitments. Third quarter year-to-date operating cost reductions were $137 million. The 2019 annual cost reduction target is being increased to $180 million, up from our prior commitments of $140 million. Run rate operating costs are projected to be reduced by $280 million, up from our prior commitment of $260 million.","Regarding pricing, we had three consecutive quarters of year-over-year price increases. Third quarter year-to-date price increases are $111 million. And as commented upon in a prior earnings call, price increases are not just a 2019 phenomenon. They're now part of our rolling LTA renewal process. With the future Howmet Aerospace business, 2020 and 2021 price increases are already planned.","Moving on to capital allocation. Year-to-date, we completed 3 common stock share repurchases totaling $1.1 billion. The weighted average purchase price was $20.67 or 53.2 million shares. Management has a total of $400 million of remaining common stock repurchase authority approved by the Arconic board in May of this year. In addition, our convertible notes settled in cash for $403 million on October 15, and no new shares of common stock were issued. These retirements further reduces our diluted share count by 15 million shares. This is additive to the $1.1 billion shares already disbursed on stock repurchases in 2019 and that also has the benefit of reducing both gross debt burden and share count. Absent other activity, year-end diluted share count is reduced by approximately -- sorry, it reduced to approximately 440 million shares, a 13% reduction year-on-year.","CapEx continues to be on track with a year-to-date spend of $412 million, which is down 17% year-to-date. 70% of our CapEx is for return-seeking projects and sustaining capital, 30%. Moving onto divestitures. We are on track. Year-to-date, we have signed, foreclosed 5 transactions with approximately $180 million of net proceeds, including the transaction last week, which is the sale of our Changwon Korean extrusions plant for approximately $60 million. Our target proceeds were between $100 million and $200 million.","These five transactions, upon completion, will reduce annual sales by approximately $350 million with unlimited operating income impact as they were close to breakeven in aggregates. We have a further two planned disposals. Lastly, we have an update on separation. We continue to be on track for our stated Q2 2020 implementation with the Form 10 filing expected to be available during this quarter. Appointment and recruitment of two boards and management teams are on track. Estimated onetime operating costs of separation and CapEx costs remain unchanged. Having Howmet Aerospace be RemainCo results in debt breakage costs being a maximum of only $38 million. By stating this, you can deduce a substantial part of the future capital structure.","Moving on to Slide 11. Before updating guidance, I mentioned in Q2 that I intended to provide another example of profit improvement as part of my statement that I saw price and mix making significant further contributions beyond the cost reduction program. This is further to the BCS example I provided in Q2. This time, I'll focus on Global Rolled Products. This segment improved operating income by 330 basis points in Q3 compared to the prior year. As we look forward to 2020, a key driver of margin expansion will be the completion of the Tennessee rolling mill profit improvement plan. At the end of 2018, we exited the North American packaging business and repurposed assets, including making a $100 million investment to expand our industrial rolled products business. The project is on track to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2020.","The plan has been to transition from North American packaging and marginal business to industrial products, which is supported by the China common alloy trade case implemented by the International Trade Commission. The trade case has enacted antidumping duties and countervailing duties on Chinese imports ranging from 96% to 176% effective December 2018, and we expect them to at last for at least five years.","These duties were applied to approximately 800 million pounds of Chinese industrial rolled product that were being imported into North America annually. Our transition to industrial products began in Q1 of this year and resulted in an unfavorable year-over-year impact in Q1 of $22 million. The second quarter improved but was still unfavorable year-over-year and an impact of $16 million. As we discussed earlier, Q3 has improved once again to an unfavorable $5 million hit year-over-year, which is in line with our expectations.","Q4 is expected to be our inflection point, where we will see year-over-year profits. We expect this transition when complete to more than double the profitability of our Tennessee rolling mill by the end of next year. Tennessee is our second largest rolling mill in terms of revenue. As you can model, eliminating low-margin packaging business in North America and substituting an increasingly profitable industrial rolled coil business and sheet significantly adds to our margin expansion.","A second item that I would like to discuss is earnings volatility in the GRP segment, which results from changes in aluminum prices. We continue to improve our commercial agreements with pass-through arrangements. Additionally, this year, our aluminum hedging program no longer requires quarter end mark-to-market. This combination of pass-through contracts and our hedging program mitigates over 90% of our aluminum exposure in our rolled product segment. We expect reduced earnings volatility from aluminum prices going forward. Hence, our business is essentially the conversion of aluminum ingots into rolled coils and plates and the dependency upon metal and, hence, volatility reduced.","Moving to Slide 12. Finally, an update on our 2019 annual guidance. In the light of current performance, we're updating and raising our earnings per share guidance for the year. This reflects our performance expectations in the fourth quarter and the fact that year-to-date, we have already earned an adjusted earnings per share of $1.58. The adjusted earnings per share forecast for the year increases to $2.07 to $2.11. At midpoint, this will be an increase of approximately 54% year-over-year and at the higher end, will be in the 60% plus. Annual revenue will be revised to $14.15 billion to $14.35 billion. This change is mainly attributed to the lower assumed aluminum prices for both LME and Midwest premium, which are mostly passed on to our customers and also to the divestitures, which are closed and planned to be closed by the -- during the fourth quarter.","Organic year-over-year annual revenue growth for the year is expected to be between 6% and 7%. Adjusted free cash flow guidance, excluding separation costs for the year, remains at between $700 million and $800 million. Further to the free cash flow guidance, capital expenditures are projected to be $625 million, excluding CapEx associated with separation. 2019 CapEx as a percentage of revenue is expected to be 4.4%. The CapEx guide for 2020 and going forward is less than 4% of revenue.","Regarding free cash flow conversion, it's projected to be approximately 80% of net income in 2019. The EBITDA guidance has been increased and narrowed to $2.325 billion plus or minus $25 million. At midpoint, this is an increase of approximately $350 million year-over-year with the execution of our fundamental improvement -- profit improvement program, including pricing. The updated guidance assumes that the Q4 737 MAX will remain at current levels pending the outcome of regulatory release of that aircraft.","Let me provide context for the full year guidance. Earnings per share at midpoint have been raised again and by more than the beat from Q3. The savings program results, as noted earlier, are being raised by a further $40 million and have more than offset the effects of 3 items: firstly, the increase in estimated cost to cover compensation due to the higher profit performance and the higher share price estimates for the fourth quarter; second, slightly lower rolled products, aluminum coil sales due to a quarter of inventory correction by distributors following their overly imported product from Europe to cover the market shortfall emanating from the Chinese tariffs; and thirdly, the effect of the GM strike, which has now been settled. The midpoint of the EBITDA guidance range has been raised and timed.","Moving to Slide 13. You will see that the new segment historical performance, this segment information shows the EBITDA performance of what will become part of the future Howmet. This shows that Howmet is -- it is in the top quartile of aerospace companies. And it shows that it is a truly differentiated company.","Also of note is the improvement in rolling asset returns and from what is and also a truly unique set of rolling assets. Improvement in volume, price and the cost-out program are improving revenue segment operating profit and margin year-over-year, and we expect continued year-over-year margin expansion in both segments in Q4. As we look to 2020, we will be providing revenue and profit guidance on the next earnings call as we get greater clarity on aerospace build rates, which impact both segments.","Regarding 2020 corporate costs and free cash flow conversion, projections are as follows. Annual corporate costs, including corporate depreciation and amortization for Howmet Aerospace, are expected to be between $80 million and $90 million. Arconic Corp. will be similar at between $75 million and $85 million. As previously mentioned, the total corporate costs of the combined 2 new businesses will be less than the corporate costs of today's Arconic Inc.","Regarding free cash flow conversion. For Arconic Inc, it is projected to be approximately 80% in 2019. In 2020, we estimate that Howmet Aerospace free cash flow conversion will be higher than 80% and Arconic Corporation to be less than 80%.","Two final items before I turn it over to Q&A. First, regarding Grenfell Tower. Last quarter, I mentioned that in addition to funding replacement planning for relevant high-rise public building and sector housing, the U.K. government has established a fund to refurbish private high-rise buildings, which have aluminum composite planning systems, and which are unlikely to meet future U.K. building regulations.","This fund will cover buildings for which owners, architects and structural engineers specified the ACM from our AAP SAS, our French subsidiary. This cladding was then fabricated and fitted by contractors as one component of the cladding and insulation system. This potential cladding remediation will be beneficial regarding contribution of these systems to the future fire risk in U.K. high-rise buildings. The details of the refurbishment process and fund still continue to be developed.","Secondly, the first U.K. public inquiry has now been completed and its report was issued last week. This is available for your reading. You will recall that the first inquiry and report had the objective of examining the events that took place on the night of the fire and how the fire spread and the response to it. The second public inquiry will commence in 2020 and is expected to most likely report out in 2021. This inquiry will examine why the events unfolded as they did and why certain choices were made with regards to the refurbishment of the tower.","Lastly, our next quarter updates will be the Form 10 filing, which will be available later this year -- this quarter; the Q4 results at the end of January, which will include guidance for 2020; and finally, assuming everything continues to be on track for separation, investor days will be held later in February for Howmet Aerospace and Arconic Corp., at which the guidance and outlook we'll provide you for each of the separated companies. A save-the-date note will be issued.","And with that, I'd like to open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.","David Strauss","John, you previously talked about, I think, 300 basis points of margin upside at BCS. Can you give us an update as to where that stands in terms of your progression towards that target?","John Plant","I think we've already exceeded it. I can't remember the exact number. Ken is just going to pull it up, but I think we're already there. But Ken, if you can...","Kenneth Giacobbe","Yes. So, the 8-K filing we did last week, they have the former segment structure and then you can look at the adders for each of the businesses. But if you looked at BCS from 2018 to the second quarter of '19, looking at about 390 basis points of improvement, so . So that's accelerated from end of '18 to Q2. So, to John's point, already there. But if you look through the 8-K filing, you can see that the former segments have accelerated from 2018 to the current state and then you can also see that BCS has accelerated and wheels has accelerated as well.","David Strauss","Okay. As a follow-up on the free cash flow guide for the full year, it looks like working capital days were up a little bit in Q3. Where do working capital days have to get to in Q4 to hit the free cash flow target for the full year? I think it looks like $600 million to $700 million in free cash flow that's implied in Q4.","John Plant","I'll go in first and pass it across to Ken. First of all, inventory days improved in the quarter. We were slightly off on the receivable days. But Ken, if you can comment on...","Kenneth Giacobbe","You're exactly right. So, we missed about one day on the DSO primarily. A lot of our customers have been pushing out terms[ph], however, inventory payables offset, I don't expect a material change, David, in terms of working capital contribution for the inventory side of the house. But in aggregate, our working capital will be a contributor to free cash flow as we exit the year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company.","Gautam Khanna","A couple of questions. First, I was hoping you could talk about the 737 rate you guys actually experienced in Q3, and what you expect in Q4, and maybe just categorize that by engine and airframe, and then I have a follow-up.","John Plant","Yes. The aircraft, we understand is being built out at 42. Spirit, on the fuselage, has been building at close to 52. And in engine, I'm going to say it's around about 48 engine builds, and maybe a little bit of, I'm going to say, inventories come out of -- on that side in favor of the CFM, whereas CFM spares have been prioritized in our supply.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. What's your expectation for Q4 as well?","John Plant","Yes, exactly. I think it'll just stay in line with that. I think the next event is the recertification, which everybody's waiting for. And hopefully, that will occur at the end of the year and that will help us when we give our revenue guidance at the end of January and chose not to do anything further at this stage until we know what the position is regarding that aircraft.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And as a follow-up, may I ask if -- Ken, it's all about the capital structure and the pension allocation, how that might split between the two new entities. And maybe Ken, if you can just talk a little bit also about where the pension resides right now, the pension OPEB deficit, the earlier[ph] proportion to the two companies.","John Plant","[Multiple speakers]I mean basically, the majority of the pension and its allocation are set by the plants, and the allocation of the corporate costs into the 2 future corporate headquarters in total is probably about 20% discretionary, which is the remaining corporate what -- where is that allocated for, say retirees. We have a plan, and let\u2019s say we're going through that and finalize that at our December Board meeting to get that part of the capital structure nailed down.","Kenneth Giacobbe","And the only thing I'd add to that, Gautam, is we'll line up the pensions on January 1. You should have a view of the capital structure in Q1 as we're targeting separation in Q2. So, you'll see the capital structure in Q1.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. May I just ask one last one? John, are you actually considering staying on as part of the management structure for Howmet or is this going to be [indiscernible]?","John Plant","Well, I clearly don't want to preempt the search committee of the Board, which is active and been moving through that, and first round, I think, interviews have now been completed. I will engage with the search committee as they, I'd say, short list during the latter part of November and then see where we are. I mean the way that we've left it is that I have agreed to provide continuity through the piece and beyond as necessary. And meanwhile, the search committee is trying to find the right candidates to go forward. And then, it remains for a dialog between myself and the Board should that process come to fruition and then also what engagement would they like to see and what engagement shareholders would like to see for me going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.","Carter Copeland","A question on the CapEx for -- you stated for 2020, the expectations around the 4 -- less than 4% of revenue for the aggregated entity. Should we think about CapEx for the two pieces being materially different than that or having different investment profiles in 2020 and beyond?","John Plant","First of all, the 4% was not meant just for 2020. I actually said 2020 and beyond, Carter. That was trying to give like a view of how I think capital should be deployed in the business on a long-term basis. And so, I was trying to get more meaning into those words, which may have not been spotted. Inevitably, there will be a difference between the 2 companies, but in my current thought, which will be amplified in those Investor Days going forward is that both entities will be below 4%.","Carter Copeland","Should there -- should we consider that there -- I guess, at the heart of the question is are there different investment profiles and opportunities in the 2 entities? I would assume that some of the rate upside for Howmet will point to different opportunities, but I'm not sure how you consider that comparing.","John Plant","Yes. I mean, if you look at the underlying, I'll say, growth and growth opportunity with what I think I'm trying to say is a truly differentiated aerospace business, then I think the prospects or the percentage growth over, let's call it, the next phase of the aerospace cycle, inevitably are greater. And it's particularly not only when I look at the future aircraft build, but when I -- but and really importantly for me is that when I look at the last decade and beyond, then we've had aerospace builds above 6% -- maybe 6% or 7%. And of course, what that's been doing is to put a huge amount of aircraft, which will be in the aircraft park, and I've been particularly focused on what is that increase in aircraft park look like over the next decade. And therefore, the solidity of the future order book and things like -- just take the CFM engine, which is -- it's not going to peak in service visits just back to shop until 2025.","So when you look at the superb aerospace, I'll say, production over the last decade or so, those aircraft are going to be in the park and requiring future servicing, which is really important for our engine air force business, and I'll talk more to that in February.","There are also growth opportunities on the rolled product side, but in -- I mean these are huge singular asset investments. And we've -- I'm only intending that we would add capacity breaking for bottlenecks where we see. And I do see the opportunity of increasing substantially the throughput from our mills with very little capital.","Carter Copeland","Great. And then Ken, just a quick follow-up. Can you help us maybe with the sensitivity around pension and OPEB funding as you look out now given the change in the discount rate?","Kenneth Giacobbe","Yes. Carter, what I would look at is the 10-K from 2018. We gave a 2-year look in there in terms of the cash contributions. I'd use that to your average based on where we are right now. If we had to strike it today and remeasure it, those asset returns, it's 17% or about better than 90% of our peer set. So you push all that together, I don't see a material change in the contribution that are listed in the 10-K from 2018.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","John, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the 787 rate decrease that Boeing announced and the impact that, that might have.","John Plant","Yes. I mean, I've seen the announcement of 14 aircraft coming out of 12 at the end of 2020. Inevitably, because some of our products, for example, our fastener business, which will ultimately be impacted before that from the supply chain. And as I think everybody knows that in fact, our total content for Howmet was actually greater on a composite aircraft compared to a, let's say, an aluminum-skinned aircraft, which is obviously good news in terms of the overall direction for the company if there are more composite aircraft builds, in particular for fasteners. But when we look through the whole piece for next year, at the moment, we see the impacts of that rate reduction probably of around about $0.02 impact, which within the context of our 2020 guidance when we give it, we just lost in noise.","Seth Seifman","Okay. And then maybe following up on the CapEx discussion you were just having. I mean 70% of the -- this year's CapEx, I guess, return seeking. I mean, the implication there, should we think about that the -- kind of the maintenance CapEx level is $200-ish million or a little below? And the gap between that and the four -- a little bit sub-4% of sales that you talk about is expectations of future return-seeking projects?","John Plant","Yes. I mean I think it's probably a little bit below the $200 million. I'm going to probably try to nail that for you a little bit more accurately at the end of the year when we've completed the year. And the future percentage will obviously vary by the compression of the top line of the total capital expenditure. But as you can imagine, when you adjust for the underlying growth of our businesses, those are going to be up in 2020. We adjust obviously negatively for the disposal and apply a sub-4% number, then you can see it's going to be less than this year's number for sure. And maybe the percentage, which will be maintenance, will flex according to the -- what the total number is and that, we intend to give you at the end of January.","Kenneth Giacobbe","And Seth, the only thing I'd add to that is there's 4 major projects this year on the CapEx that were in that return-seeking number with that aerospace airfoils expansion in Whitehall, Michigan; the aerospace rings in Rancho Cucamonga in California; and the forged aluminum wheels in Hungary. Those projects, those growth projects pretty much complete this year, fully operational in Q1 of next year, might have only about a $50 million CapEx tail in 2020 for the Howmet Aerospace business.","Then if you look on the GRP side, it's the industrial expansion that John talked about, probably have about a $40 million to $50 million tail next year there. So the growth CapEx major projects are done. To John's earlier point, if there would be growth, it will be the debottlenecks in plants at some smaller amounts. That's why we feel so comfortable in the sub-4% CapEx spend.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Martin Englert with Jefferies.","Martin Englert","In GRP, you noted strength in packaging volumes. Can you remind us again of your packaging exposure? How much volume growth you saw there for the quarter versus the prior year? And also, if any contracts are reopening soon and anticipated pricing on that?","John Plant","Yes. I'll give you the overall context and then give -- pass it across to Ken for the specific percentages. So let's do it by region. North America packaging, zero. We pulled out of it, and that's the transition to industrial, which we've been talking about.","In Russia, we have something like 95%-plus market share of the packaging business in Russia. And I think the exports a little bit in Europe, we're examining further opportunities there given what I think is an emerging market for additional packaging in that region. We also -- and that has exhibited strong growth in the third quarter and this year.","In China, we also have packaging, which also grew -- I mean, not that we don't have the market share that I talked. It's going to be coming out of Russia. But again, good growth in the quarter. But those are the 2 regions of the world where we still do packaging. And as you know, we will have withdrawn from Brazil by next year, so that's -- I choose not to comment on. And Ken, just specific percentages?","Kenneth Giacobbe","Yes. Martin, so for third quarter, Slide 22 of the appendix, it's up about 17% year-over-year for the regions that John mentioned. And again, we've taken our traditional organic revenue by market chart for total Arconic Inc. and split it out into the 2 new segments. You have visibility there in terms of what the growth rates are as well as the distribution of revenue. So for example, as I mentioned earlier, at Howmet Aerospace, you can see the 70% plus of the revenue is tied to aero.","Martin Englert","And maybe just circling back, I know you're expanding the Tennessee or repurposing the Tennessee GRP operations away from packaging. But have you given any thought about reengaging the North American packaging market after your noncompete concludes like 2020?","John Plant","We haven't decided anything at the moment, that's not been our focus. As you say, we have a noncompete and therefore, for us, it's not -- it's been a moot point. I mean, I think the only thing I do note is that I'm going to call it the anti-plastic environmental movement seems to be gathering speed. It's probably led more from Europe and Asia. But there are clear examples of where major, I'll say, beverage companies are moving to aluminum cans. And what that produces over the next few years, I don't think any of us truly know this point. I don't think it's a point yet where we can say that there is a clear case for market capacity shortage. And maybe we'll just watch that and see what opportunity, if any, come of it and to see what response the, I'll tell you, the plastics industry makes to this because they've been particularly innovative over the years. So I see currently no case for jumping back into something. And I think to wait and see is probably a more appropriate at this stage, and we'll see how it develops.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global.","Joshua Sullivan","Can you just expand on the overall pricing improvements? Are you getting price on the growth CapEx you're investing in here? And then what products or markets are you really having traction with on the pricing front?","John Plant","It's going -- normally, reversal, it's a normal -- I mean on GRP, it's a function of the industrial pricing year-on-year because of the international trade agreements and combine that with that shortage in the market in terms of shortage of capacity. So there's that and that, combined with the mix opportunity of pulling out of North America packaging. On aerospace, on Howmet Aerospace, it's really examining each of the contracts as they come up for renewal. And now I'm going to call it as an average cycle of LTAs. There's something every year, but they're on a roughly a 3-year cycle. So that we have now clear line of sight of those which occur in 2020 and 2021 and so on, and really examining the competitive dynamic in those segments and also making sure that Howmet really has the value for what I think is some truly unique capabilities especially in the hot end of the aircraft engine. And the most -- the best example I'd like to give is the engine temperatures, which are there on the latest military jets. ","So for example, the Joint Strike Fighter, where those operated very much higher temperatures than the commercial engine markets. But -- and we have the unique capabilities to meet those requirements with not only the sophistication of the coils to go inside these foils to provide the airflow, but also the coatings that go with them and to operate substantially above the melt temperatures of those, and those are up well into the -- well above 3000 degrees Fahrenheit. What happens afterwards of course is that with the emissions requirements for commercial aviation, the -- so lower, I'll say lower emissions, higher fuel efficiency. What that does is basically, it's more pressure and higher temps, and so that unique capability that we have enables us to flow that down into successive generations of the commercial aerospace market. And so that will be the answer, the prime example. But it's not confined just to that. I would look at other commodities as well, but that would be the best example just to give you one on the telephone here. And so I'm just trying to make sure that unique differentiated technology that we have is truly valued in the industry.","Joshua Sullivan","Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the divestiture front, do you feel you mostly have the portfolios of the two entities where you want them at this point? Or could we see some additional portfolio shaping that hasn't been announced so far?","John Plant","I think in terms of disposals, when we've completed the next 2, that will probably be it in terms of, I'll say, disposal of assets, which I saw as fundamentally underperforming and contributing -- in fact, dragging on the overall portfolio and chose that rather than try to change that view. I'll say the view that we can fix everything, the answer is no, there are certain things we can't and shouldn't bother with. Let's play our energies to where we see more opportunities, and so getting rid of things, which I think we are structurally disadvantaged, is the best approach. Focus our energies on where we have true differentiated advantage for the future and to see where we can expand those both organically, but also if there are opportunities, we'd look at those as well. So if you're asking are we going to sell lots more stuff, the answer is fundamentally no.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","A question on the revenue side given all the moving parts coming into the end of the year. Can you give us some puts and takes as we look into next year around the impact from aluminum and the end market noise like the 787 or commercial transport? And then the impact of asset sales there too? Essentially, I'm trying to see if we shouldn't be thinking of next year as being a mid-single digit plus type year in organic revenues or overall revenues, for that matter, given all the moving pieces.","John Plant","Let me deal with metals first. Because again, I'd like to blow away -- if I could blow away, once and for all, the confusion which sometimes come around that. Inevitably, I mean, this Howmet Aerospace, low volatility company, top quartile performance. That's that way you should think about it. In terms of GRP, inevitably, there is metal volatility associated with -- essentially with the packaging business in those entities. But we've been working hard to reduce the volatility on earnings because of the pass-through aspect of it. We're a conversion business. Of course, at the top line, on what will be Arconic Corp, inevitably if LME drops -- as its drops, let's say, $150 per ton in the last few months, that's about a dropping Midwest premium. Inevitably, it's a revenue fall, so that's why the large reason why we've trimmed our guidance for the year, it's irrelevant for the bottom line. And so in the quarter, you have revenue, we are probably $30 million light first. Metals was like almost $70 million, and so we overperformed on an organic basis. ","When you look forward, what I expect is fundamentally low volatility from Howmet, aircraft build increases, we'll get the MAX out of the way. And so I see that we should be adding value over and above whatever aircraft build will be if they were how I think about Howmet. In terms of GRP, there, you've got a little bit of volatility on the -- I think, I'd say volatility on the top line according to where does LME go and Midwest premium. And that's dampened volatility in the future on the bottom line, but inevitably you've got fundamentally a little bit of a fraction more volatile business there exposed to obviously a much wider mix of that market so industrial, commercial transportation plus aerospace and packaging outside of North America. And where do those markets go, I'm thinking again, aerospace up, industrials steady, commercial transportation's probably on a downward thing at the moment into 2020. But when you look at the opportunities from the shortage, which was in capacity -- in the North American aluminum market, I just think it all ends up as a wash. And with our ability to bring further throughput from our assets, I'm encouraged by our GRP business. So more to be done, but that's the way I think about the top line.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. And then as a follow-up, looking at the engineered products business. Previously, you talked a lot about operational headwinds. Where are we in that overall? Any parts of the business where there's some weakness? And then relating to that, as we do start to get the MAX ramping again, how confident are you that we won't start to see some of those prior headwinds start to show up again?","John Plant","MAX being where it is has been -- obviously, it's just been a steadying influence for us. It's enabled us to further improve down the learner curves from the -- on the LEAP engine in particular. So on that side, I'll say everything is smooth. That's the way I see the engine build developing into 2020. I would imagine it'll stay where it is for the time being and may begin to inflect upwards towards the back end of the year should Boeing increase their production rates of the 57 that they've talked about. So with the additional capacities coming on stream from both Whitehall for the casting operations and Morristown from the core operations, that's going to take a lot of stress out of our system and with the revenue opportunity of delivering more. So I don't expect headwinds going forward in terms of production issues. And we're trying to address those this year, including where we've had capacity shortage in our structural casting business.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. This does conclude the Arconic's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect. "],"2985":["Arconic Inc.

Good morning and welcome to Arconic's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. I am joined by Chip Blankenship, Chief Executive Officer and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by Chip and Ken, we will take your questions.","I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings.","In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix to today's presentation.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Chip.","Chip Blankenship","Thanks Patricia. Good morning and thank you for joining the call. I will begin with an overview, then Ken will take you through our financial results in more detail, after which I will provide an update to our 2018 annual guidance. We will then take your questions.","In the first quarter, revenue grew by 8% year-over-year, driven by volume gains in all segments. Our revenue was strong and our key markets remained healthy. Organic revenue growth was 4%. Operating income was lower than anticipated. On a year-over-year basis, we delivered net cost savings along with volume growth, but this was more than offset by headwinds from higher aluminum prices and performance shortfalls in our rings, disks and global rolled products operations.","Our progress since the acquisition of the rings and discs assets from Firth Rixson is unacceptable. Although revenue was inline with prior year, increased costs associated with outsourced operations and lower yields impacted our margins. Turning around these operations will require additional resources and time.","GRP operating income was below our expectations driven by higher aluminum prices and unfavorable aerospace wide-body production mix. We also experienced higher outside processing costs and lower material yield than planned, both issues that we know how to fix. We have a sense of urgency in our operational cadence and CapEx solutions to address both issues. TCS operating income was down slightly as strong operational performance was offset by higher aluminum prices. Free cash flow was inline with expectations.","In 1Q, we made incremental pension contributions of $124 million and had a favorable change in working capital of $112 million year-over-year. Our cash position is $1.2 billion and we have liquidity of $5 billion. Moreover, we continue to drive down our pension liability. In the first quarter, we decreased our pension liability by $315 million through cash contributions and the recently announced pension freeze. We completed the $500 million early debt paydown announced at the beginning of year.","Now, I would like to share some observations for my first 100 days. First on customers. I met with 12 of our largest customers and their feedback was mixed regarding our delivery performance. On some of our aerospace component programs, we are producing above our share to support customers, but on others we are behind customer demand. We have been prioritizing delivery to serve customers at incremental cost. The engine ramp up and demand for narrow-body aircraft is substantial and the team is focused on creeping our capacity upwards through lean improvements in the short-term. We have capital expansion projects underway to match our capacity with long-term demand. We know how to turn this for mixed results into a positive story and we are mobilized to do just that.","Second, our people. I am impressed with the dedicated Arconic team members that I met during my site visits. I have made three key personnel changes. First, the three EP&S business unit presidents now report directly to me. This change will improve the speed of communication and decision-making. Second, I added a head of strategy and development to accelerate our portfolio review. Third, I had a commercial leader to ensure that we are focused on growth in the markets where we compete while I am focused on operational improvements. Third, operational excellence. I have been to 31 of our 151 sites which represent 34% of our revenue. My single biggest conclusion is that I see too much variation across our factories. Therefore, we are returning to the basics and reinvigorating our Arconic business system version of lean manufacturing. The plants that are executing well right now have strong ABS DNA in their people and production management systems. We will increase asset utilization and first pass yield as well as reduce cycle times and increase velocity through the plants that are constrained. We are introducing digital and physical automation to solve problems faster and introduce sustainable controls. We will attack and tighten up our metal loops to reduce losses and increase revert utilization.","I like to highlight the performance of our wheels factories and overall equipment effectiveness, quality, productivity and revert utilization. They have achieve world-class levels in all categories using the combination of ABS and smart manufacturing. This makes them role models for the rest of our company. We will drive these best practices throughout our network. For us to course correct here, it will take resources and time. We are hiring process engineering, quality, lean and operations people now and we have capital projects underway that will come online in 4Q of this year and feather in throughout 2019. The capital projects will have multiple impacts, including reduced cycle time, improved quality and less outside processing.","On the technology front, I am impressed with our current technology portfolio in alloy development, processing and surface treatment innovation. During my visits to our plants and the Arconic technology center, I participated in deep dives into our differentiated technologies associated with aircraft engine airfoil investment casting, surface treatments for automotive sheet and forged truck wheel applications, fasteners and additive manufacturing, just to name a few. These technologies play key roles and they help our current business revenues. Further development and emphasis will yield even more in the future. As an example, last week we announced new aluminum alloy compositions specifically tailored for additive manufacturing featuring enhanced printability as well as higher temperature properties.","Lastly, the strategy and portfolio review. The project is progressing well and we intend to complete this work in 3Q of this year. As a reminder of our framework, we are determining our strategic advantage or lack thereof in each product line and examine the business models including the prospects of the markets served and returns available with world class performance. We are conducting this review with an eye on the purpose of the company as it relates to synergies available in technology and manufacturing, management focus and shareholder returns.","Now I will turn it over to Ken who will take you through our first quarter results in more detail.","Ken Giacobbe","Thank you Chip. Let's move to slide six and the key financial results for the quarter. Revenue for the first quarter came in at $3.4 billion, up $253 million or 8% year-over-year as aluminum prices accounted for $109 million or approximately 40% of the increase. Revenue growth was driven by volume gains across all segments. Most of our key markets remained healthy, including aero engines, automotive, commercial transportation and defense.","While commercial aero engine revenue was up 5% per quarter, it's important to note that our aero airfoils business delivered double digit revenue growth this quarter. These markets were partially offset by anticipated weakness in aero airframes production mix and industrial gas turbines. Organic revenue, which adjusts for aluminum prices, currency, the 2017 Fusina divestiture and the Tennessee packaging ramp down, was up 4% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis. The reconciliation for organic revenue could be found on slide 17 in the appendix. We have also included year-over-year market growth rates on slide 18 in the appendix.","The next metric is operating income, which can be found on the face of the income statement. Operating income excluding special items was $345 million in the first quarter, down $45 million or 12% year-over-year. Similar to 2017, our operating income and operating income margin percent have been negatively impacted by higher aluminum prices as the average aluminum prices increased approximately 20% versus last year. In the first quarter, higher aluminum prices unfavorably impacted operating income by $37 million year-over-year and operating income margin percent by 140 basis points.","The aluminum price impacts, which include widening scrap spreads and aluminum derivative contracts are detailed by segment on slide 16 in the appendix. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect that the aluminum price impact year-over-year will be an unfavorable $45 million to $55 million at current prices. We will continue to call out aluminum price impacts on future earnings calls.","In addition to higher aluminum prices year-over-year, we have had two further unfavorable items of note. First, an unfavorable inventory impact of the new pension standard which will not repeat in the second quarter. The second relates to an unfavorable market factors at aerospace wide-body production mix and IGT. Our unfavorable items were partially offset by volume gains in aero engines, automotive, commercial transportation and net cost savings.","My previous comments include the impact of performance shortfalls in the rings, disks and global products operations. We have also included a reconciliation of operating income excluding special items on slide 28 in the appendix.","Operating income margin percentage excluding special items was 10% for the first quarter, down 220 basis points year-over-year. Approximately two-thirds of the year-over-year margin percent decline was due to higher aluminum prices.","Free cash flow for the first quarter was inline with expectations at a $417 million use of cash. This compares to a $403 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2017. Pension contributions were $424 million higher in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter a year ago. We continue to expect full year pension contributions to be in the range of $350 million this year.","The change in working capital in the first quarter of 2018 was a favorable $112 million versus the first quarter of 2017. Days working capital were flat on a year-over-year basis at 59 days. Capital expenditures were $117 million in the first quarter, which is 14% higher than a year ago same quarter as we focus on increasing velocity through our plans and insourcing operations where it makes sense.","Diluted earnings per share excluding special items was $0.34, or $0.01 higher than the first quarter of 2017. Lower interest expense and a lower operational tax rate of approximately 27% offset the impact of higher aluminum prices.","Now let's move to segment results on slide seven. EP&S's revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Organic revenue was up 2% as volume growth in aerospace engines, defense and industrial more than offset the decline in the IGT market and the headwinds due to aerospace airframe production mix. Segment operating profit was $220 million, down $26 million or 11% year-over-year. The performance shortfalls in our rings and discs operations combined with the unfavorable inventory impact of the new pension standard and the continued decline in the IGT market more than offset our favorable impact on aero engines in our net cost savings. Segment operating profit was 14.3%, down 230 basis points year-over-year, including 150 basis point negative impact due to the performance shortfalls in our rings and discs operations.","GRP revenue was $1.4 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year. Organic revenue was up 4% as volume growth in automotive and commercial transportation more than offset the decline in aerospace airframe production mix. Segment operating profit was $112 million, down $24 million or 18% year-over-year, driven by higher aluminum prices and an unfavorable aerospace wide-body production mix. This was partially offset by higher volume in the automotive market. Segment operating margin percent was 8.2%, down 270 basis points year-over-year, including 170 basis point negative impact due to higher aluminum prices.","TCS delivered $537 million of revenue, which was an increase of 18% year-over-year. Organic revenue was up 13% as we saw strong growth in commercial transportation. Segment operating profit was $67 million, down $1 million or 1% year-over-year. Favorable impacts include higher volume in commercial transportation and the building construction business, favorable currency movements and net cost savings. These favorable items were more than offset by higher aluminum prices and unfavorable product price and mix. Segment operating profit margin percent was 12.5%, down 240 basis points year-over-year, including a 350 basis points negative impact of higher aluminum prices.","Now let's move to the capital structure on slide eight. We finished the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash which was above our minimum operating cash level of between $600 million and $700 million. Gross debt now stands at $6.35 billion after completing the early redemption of $500 million of debt in March. We have paid down $2.5 billion of debt since the separation on November 1, 2016, which has reduced our annual interest expense by approximately $150 million per year. Additionally, net debt to EBITDA has improved 23% since the end of 2016 to 2.6 times. Finally, in the quarter, we reduced our pension liability by $315 million, driven by cash contributions and the pension freeze for our U.S. salaried and non-bargained hourly associates. This was announced in January and took effect on April 1 of this year. Our liquidity is strong at over $5 billion and we remain committed to managing our debt and reducing our liabilities.","Before turning it back over to Chip, let me cover a few items that will further clarify the financial results for the quarter and our annual guidance. On slide 12 in the appendix, we have summarized a number of key accounting changes that were adopted this quarter in accordance with FASB guidance.","First, non-service related pension and other post-employment benefit cost for the current period as well as prior periods have been reclassified out of operating income and into other income and expense on the income statement.","Second, cash receipts from sold receivables for the current period as well as prior periods have been reclassed from cash from operations to cash from investing activities on the cash flow statement. Please note that we did not change the net cash funding in the quarter from our AR securitization program. As a result of this classification, we have revised our free cash flow definition to include cash receipts from sold receivables to maintain our historical comparability and maintain consistency with our 2018 guidance. Slide 13 in the appendix provides more details on this change.","Third, payments related to early debt redemption for the current period as well as prior periods have been reclassified from cash from operations to cash from financing activities on the cash flow statement.","And finally, as we pointed out on our fourth quarter call, we have changed our primary measure of segment performance from adjusted EBITDA to segment operating profit to more closely align segment performance with operating income as presented on the income statement.","I will also note that segment operating profit includes certain items that were previously included in corporate namely LIFO, metal price lag, intersegment profit eliminations and derivative activities. Please note, the prior periods have been recast to conform to the current year presentation. We have provided slide 19 in the appendix, which details 2017 segment performance to assist in the transition to the new measure. The slide provides reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA as presented in 2017 to segment operating profit as recast in 2018.","Also on slide 14 in the appendix, we have summarized special items for the quarter. Let me just touch on them briefly. Restructuring related charges were $7 million, which consisted primarily of a $5 million pension curtailment, which related to the pension freeze announced in January. In the first quarter, we also incurred $5 million of external legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower which were recorded in SG&A. Also in the quarter, we had $19 million charge to interest expense related to the early redemption of our February 2019 notes.","Finally, I would like to give you some context on aluminum price impact to our updated 2018 guidance. As the company with a large U.S. presence, we utilize LIFO accounting to a greater extent than our comparable companies. Therefore the increasing volatility in aluminum prices will impact results to a greater degree, both on the upside when aluminum prices go down and on the downside when aluminum prices increase. As discussed on this call and previous calls, aluminum prices have unfavorably impacted our results over the last three quarters. It is important to note that over time as aluminum prices go up and down, the impact of aluminum prices should offset. However, during times of steep increases or decreases, you will see significant impact to our results.","With the announcement of the aluminum tariffs and Russian sanctions, we have currently experienced a steep increase. In fact, since the separation of Alcoa, aluminum prices have steadily increased by more than 40%. While we have historically said that LIFO and metal lag tender offset overtime, this statement assumes metal price rises and falls through a cycle. Unfortunately, aluminum prices have continued to increase since separation. Moreover, our updated 2018 guidance assumes that current prices will hold at these elevated levels. The aluminum price impact is consistent with our previous communicated sensitivities and along with metal lag are estimated to have an unfavorable impact of approximately $100 million for the year. Should aluminum prices decline, there would be a positive impact to our guidance.","In addition to the public sensitivities and metal lag, we have two further items impacting our 2018 guidance related to aluminum with approximate impact of $30 million for the year. The first relates to mark-to-market losses on the first quarter on our aluminum derivative contracts as well as our inability to head some aluminum purchases in mid April for our Russian plant in Samara. The second relates to a discount on aluminum scrap which has increased 32% from our original guidance. Since currently we are a net scrap seller, this will unfavorably impact our results through the remainder of the year. We are aggressively working to improve our scrap usage by leveraging the Arconic network of cast houses as well as investing in new melting capacity.","Let me now turn it back to Chip to update us on the guidance.","Chip Blankenship","Thank you Ken. As Ken said, due to rising aluminum prices and underperformance in our rings, disks and GRP operations, we are reducing guidance from the midpoint of $1.50 per share to the range of $1.17 to $1.27 per share. This assumes aluminum price and Midwest premium of $2,720 per metric ton for Q2 through Q4 and an average aluminum price and Midwest premium of $2,660 per metric ton. The 2018 average price is an increase over the 2017 average price by about $500 per metric ton and around $265 per metric ton over our original guidance. The impact of higher aluminum prices, including scrap rates and the trading desk, is $0.19 per share from our initial guidance.","Reduced earnings and higher metal costs will also impact free cash flow. We are reducing free cash flow guidance to $250 million for the year, down from $500 million. We are disappointed about lowering guidance for the year. Although two-thirds of the revisions are a result of higher metal prices, a significant portion is related to our operational performance. As I developed a deeper understanding of each business unit, it became clear to me that revisions were required. 2018 is a transition year as we are making investments in our future to position the company for long-term success and shareholder value creation.","With that, I would like to open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much and good morning. I wonder, Chip, if you can talk a little bit about your share in engines? The growth rates seemed to swell a little bit in the quarter to about 5%. We have seen some higher growth rates elsewhere. Are the execution challenges that you are having, particularly in rings and discs, having an impact on your share? And if so, do you see being able to make that up?","Ken Giacobbe","I think you called it right there, Seth. We are seeing a high double-digit increase in output from, say, our airfoils business, but rings and discs is really bringing down the overall increase that you noticed there in muting the engines output line in total.","Seth Seifman","Okay. And maybe can you give us a little bit more color about remediation plans you have? In terms of what you have seen so far, how much of the challenges in EPS are at rings and discs? Is it 100%? Is it 80%? And then when you think about the capital that you are investing, is the capital that you need just to have capacity or is the capital that you need to be more efficient? How would characterize it?","Chip Blankenship","Well, Seth, on the use of capital, it hits both categories. So we need it just for pure capacity in rings and discs. But we also need it for capacity in airfoils. The demand is substantial there. And as I said earlier, in some cases on some part numbers we are providing significantly more than our share to support our customers. In other ones, we have struggled to get them going on. So we are investing in capital both for capacity sake as well as to insource operations, reduce costs and shorten lead time. So all of the above there.","As far as rings and discs goes, we have a big challenge in front of us. We have a lot of work to do. But the team has a good plan. We are in their map of the value streams and making sure that each step in the process has the proper capacity and the proper ability to produce a quality part first time through the process. That's what we are focused on.","Ken Giacobbe","All right. And Seth, I had also mentioned too in the airfoils business, as Chip touched on, last year we crossed a significant milestone with $2 billion of aero engine revenue in the first quarter. That was up about $530 million was our Q1 number for 2018. So we are trending positive. But also in that dynamic, we are seeing that the next generation engines are up 60% on a year-over-year basis. So that's good news and our legacy engines business is down about 14%. So we are seeing that change as we did in Q4. But that, in the near term, impacts our margins unfavorably as we learn out our cost on these next-generation platforms.","Chip Blankenship","And I would elaborate further, just to summarize, Seth and say that we really have a good problem that we are facing in EP&S. Our markets are strong, order book is full. We have to execute and that's what we are focused on.","Seth Seifman","Okay. I think to the extent that you can talk about, I think maybe some of the concern among investors is about what happens because of the execution challenges, what might happen to your market share over time? And so, if you thought about the opportunities, Chip, that you thought Arconic had coming in? I know it's been a little hard to realize them in the near term, but when you think about the opportunity set, let's say, two years out from now, is that still the same or do you think some of it's been lost because of some of the struggles that you guys have had?","Chip Blankenship","I think largely the opportunity, Seth, is the same if not more. We may lose a little bit here and there in the short term but the demand is strong. This narrow-body ramp and the engine programs associated with that, they need strong suppliers to deliver high-quality parts in shorter lead times and the extent we can demonstrate that over the next 18 months or so, I think we are looking at great opportunities in the future.","Seth Seifman","Great. And maybe last one. Just I know, Chip, that this predates your time at the company, but I think part of the idea behind the separation between Alcoa and Arconic was to have a downstream or value-add oriented company focused particularly on aeros and auto and here we are out here over a year later talking mainly about metal prices and the impact on the guide. Is that something that you and the Board and your team are thinking about as you go through the strategic review?","Chip Blankenship","I would say we are incorporating all that in our strategy and portfolio analysis and it's really our time to lean into that and make sure that we understand exactly how all this fits together, examine the strategy by product line, look for the opportunities and we will have our completed work by the end of 3Q.","Seth Seifman","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi. Good morning gentlemen.","Chip Blankenship","Good morning.","Ken Giacobbe","Good morning.","Rajeev Lalwani","Chip, I just wanted to come back to your answer there to Seth's question on the strategic review. Can you talk about how you sort of narrowed the scope of it here over the last couple of months? And then as it relates to when you are looking at assets to keep or not keep, can you just talk a bit more about the approach you are taking? Are you looking at margins relative to performance, the variability of profits? Just some color there would be great.","Chip Blankenship","So we are really not in a position, Rajeev, to make any announcements related to the strategy and portfolio review. But I will share with you that we are focused on what returns are available and what are the best end markets to participate in and what are our technology and manufacturing capabilities. And we are trying to do the best job we can to assess all that. And we will be able to report out later in the year.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. And then if I may, just a quick follow up. In terms of some of the adjustments that you are making to get the rings and discs side of the house back in order, can you talk about the timeline that we should be expecting to start to see some of those benefits come through? Is it something that we should look for as we go into next year and beyond? Or could we see that start to turn here in the coming months and quarters?","Chip Blankenship","It's really early to forecast a complete turnaround in those portions of the business, Rajeev. I would say, we are not expecting margin expansion this year and we are focused on making sure we make the right long-term plays there while following our guiding principle of keeping our customers in metal.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Chip Blankenship","Good morning.","Ken Giacobbe","Good morning Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","At the end, I guess, when you reported the fourth quarter, you talked about and you put in place a share repurchase of about, I think it was $500 million. Just given the share weakness since you reported fourth quarter, I am surprised you didn't repurchase any in the quarters. Can you just talk about how you are thinking in approaching the buyback?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes. Hi Sam. You are correct, $500 million we were authorized from the Board. There is no time limit on that. As we said on the previous call, we are just looking at the seasonality of our cash flows in the business and then we will gauge the relative returns of different options of our capital and we will make a decision at that time.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And then just looking at the increase in CapEx this year and then just the overall reduction in free cash flow, I know that Chip, when you first came in, everybody wanted to know if you would be able to reiterate some of the 2019 targets. But just thinking about the step up going forward from here, now that capital spending is going up, first question, do you see this year as a peak in capital spending? That it might go down beyond that? And then, what do you think about the pathway of getting to some of those high numbers that were out there before for 2019?","Chip Blankenship","I guess I will answer the second part of that first. We are not ready to talk about 2019 at this time. We will have to defer that till we get closer to 2019. On the capital spend, although we raised this year's target, it's too early for us to say that that's a peak. We have some really substantial increases in business opportunities in front of us that we need to evaluate, whether it's for the auto growth in global rolled product aluminum sheet or the engine business to support the narrow-body ramps and additional business opportunities there. So I would say, it's early to say that this is a peak or not. But we will be very mindful of our decisions to deploy capital based on sustainable demand and the returns available.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Co.","Gautam Khanna","Yes. Thanks. Good morning guys.","Chip Blankenship","Good morning.","Ken Giacobbe","Good morning.","Gautam Khanna","Couple of questions. First, I was wondering, you mentioned one of the personnel changes you made. Do you have the people in place at the various plants that you need to affect the operational improvements at the rings and discs units?","Chip Blankenship","Gautam, this is Chip. You know, right now we have open positions. As I said earlier, we are seeking to acquire additional experienced help and we are actively hiring and monitoring that every week in terms of filling roles like the plant manager minus one kind of roles where it's a process engineer or it's a lean ABS person or it's a quality engineer. We do need some additional resources to make sure that we have the horsepower to improve the plants while we deliver on full plants because that's a higher degree of difficulty, in my experience, than having one of the other of those not be the case.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. From your comments earlier, we are obviously scaling the new narrow-bodies at a pretty extreme rate, the LEAP and the GTF programs. Is that where you guys are actually having the most difficult cost position in the rings and discs businesses on the new narrow-body stories or is it across the board?","Chip Blankenship","It's really the total plant loading that requires us to respond and make improvements here. One of the reasons obviously that the plants are so heavily loaded is that ramp, but it's nothing unique about those parts that are driving our situation in the rings business, particularly. In some of the other parts of the portfolio, we are on a very leading edge of technology to deliver what these engines need in terms of performance and temperature capability. But we are solving those problems and we improving yields as we speak.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And to your opening comments and in your slides, you talk about mix in two places. I think you mentioned airframe mix is negative. Is that just fasteners down? And GRP wide-body mix, what specific programs or if you can elaborate on what that actually means, wide-body mix?","Chip Blankenship","Yes. Gautam, I will just go ahead and put fasteners in GRP sheet and plate together and say that when 747 and A380 and 777, for example, go down that's very impactful to the ships at totals for those two business units. We are on the 787, A350. We have good scope there, but nowhere near the scope as the jumbos. So that's what we are experiencing.","Gautam Khanna","So in effect, it's just volume is down because the wide-bodies are down.","Chip Blankenship","Well, see the wide-body total numbers are up. So that's why I am being very careful about the mix. When you put A350 and 787 in there, the numbers can be, the total production rates are up, but what we see in terms of mix of those wide-bodies is not in our favor.","Ken Giacobbe","So Gautam, we are seeing the A380, it may be eight units this year. There is some inventory in the channel, right, in terms of our pool, it's a lesser number as well. So there is really a double hit and that ships at values over $10 million on that plane for us.","Gautam Khanna","I see. Okay. That's helpful. And sorry to keep asking, but you mentioned EP&S, you are not expecting a margin expansion this year. Could you give us more clarity on what you are expecting? Are you expecting a decline? And if so, how much? And if you could also give us the Firth Rixson sales and EBITDA contribution in the quarter?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes. Gautam, let me give you the Firth Rixson piece first. We have moved to operating income. So if we look at Firth Rixson for the quarter, it's pretty much breakeven on an operating income basis. Revenue was pretty much flat on a year-over-year basis at around $250 million, $260 million.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. Last one, Chip. Just stepping back, I know you are still early in the discovery phase as you have visited a handful of couple of dozen plants, but there is many more to go. Just your level of confidence honestly and the guidance? Because obviously, the Street has undergone a number of revisions downward over the last couple years. Do you feel confident that this bounds the lower end? Or is there still risks to actually hitting these numbers based on where you sit today? Just wanted to get your level of confidence?","Chip Blankenship","Yes. That's a fair question, Gautam. We certainly designed this guidance to be that lower bound. But the reality of fact is that I have seen 20% of our plants and 34% of our revenue producing locations. So there is still more to see. But we believe we have done the best job we can through deep dives with each business unit as many, go see discovery site type visits as possible to produce these numbers. So we are focused on delivering these numbers a little better. We are giving up on improving still this year.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And did you guys answer the EP&S margin? How much may it decline this year? Maybe I missed it.","Ken Giacobbe","No. Gautam, we haven't given guidance on that. Until we get further visibility into the rings and disc business, in we are seeing favorable margins in the airfoils business that we talked about earlier. Our fasteners business is remaining strong. However, as we dig deeper into the rings and disc business, it's too early to tell in terms of what the margin impact will be.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. Thanks a lot. Good luck guys.","Chip Blankenship","Yes. Thanks Gautam.","Operator","And your next question is from David Strauss with Barclays.","David Strauss","Thanks. Good morning.","Chip Blankenship","Good morning.","David Strauss","So in terms of the new airfoils ramp and how you are pacing there, can you just comment on where you sit today relative to the last time you reported three months ago? Are you further behind schedule? Or are you kind of in line with where you were a couple of months ago? And roughly how far behind schedule are you?","Chip Blankenship","That's really not how I look at it exactly in terms of being ahead or behind schedule. Just to clarify, David, we are pretty well even with where we were last report out on airfoils. We are providing what our customers need to build engines. We are keeping them in metal. And we are continuing to improve our yields. And I think we get more orders when that happens. So it's a bit of a challenge to say, we are increasing our shipments, we are increasing our revenue, but the orders keep piling in. And we are using all that to decide how we deploy our lean resources to creep up the capacity as well as make more major capacity investments for 2019.","David Strauss","Okay. I just wanted to follow up on Gautam's last question on EP&S. Obviously there is some sort of margin assumption there baked into the guidance and it would seem like to get down to where your guidance is, is that we would have to assume sequentially lower margins from Q1. Is that a fair statement or not?","Ken Giacobbe","David, I just don't think we are at a position to forecast and break out the EP&S margin at this stage.","David Strauss","Okay. And then on free cash flow, can you talk about the change in how that's being reported now with the receivable sales? Can you tell us what, within that $250 million free cash flow guidance through the year, what you are assuming for full-year receivable sales?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes. They would be constant to last year and this year at about $350 million a quarter. So no increase or decrease.","David Strauss","Okay. All right. Thanks very much.","Chip Blankenship","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Olin with Longbow Research.","Chris Olin","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my call.","Chip Blankenship","Good morning Chris.","Chris Olin","Just wanted to circle back on the fasteners marketplace. I know that had been an area of weakness due to some destocking going on in Europe. I am just curious if that has stabilized yet? And then have you accounted for the new production targets that are on the A330? I know those are going down. I kind of just wondered if that's going to have a big impact?","Chip Blankenship","So as we look at the fasteners business, the destocking coupled with some of the declines programmatically in Europe with Airbus, are impacting our total number there for fasteners. We are making that up as we work hard to win more business in the industrial and commercial transportation markets. So we are playing the field there. It's a very good business. We have some wonderful product lines in fasteners and we are competing well in the other spaces to make up for some of the softness there in the Airbus production rates.","Ken Giacobbe","And we don't see a material impact, at least in 2018, of those revised production rates. It's more of a 2019 conversation.","Chip Blankenship","On the A330.","Ken Giacobbe","Yes.","Chris Olin","Okay. Just switching gears a little bit. What actually happens to your Russian rolling assets, if Rusal is actually kept on the sanctioned list? How do I think about that going forward?","Chip Blankenship","So we have been very active in our discussions with various departments of the U.S. government here on the process and how these sanctions apply. And quite frankly, it's a little bit early to draw absolute conclusions. As we speak right now though, the Samara operation is the operating normally. It is a Russian entity run by Russians doing business with Rusal for their primary aluminum supply. And that's how it stands right now.","Chris Olin","Okay. Just last question, I know you didn't give these numbers out, Chip, but in the past, some of the management teams have offered revenue ship set numbers and historically those numbers have not matched your aerospace performance. Looking at your guidance for 2018 and there is some reference on pricing weakness. I am just wondering if you have had to give back on pricing on some of these contracts in order to keep your market share or anything like that?","Chip Blankenship","As you probably know, as contracts come up for rebid, they are typically competed and we work very closely with our customers to try and value sell the portfolio of products that we are competing with. But from time to time, we are competitively required to take price reductions. We certainly had some of those over the past few years, including this year as we work to secure volume. But we are actively working productivity to offset that and make sure that we have good business arrangements for the future.","Ken Giacobbe","So we have had some puts and takes on the contracts. We previously communicated, I believe, about 13 different platforms. Some are higher, some are lower, but in aggregate, there is no material change, right. But it does impact, as Chip mentioned earlier, on the wide-body production mix. We are heavily in some of those platforms, again, A380, 777, 747. That impacts the growth.","Chris Olin","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse.","Curt Woodworth","Yes. Thanks. Good morning.","Chip Blankenship","Good morning.","Curt Woodworth","I just wanted to drill down a little bit more into the aluminum sensitivity. So in your guidance cut for the year, the $0.19, to EPS is about $130 million of EBIT. But you only changed your base of the Midwest premium assumption by about $260 a ton which would be roughly $26 million based on the sensitivity you have provided. So it seems like there is $100 million delta there. And I know you talked about the impact of scrap spreads, I think a derivatives impact and the hedge. Can you just kind of walk through what those other pieces would be? And I guess if the scraps spreads stays wide on some of these other things, is the implicit sensitivity much higher than this $100 metric ton increase for $10 million EBIT impact?","Ken Giacobbe","Well, there is two parts on that. In terms of, you have got the operational $10 million impact but there is also the LIFO, metal lag impact, right, which is about $25 per move in metal. So as you go through the math and we can have Patricia walk you through the detailed calculations, but the impact of the LIFO, the metal lag and the operational is about $100 million of the $130 million. And the other $30 million relates to, we had to do some mark-to-market on some hedging, right. That was $10 million. As we mentioned with the sanctions in Russia, there was a short period there where we could not hedge our metal for our Samara plant just due to the sanctions. That's behind us now. That was worth about another $10 million. And then the scraps spreads, that's an issue that's within our control. Scrap spreads have gotten worse by about 32% from our initial guidance. That's a huge opportunity for us. One of the things that we are doing is first looking at melting capacity for our scrap. Right now we are net seller of scrap. We want to use that more in-house. So how do we leverage the Arconic cast house network? Are there opportunities to invest with good returns around incremental melting capacity and automation, which we are currently doing in the portfolio? And third, are there alternative uses for scrap in other parts of the business. So that piece right there in terms scrap spreads, that's worth another $10 million. That's within our control and we are aggressively working on that. So that's the breakdown of the $130 million.","Curt Woodworth","Okay. That's helpful, Ken. And then Chip, can you talk about in terms of the feedback with the customers, I am more curious to get your take on the commerciality of some of these big contracts you have. Obviously, you have some of an inside look from the OEM perspective, given your time at GE. Do you feel like you like the commercial set that you have? And then can you talk to any ability to improve commercial terms going forward? Are there any sizable contracts coming up for rebid, 2018, 2019, 2020? And how we can think about the cadence of that? Thank you.","Chip Blankenship","Sure. So one thing I didn't mention in my earlier comments was that I received universal feedback from our customers that they really value our technology and they like working with our team. And so really our challenge is around quality and delivery performance. And so that's what we are focused on. The nature of the commercial arrangements, we have lot of long-standing history of how we do business with our OEM customers and that's reflected in those contracts. We did inherit some contracts from acquisitions that frankly we think are opportunities for us and the OEMs to get on the terms that we are used to working together on and so that represents opportunity. There are a few contracts coming up over the next 18 to 24 months that we will be actively pursuing with the OEMs in terms of how do we, Arconic, provide more value to them to improve their products, not just kind of copy and paste here, but what are the opportunities to work together more closely and for us to represent obviously a better return for our shareholders.","Curt Woodworth","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research.","Carter Copeland","Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. On the slide where you mentioned the guidance change on aerospace pricing, can you just clarify, is that related to the contractual or the new program mix discounting that you referenced before? Or is that something else? And then secondly on the inventory burn down, you mentioned Airbus having an impact. When do you see that bottoming out? Thanks.","Ken Giacobbe","First on the aerospace pricing. This is just continual pressure that we are getting from the OEMs around reducing pricing in the portfolio. Our goal is to offset that through our net cost savings. But that's going to continue as we move forward. So we need more productivity out of the business.","Chip Blankenship","And then on the fastener front, some of our market intelligence says that during the latter part of this year we could see the bottom of that. But frankly I am not counting on that. We are going to take a look at how that develops and what the slope and trajectory is of that. I am a little bit weary of it. That bottom has been forecast before and not achieved.","Carter Copeland","Yes. Does the market intelligence include the lower 330s beginning next year. I would assume that would have an impact?","Chip Blankenship","Yes. That's just one of the leading indicators, I would say, of 2019 and perhaps the third quarter or fourth quarter of this year is not the bottom on that.","Carter Copeland","Yes. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question is from Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global.","Josh Sullivan","Hi. Good morning.","Chip Blankenship","Good morning.","Josh Sullivan","Just digging down into the segments, if Firth was near breakeven, that means that RTI and the legacy assets must have been making up some of that difference. Can you just give us an update on those assets? And then maybe an update on the isothermal forge as well?","Ken Giacobbe","The RTI business is continuing to perform well. We are getting margin expansion there. We were up about over 600 basis points since acquisition. There are still opportunity for more improvement but RTI is performing well.","And on isothermal, Chip has just been down there.","Chip Blankenship","Yes. On the isothermal, we continue to work with our OEMs on part by part number qualification. It's kind of an arduous process. It's very involved and time-consuming as it should be. We are working diligently to produce the parts and go through that qualification process. We are producing six right now in the isothermal forge. And we continue to work with the OEM to come up into production.","Josh Sullivan","And then just one on lead times. What do they look like right now versus the end of the year in GRP?","Chip Blankenship","For GRP, I think we haven't had any change in lead times that I know of.","Josh Sullivan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","This is all of the time we have for questions. Gentlemen, do you have any closing remarks?","Chip Blankenship","Yes. I have some closing remarks please. So just to wrap up, we are taking actions necessary to improve our business performance. We have strong end markets and a solid technology portfolio. We have customers that support our efforts and capable people on our team. We are reinforcing our team with additional human and capital resources. Our strategy and portfolio review is proceeding at an accelerated pace and going well. Thanks everyone for dialing into today's call.","Operator","This does conclude today's earnings call.

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Patricia Figueroa, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Patricia Figueroa","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Arconic\u2019s second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. I\u2019m joined by Chip Blankenship, Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by Chip and Ken, we will take your questions.","I would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company\u2019s results to differ materially from these projections listed in today\u2019s presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings.","In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release and in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Chip.","Charles Blankenship","Good morning. Thank you for joining the call. I\u2019ll begin with an update on the strategy review and 2Q highlights, then Ken will take you through our financial results. I\u2019ll conclude with guidance and we\u2019ll take your questions after that.","As a reminder, the goal of our strategy review is to develop actions that will enhance shareholder value, streamline the portfolio, tighten our strategic focus and strengthen our financial profile.","In the first phase, we divided our three business segments into 25 product lines for granular assessments of return on net assets, competitive advantage, business synergies and market attractiveness to be made in more meaningful and actionable ways. We also kept in mind practical consideration such as organizational capability, distractions, and growth opportunities. From that analysis, we categorized each product line into one of the four buckets shown on the chart.","We are now in the second phase of the review, where we are analyzing alternatives and making decisions. One of the outcomes of this phase is a decision to initiate the sale process for our Building and Construction Systems business. This is a very well run business with strong markets and products, but we\u2019ve decided that the building and construction market will not be a core emphasis for Arconic going forward.","The business overview is shown on the next slide. BCS is a leading supplier of building materials and construction systems, with well regarded brands, technology, fabrication and service centers, serving all the relevant commercial customer segments.","As I said, the decision to initiate the sale process for BCS is the first outcome of our strategy review project. We remain on track to complete the project in the third quarter. We plan to hold an Investor Day in November to communicate the output of the strategy work and associated actions.","Before Ken takes you through the financial results for the quarter, I\u2019d like to share some highlights from 2Q. As I said last time, we are reinvigorating our commitment to the fundamentals of lean manufacturing. We created a central organization to provide support to each of our businesses.","The first area is training resources for the fundamentals of lean manufacturing all the way up to very advanced concepts. The second is in the area of quality assurance and Six Sigma methodology for process control. The third is smart manufacturing, using the latest physical and digital automation techniques, with sensors and data collection and analysis to improve equipment uptime, production output and reduce costs.","The newly created manufacturing and continuous improvement organization will play a critical role in strengthening our culture of operational excellence and driving process improvements that enhance business results and customer satisfaction.","I recently appointed a Vice President, reporting directly to me and the team is at half its targeted staffing level and already driving results. We formed surge teams to support plants in need of help. And in each case where they are deployed, we have increased output more than 10% so far with more to come. The surge teams are also charged with improving the capability of the local team alongside executing the specific improvement projects.","We will be holding the first ever Arconic Plant Manager Summit in August. We\u2019re holding the summit to provide plant managers with more business context and framework that will help them lead their teams and make the best decisions for the company. This will allow us to empower them to optimize performance of their plants.","I\u2019m excited about this event, as it will help us continue building momentum at the heart of our company, our operations. We made several announcements during the Farnborough Airshow, including a new long-term contract with Boeing to supply aluminum sheet and plate for all models produced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes.","This contract is the largest to date and captures growth in the build rate increases of the Boeing 737 program. The agreement also includes new business for the supply of structural plate used on a variety of applications, including wing ribs for carbon fiber platforms such as the 787 and the 777X.","This morning, we announced expansions of operations in Morristown, Tennessee and Whitehall, Michigan, which will provide additional capacity to meet growing demand from our aerospace engine customers.","The expansion projects will require more than $100 million of investment, about one-third of the total spend will happen in 2018 and is already included in the 2018 CapEx plan. These expansions are expected to be operational near the end of 2020. While we have a lot of work ahead of us, I\u2019m encouraged by the positive customer and operational momentum coming out of the first-half.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Ken.","Ken Giacobbe","Okay. Thank you, Chip. Now, let\u2019s move to Slide 7 and the key financial results for the quarter. Revenue for the second quarter came in at $3.6 billion, up $312 million, or 10% year-over-year, as aluminum prices accounted for $149 million, or almost 50% of the increase.","Revenue growth was driven by volume gains across all segments. All of our major markets are healthy, and on a year-over-year basis when normalizing for the impacts of aluminum prices in currency, commercial transportation is up 20%, automotive is up 14%, aero engine is up 10%, and aero defense is up 20%.","The strong growth in these markets was offset by anticipated weakness in aero airframe production mix, which primarily impacts our Global Rolled Products and Fasteners businesses.","Organic revenue, which adjust for aluminum prices, currency, Tennessee packaging and the divestitures of the Fusina rolled products in Latin American extrusion businesses was up $169 million, or 5% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis.","The reconciliation for organic revenue can be found on Slide 18 in the appendix. Revenue in the quarter included a $38 million negative impact for the settlements of certain customer claims, principally related to product introductions. We are satisfied and our customers are satisfied with these settlements.","We have also included year-over-year market growth rates on Slide 20 in the appendix. Excluding special items, operating income was $381 million in the second quarter, down $7 million, or 2% year-over-year.","Operating income and operating income margin percent continue to be negatively impacted by higher aluminum prices, as average aluminum prices increased approximately 30% in the second quarter versus last year.","The second quarter impact of higher aluminum prices was less than expected, but unfavorably impacted operating income by $20 million year-over-year. Aluminum prices also impacted operating margin percent by 100 basis points. The aluminum price impacts are detailed by segment on Slide 17 in the appendix.","During the first quarter earnings call, I said that we expected the aluminum price impact would be unfavorable $45 million to $50 million in the second quarter. The impact was less than expected and was unfavorable $20 million driven by two factors.","First, while average aluminum prices for the quarter was slightly higher than our assumption of $2,720 per metric ton, aluminum prices dropped at the end of the quarter. As a result, the aluminum price used in the second quarter LIFO calculation was closer to $2,600 per metric ton. Therefore, LIFO was approximately $20 million favorable in the quarter compared to our expectations.","Second, I mentioned the inability to hedge some aluminum purchases due to sanctions in the second quarter for our Russian plants in Samara, and that would be approximately $10 million unfavorable in the quarter. Although this remains a potential risk going forward, we were able to mitigate this impact in the second quarter when we were able to resume hedge activities.","In addition to higher aluminum prices year-over-year, we had two further unfavorable items of note. First, we experienced unfavorable market factors related to aerospace wide-body production mix; and second, net savings in the quarter were offset by continuing challenges in our Rings and Disks operations, and a $23 million charge related to a physical inventory adjustment in one of our facilities.","The unfavorable items were partially offset by volume gains in commercial transportation and in aerospace. We have also included reconciliation of operating income, excluding special items on Slide 30 in the appendix. Operating income margin percent, excluding special items was 10.7% for the second quarter, down 120 basis points year-over-year. More than 80% of the year-over-year margin decline was due to higher aluminum prices.","Adjusted free cash flow generated in the second quarter was $289 million, or more than doubled the second quarter of 2017. The improved free cash flow generation was driven primarily by favorable operational working capital that drove a $98 million benefit year-over-year.","Days working capital improved six days year-over-year, compared to the year ago quarter, lower pension contribution and lower interest rate payments more than offset the increase in capital expenditures as we continue to focus on operations in our plants and insourcing operations where it makes sense.","Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items was $0.37, or $0.05 higher than the second quarter of 2017. Operational improvements driven by volume growth, lower interest expense and lower operational tax rates offset the impact of higher aluminum prices.","Now let\u2019s move to Slide 8 to go to the segment results. In the second quarter, EP&S\u2019s revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Organic revenue was up 6%, due to volume growth in aero engines and aero defense. Segment operating profit was $212 million, down $38 million, or 15% year-over-year.","Results were impacted by a $23 million charge related to a physical inventory in one of our facilities, as well as higher aluminum prices and performance shortfalls in our Rings and Disks operations. These items more than offset the strength in aerospace engines. As a result of the items mentioned, segment operating profit margin was 13.3%, down 350 basis points year-over-year.","In the second quarter, GRP\u2019s revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Organic revenue was up 5%, as volume growth in automotive and commercial transportation more than offset the decline in aerospace airplanes production mix.","Segment operating profit was $123 million, down $10 million, or 8% year-over-year, driven by higher aluminum prices and an unfavorable aerospace wide-body production mix. These items were partially offset by higher automotive and commercial transportation volumes, as well as net cost savings. Segment operating profit margin percent was 8.5%, down 200 basis points year-over-year, including $120 million negative impact of higher aluminum prices.","Regarding TCS in the second quarter, they delivered $562 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Organic revenue was up 11%, as we continue to see strong growth in Commercial Transportation, as well as our Building and Construction businesses.","Segment operating profit was a record $97 million, up $26 million, or 37% year-over-year. Higher volume in commercial transportation and building and construction, a favorable product mix and net cost savings drove the improvement despite the higher aluminum prices.","Segment operating profit margin was 17.3%, up 320 basis points year-over-year, including a 150 basis point unfavorable impact of higher aluminum prices. All the way, these results resulted in a very strong performance by our TCS team.","Now let\u2019s move to the second quarter key achievement on Slide 9. While we still have a lot of work to do, we are driving for improvements across the company. In EP&S, we saw a double-digit growth in aero engines and aero defense as we ramp up production to meet unprecedented customer demand.","For our fasteners business, aero frame revenue was up modestly after declining in the prior quarter. And finally, investment casting costs are moving as we improved down the cost curve for new product introductions.","In GRP, we continue to deliver strong growth in automotive, as revenue, excluding the impact of aluminum prices and currency was up 13%. Our growth in automotive is backed by innovative solutions to help customers increase performance and decrease weight as evidenced by our recent announcement that Arconic is supplying a new proprietary in highly formable aluminum alloy for 2018 Jeep Wrangler.","As Chip mentioned, we also announced our unique manufacturing technology in aerospace, which led to the signing of our largest multi-year supply contract with Boeing to supply sheet and plate for all models of its commercial airplanes.","In TCS, the segment delivered record segment operating profit, which was up 37% year-over-year. The segment also delivered record margins of 17.3%, which was up 320 basis points year-over-year.","For the company in total, adjusted free cash flow in the second quarter was $289 million, or more than doubled the prior year quarter, as improvements in operational working capital drove a six-day reduction in working capital days on a year-over-year basis.","Corporate expenses, excluding special items were favorable 23% on a year-over-year basis, as we continue to look for ways to reduce our overhead structure. And finally, we renegotiated our corporate revolver with a three-year renewal, including a reduction in fees and more favorable terms.","Before turning it back to Chip, let me cover a few items that will further clarify our financial results. First, we have included two slides that will provide more detail than we have previously provided.","First on Slide 21 in the appendix. We had previously provided a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA as presented in 2017 to segment operating profit as recast in 2018. As you may recall, we changed our primary measure of segment performance from adjusted EBITDA to segment operating profit in 2018 to more closely align segment performance with operating income as presented on the income statement. We have added LIFO and derivative activities to the reconciliation.","On Slide 16 in the appendix, we have summarized major elements of our adjusted free cash flow guidance, including pension, OPEB, capital expenditures, working capital and cash taxes. There is no change to guidance, we\u2019re just summarizing for your convenience.","On Slide 13 in the appendix, we have summarized special items for the quarter. Restructuring-related charges were $15 million pre-tax, which consisted primarily of $9 million of pension curtailment charge associated with a union contract that was ratified in the second quarter, and also $5 million related to the relocation of the New York office to Northern Virginia. In the second quarter, we incurred $4 million of external legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower, which were recorded in SG&A.","As previously discussed, we had a $38 million reduction in revenue for settlements of certain customer claims, principally related to product introductions. Finally, the impact of discrete tax items for the quarter was a charge of $21 million, primarily related to revised estimated \u2013 estimates associated with one-time transition tax that was enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.","On Slide 14 in the appendix, we have provided an update on our capital structure as we continue to manage our debt and reduce our liabilities. We finished the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion of cash, up $250 million sequentially. Gross debt now stands at $6.4 billion, the net debt stands at $4.9 billion. Net debt to EBITDA continues to improve and stands at 2.49 times.","Finally, I would like to give you some context on aluminum price impact for the remainder of the year. Our guidance assumed in aluminum price of $2,720 per metric ton for the remainder of the year. The second quarter average was slightly higher at $2,737 per metric ton. While aluminum prices ended the quarter lower at approximately 2,600 a metric ton, that really understates the recent volatility that we\u2019ve seen.","In the second quarter alone, aluminum prices won more than $700 per metric ton between the quarters high and lows. Given this volatility, our aluminum price assumption remains unchanged at $2,720 per metric ton for the remainder of the year. For the full-year, that equates to an aluminum price average of $2,664 per metric ton, which is in line with our guidance.","Therefore, our estimated unfavorable aluminum price impact for the year versus 2017 remains unchanged at approximately $130 million, which means the unfavorable price impact is expected to be higher in the second-half of the year, as compared to the first-half of the year. We continue to have risk in our Samara facility in Russia, as well as the impact of unfavorable scrap spreads.","Now let me turn it back to Chip to cover our 2018 annual guidance.","Charles Blankenship","Thank you, Ken. Our guidance for the year remains unchanged. This is the same slide that we showed last quarter. As we continue to pursue long-term shareholder value creation, there\u2019s a lot of work ahead of us, yet there are opportunities all around us.","I\u2019d like to share a couple of highlights from my recent trips, because I think you\u2019ll ask me about that anyway. At Rancho Cucamonga Rings plant, I saw tangible improvements with better product flow, more employee engagement and progress working down the work-in-process inventory.","The project to install a 10,000 ton press remains on schedule for the first-half of 2019 installation, as well as part qualification, and it\u2019s just one of many projects aimed at increasing throughput and lowering costs.","Wichita Falls, the home of our low-pressure turbine blade and vane investment casting operations is off to a great start using lean tools and already have excellent engagement on Six Sigma process control. A great line of sight on serving customers here, customers I met with previously cited this plant as an example of excellent customer service and collaboration.","Waco, Texas, home of our industrial fasteners business, is experiencing steep growth and we\u2019ve been raising to fill direct labor positions and commission new equipment to serve customers and capture the revenue and margin opportunities. The team is recovering from the order onslaught and growing to meet the demand.","In Hampton, Virginia, they\u2019re doing a very good job managing through the significant volume downturn in industrial gas turbine by moving select large aerospace investment cast blades and vanes into the available capacity. I\u2019m pleased with how we\u2019re optimizing the network, preserving capability and optimizing costs simultaneously.","On the other side of our campus, the Hampton structural casting team is growing with the aerospace cycle and they remain 100% on-time to customers for 19 straight quarters. Our Savannah Forging facility is now demonstrated significant improvements to on-time delivery and lowered costs by insourcing substantial amounts of machining operations.","And GRP is making progress managing our scrap loop. Although the financial improvement was modest this quarter, we\u2019re moving in the right direction on this important topic.","From the customer contracts, we announced at Farnborough to the enthusiasm of our teams and driving operational improvements where we needed the most. We are gaining momentum and there is significant opportunity ahead.","With that, I\u2019d like to open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.","Carter Copeland","Hey, good morning, guys.","Charles Blankenship","Good morning, Carter.","Ken Giacobbe","Good morning.","Carter Copeland","Just a couple on just kind of understanding the performance in EP&S in the quarter. The unfavorable product mix, was that related to specific market vertical, or was it programmatic in nature? And then can you just give us some clarification on the challenges in Firth and whether that was a loss-making in the quarter or not?","Ken Giacobbe","Hey, Carter, this is Ken. Good morning. Related to the mix in the EP&S, IGT is a small percent of our revenue as we move forward. But it\u2019s been a good margin business for us, so we\u2019re seeing an impact there. Also, we\u2019re seeing an increase in our Fasteners business on the industrial side. We have good performance in terms of aero fasteners, but we\u2019re bringing more industrial fasteners into the market and that\u2019s impacting our mix.","Regarding Rings and Disks, what we can say there, we\u2019re not going to go into the profitability of that business. What I can tell you is, revenue for Rings and Disks was up about 7% on a year-over-year basis. So continuing to get inbound into that business and the operating income is improving sequentially modestly. But we\u2019re seeing progress in that business, we\u2019re not going to disclose the specific numbers.","Carter Copeland","So it\u2019s fair to say that the additional $15 million decline in our profit that wasn\u2019t part of the inventory adjustment, it was largely mix?","Ken Giacobbe","That \u2013 that\u2019s a big part of it. Correct, Carter.","Carter Copeland","Okay. And then one, Chip, just briefly on the capacity expansions. You guys called out in both Morristown and Whitehall. Is that capacity incremental to the current plans, or is that necessary to meet what you\u2019re contractually obligated to do?","Charles Blankenship","That\u2019s necessary to meet our forecast and our customers forecast of requirements for the 2020 time period, Carter. However, I would add, it\u2019s more volume than was forecast four years ago when we first started planning for the narrow-body program. So as of now, it\u2019s in the forecast, but that\u2019s quite a race forecast compared to what was originally forecast.","Carter Copeland","So with respect to the production rates studies and whatnot that we hear about from Boeing and Airbus that there could be some incremental investment beyond what you\u2019re talking about here to hit the rates that are being talked about in the 2020s?","Charles Blankenship","We really don\u2019t get involved in the direct rate requirements from the air framers. We take our forecast and do our own work based on what we see from the engine manufacturers, because the split out of the requirements really are varied by part number in terms of who is playing and what product and what part. So\u2026","Carter Copeland","Okay.","Charles Blankenship","\u2026it\u2019s just \u2013 we just take that, Carter, directly into our capacity planning and we put our own thoughts about where it\u2019s all going.","Carter Copeland","All right. Thanks for the color, Chip.","Charles Blankenship","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Charles Blankenship","Good morning.","Ken Giacobbe","Good morning.","Gautam Khanna","A couple of questions. Ken, first, I was wondering last quarter you had given us some of the aluminum impacts in aggregate LIFO, the Samara lack of hedging, scrap, negative scrap arbitrage or whatever you want to call it, et cetera. And it aggregated to about $130 million. You gave the LIFO and then did I \u2013 I just want to make sure I have that walk correct relative to what was given last quarter. Is the Samara thing now zero, not $10 million, but zero. If you could just walk through those what may have changed there?","Ken Giacobbe","So good morning, Gautam. We put a LIFO schedule in the back of the deck for you to show the aluminum impacts, so you have that there. So the end of quarter number although the quarterly average was about $2,737, it dipped at the end of the quarter. So we got a favorable LIFO. But when we\u2019re assuming that metal is going to stay at $2,720 for the remainder of year, we give that back in the second-half.","Scrap spreads continue to move around, Gautam, so we\u2019re thinking, it\u2019s more going to be in the $0.33 to $0.35 per pound range. So that we would probably got some risk there. The Samara hedges, the $10 million, we were able within the quarter with \u2013 when we resumed hedging activities to dispose of that. But Russia in general, just has risk as we move forward. That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t change the $130 million guidance. You could call me a little conservative there, Gautam, but that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t change it.","Gautam Khanna","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Ken. I also wanted to just ask Firth Rixson, not just Rings and Disks, but all in Firth Rixson sales and EBIT in the quarter?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, Gautam, as I said earlier. the revenue for the combined is up 7% compared to Q2 of last year. But we\u2019re not going to go into the details of the EBIT or operating margin. But I can tell you, it\u2019s improved sequentially quarter-over-quarter.","Charles Blankenship","And, Gautam, we\u2019re not really tracking\u2026","Gautam Khanna","Okay.","Charles Blankenship","\u2026we\u2019re not really tracking Firth Rixson as an entity. We\u2019re trying to focus in our strategic review about what value each product line provides to customers in our business and shareholders and looking at it that way as we fold it into the measured operations like Arconic engines, for example.","Gautam Khanna","Got it. And with respect to what you\u2019re already planning to divest the BCS. Is the Cladding business embedded within that, or is it somewhere else?","Ken Giacobbe","I\u2019m sorry, Gautam, which business? It\u2019s Cladding, yes.","Gautam Khanna","Within\u2026","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, you\u2019re correct.","Gautam Khanna","Yes.","Ken Giacobbe","So there\u2019s two parts to that business. We have the systems business, which are primarily windows, doors, framing systems, curtain wall, that\u2019s part of the business. And then the cladding system Reynobond is included in BCS. Then there\u2019s a third product line called, Reynolux, which is similar to Reynobond, it just doesn\u2019t have the core between the aluminum. So, yes, included.","Gautam Khanna","Got it. Last question for me and I\u2019ll requeue. Could you comment maybe on whether \u2013 where you guys are on the leap production ramp, if you\u2019re on schedule? GE mentioned being four weeks behind, which was better than seven weeks behind as of March. But I wanted to get a sense for how caught up are you guys and you mentioned some of the internal throughput improvements. But as you catch up if you\u2019re not caught up, we get more cost pressure as we move into Q3 as tight supply get caught up with the targets for the year? Thank you.","Charles Blankenship","What we\u2019re doing, Gautam, is daily prioritization and production meetings with each of our engine customers making sure that we\u2019re providing the parts they need for their engine assembly and service needs. It has us in some cases hand to mouth. But we believe we are supporting their needs at this time and working through the issues and making sure that we keep our customers in metal, which is one of our guiding principles.","Gautam Khanna","And have you continued to ramp up to the higher rates in the second-half of the year? Do you feel the cost pressures will intensify, or do you turn the corner on those on a unit cost basis?","Charles Blankenship","Hey, Ken was pretty descriptive in terms of how we are coming down the cost curve on the new products that we are introducing. In some cases, there\u2019s expedite fees, in some cases, there\u2019s transportation. And we\u2019re doing some outsourcing to make to make sure we load our factories with the most important work that that we need to complete the deliveries. But for the most part, we\u2019re coming down the cost curves and seeing better performance from our operations.","Gautam Khanna","Thanks a lot, guys.","Charles Blankenship","Yep.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel Pearlstein","Good morning.","Charles Blankenship","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel Pearlstein","Could you talk a little bit more about building and construction in terms of the sale? I\u2019m just trying to think about, I know in the slide deck, you said $1 billion in sales, trying to think about the financial impact. And how you think about do you replace those earnings with buybacks? Is the intent to just free up capital? Is it to improve your RONA? Just how are you thinking in terms of what drove you to this conclusion and then what the impact will be?","Charles Blankenship","This is Chip. I\u2019ll start and then turn it over to Ken for more color. But the way we think about it is, we made a strategic decision not to emphasize that market. And this is a great business that we think we can get substantial value for the shareholder by selling it to a company that really prioritizes and wants to be in that business.","So as far as what we do with the proceeds, that\u2019s folded right into the strategic review that we\u2019re conducting and that\u2019s just going to be part of what we talk about in November when we tell the rest of the story.","Ken Giacobbe","And I think that\u2019s spot on. The only thing I would add is, Chip mentioned a great business in terms of our capital allocation moving forward. That\u2019s just not part of the business that we\u2019re going to investing going forward. So we thought it was the best to start that process.","Samuel Pearlstein","And if I can follow-up just separately the physical inventory adjustment. Can you just describe what went on there and how I guess, we can be sure that the rest of the inventory is fairly staying across the company?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, what we\u2019ve done, Sam, is our team and our auditors believe this is isolated to the one plant in the EP&S portfolio. Majority of that impact was in 2018 when we took the account, but we are \u2013 believe it\u2019s isolated to this one plant.","Samuel Pearlstein","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Thanks very much, and good morning.","Charles Blankenship","Good morning, Seth.","Ken Giacobbe","Good morning.","Seth Seifman","I was wondering if you could tell us what the growth was on new engine in the quarter?","Ken Giacobbe","Yes, Seth. A couple of things on engines. We were up about 11% in the quarter on new engines. And the engine mix now within our business as we look at the next generation engines compared to legacy, we\u2019ve crossed over. So about 60% of all the revenue was coming from next generation. So total engine is up about a 11%. We\u2019re seeing that flip. Now we\u2019ve crossed over with next-generation engines higher than legacy engines.","Seth Seifman","Right, okay. But you are \u2013 are you able to say what the growth rate was on the next gen in the quarter?","Ken Giacobbe","We\u2019re not going to give that particular detail, but it was a good performance.","Seth Seifman","All right. And then when you look at the $38 million on the corporate side in settlements related to new products, I presume that\u2019s \u2013 is that related to engine products? And if so, do you see that being the conclusion of the settlements that are going to be required?","Charles Blankenship","Seth, this is Chip. What I\u2019d say to that is, we\u2019re not going to identify the customers of the segment there. But I can tell you with confidence that these issues are behind us. And we\u2019re satisfied that we\u2019ve got the right process and product discipline going forward and our customers are satisfied as well.","Seth Seifman","Okay, great. And then maybe last one moving back bigger picture, the press that you talked about installing for the first-half of 2019. Is that sort of the last big piece that you need in place in EP&S to kind of get caught up and be where you need to be in terms of volumes and rate?","Charles Blankenship","This is \u2013 that\u2019s a big piece of the equation. It\u2019s \u2013 it will be a big help to the industry and the Rings business and supporting the engines and in some cases a couple parts of aero frame customers, but that\u2019s a big step in that direction. The \u2013 an announcement we made on Morristown and Whitehall is a piece of the puzzle though in terms of hitting the second-half of 2019 and the 2020 timeframe in terms of production rates.","Seth Seifman","Gotcha. Thanks very much.","Charles Blankenship","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse.","Curtis Woodworth","Hey, good morning, guys.","Charles Blankenship","Good morning.","Ken Giacobbe","Good morning.","Curtis Woodworth","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the progression in Firth Rixson. Can you kind of give us an update on where you stand in terms of qualification and sort of the level of consensus product and what your exit rate could look like in terms of the revenue base there?","Charles Blankenship","What rate could like, I\u2019m sorry?","Curtis Woodworth","The exit rate this year for revenue?","Charles Blankenship","No, we\u2019re not really calling out Firth Rixson as a separate entity anymore. What I would share with you though is that, we\u2019re continuing to improve in our first pass yield. First \u2013 not having a first pass yield leads to engineered concessions on parts that don\u2019t meet the strict process window specification of the customer.","What that does is that adds cost to our parts, because we need to do engineering review, it adds cost and time to delivery for our customer, because they have to do engineering review and sign off. It does not result in a price issue, it\u2019s purely a cost incurred by us and cost of goods sold. But it also impacts our on-time delivery.","As we see that first pass yield come up, both in our Rings and our Disks business, we\u2019ll be reducing working capital, improving our throughput and serving customers better and reducing cost of goods sold. So I can assure you, we have a very solid focus on that with engineering resources from across the company helping these plants.","Curtis Woodworth","Okay. And then follow-up question just on the wide-body issue. Can you give us a sense for what your revenue mix is between narrow-body versus wide-body? And is that issue primarily with respect to the GRP segment, or is it split sort of evenly between EPS? Thanks.","Charles Blankenship","It\u2019s primarily related in the GRP segment. We don\u2019t really give the details, but sheet and plate would be the biggest impact to business. But you also would see some impact on the fastener side, but primarily GRP.","Curtis Woodworth","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Good morning, Chip. Good morning, Ken.","Charles Blankenship","Good morning.","Ken Giacobbe","Good morning.","Rajeev Lalwani","Chip, in your prepared remarks you talked a fair amount about the Boeing contract on the sheet and plate side. Can you just talk about how the economics are looking versus what you see today? How competitive was a bidding process if there was one? And may be if you\u2019re displacing a competitor? And then a follow-up for you.","Charles Blankenship","There was always competition at the Boeing company. We believe we came to a contract term that is mutually beneficial for both companies. I\u2019ll also reveal not a secret, we are an active participant in partnering for success. So, we had our share of negotiations and challenges to be competitive in the out years that we accept from a productivity standpoint. So bottom line is, we think it\u2019s a fair contract and it offers us a lot of opportunity for the future.","Ken Giacobbe","Rajeev, part of that, too, is just the asset base that we have there as well in a very thick plate stretcher in Davenport, that helped us differentiate ourselves in that equation.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. And then just taking a step back from the operational side of things some of these contracts. There has obviously been a few headlines out there around third-party interest in the company. Should we assume that that\u2019s now in the past, given that you\u2019re moving forward with strategic review and operational improvements and so on?","Charles Blankenship","We\u2019re not going to comment on the rumors out in the press. I\u2019ll just focus your attention to what we\u2019re reporting on today, which is progress in the strategic review of the company, as well as operational improvements.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Charles Blankenship","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.","David Strauss","Thanks for taking the question.","Charles Blankenship","Good morning.","David Strauss","Good morning. I want to ask about the financial impact, the cost you\u2019re incurring to get back on schedule on the new engine side. Could you quantify that for the full-year, where you think the impact is and kind of how that splits out first-half versus second-half of the year?","Charles Blankenship","I\u2019m sorry, Dave. We just don\u2019t track it that way. We\u2019re focused on total cost of goods sold and meet the customer requirements. And as Ken related earlier, we are coming down the piece part cost curve in the engine business, which is good news.","David Strauss","So nothing from kind of a lost productivity standpoint or anything along those lines in terms of the impact you think you\u2019re seeing?","Charles Blankenship","If I understand the question correctly, no. We\u2019re focused on improving our costs and reducing our time to serve.","David Strauss","Okay. As a follow-up, I want to ask about the receivable sales. I think, you had talked about $350 million for the full-year, fair amount in the second quarter. Can you just run through kind of the status of that and what we should expect for the full-year? Thanks.","Ken Giacobbe","Hello, David, this is Ken. So on Slide 31 in the deck, we detailed there that our AR securitization plan hasn\u2019t changed during the quarter. So there\u2019s no impact, it\u2019s around $350 million. We anticipate that that will hold through the remainder of the year as well. So there won\u2019t be a favorable or an unfavorable associated with the AR securitization plan.","David Strauss","Okay. Thank you.","Charles Blankenship","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global.","Josh Sullivan","Hey, god morning.","Charles Blankenship","Good morning, Josh.","Ken Giacobbe","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Sullivan","When you look at the strategic review for Global Rolled Products, what\u2019s the thinking on CapEx investments? Automotive aluminum penetration continues to be able to swept the Devonport assets. But how long can that continue? And then what are the thoughts in the Micromill at this point?","Charles Blankenship","As we look at GRP, Josh, we\u2019re having plenty of success in the automotive market. The industrial market is strong as well commercial transportation. So, we continue to work our assets hard to serve customers and grow our revenue and EBITDA.","As I \u2013 as we look at the future though, we\u2019re actively bidding and pursuing new platforms, new vehicles that are in development, then how we do on that we\u2019ll inform what our investment path is going forward to make sure that we have the capacity we need to serve a growing industry.","So as far as the strategic review goes, that\u2019s all in the equation in terms of where we invest and how we see capacity needs going forward, we\u2019ll be in a better place to talk about that in November.","As far as the Micromill goes, we are coming up to speed, running at rate, demonstrating this next phase of the development program and selling product to customers who are very excited about that technology, the throughput it offers, as well as some unique properties of material.","Josh Sullivan","And then, I guess, just as a follow-up to that. You mentioned a highly formable metal related to the Jeep Wrangler. Was that a Micromill product, or is it something different?","Charles Blankenship","No, that\u2019s an alloy composition that allows excellent formability.","Josh Sullivan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Olin with Longbow Research.","Christopher Olin","Good morning.","Charles Blankenship","Good morning, Chris.","Ken Giacobbe","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Olin","So when we talked to some companies in the aerospace faster in marketplace, late deliveries comes up as a problem or a potential risk. And I guess, I just wanted to better understand what you were talking about when you referred to Wichita. I guess, is that a business that you would consider underperforming on the margin side that could be a tailwind for 2019. I\u2019m just curious if you think you have enough capacity to support all these rate increases going forward?","Charles Blankenship","So I\u2019ll take the last part of the question first. We have enough capacity to support the aerospace business. We\u2019re always looking at more efficient ways of those to produce fasteners of the high-rate production that\u2019s required there. So I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re not buying a piece of equipment here or a piece of equipment there, but no large-scale changes to capacity in the fasteners business.","We have a factory in Acuna, Mexico that has plenty of capacity available, surge capacity as we bring them online and get them qualified with various new parts. The Waco comments were really about the industrial side of the Fastener business, which is we\u2019re seeing quite a bit of demand in that area and that is actually driving some of our mix that Ken referred to earlier in terms of more industrial, less aero mix in the Fastener business. I don\u2019t view any of this as headwinds. I view this as opportunity to continue to grow our Fastener business.","Christopher Olin","But the margins are in line with expectations right now?","Charles Blankenship","Yes.","Christopher Olin","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And we have no further questions in queue at this time. And this does conclude today\u2019s conference call, and you may now disconnect."],"2990":["Arconic, Inc. (NYSE:ARNC) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call August  2, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Paul Luther - Director, IR","John Plant - Chairman & CEO","Kenneth Giacobbe - EVP & CFO","Conference Call Participants","Carter Copeland - Melius Research","Seth Seifman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company","Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs Group","David Strauss - Barclays Bank","Joshua Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities","Christopher Olin - Longbow Research","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Arconic's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jason, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Paul Luther, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Paul Luther","Thank you, Jason. Good morning and welcome to Arconic's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined by John Plant, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will take your questions.","I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause our company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings.","In addition, we've included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix in today's presentation.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.","John Plant","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. Let's move to Slide 4. You can see that for the second quarter, revenue was up 3% year-on-year to $3.7 billion, which is a quarterly record since separation. Organic revenue, which adjusts for currency, aluminum and portfolio changes, was up 10% as we continued to grow in all of our key markets. Our adjusted operating income was up 27% year-on-year and operating margin was up 240 basis points. ","I would like to comment on each segment's year-over-year margin expansion. Engineered Products and Solutions operating margin expanded by 310 basis points. Global Rolled Products margins expanded by 210 basis points. Transportation and Construction Solutions margins expanded by 220 basis points. Moreover, all segments had operating margin expansion sequentially. In addition to revenue, operating income, operating margin and adjusted earnings were quarterly records. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $227 million. And year-to-date, cash flow has improved approximately $89 million from the prior year. ","We continue to return money to shareholders with the completion of 900 million shares -- $900 million shares repurchased year-to-date. The weighted average acquisition price was $19.80 per share for 45.4 million shares. Our return on net assets improved 450 basis points to 14.1%.","Later in the call, I will comment on the regular items that I stated in the February earnings call, namely operating performance, cost reduction, capital allocation and portfolio separation. I'm also going to talk to our 5-year planning process, asset impairments, union negotiations, divestitures and the recruitment and appointment of the two boards and two management teams before I review our updated annual guidance. Adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow guidance will be raised for the second time in 2019. And we'll also provide EBITDA guidance for the first time. ","Let me turn it over to Ken to give a deeper review of Q2 performance.","Kenneth Giacobbe","Great. Thank you, John. Now let's move to Slide 5 and the key financial results for the quarter. Revenue for the second quarter came in at $3.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Revenue was at our highest level since separation. Organic revenue, which adjusts for currency, aluminum prices and portfolio changes, was up $344 million or 10% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Revenue growth was driven by volume gains across all of our segments. The reconciliation for organic revenue can be found on Slide 22 in the Appendix.","All of our key markets continue to be healthy, and demand for our products continues to be strong. We've included our organic revenue growth rates by market on Slide 23 in the Appendix, and I'll touch on just a few. Organically, year-over-year revenue for the total Aerospace business was up 11% with defense aerospace delivering growth of 25%. Additionally, industrial products was up 12%. Double-digit growth in these markets was supported by solid year-over-year organic revenue growth of 7% in commercial transportation and 5% in automotive. ","Operating income, excluding special items, for the second quarter was at the highest level since separation at $484 million, up 27% year-over-year. Both EP&S and TCS delivered record segment operating profits. Higher pricing resulted in $41 million of favorable year-over-year impacts to operating income driven by EP&S and GRP. Year-to-date, prices increased $75 million over the prior year. As we mentioned on the first quarter earnings call, we expect favorable pricing to continue throughout the year as demand for our products continues to be strong. Higher volumes in the second quarter also favorably impacted operating income by $39 million mainly driven by aerospace but also in automotive and commercial transportation. Aluminum price was favorable to operating income $19 million in the quarter.","The incremental cost-out program that was launched in the first quarter was the main driver of our net cost reductions. On a year-to-date basis, the program has resulted in approximately $66 million of savings on a year-over-year basis. John will talk more about this program later in the presentation. In terms of opportunity, we continue with the transition of our Tennessee plant out of the North American packaging business to more profitable industrial products. The transition negatively impacted operating income in the second quarter. However, this was an improvement from the first quarter, and we expect to be a positive operating income in the fourth quarter.","At a consolidated level, operating margin, excluding special items, was up 240 basis points year-over-year. As John mentioned in his opening comments, all 3 segments contributed to margin expansion both year-over-year and sequentially. We have included the reconciliation of operating income, excluding special items, on Slide 34 in the Appendix. Adjusted free cash flow in the second quarter was $227 million or $62 million less than the second quarter of last year. For the second quarter, we continued to focus on days of working capital with an improvement of 2 days year-over-year to 52 days. Lower inventory of 4 days was the main driver of the improvement. The greatest improvement in days of inventory was in our EP&S segment with a 7-day improvement year-over-year.","Pension contributions and OPEB payments were $104 million, which was $21 million more than the second quarter of 2018. Capital expenditures decreased $35 million year-over-year to $136 million. Approximately 70% of the capital expense in the quarter was to return-seeking projects as we expand aerospace airflows, aerospace range, industrial products and forged aluminum wheel capacity. We continue to expect capital expenditures to the year -- for the year to be approximately $650 million or 4% of revenue. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow is $89 million higher than the prior year. Year-to-date, the improved free cash flow was driven primarily by three favorable items: higher net income, lower pension contributions and lower interest payments. These favorable items were somewhat offset by working capital to support our revenue growth.","Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was at a new high of $0.58 per share. This was $0.21 or 57% higher than the comparable period. The diluted earnings per share was primarily driven by operational improvements of $0.13, aluminum prices of $0.03 and lower share count of $0.03.","One final comment on earnings per share. The second quarter is historically our highest-earning quarter with lower levels expected in the third and fourth quarters due to our typical seasonality. Although the third and fourth quarter earnings per share are expected to be lower than the second quarter, we expect to see robust year-over-year growth in the second half. If you use our midpoint of our Q3 earnings per share guidance, this forecast would be an increase of 56% year-over-year.","Now let's move to the segment results on Slide 6. In the second quarter, EP&S' revenue was a record $1.6 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Organic revenue was up 8%. Segment operating profit was a record at $286 million, up 28%. The increase in segment operating profit was driven by double-digit growth in aerospace engines, aerospace defense, higher pricing and net cost reductions. The resulting segment operating margin expanded by 310 basis points to 18.3%.","In the second quarter, GRP's revenue was $1.6 billion, flat year-over-year, but organic revenue was up 11%. Segment operating profit was $145 million, up 31% year-over-year. The favorable year-over-year improvement in segment operating profit was driven by growth in our major markets, including aerospace, automotive and commercial transportation. Also, we had favorable pricing in industrial products and commercial transportation markets, lower aluminum prices and net cost reductions. The 31% growth in the segment operating profit included a $16 million unfavorable impact from transitioning our Tennessee assets out of North American packaging to more profitable industrial products. The impact in the second quarter was less than the first quarter, and we expect year-over-year impact to improve as we move forward. The second quarter also included challenges in our aluminum extrusions business, which is isolated to one plant. The team is making progress, and we expect to see improved performance in the third quarter. ","Despite the Tennessee transition or -- transition and challenges in the aluminum extrusions business, the GRP segment operating margin increased 210 basis points to 9.2%. We've had 3 consecutive quarters of sequential margin expansion in the GRP segment.","In the second quarter, TCS delivered revenue of $548 million, which was down 2% year-over-year. But organically revenue was up 3%. Segment operating profit was a record since the separation at $107 million, up 10%. The increase in segment operating profit was driven by higher volumes in both commercial transportation and building and construction markets as well as net cost reductions. Segment operating profit increased 220 basis points to 19.5%.","Now let's move to the second quarter key achievements on Slide 7. Our EP&S business had record quarterly revenue and segment operating profit for the second consecutive quarter. On a year-over-year basis, aerospace engines organic revenue was up 10% and aerospace defense organic revenue was up 26%. Favorable pricing improvements in EP&S continued in the second quarter as we achieved $24 million of year-over-year price increases.","In GRP, commercial airframe revenue was up 19% organically year-over-year. Price improvements in the industrial products and commercial transportation markets resulted in $18 million of year-over-year price increases.","Moving to TCS. The TCS segment as well as each business included in this segment had record segment operating profit and record segment operating margin in the second quarter. The expansion of our Wheels facility in Hungary remains on track for completion by the end of the year. And finally, the Wheels team delivered record quarterly performance year-to-date.","For Arconic, in addition to the highest quarterly revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin and earnings per share, we achieved the highest quarterly return on net assets since separation at 14.1%. Return on net assets was up 450 basis points year-over-year. And excluding the impairment impact, return on net assets was up 410 basis points year-over-year.","Finally, we increased our cash balance sequentially by $38 million, including the use of $200 million for share repurchases. Our cash balance at the end of the second quarter was approximately $1.4 billion compared to $1.5 billion last year. However, this year, we completed $900 million of share repurchases as we continued to return cash for our shareholders.","Before turning it back to John, let me briefly cover 2 items that can be found in the Appendix. The first is on Slide 20 in the Appendix where we've summarized the special items for the quarter. ","In the second quarter, our results included $565 million of pretax special items. More than 80% of the pretax special items, or $466 million, are related to noncash asset impairments and charges related to divestitures. Noncash asset impairments resulted in a charge of $444 million in the second quarter. The majority of the impairment of $428 million related to the Disks operation, an asset group in the engines business unit which is within the EP&S segment. ","As John will discuss shortly, we have updated our 5-year plan in the second quarter. The updated 5-year plan and expected future cash flows at the Disks asset group resulted in an impairment. We also recorded a charge of $22 million in the quarter related to the divestiture of a small additive manufacturing facility that closed in the second quarter and a small energy business that is expected to close in the third quarter. Both of these entities were included in the Engineered Structures business within the EP&S segment.","There are a number of other pretax special items in the quarter that are detailed on Slide 20. We're planning to file the 10-Q later today, and these items will be discussed in more detail in that document. ","For now, let me highlight 2 items. First, we recorded a pretax charge of $15 million in the quarter for lease termination and other costs. The majority of the costs related to exiting our corporate aircraft operations. Second, we experienced a fire at our fastener plant in St. Cosme, France that resulted in a $4 million unfavorable impact in the quarter related to equipment and inventory damage as well as higher operating cost. Fortunately, there were no injuries. We still continue to assess the impact of the fire. Current estimates are that we will have approximately $5 million to $10 million unfavorable impact in the third quarter, and it will take multiple quarters for us to recover from the fire. We will update you on the situation in the third quarter. We do have insurance which is expected to cover the fire with a deductible of $10 million.","Finally, the impact of discrete and special tax items for the quarter was a credit of $61 million. It included a benefit related to prior year foreign taxes and a benefit associated with a foreign tax rate change. ","The second item I wanted to cover was on Slide 21 in the Appendix where we've provided an update on our capital structure as we continue to manage our debt and reduce our liabilities. Gross debt is $6.3 billion and net debt stands at $5 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA continues to improve year-over-year despite a cash outflow associated with our $900 million of share repurchases year-to-date. Net debt-to-EBITDA stands at 2.35x, which is an improvement of 6% compared to the second quarter of 2018.","With that, let me turn it back over to John.","John Plant","Thanks, Ken. Moving to Slide 8. I'll now comment on the four focus areas that I discussed in the February earnings call, namely: operating performance, cost reduction, capital allocation and portfolio separation. On Slide 9 regarding operating performance, we continue to complete detailed quarterly operating reviews and monthly forecast reviews by segment as part of our profit improvement program. The reviews are robust, and the quarterly reviews kind of 25 key areas to drive current and future profit improvement. The review content continues to improve and underlying progress is being made. However, there's still a long way to go regarding performance improvements.","On Slide 10 and referring to cost reductions, actions are under way to reduce operating costs by $260 million on a run rate basis. Our commitment has increased by $30 million from the previous commitment of $230 million. $140 million of savings are expected to be captured now in 2019, which is an increase of $20 million from the previous $120 million commitment. The increasing savings this quarter resulted in a severance charge of $27 million.","On Slide 11, you can see that year-to-date, we have completed 2 share repurchases totaling $900 million. The weighted average purchase price was $19.80. Management has a total of $600 million of remaining share repurchase authority. This is comprised of $100 million of repurchase authority from the prior 2018 authorization and an additional authority of $500 million which was approved by the Arconic board in May of this year.","Lastly on Slide 12, we have an update on the separation. We continue to track with our stated Q2 2020 implementation date with a targeted filing of the Form-10 in the fourth quarter of this year. You can see the critical closing conditions as well as financial implications on the slide.","Moving to Slide 13. The names of the 2 companies will be Howmet Aerospace and Arconic Corporation. We plan to announce which company will be SpinCo at the next quarter's earnings call. We also plan to provide 2019 year-to-date financial information for the 2 future companies at that time. ","Consistent with the second quarter earnings call, we have identified noncore businesses for sale with an estimated value of $100 million to $200 million in proceeds with limited earnings impact. We also expect corporate costs to be in line with industry-leading peers. And in aggregate for the 2 new companies, they will be below the current Arconic corporate costs.","I would now like to comment on 5 additional actions on Slide 14. Firstly, in the second quarter, we completed the 5-year business plans for each of our units. Let me clarify. This is not a review of portfolio but more a granular-level examination of market share, competitive position, cost base and formulation of clear plans to execute in each business and to secure each business's future during the next year, 3-year and 5-year time periods. This is consistent with the plans that we are now executing on. The reviews focus on volume growth and price while building on a more competitive cost structure.","In terms of calibration for our shareholders, I see the benefit of these plans regarding product, price and mix to exceed the aggregate of the current cost reduction commitments made earlier in my notes today. Today, I'll just call out one example of this. Further clarity on other business units will be provided in our third quarter earnings call when we outline the 2 future segments for the new companies going forward.","Back to BCS. I referred to the 200 basis points of adjusted operating income margin improvement on the prior earnings call. We now see this opportunity as larger. Moving from 2018 through 2019 and into 2020, margins will increase by approximately 300 basis points. Cost is a feature. But more importantly, we will rationalize product lines and repurpose assets to better markets, which allow us to increase revenues and profits resulting from the benefits of this price and mix of products sold. And I'll cover this in more detail in the next quarter for other businesses.","Second, we took a charge for asset impairment. As part of the 5-year planning activity, we reviewed the asset base to assess future cash flows. This review resulted in a noncash impairment charge of $444 million. Of this charge, $428 million relates to the disk business or what was formerly referred to as Firth Rixson. ","Before moving on to other items, I think that it is appropriate to update you on Firth Rixson before eliminating the name from future years. Firstly, Rings. It's a business with approximately $700 million in annual revenue. It is fundamentally a good business in which Arconic has the largest market share globally. Profitability is now showing signs of improvement and, from the 2018 base, will show improvement in 2019, into 2020 and beyond. Improvement is driven by a combination of differentiated products; a more competitive cost structure; and bringing new, more efficient capital online.","The disk business by comparison is fundamentally fluid. In total, it is just in excess of $300 million in annual revenue. A portion of the disk business will be disposed of, and the smaller retained part has been rightsized and the asset carrying value will be impaired to allow for future competitiveness and improved profitability in 2020. The remaining portion of this disk business will be a small part of Arconic, and the significant losses of 2018 and 2019 will be eliminated.","Third, in the second quarter, we have come to a mutual agreement with the U.S. steelworkers to successfully conclude negotiations of the USW Master Agreement. Additionally, we concluded negotiations with the steelworkers at our titanium structures business in Niles, Ohio, which had been operating without a contract for the last 18 months.","Fourth, regarding divestitures. We've closed on a small transaction and signed a share repurchase agreement for another transaction with a close currently pending. We are making satisfactory progress on the remaining divestitures. As you can see, it's been a busy quarter. Finally, the process is under way to recruit and conclude appointments of the two boards and two management teams. Search committees have been defined and recruitment firms appointed to help form the future leadership teams of rolled products and the aerospace companies.","Regarding the management team, I want to announce the departure of Elmer Doty. Elmer decided not to participate in the future CEO selection process and to allow for a smooth transition. Elmer has agreed to step aside. Elmer will continue to be a Board member, and I want to give a personal thank you to Elmer for being my business partner in recent months. In addition, and to further solidify and clarify leadership, I have agreed to extend my term beyond the 5th of February 2020. I will continue to serve as CEO through separation and beyond, as required, to ensure continuity and performance of Arconic.","Finally, an update to our 2019 annual guidance. In light of current performance, coming off a healthy Q2 and considering our typical seasonality, we are updating and raising our guidance for the year. This reflects both our performance expectations in the second half and the fact that year-to-date, we've already earned an adjusted dollar earnings per share. ","Annual revenue is unchanged at $14.3 billion to $14.6 billion despite a fall in assumed aluminum prices. The adjusted earnings per share range forecast for Q3 is $0.47 to $0.53 earnings per share. Adjusted earnings per share forecast for the year increases to $1.95 to $2.05 per share. Free cash flow for the year increases to $700 million to $800 million. ","EBITDA guidance is provided for the first time and is approximately $2.3 billion, plus or minus $50 million. Our updated guidance assumes that the Boeing 737 MAX will remain at 42 aircraft builds per month on airframes and 48 builds per month on aircraft engines for the remainder of 2019. One final item before I turn it over to Q&A. Regarding Grenfell Tower, there is an update this quarter which is considered helpful. ","In addition to funding replacement planning for relevant high-rise public sector housing, the U.K. government has established a new fund to refurbish private high-rise buildings which have s and which are unlikely to meet U.K. building regulations. This fund will cover buildings which architects specify the aluminum planning, polyurethane from AAP, our French subsidiary, which was then fabricated and fitted by contractors as one component of the cladding and insulation system. This potential cladding remediation will be beneficial regarding the potential contribution of these systems to future fire risk in U.K. high-rise buildings. The details of the refurbishment process and fund continue to be developed. I'll try to provide a further update on these topics later today and our next earnings call. ","And with that, I'd like to open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland.","Carter Copeland","Great progress. Congrats. Just a two parter, John. I noticed you guys made some comments around quality -- record quality in Wheels. But I wondered if you might speak to what sort of trends you've seen in EP&S in there on quality and yields. I know that was a particular point of focus. I wondered if you could just give us some insight on that. And to the extent that it impacts your CapEx -- longer-term CapEx planning, I wondered if you could touch on that as well.","John Plant","Yes. First of all, quality within our EP&S business really across the board has continued to improve. In particular, I'd like to note the quality improvements as we've started to come down as we improved rates on the learning curves on some of the engine airfoils, and that's obviously very welcome. ","Of course, we are bringing into commission 2 new manufacturing plants over the next 3 to 5 months. That's the new plant for the molding process in Morristown, Tennessee for the insert to the airfoil business, and then a new plant in Whitehall, Michigan for the casting of the airfoils. Both of those are on track. In fact, if anything, a little bit ahead. And we're hopeful we may get some modest production out in the fourth quarter, which would be about a quarter earlier than previously anticipated. Everything appears to be on track. Obviously, we're monitoring that to make sure that our future quality is -- also continues to improve. ","On the second part of the question on CapEx, we've maintained the guidance given. The critical investments that we need for the expansion, particularly in our engine business, has been -- again, everything's on track. Same for the Hungary, for the Wheels business and same for Tennessee, which allows that transition out of -- into the -- more into the industrial market which occurs in the second half of 2020. ","So at the moment, I'll say everything is in order, and the -- I think the expectation is that we're planning to further trim our CapEx requirements going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Wondering, if we think about how cash flow kind of, progresses from here and we think about some top line growth next year dropping through, the lack of severance costs, an incremental $120 million or so from the cost savings that didn't drop through this year, it would seem that there's a path to some nice cash flow growth next year with the one kind of question mark remaining there about pension. So I guess is it that -- can you speak a little bit to the potential for cash flow growth next year?","John Plant","I think all the elements that you've highlighted, Seth, indeed are true. Next year, clearly we're not going to have the level of cash restructuring. I tried to provide a little bit of color of our future CapEx on -- in my response to the -- to Carter Copeland, and certainly the results of the cost reductions and some of those things I talked about in terms of margin improvement really are all positive, I think, not just for future cash flow. Clearly, we shall conclude our negotiations at some point on separation with the PBGC on the pension matter. But outside of that, the underlying theme of what you said is correct.","Seth Seifman","All right. And then apologize if I missed this, but you talked about staying on for kind of, I guess, an indeterminate period of time. Did you specify which company you plan to stay with?","John Plant","No, I did not.","Seth Seifman","Right. Okay. And I guess that perhaps when you give us more information next quarter about the split and who's RemainCo and stuff. But at that point, we'll learn that?","John Plant","Well, I'm sure you're going to press me and ask me in the future about that. Great question. But the important thing is -- was to make sure we had continuity through the separation. And I think that's just -- that's fundamental to making sure that everything is really smooth and performance continues.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna","I heard you say your guidance implies 48 a month on the LEAP-1B. I just wondered, have you actually seen a step-down yet? Or is this just advance caution?","John Plant","We saw a modest step-down of, I think, of two engines. I think in the B, that's the information I have. But it's just being cautious as well.","Gautam Khanna","Okay, two engines from 52, just to clarify?","John Plant","Yes. Yes.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. Secondly, maybe, Ken, I was wondering, discount rates have moved down. Obviously, pension is a bit of a recurring theme. But I was just curious, given asset returns, any preliminary color on where the plan, what the deficit would look like if you snap the line today on the pension and OPEB?","Kenneth Giacobbe","Yes. Yes, Gautam. So a couple of comments. First, when we look at pension and OPEB, we were down about -- or improved $322 million year-over-year. And on top of that, I would say that on the pension side, 90% of the gross liabilities froze into future service accruals and about 75% on the OPEB side. We will restrike or remeasure at the end of the year, but a couple of things that I can tell you. Last year where the discount rate was at about 4%, 4.35%, we're seeing a number more around 3.5%. Right now, we do have for you in Slide 19 of the Appendix the sensitivities. So that's about an 85% bps move on the liability side. But also, I would note that on the asset returns side, we've been doing a lot of work over the last 12 months. Last year, our asset returns were negative 3%. If we look through June of this year, we're in the low double digits. We had moved our investment strategy more to the equity side. So we've also benchmarked those returns against our peer group, and we're at about -- better than about 85% of our peers. So we will have an adverse impact, to your point, around the liability side driven by the discount rate. There will be an offset on the asset side based on our returns most likely, but we will restrike that at the end of the year. And the sensitivities are on Slide 19.","Gautam Khanna","And one last one, if I may. I was just curious, John, if you could speak about the pricing progress you've made on the EP&S side and sort of what opportunities still lie ahead. Is -- how receptive, how difficult were those conversations? And kind of how -- what's your confidence on restriking versus contract buyer?","John Plant","I think we have really tried to ensure that we have a future line of sight for all of these long-term contract renewals. So I can now see that several years out. And it's very much been a process. We spent even more time at -- during our 5-year plan reviews trying to understand the fundamental competitive advantage and where we had true excellence. And so, for example, in the very -- or the first and second and third blade, the hot end of the engine, where we think we have some unique capabilities. And so we think we should be paid appropriately for that level of skill set and value we bring to the capabilities of those aircraft engines. That's just one example. ","I mean some of these I don't really want to spend a lot of time talking about apart from the discipline has previously been, I think, very deep in the organization. And now it's something that I expect each business unit head to be able to sit and talk to me about because if I have the information, then I expect them to. And, I mean, it's a healthy dialogue, trying to maintain both good relations with our customers but, at the same time, trying to make sure that we do get paid appropriately for the level of value we bring to the engine and to the whole aircraft.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Korn from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Korn","Just a couple from me. First, we heard from one of your competitors that a certain jet engine customer is becoming more aggressive with inventory management. Are you seeing anything similar? And then second, having completed all these 5-year plans for each segment, could this turn into more clarity on medium-term targets for all the segments into year-end? Is that something we could see and understand a bit better before the split?","John Plant","Okay. So let me deal with the second one first. I haven't decided yet, but I'm thinking about possibly giving some 2020 revenue guidance at the next earnings call. And obviously, we'll be giving 2020 guidance when we announce the fourth quarter in the early part of 2020. ","Personally, I'm not particularly a fan of giving out future hostages to fortune in terms of giving growth and margin profiles. It assumes a level of knowledge, which inevitably is imperfect. I prefer to that achievement, and the directional vectors give guidance to that. And I can't imagine me breaking out a pattern to do that in -- during my leadership of the company. So I think that deals with that one. The first question, I'm trying remember what it was now.","Matthew Korn","Inventory.","John Plant","Oh, inventory management. No change I've seen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays.","David Strauss","I want to ask you about the EBITDA guidance that you gave. The margin, I think, implied in that in the back half of the year is lower than obviously what we saw in Q2. And I know you have normal seasonality in the back half of the year, but what you're talking about with Tennessee and the BCS improvement, can you just give a little bit more detail on the margin outlook in the second half?","John Plant","I have to say I didn't know that it gave that impression. So rather than me grapple for numbers as we speak, here, David, I'll say, I don't recognize it. So maybe I'll get you to recheck your math or we'll do it, and we'll have a separate conversation with you. But that's not something that's in tune with my thinking.","David Strauss","Okay. All right. And then I think in Q4, you have this convert that's coming due. How do you -- what's the plan for that at this point?","John Plant","So I'm going to pass that across to Ken, but essentially will be -- my expectation is we'll pay that off and redeem them.","Kenneth Giacobbe","Yes. The only thing I'd add to that, David, is on Slide 18 in the Appendix you can see the share count by quarter. And to John's point, included in that is for us to settle the RTIs in cash.","David Strauss","Okay. It's what I thought. I just want to confirm.","John Plant","And so it's going to take both our gross and net debt -- our gross debt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Seaport from -- or Josh Sullivan from Seaport Global.","Joshua Sullivan","Just within GRP on the automotive body-in-white vertical, Arconic was a pioneer in that market. I know you've been able to swap the assets, and now you've got the 5-year review. Curious on what your capacity needs in the auto sheet are at this point. And then just as a follow-up, can you talk about growth expectations for auto sheet over the next 12 months or so?","John Plant","Okay. I think the underlying secular trend of lightweighting is certainly going to be a feature in the automotive market for the next decade. And if I look at it like an average for last year, there's somewhere between 6% and 9% conversion on an annual basis. And I'm going to say on a normal order cycle, it should be enough to overcome, I'll say, auto cyclicality. Obviously, of course, you can't say that. But roughly, year-to-year, you can. ","We intend to -- so if I look at the GRP segment, I mean, it really falls into 3 in the future, which is: aerospace, where we're just over 20% of our revenues, which is very solid and healthy; automotive, which has obviously contracted as well in terms of volumes with the vehicle manufacturers. There we're -- we have good margins and expect that to continue. And in fact, one of the features of our plan has been diversification of our customer base. And indeed, well, we have now announced which vehicle manufacturer we have succeeded in designing up another very major U.S. platform in the second quarter, which obviously is going to be good for the future order book and we'll see some of that materialize in 2020, and then obviously a full year effect in 2021 and beyond. So we are pretty pleased about that not only for the inherent profitability but also the security of the -- of supply and -- for us to actually need to achieve more throughput and more volume in our rolling mills. And obviously, that's -- it gives us a very good baseload. ","And then finally, the industrial segment, where we've seen, obviously, significant and healthy price improvements, pulling with the common electric case, which has given us that protection for the probably next few years. It could be five years and beyond. And obviously, with the well, I'll say, publicized investment in Tennessee that we've talked about, that's additional capacity and additional finishing end mill capacity is planned to come on in the second half of 2020. Again, we see that as a healthy future margin for the business and us being totally out of packaging in the U.S., albeit we'll still be in production for packaging in Russia and China. ","So I tried to give you a bit of a sweep through GRP and obviously, we've been making progress and you've seen the sequential margin improvement that Ken talked to, if I'm -- really Q3 of last year through Q4. So it's about 5% quarters to 7% to 9%. And obviously, we're pleased with that progress.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Olin from Longbow Research.","Christopher Olin","You might have touched on it a bit on an earlier question, but I just want to maybe zero in a little bit here on maybe your confidence level in keeping the market share on the next Airbus titanium contract. Seems like all 4 companies are submitting bids. In the past, there have been some reliability issues with the old RTI. Just wondering if you're going to keep it and would pricing hold. Anything there would help.","John Plant","Of course, I mean, nobody knows at this point whether we keep that contract. There's one specific. Of course, there are multiple contracts for titanium with the increased use of titanium in future aircraft. We're confident of the future revenues and order book for our business. I have been paying particular attention to our titanium business. And indeed, it's actually a very -- the major site, which is Niles in Ohio, is the very first site that I visited in Arconic. And during the last few months, I've tried hard to dedicate resources to that plant to have fundamental improvements in terms of quality, in terms of OEE and throughput and in terms of customer compliance and combined also with the significant inventory reduction, which I think is a fundamental part of quality improvements as well.","So I think very positively about our titanium business. It's an area which I think we need to continue to focus on. I was really pleased that we were able to conclude agreements with the steelworkers on that contract and really trying to reset the -- and I think have to logically reset or at least attempted to reset the relationship between management and the steelworkers in that site. So I think it's a really important site for us, and I see plans and expect plans and achievements to improve the future profitability of it. But having said that, which I say a very positive backlog to the business, on the Airbus contract, we're all in a bid situation. We're incumbents. We are hopeful to retain our share. But I'm sure that, and I've read the same stuff that you've read about, other people think that they're going to win. I'm never so bold as to make those predictions when we're looking at bidding against other people. I don't see why I need to beat my chest and say that sort of stuff.","Christopher Olin","Okay. Helpful. And then I just want to make sure I understand your comments about Boeing and the MAX. I think you said 42 on the frame and 40 in the engine. I had always been under the impression that Arconic's lead times on finished products are pretty far out there. Are you shipping at those levels? Are you shipping at where Boeing is going to be in like the fourth quarter and 2020?","John Plant","We'll ship whatever Boeing, Spirit and GE want us to ship out. I'm just trying to give you guidance to what we've assumed in our plans financially going forward. So if people were to build fuselage at a higher rate, then obviously that's good for us -- or engine at a higher rate, that's good for us. Clearly, if the engine rate was lower, then we'll be moving some of that capacity to clear some of the other arrears and meet the demand on other engines that we have and in particular for the military requirements of the -- of those engines as well. And so we're sort of trying to balance everything out at the moment, but I was just trying to give you the best guidance I could in terms of our financial assumptions.","Christopher Olin","That makes sense. And congrats on the success that you had.","John Plant","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.","Seth Seifman","Guys, just one follow-up here in terms of understanding the cost cutting plan. Sort of my understanding that it was directed kind of primarily at overhead. Now if I look back at like the run rate corporate cost in the back half of last year, it looks like annualized that was about $200 million. So when we think about where the cost cutting is directed, clearly the corporate costs are not going to 0, obviously. So do you consider that there was a fair amount of overhead in the segments that that's also where the cost cutting is kind of directed? Or maybe I was sort of overestimating the degree to which overhead was playing a role here.","John Plant","I'm going to pass the majority of that question across to Ken. Essentially, there was significant cost cutting at the corporate level. But we also planned at a reduced percentage cost cutting at the businesses. In particular, something which we did which, I guess, maybe we haven't publicized enough is that between corporate and the six individual businesses, there were three sub-HQ levels, 1 for each of those reporting segments. So 1 for the rolled products, 1 for EP&S and [indiscernible] and 1 for TCS. Those have been eliminated altogether. So there has been cost cutting at every level. ","One of the reasons why you may not see a full effect of, if you do the math, SG&A is that we've also had a good problem to deal as the share price has improved, is that we've needed to remark and put through to the P&L additional charge for that, for the share compensation. So I just wanted to make sure we got that fact out, that as well it's all taken care of in the results year-to-date. And Ken, I'll pass the cost to you.","Kenneth Giacobbe","Yes. Just a couple of other things, Seth, to build on John's comments. You'll see in the Q that we'll file later on today that there's multiple pieces that come out of this cost restructuring program. The biggest part is labor, and you'll see in there that about 40% of the labor reduction is coming at corporate. But it's not just limited to labor. We're looking at other items like indirect cost savings, which relate to energy, maintenance, transportation. We've also exited the aircraft that I talked about earlier on there, but we've also looked at the balance sheet. So on the retiree side, retiree life, we eliminated. We reduced some of the Medicare subsidy programs as well. So it's an all-encompassing program, and you'll see some more detail of that in the Q.","Operator","Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. We are now concluding the call. You may now disconnect."]}}
