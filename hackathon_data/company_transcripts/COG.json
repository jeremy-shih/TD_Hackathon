[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO. Please, go ahead.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Allison, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are several executive members of team Cabot. I would first like to emphasize that on this morning's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.","As some of you may recall, this time last year, we laid out a strategy for 2018 that was focused on: first, delivering growth in production and reserves per debt-adjusted share while generating positive free cash flow; secondly, generating and improving return on capital employed that exceeds our cost to capital; third, increasing our return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and fourth, maintaining a strong balance sheet to maximize financial flexibility. I'm very happy to report that we have successfully delivered on all the strategies that we had laid out for 2018. For the year, we delivered growth in production and reserves per debt-adjusted share of 12% and 25%, respectively. Most importantly, the company generated $297 million of free cash flow, a 92% increase relative to prior year.","I would highlight that this is the third consecutive year of positive free cash flow generation during a period in which the company generated an adjusted earnings per share CAGR in excess of 100%.","The company generated a 15.9% return on capital employed for the year, far exceeding our weighted average cost of capital and representing an improvement relative to prior year of 860 basis points. This 15.9% return on capital compares favorably to the average S&P 500 return on capital, highlighting that there is a company in the E&P sector that can in fact deliver returns that are competitive across the broad equity market.","Additionally, we exceeded our initial expectations by returning over $1 billion of capital to shareholders, including increasing our quarterly dividend twice and repurchasing over 38 million shares in 2018.","This represented over a 9% shareholder yield to equity holders. Also, we have now reduced our shares outstanding by over 9% since restarting our share repurchase program in 2017.","Lastly, we demonstrated our continued commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet by reducing debt levels of -- by approximately $300 million, resulting in a year-end debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of 1x. When considering the combination of cash dividends, stock repurchases and debt reduction, the company delivered a total stakeholder yield of over 12% for the year.","In addition to these highlights, we delivered growth in adjusted earnings per share by 125%. Our results for the year demonstrate that despite the negative sentiment around the energy sector and specifically as it relates to natural gas base, Cabot is generating a compelling combination of growth, free cash flow, return on capital, return of capital, while maintaining investment-grade balance sheet. As it relates specifically to the fourth quarter of 2018, the company generated net income of $275 million or $0.64 per share and adjusted net income of $236 million or $0.55 per share.","Cabot's cash from operating activity in the fourth quarter was $316 million, while discretionary cash flow in the fourth quarter was $493 million. Cabot also delivered $241 million of free cash flow during the fourth quarter of 2018, exceeding our previous expectation of $200 million. All of these improvements relative to the fourth quarter of '17 were driven by higher production, stronger natural gas price realizations and a significant improvement in our cost structure. ","In fact, 2018 represented the company's lowest unit cost in history. One specific operating expense I want to highlight is the exploratory dry hole cost we incurred in the fourth quarter, resulting from unsuccessful drilling results in our second exploratory area. As a result, we do not expect to allocate any incremental capital to exploration at this time.","Let's move on to reserve discussion, Cabot reported year-end improved reserves of 11.6 trillion cubic foot equivalent, an increase of 19% over year-end 2017, despite the divestiture of our Eagle Ford property in 2018. Cabot's total company all-source finding and development cost were $0.30 per MCF year, while our Marcellus-only all-source finding and development cost were $0.26 per MCF. These results reaffirm our acreage position in Susquehanna County as the lowest-cost natural gas asset in North America. As many of you are aware, we tested a sample of Upper Marcellus wells during 2018 with our generation-5 completion design to further demonstrate the resource potential of this distinctive incremental reservoir. Based on the production history today, the Gen-5 Upper Marcellus wells placed on production during 2018 have outperformed the average EUR per 1,000 lateral feet of 2.9 from our earlier-generation Upper Marcellus completions. To answer several questions regarding the Upper Marcellus, these results reconfirm our previous Upper Marcellus wells results demonstrated, which is: While the Upper Marcellus reservoir has its own distinctive characteristics relative to the Lower Marcellus, it remains one of the most economic reservoirs in North America. Our plan is to continue to drill and complete a small sample of Upper Marcellus wells each year, to build a larger population of Gen-5 Upper Marcellus wells. Once again, these results, coupled with our previous Upper Marcellus completions, have extensive production history, reconfirming our conviction on the distinct nature of this reservoir and reinforce our views on the multi-decade inventory life remaining from this world-class asset.","All right. Move to the marketing and pricing update. Much of the -- our success for the fourth quarter and full year was driven by the long-awaited addition of new takeaway capacity in the basin, demand projects that have been work -- we've been working on for years. Cabot's realized natural gas prices before hedges improved by 50% relative to the prior year comparable quarter, driven by a combination of higher NYMEX prices and a significant improvement in differentials, which came in at $0.42 below NYMEX, our lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2013. The exposure we now have to highly seasonal markets in the Mid-Atlantic, we expect our first quarter 2019 price realizations to be flat to or even a slight premium to NYMEX. For the full year, we still expect our weighted average differential before the impact of hedges to be $0.30. On the hedging front, we utilized the short-lived winter rally to layer in NYMEX and basis hedges, which we posted on our website this morning. We anticipate these hedges will generate over $55 million of our additional revenue this year, based on the current forward curve. We will continue to be opportunistic in layering and hedges during market rallies in order to protect our anticipated free cash flow for the year.","Now I'll provide commentary for 2019. For the full year, we updated our 2019 capital budget to $800 million, resulting in production growth of 20% or 27% on a debt-adjusted per share basis. Our decision to target the lower end of our preliminary capital guidance range is the direct result of current market conditions, feedback from shareholders and the broader investment community and our continued strategic focus on returns and free cash flow over top line production growth.","We believe that we have an industry leader and -- we have been an industry leader in deemphasizing growth for the sake of it and prioritizing return of and on capital, while maximizing the free cash flow. Our updated program for the year reaffirms our commitment to this philosophy and echoes our commentary from the third quarter earnings call last October.","We have certainly heard data points from the appellation peers that imply a more rational approach to capital allocation in 2019, and Cabot fully supports the rationalization of capital to bring stability to the market.","With that said, we have actually witnessed a slight increase in the rig count in the Marcellus, Utica and Haynesville since our call last October, meanwhile, despite early winter-related rally, the NYMEX strip remains in backwardation. While we are cautiously optimistic on the supply -- demand outlook for the next 24 months, due in large part to significant demand growth and material-based declines across the U.S., we believe it is prudent for us to plan more conservatively and utilize an incremental free cash flow, resulting from higher prices for our additional returns of capital to shareholders as opposed to funding additional outsized production growth. As a result, we are using to a $2.75 NYMEX assumption for budgeting purposes in 2019, which is below the current strip of approximately $2.90 when taking in consideration -- account -- and account for actual NYMEX settlements for January and February.","Under this more conservative price assumption, we expect to generate between $600 million and $650 million of free cash flow, implying a 6% free cash flow yield. I would highlight, this differs slightly from $650 million to $700 million of expected free cash flow that we discussed on the third quarter call, which was based on a higher NYMEX assumption of $2.85 million instead of the $2.75 we are using. As we highlighted on our third quarter call, we plan to return at least 50% of this free cash flow to shareholders annually through the combination of growing dividend and share repurchase, resulting in a minimum total shareholder yield of 3%.","At $2.75 NYMEX, our 2019 program is expected to deliver between 40% and 55% growth in adjusted earnings per share and between a 21% and 23% return on capital employed. Even under a $2.50 NYMEX assumption, which some of the sell side are calling for, our program would deliver between $475 million and $525 million of free cash flow, which implies a 5% free cash flow yield at the midpoint, also, between 20% and 35% growth in adjusted earnings per share and a return on capital employed between 19% and 21%. We believe these metrics are very compelling relative to the broader equity market, especially at these trough commodity prices assumptions. I think it is also important to highlight that we are going to generate this type of free cash flow, while continuing to reinvest in the disciplined growth of our assets via the drill bit. We will -- we have been numerous -- excuse me, we have seen numerous 2019 budgets released across the sector that imply significant reduction in capital spending year-over-year in order to target free cash flow neutrality.","However, for some, the limited capital investment, there could be a day of reckoning in 2020. In contrast, assuming price realizations are flat to 2019, our program for 2020 is designed, first and foremost, to deliver an improving return on capital employed and to generate strong free cash flow for the 5th consecutive year from a capital program that is lower than 2019, all while maintaining a pristine balance sheet. We expect to continue to deliver growth in cash flow and earnings per share in 2020, driven by disciplined capital allocation, resulting in measured production growth. Additionally, the continued reduction in our shares outstanding, resulting from our buyback program, should further accrete per share metrics.","Our decision to be more disciplined with our capital allocation for the year and deliver more measured growth will only do so much to help balance the market. We believe it is important to send a message to investors, both energy specialists and generalists alike, that there is a company in the industry that is committed to disciplined capital allocation and has the assets that can generate a compelling combination of returns and growth in per share financial metrics, even under much lower natural gas price assumptions and a reduced capital program. In summary, I believe our strategic effort have continued to create incremental value for our shareholders as we have transformed Cabot into the lowest-cost producer in the industry, with the lowest headcount and capital intensity, the highest capital efficiency and ultimately resulting in return on capital employed, free cash flow and per share growth metrics that are not only industry-leading but also extremely competitive when compared to all other sectors across the S&P 500. So with that, Allison, I'd be more than happy to open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question today will come from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","You've been very upfront on the return of capital to shareholders, committing to at least 50% of free cash flow. How do you think about the, at least or the plus in that, as it relates to 2019 cash balances, seem to have kind of come down here at the end of the year? And maybe you could also comment on what you see as the right sustainable cash balance as you think about trying to manage the plus and the 50% plus of returning free cash flow to shareholders.","Dan Dinges","Yes, by design, we brought our cash balance down, felt comfortable with the infrastructure buildout, Atlantic Sunrise, the commission with those two power plants that -- with that and our ability to grow into deliveries on those infrastructures that our cash flow was not a -- not just an assumption, but it was a reality. So we felt comfortable not only drawing down that cash balance but repaying the $300 million of debt and increasing the dividend twice this last year and with the $1 billion of buyback. Right now, with the free cash flow generation that we anticipate in '19, we've kind of layered in a base assumption, Brian, at the $2.75, and the plus would come, if in fact, we realize the $2.90, which the strip sits at today, if we realize the $2.90 then -- or something above that, then we're going to do what we've done in the past, and that is to deliver some of the funds back to the shareholder. We'll make a decision whether it's in the form of dividend or a buyback. But it's not our intent, with our confidence level of the cash flow we generate, it's not our intent to leave a lot of cash on the balance sheet.","Brian Singer","And then my follow-up is on the midstream front. I don't know if you or Jeff are teed up for just the latest and greatest update on the various timing of projects and anything that's new that's coming onto the chalkboard, but that would be great, if that's a possibility.","Dan Dinges","Yes, I'll flip it over to Brian -- I mean to Jeff, Brian.","Jeffrey Hutton","Yes, I think on the midstream, it's relatively quite as we await some additional ruling with the PennEast. I can tell you if there are some new projects that have been laid out in front of us over the last few months that we're interested in. I don't think a lot of this has reached out into the public domain yet, but still a lot of movement on midstream projects. Additionally, I think even -- maybe more importantly is the additional, in-basin demand project that we're viewing. There's quite a bit of activity, not just in Susquehanna County but in that Northeast corner of Pennsylvania, with additional projects that are being developed to keep gas in the basin. And that's been exciting to watch as well.","Brian Singer","Can I ask, on the new projects, are you talking about those to move gas to the New Jersey, New York markets, to the Southeast markets or dare I ask, to the Northeast markets? Yes.","Jeffrey Hutton","Yes, so I think, a couple of them will do both, and the -- I don't think anyone has given up on building pipe out of Pennsylvania into either New Jersey or New York and additionally, moving gas back down into the South. But I think the pipelines, we'll be talking about those in the next few months.","Dan Dinges","Yes, Brian, I'd like -- yes, I'd like to add also on that point that not only would gas move out of basin, like Jeff is referring to, there are also a number of in-basin projects that he alluded to that we continue to work on that we think would not have it on the long-haul pipes but would have it from the tailgate of our gathering system. And we think that is meaningful to simply from the standpoint of how it assists in balancing the basis up there. I would also like to point out while I take this time as some of my colleagues here want me to maybe not expand on questions, but I would point out that in the New York Post today, there was an interesting article on Cuomo and the results of his crusade against natural gas and the beginning of some of the issues that New York is experiencing up there, experiencing the farm where it is starting to hurt small businesses, it's starting to hurt the development of new housing. I think it's clear that businesses are going to be turning away from New York. And with all of this, including the largest utility in New York representing that they will no longer accept applications for natural gas hookups, and that's kind of it, beginning March 15. I think these are all the early signs of -- that a policy that is creating a significant calamity in New York. And I think it'll continue to have companies evacuate from doing business there.","Operator","Our next questioner will come from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers.","Dan Dinges","Let's move on.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy.","Michael Hall","Just curious, I guess, on -- as I was looking at your 1Q guidance, it seems pretty clear you guys aren't really like leaning into the winter market, let's say. Was that a view on the market stability to take the volumes are more a function of just the strict adherence to your approach on capital discipline?","Dan Dinges","Have our scheduled program. We have the time completion, Michael. When we get our pads -- all the drilling completion done on particular pads. And at various times of the year, just sequentially, it -- they come on at various different times, and it gets a little bit lumpy. And so there's no particular master design on where we are in the first quarter.","Michael Hall","Okay. And do you have any sort of curtailed volumes that you could theoretically open up for opportunistic accessing of the market? And I guess, for lack of a better way to put, are you kind of running full house in any given period?","Dan Dinges","No. We're producing what we can. The curtailed, if you will, volumes would be volumes that are adjacent -- that are wells that are adjacent to completing pads. We do shut in our existing production on some of the surrounding patch, surrounding wells while completions are going on to help avoid frac hits and things like that. So -- but as far as having a block of curtailed volumes, we do not have that, and I don't anticipate anybody in the industry has that.","Michael Hall","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then I guess last for mine is just on the Upper Marcellus. I'm just curious, just exactly how much do you think you will allocate in the 2019 program on the Upper Marcellus? And are there any changes in completion design associated with incremental productivity?","Dan Dinges","We have a handful of wells that we'll drill, and whether 10, 15 -- that's kind of in the key right now. I don't have the exact count in front of me, Michael, on the status of the drilling completion of the ones that we have scheduled for '19, but we had a -- we're just a good sample pool of Upper Marcellus completions.","Operator","Our next questioner will come from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","I wanted to pick up. You touched on this a bit in your earlier question, but I wanted to explore a little bit more. When I look at the -- you guys have a slideshow on how the basis has improved up to the Northeast. And when I look at that, it looks to me that delivering volumes -- you've moved all these volumes on the Atlantic Sunrise, but delivering volumes into the local market, looks -- it certainly looks more attractive than it has for most of the last in your few years. And so -- but it -- my read on what you guys are doing is you guys are electing not to do that because you're keeping your CapEx low, and looks like you guys are -- or you've committed to doing more cash return to shareholders. So can you talk about how you went through that decision? I know it's something you look at all the time, but how was the evaluation of delivering the incremental volumes into the local market look to you right now?","Dan Dinges","And I'll flip to Jeff to make commentary on the basis. But one quick comment is, with Atlantic Sunrise coming on, we knew we were going to transfer those volumes out of basin, with a couple of long-term contracts that we were fulfilling and price points out of the basin that were better than in-basin pricing. So we're doing that. On the question about backfilling. We saw contemporaneous with the commissioning of Atlantic Sunrise and these power plants. We saw a fairly drastic narrowing of the differential. And with that -- that improved -- not only did we have an improvement by the gas that we moved on the new infrastructures and to the power plants, but that dramatic improvement in the basis also enhanced every other molecule that we were still selling into the basin. So with that uplift and the rest of our gas, we feel comfortable that maintaining that volumes we're producing and having just a measured growth by our capital allocation and allocating back some of our free cash and buying back shares and having a per share metric component to growth, we think that fits what we're trying to accomplish on improving realizations throughout not only the basin but also where we're moving gas outside the basin.","Jeffrey Hutton","Without getting too far into the weeds on this, we -- Atlantic Sunrise, the reaction in the marketplace was pretty much what we expected. Of course, Cabot did redirect a large amount of volume from other pipes to fill Atlantic Sunrise. On the other hand, the other half, I guess, of Atlantic Sunrise, those volumes were being delivered into the Leidy system directly. And so what we saw was a large amount of gas leaving the lighting system as well as Cabot gas leaving the Leidy system, but then that influence in that Leidy basis fell back into the other pipelines as well. And then along at the same time, we have a number of in-basin projects, not just Cabot-related but other producer-related projects. So it was somewhat of a perfect storm in a very good way, this fall, for the pricing and the basis in Northeast PA.","Charles Meade","Got it. You guys -- and then, if I could also ask Dan, back on the Upper Marcellus, what would you guys need to see in terms of well productivity or whatever the metric -- development metric for you? What do you need to see from those Upper Marcellus leases before you decided to perhaps codevelop those with Lower Marcellus locations and save on the surface and mold costs and things of that nature?","Dan Dinges","Well, I'll make a couple of comments. First, I'll make a comment regarding our comfort level since we received a number of -- not a number, a couple of questions regarding our Upper Marcellus and how do you know it's distinctive. And I'm going to just give one example. We have a number of examples that we could give to you, but I'll give you one example that most people are not going to have any problems understanding how we have the conviction that we do. We laid 2 -- this -- recently, we laid two Upper Marcellus wells in an area that we had prior completions on our -- in our -- in the Lower Marcellus. And in this specific example I'll give you, we had two Lower Marcellus wells that had been producing for an extended period of time. We put two Upper Marcellus wells 400 feet, get that context, 400 feet from two Lower Marcellus wells that had produced a long time. And we completed those two Upper Marcellus wells that were 400 feet from these two Lower Marcellus wells. It just so happened to be the two Lower Marcellus wells that we chose to do this experiment on have each cum-ed over 20 Bcf. ","Okay, so we laid two Upper Marcellus wells, 400 feet from two wells that had cum-ed each 20 bcf. Those Upper Marcellus wells came on normally as you might expect. The early time production from those Upper Marcellus wells have actually fit a curve. And again I'm going to caution the comment here on a curve fit with very little data, but those two Upper Marcellus wells came on fitting a curve of 3.3 Bcf per 1,000 and 3.7 Bcf per 1,000. I'm not saying that that's what we're going to go to. So don't take it, and I hope nobody comes and ask about what about the 3.3, 3.7 Bcf, 5,000 EUR. That might be our poster, Charles, from this point forward. I'm just giving you an example of our confidence level. If there's any place we would have seen some issues, it would've been where we had produced over 40 Bcf, 400-something feet away from a couple of Upper Marcellus. So that's -- so box commentary in that. What was the rest of your question?","Charles Meade","Well, what was...","Dan Dinges","Scott wants to -- Scott's been raising his hand so...","Scott Schroeder","But Charles, I think back to the -- at what point would you go to taking a word out of the West Texas, the -- and [indiscernible] playbook be the cube kind of concept. The other thing that plays into that is what is the takeaway capacity in that part of our field at this point in time? What we wouldn't want to do is do all of the lowers and the uppers and then be constrained because we wouldn't be able to get that gas to market. And while -- in addition to being the most efficient to the lowers then the uppers and come back, do -- and do the uppers later. And Dan's example right now highlights that there is no degradation when we came back. That's still the primary focus of how we're going to do it. The really only downside is the mold cost you mentioned because we're building the pads where we can come back on them and all that kind of stuff. So there's not a lot of lost efficiency. What we don't want to do is instruct Williams to put a huge pipe out there that will never be filled again after the initial production. That's just not efficient from that side of the equation. So that's kind of the dynamic. We will do some science test, like Dan highlighted earlier, where we'll do -- we had 10 or 15 that we think -- I think that's the latest number in the '19 program. We did 9 in the '18 program. We'll continue to do a few handfuls of these as part of the science project going forward. But in terms of full develop -- the full pad outside and maybe 1 or 2 for science purposes, it's still most efficient to do what we're doing.","Operator","The next question will come from Mike Kelly of Seaport Global.","Michael Kelly","I just wanted to check in with you guys on the Constitution pipeline. RBN had an article out this week that at least expressed some sort of hope in the revival of that project and just wanted to get your perspective on that and your thoughts.","Dan Dinges","Well, we have maintained our efforts to get some movement in Constitution. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals had a ruling -- a favorable ruling in a similar case, a fact-patterned case, that was favorable to Constitution's fact pattern. And the FERC is there's still consideration out there, I guess, and a sense on maybe what might happen next. And we think the ruling in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is again favorable if you didn't take the fact pattern that we have in Constitution. And that has to do with the waiver consideration. So we hope we'll have at -- maybe at some point in time another time to have this addressed, and we continue to work on that.","Michael Kelly","Okay. Any extensive timing on that? Like what the next step is for us to look for?","Dan Dinges","Yes, we have -- with all the uncertainty, I'd be speculating, Mike. But I would think that -- I would hope that sometime in the first half of '19 that we would have some additional consideration from the courts, from FERC or something that might opine on this.","Operator","Our next question will come from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc.","Leo Mariani","I don't want to harp too much here on the Upper Marcellus, but I know you guys, I think, said you had nine wells that you get to do work on in 2018 not ready at this point kind of come out with anymore defined EUR estimates. But out of curiosity, I mean, how much production history do you think you need to see on some of those wells to give you guys a better sense of what the Upper Marcellus EURs look like? And what -- how old are some of the kind of wells that you frac-ed in 2018? Just trying to get a sense of how much history you have now and how much you think you need to give yourself a little better handle on it.","Dan Dinges","We need a year, 1.5 year and the '18 wells are -- none of them are a year old yet.","Leo Mariani","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, just turning to the exploration side. I guess obviously, you guys kind of abandoned your recent effort here of late. I just wanted to get a sense, I mean, is there a continued appetite for Cabot to kind of look at other plays either this year or next to try to continue to sort of build the company? I just want to get a sense of your thoughts on looking at other plays. Obviously, you've got a tremendously higher-rate of return opportunity right now, which is a pretty high bar. So how should we think about that going forward?","Dan Dinges","Yes. Right now, we have no interest in allocating any additional capital to exploration. So the answer today is, that's where we stand.","Operator","Our next questioner will come from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas Leggate","I'm just wondering if you could give us an update on your exploration ambitions beyond obviously being used today. What's next? Are you going to stick with the Marcellus on a go-forward basis?","Dan Dinges","You might've been -- might not have heard the answer, previous call, but we're not going to allocate anymore capital to exploration at this time, and that's kind of where we are.","Douglas Leggate","Okay, sorry, I did miss that. I apologize. My follow-up is really just a quick one, I guess, because we haven't really asked your opinion on the gas market for quite some time. And obviously, after the first -- the fourth quarter strength that we saw, I think that some folks were of the view that the idea of just-in-time production was probably not the right model going forward, and we are, in fact, going to have a more resilient outlook. I'm just wondering if you could give us your prognosis on how you see things playing out. Will your plan bear it? And I'll leave it there.","Dan Dinges","Couple of moving parts in that, and that's a -- that can be a long-winded response. But a couple of moving parts in the way I look at it is, one, I think it is imperative that our industry rationalized the market in a way that is prudent for all shareholders. And I think there's -- there are signs that rationalization is taking place, even though from October to current, there's -- seems to be more rigs working today than there were back in October. We did see in December and January, a little bit of reduction in -- at least up in the Appalachia area, a flattening or a reduction in production up in that area. So that would be helpful. But in looking at the demand side of the equation, I'm optimistic that there is going to be another 3 or 4 Bcf a day going offshore by commissioning of the LNG facilities. ","We're seeing incremental demand that is needed up in the -- up in New York and up in the Boston area. When utilities now in Boston are talking about not taking application for new natural gas hookups. That means that demand is increasing, and there's a need for additional natural gas up there. So I'm encouraged by incremental demand up there in that particular area. So -- and I also think that it's proven from your side of the equation, Doug, that if in fact there's reward on value and there is expectation that value would be returned to shareholders in the form of buybacks, of dividends and that's meaningful, then that is going to help assist with the market as opposed to some that keep focused on growth at the -- at all cost. And so I think all of this is part of the forward look on natural gas. But I also think that natural gas plays a role on any of the renewable footprint out there, natural gas better be part of the equation. Otherwise, your responsiveness to the insecurity of a delivery of energy is going to be challenged.","Operator","The next question will come from Jane Trotsenko of Stifel.","Jane Trotsenko","Dan, could you please expand on what drove the 19% year-over-year increase in the crude reserves in 2018? It looks like the increase in results is well above the three year average run rate. And I was just curious if it's due to the outperformance of the existing wells. So is it like the recent well results have been particularly strong or something else that would explain that?","Dan Dinges","All right. And I'll -- Steve Lindeman is in here, and he is responsible for our reserve bookings, and I'll let him cover that. Thanks for the question.","Steven Lindeman","So a part of what drove most of our revision this year was drilling longer laterals than we had modeled in our '17 reserve report. As time's progressed, we've upped our lateral length. Our average pipe was about 5,500 feet. And our wells that we drilled were in the 8,000-foot range.","Jane Trotsenko","Okay. Got it. Got it. And then my second question is for Jeff. Jeff, could you please expand a little bit on fixed-price sales that account for 16% of the sales mix in '19? Is it something that we should expect to take place in 2020 plus as well? And how do you think the pricing for those volumes will evolve over time?","Jeffrey Hutton","Jane, I'm going to grab the table real quick because I'm sure -- thank you, Matt. You're asking about the change on -- in 2019 on the NYMEX portion?","Jane Trotsenko","Yes. So you have fixed-price sales. So it seems to me that those are term sales, but I'm not sure if those are term sales that you roll over maybe on a quarterly or an annual basis. And I'm just curious how that portion will evolve over time in terms of volumes and pricing?","Jeffrey Hutton","Okay. Well, on the fixed-price portion, that's of course a combination of some of our contracts that have fixed-price forwards in them. And so going forward, that piece of that fixed price, 16%, will remain static. However, another part of the fixed-price is just from opportunities we've seen in the marketplace. So I would expect that to continue to be dynamic. If we have opportunities to convert some NYMEX or some index-based pricing to fixed price, we will take advantage of that. So that one is more of a moving target that we can't really elaborate on going forward in the '20, '21 or '22.","Jane Trotsenko","I see. I see. And in terms of pricing, how are those volumes priced? Is it -- should it -- should we think about them in terms of comparable pricing to '19? Or can you comment on that as well?","Jeffrey Hutton","Now that's built into the overall -- how we calculate the overall basis differential to NYMEX, looking forward. So it moves around.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan Dinges","Just briefly, I appreciate everybody's interest in Cabot. I think, it is interesting, and I reflect on the release we've made. And looking at our -- not only our press release but the comments in this morning's report, it's interesting to have an E&P company make a report that does not talk about how much a particular pad has come on or what a zone has done, what a yield is on the well but talk strictly about what type of financial performance we can deliver to the shareholders. And I think that is, certainly, what we're hearing is the shareholders are very interested in value and value creation. And I hope it is getting a little bit agnostic that just because we do it with natural gas does not mean that we have a flawed company. So with that, Allison, I appreciate the interest. And we'll conclude the call.","Operator","And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. And we thank everyone for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Dinges, Chairman, CEO, and President. Please sir, go ahead.","Dan Dinges","Okay. Thank you very much Gary and good morning and thank you all for joining Cabot's fourth quarter year-end earnings call. I do have members of the executive group with me today and also the forward-looking statements included in the morning's press release do apply to my comments.","As you did see in the morning's press release 2014 marked another successful year for Cabot Oil & Gas as we generated top tier growth in production, reserves, earnings, cash flow despite continued price challenges in the Marcellus coupled with a deteriorating oil price environment during the second half of the year. Going over a couple of the bullet points, Cabot generated record production volumes of 532 Bcfe and increased 29% over '13 levels and an increase of 32% when adjusting from the sale of the Mid-Continent West Texas assets in 2013 this included record liquids production that increased 55% year-over-year when adjusting for the 2013 asset sales.","Net income excluding select item for the year was $405 million or $0.97 per share an increase of 36% over '13 and operating cash flows for the year was 1.2 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year. This growth in earnings and cash flow was driven primarily by our strong production growth combined with a 16% year-over-year decrease in unit cost. The Company did take a non-cash after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of approximately 487 million related to the impairment of certain non-core properties primarily in East Texas due to the significant decline in commodity prices and the decision not to pursue further activity in these legacy operating areas at this point in time.","As a reminder, these assets were the focus of the Company prior our development of the Marcellus and Eagle Ford and have not seen any meaningful levels of drilling activity since 2010 so there was no impact to the Company's reserve report. I would also like to highlight that during the year we purchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock and added approximately 40,000 net acres in our Eagle Ford position. All while we maintained a strong balance sheet with conservative leverage metrics and over 1.3 billion of available borrowing capacity on our current facility at year-end.","On our proved reserves in addition to these strong operational and financial performance during the year, we also generated significant growth in the year-end proved reserves which increased 36% to over 7.4 Tcfe that is all source finding and development cost for the year was $0.71 per Mcfe, this is particularly impressive yielding at over 43% of our 2014 capital was allocated to our oil properties in the Eagle Ford that by nature are more capital intensive excluding the purchase of reserves in place associated with our Eagle Ford acquisition last year the total company finding and development cost was $0.65 per Mcfe.","In the Marcellus, our all sources finding and development cost was $0.43 per Mcf highlighting the capital efficiency of our wells in the Northeast PA, obviously one of the components is that our wells in this area do deliver very strong EURs. The Cabot's average EUR for the 2014 program on proved developed wells was over 18 Bcf up from the 16.9 Bcf for our '13 program. As a result of our continued performance improvements, we have also increased our reserve bookings on PUD locations in the Marcellus from an EUR of 10 Bcf to 11 Bcf per well. Our proved developed percentage increased from 59% in '13 61% in '14 highlighting our fairly conservative philosophy regarding our reserve bookings.","For example, we booked a modest 0.7 offset PUD locations for each of our proved developed wells in the Marcellus at year-end. Our year-end reserves were 96% natural gas down from the 97% in '13 which was driven by 100% increase in our liquids reserve base. Approximately 89% of our proved reserves are located in the Marcellus Shale. I would also like to highlight that the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection that released the production data for the second half 2014 this week and once again Cabot dominated the list with the top 16 wells in the state.","Let's move to our '15 program, while our '14 operational and financial performance are in the rearview mirror, the results do highlight Cabot's ability to deliver strong results in a challenged price environment, however we are immune to the market conditions the entire industry is currently facing. On our third quarter earnings call in October of last year I laid out the Company's initial 2015 program which was predicated on realized natural gas price and oil prices of $2.80 and $88 respectively. As you all are aware the operating environment the industry is facing has changed drastically since our call less than four months ago, while much of the focus over the last few months has been on the declining oil price, we have also experienced a fairly meaningful decline in the natural gas prices including the regional index prices in Appalachia. No different than what we are seeing in the major U.S. oil basins Cabot and its peers have done an excellent job of finding an abundant supply of resources in the Marcellus and as a result supply demand balance is currently at a synch. Until we see the rebalancing of the market which reduced activity with the reduced activity which I think is currently underway, I believe the industry will continue to see pricing pressures on both oil and gas.","As you will recall in the fourth quarter of last year we saw a significant increase in natural gas supply on the three major pipes in our area which included a 15% sequential increase in Cabot's volume in anticipation of winter however, winter demand did not materialize as we all would have expected and as a result we have seen the local indices in January and February sat at levels significantly lower than our initial forecast. In response to this lower commodity price environment, we have adjusted our 2015 program with a focus protecting the balance sheet and maximizing our return on investment by still managing our growth profile. Despite the change in our absolute levels of activity in 2015, our strategy remains unchanged. A focus on aligning our capital spending to be primarily funded by operating cash flows, focus our drilling efforts on maintaining our acreage position and optimizing operating efficiencies and the retention of our high quality employee base.","This strategy has positioned us favorably leading into this commodity cycle and we believe this strategy will allow us to exit this cycle extremely well positioned. Company updated capital budget for 2015 as $900 million which is 42% decrease compared to our initial budget. Approximately 80% of the program will be directed towards drilling and completion activity with 60% allocated to the Marcellus and 40% allocated to the Eagle Ford. In the Marcellus, we are currently operating five rigs with plans to decrease to three rigs by the end of the second quarter based on this level of activity we expect to drill approximately 70 net wells and place 65 to 70 wells on production during the year. Giving the backlog of wells we carried into 2015 and our anticipated level of activity during the year, we expect to exit the year with approximately 45 wells in the queue for 2016. Despite drilling longer laterals in '15, we expect well cost to average between 6 million and 6.5 million as a result of operating efficiencies and the service cost reduction that we have received to-date.","However as we're all aware this is a dynamic market and our expectation is that if commodity prices remain depressed for a sustained period of time, and the level of activity industry wide continues to decline, we will likely see a further reduction in cost in the Eagle Ford we are currently operating three rigs with plans to decrease to one rig by the end of the second quarter given where our oil prices are currently our focus is solely on lease maintenance and meeting all drilling obligations. Based on our planned rig count for the year, we expect to drill approximately 45 net wells and place 40 to 45 wells on production during the year. Again giving our backlog of wells that we carried into '15 our anticipated level of activity during the year, we expect to exit '15 with approximately 20 wells queued up ready for our 2016. Similar to the Marcellus we expect well cost for the year to average between $6 million and $6.5 million with an opportunity for further cost reductions as we move through the year.","We remain excited about what we have seen so far in our 90,000 acre net position which is all contiguous however in light of the current price environment we believe that prudent decision is to maintain all of the acreage and wait until a sustained recovery in prices before we start accelerating activities in the future. Based on this updated operating program, we have adjusted our production guidance range for the year to 10% to 18% which includes 50% to 60% growth in liquids production. This guidance range assumes a modest level of curtailments in the Marcellus in anticipation of maintenance in high line pressures at certain points during the year.","Additionally, we have also included a wage of price related curtailments in this guidance to account for those periods where price simply does not meet our threshold. Obviously the natural question would be how much and what price we would take these actions for competitive reasons we will not disclose specifics but I will say that our production profile for the year assumes higher volumes in the first quarter with a reduction in the second quarter and third quarters and increasing again in the fourth quarter. The realized commodity price is used in this updated budget to make our $900 million program or $0.45 per Mcf $2.45 for natural gas and $55 per barrel for oil. This includes the impact of our natural gas hedges which covers about 28% of our natural gas volumes at the midpoint of our updated guidance range.","Also for the full year approximately 50% of our gas sales are priced at three major indices in Northeast PA which is Tennessee, Leidy and Millennium. Under these assumptions our operating program would result in a very small level of outspend allowing us to maintain the same financial strength we demonstrated prior to this down-cycle, while still providing double-digit growth and generating returns. Some of you may find or may have questions about 2016 given our reduced level of activity for this first year, first let me say that our internal model shows continued growth in 2016 with the level of growth dependent upon factors that will certainly be understand better as 2015 progresses. However, one key factor, we have the commodity price environment evolve throughout 2015, we do anticipate similar operational and supply reductions by other operators in Northeast PA in a reaction to the current prices and our expectation is that this will ultimately result in a rationalization of this supply and demand dynamics in our area.","Given an expectation for tapering of supply growth coupled with new takeaway capacities in the Northeast that's Leidy Southeast expansion and the Tico East side expansion that's coming online in the second half of the year, we will remain flexible with our program if the market warrants us to make changes. Given the productivity and the low capital intensity of our wells in the Marcellus, we are well positioned to adjust our operations in short order. As a reminder, we grew to our current production levels by never operating more than six rigs in the Marcellus and given the anticipated backlog of 65 wells companywide at year-end 2015 we do have plenty of optionality to accelerate completions in the second half of the year as we see fit.","As I mentioned earlier, our plan is to maintain our high quality employee base and we believe that positions us very well in the event of a quick recovery. Another key factor that will drive '16 growth and enhance program returns will be the anticipated in-service of constitution pipeline which is currently planned for the second half of 2016. Cabot has 500 million a day capacity on this pipeline so the timing of when this pipeline comes online will obviously have an impact on 2016 production levels. As a quick update on constitution there were a few significant accomplishments at the end of last year that they're repeating as you are aware and on December 2, 2014 the FERC issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity of proving the constitution pipeline. In addition, on December 24th the New York DEC issued a formal notice of complete application regarding the final permits necessary from New York.","We are currently awaiting the conclusion at the New York state public comment period which is schedule to end on February 27, 2015. Moving forward we are hopeful to receive our final permits from New York during the second quarter and immediately file for the implementation and construction plan with the FERC with construction beginning this summer. So in summary I've covered many topics we are well position to adapt and succeed in this price environment. I thinks it's clear our asset base and our disciplined focus lends itself to a allowing us to generate returns at these price levels that maybe many other operators will not or may not experience. And despite the current market conditions we remain committed to delivering our long-term shareholder value and certainly maintaining a strong balance sheet.","Gary with those comments I'll turn it back over to you to queue up some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Dan a couple of things if I may, first of all on constitution just to be clear, so what is the precise hold up now Dan on moving forward with construction outside of what I guess it rightly issues in New York is still the bottom-line. But in terms of all the other preparation can you actually start now or are you still waiting can you not probably start until everything is lined up. I'm just trying to understand what the bottlenecks might be?","Dan Dinges","Yes great question and a question that is obviously on a lot of people's mind I'll make a brief comment and turn it over to Jeff for any specific color. But we have submitted all the permits we submitted our original permits back in August of \u201913. There has been significant dialogue between Williams the operator of the pipeline not only the FERC but also the New York DEC. The protocol and moving through this process is that the DEC has made the determination as I mention on the 24th of December that we have fulfilled our obligation to give them all of the information they need to deem the project complete. With that so there comes a public comment period and that public comment period we are end at this period of time and it ends at the end of this months. Subsequent to that the expectation is with no new issues that would have that not come up over the last couple of years that the New York DEC will grant a final permit and then that would allow us to make the application to FERC to begin construction.","Jeff Hutton","Yes Doug just to add a few points to that the application process in New York and Pennsylvania for that matter and of course we're finished in Pennsylvania it has been pretty much what we expected it has taken a little bit longer than we expected. But the process is what it is and by getting the notice of complete application it does signal that the New York DEC have all the information they need to issue the final permit and the process we are in now is standard and operating procedure where public comments are welcome based on the action that New York DEC took. In terms of getting construction started Williams will file an implementation plan with FERC probably next month and in the implementation plan we will include permits from all the agencies involved including the ones that FERC issued and it will be complemented with the final permit from New York once that is issued. When FERC gets that final determination they'll issue a notice to proceed with construction and at that point construction can begin. So it's a lot of moving pieces but it really cannot dig dirt until all the pieces are in place.","Doug Leggate","Just two quick follow-ups I guess on some numbers if I may first can you quantify the curtailments that you'd assumed in your JV\u2019s of current year and finally any scale of anticipated cost reduction from this point forward and over and above what you've already achieved in terms of service cost? And I will leave it there.","Dan Dinges","On the curtailment we will not be exactly specific. But I can say that it -- in fact all of the available production would move we would certainly approach where the lower end of our previous guidance and in regard to cost again we have seen the cost roll off no different than the other operators that had made a release and we anticipate they'll also as you continue to see service or programs lay down rigs, there is going to be a natural tendency to continue to keep equipment and people teed up and busy for the service sector. And we could see additional service cost reductions throughout the year.","Doug Leggate","And Dan some folks are talking about sort of 20.5% Q4-over-Q4 is that scale reasonable for you or would you pass them up?","Dan Dinges","No I think that's reasonable.","Operator","The next question comes from David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","David Deckelbaum","On the -- I just wanted to follow-up on the EURs that were booked this year, obviously very encouraging data on the PDPs of 18 Bcf versus 16.9 last year. Would you distribute all of that to just longer laterals?","Dan Dinges","We're fortunate to have our VP of Marcellus region in here Phil Stalnaker we had our Board meetings yesterday and Phil's group does a number of things up there that we try to tweak and gain additional efficiencies and Phil why don't you just talk about capital efficiency things that you have done and what we're looking at.","Phil Stalnaker","On the completion side of course one thing we'll continue to look at is the optimum spacing between frac intervals and testing from the 200 feet down to the lateral of 50 foot spacing. Again we're looking at optimizing our landing 0.2. So again we're continuing to tweak the formula and look for ways to improve.","David Deckelbaum","And do you have the data at all for the Eagle Ford, didn't know if I missed that, I just hope on what the Eagle Ford was booked at this year?","Dan Dinges","We have also Steve Lindeman who is coordinating our south region effort Steve why don\u2019t you add some more comments.","Steve Lindeman","Yes for the Eagle Ford we\u2019re still in line in the range that we talked about before about 500,000 barrels for roughly 7,000 foot lateral wells.","David Deckelbaum","So in all the incremental improvements that are being made now weren't factored into last year's reserve report yet at least in the Eagle Ford?","Dan Dinges","That's correct.","David Deckelbaum","The only other one I had was, just on the well cost reduction that you're seeing so far. What percentage of that is just your own optimization versus third-party service declines?","Dan Dinges","Well we had specific numbers on the third-party service declines. As you have seen it through the again the relations that have occurred to-date out there that rig cost coming down and pumping services coming down are the major components, the operational efficiencies are, it is kind of an ongoing effort in our program and we continue to try to those things that would allow us to create more efficiencies either by enhancements to the amount of production or EURs we can recognize or tweaking the components of a completion for the most part or landing points that will allow us to gain time and\/or frac efficiencies with either spicing considerations or the amount of profit pumped. Those common things that we all look at, so I don\u2019t have a specific breakdown between the components of service cost reductions and operational efficiencies. The majority of that has occurred most recently has been from the service side.","David Deckelbaum","Last one if I might, just wanted to get with the updated guidance now looking at spends fairly close to cash flow and preserve that balance sheet. Are you starting to see opportunities in and around your core areas to expand your positions from some other folks that are maybe a little bit more stretched?","Dan Dinges","In these environments where commodity price fall off so rapidly, typically there is a law between the time when that fall off occurs and the M&A activity. And I think we're in that period right now, the expectation by those that have assets and that might have some stress points, are they're going to hold as long as they possibly can in hoped of a quick bounce off the bottom. But I can say from a strategic standpoint we do look at this period of time as an opportunity and if we see the bolt-on as you are referring to fit what our long-term plan is, because we're balancing this market for the long-term and not just the short-term. We'll take advantage of it and our balance sheet certainly allows that at the end of the year as we have mentioned we had $1.3 billion of available capacity to utilize, so we're in good shape to take advantage of what opportunities come along.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","Dan you have generally in the past spoken to building a backlog of wells in anticipation of constitution coming online. How much of your CapEx reduction here is a function of greater flexibility given the lack of clarity on the constitution set of time so has there been any strategic change in which you\u2019d plan to fully supply constitution with wells yet to come online versus wells contributing to the oversupply today of the local market?","Dan Dinges","Well we had reacted with our capital program today based on commodity price. We've looked at the differentials and we all realize the loss of $45-$50 on a per barrel and we have reacted with a reduction in our activity i.e., capital that translated into the number of wells drilled and completed just purely based on that commodity price assumptions and maintaining our cash flow neutral program and looking at constitution and looking at as I've mentioned the queue that we had built up of 40-45 wells that we'll have at the end of 2015. We are going to be in good shape to be able to build our volumes into the expected commissioning date of '15. We continue to see efficiencies as we've reported from our '13 program to our '14 program. We expect continued efficiency gains in our '15 program which I think is going to translate into maybe higher IPs and higher EURs which would allow for a more rapid increase in the amount of deliverability leading up to constitution.","I think again a point to illustrate is the fact that and in one of the premier gas fields in the entire world in an area that's growing probably faster than any other place that I'm aware of in the world is a Six County area in Pennsylvania and in all of the Marcellus Cabot had the top 16 wells in the entire field. So I think that speaks volumes on our ability to be able to grow into additional 500 million a day that is our volumes on constitution in a fairly quick order. And I might add without a whole lot of capital intensity.","Brian Singer","And then separately you built up your Eagle Ford commensurate with your growth in the Marcellus over the last few years. Is the down cycle in both oil and natural gas prices provide an opportunity to materially shift your exposure to around these areas or are you committed to the balance currently in the portfolio?","Dan Dinges","Are you talking about like the 60-40 balance we have in the Eagle Ford and the Marcellus?","Brian Singer","Exactly or if you think about the production percentages or the resource percentages, do you see an opportunity for larger scale M&A here to move around your core areas and the weighting of your core areas these new core areas or should we expect when we come out of it that you'll have a similar weighting for the Eagle Ford, Marcellus and nothing else?","Dan Dinges","And that's a good question also because again a lot of opportunity occurs to those that have a strong balance sheet and optionality in a down market and we're certainly one of those companies. We don\u2019t have anything on the books Brian but again to think about our long-term runway and to position us to take advantage of a uptick in the oil market for example I think it is prudent for us to look at what type of area we might want to be in the long-term and how we might want to position and how we create that position. But again as it being a singular focus or a strong need at this particular period of time, it is not that but certainly it's I view that we kick around and we look at and we build data base on to be able to understand the markets out there in the longer-term. So if we move around the balance of commodity i.e. more oil versus our 96% gas versus 4% oil, it would be a long-term view and we'll take advantage of it. And I think we could do something in the future.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","To start out I just want to be clear once you finally break dirt what's the time range for finishing the constitution based on experience?","Dan Dinges","Construction is going to be a rather short-term project but -- and Jeff can fill you out on the number of crews that we have the pipelines on the ground there and the things that have been lined up from the construction standpoint.","Jeffrey Hutton","Okay Jeffery actually the -- of course the pipe is on location and the construction bids have gone out and we have contractors waiting on the notice to proceed everything is set up and staged and ready to go waiting on the final permits. That said there are a few operating windows that have to be considered such as stream crossings and tree clearing and that sort of thing but basically regardless of when you start and if you adhere to all the windows of constructions you're talking about less than a year to get everything in place, tested and operating.","Jeffrey Campbell","Dan based on prior guidance it looks like you have reduced your 2015 wells to drill by a greater percentage in the Marcellus than in the Eagle Ford. And can you add a color on that and the reason why I'm asking is because you've recently said that Marcellus returns to $2 per million BTU\u2019s are better than the Eagle Ford returns of $70 a barrel. So some thought some color might be useful.","Dan Dinges","We want to have some new acreage that we acquired in the Eagle Ford and that new acreage we acquired in the Eagle Ford had near-term lease explorations that required drilling activity. And so our balance of capital with bringing it down to kind of cash flow level just dictate it based on the acreage capture in the Eagle Ford how much activity we are going to have in that particular area and in regard to where that places our activity in the Marcellus we have ample supply to sell into the market. That would give us a growth profile greater than what we have represented in our guidance. However every incremental amount of gas that we would produce in the Marcellus goes into the indices that are the most challenged right now. So to grow into that with additional drilling even though we are yet recognizing very good returns it's still blows down to the balancing act between our cash flow and the amount of activity that\u2019s necessary for a maintenance program. So that\u2019s the balance that we see short-term being our '15 program.","Jeffrey Campbell","So if I could sneak one last quick one in. You said previously that you intended to target investment grade leverage metrics in 2015. And I'm wondering if you're revised CapEx is guided by this goal and does it remain a primary balance sheet metric during maybe future commodity volatility in 2015?","Dan Dinges","Yes I'll pass that to Scott.","Scott Schroeder","Jeffrey yes that\u2019s still a goal again Dan hit on the key points of why we did what we did related to the capital. But we've had a strategy our capital modeling both in good times and in bad that we want to be right on top of or very near the anticipated cash flow and as a result of that we have build a company that is very close to investment grade clearly from a debt-to-EBITA perspective that has been kind of test those kind of limits in terms of investment grade metrics. Simply because of the underlying cash flow but the overall leverage won't change as we alluded to in our opening comments.","Operator","The next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Bob Brackett","Yes a quick one and a follow-up. The quick one is what's the best daily rate that your Marcellus operations have achieved?","Dan Dinges","Well we had recently we had a 42 million almost 43 million a day type of well.","Bob Brackett","I mean for the whole operation.","Dan Dinges","We have been over 2 Bcf a day in between 2.1 Bcf a day.","Bob Brackett","The other one is a bit more strategic we're spending a lot of time thinking and wondering about constitution. That\u2019s 2016 what's the 2017 and beyond strategy for getting your volumes to market and what are you doing now to make sure there aren\u2019t delays like we've seen with constitution?","Dan Dinges","Now we have a significant runway out in front of us. That is already in and moving forward not only is the constitution teed up for the middle of \u201916 and a 0.5 Bcf a day. I\u2019ll let Jeff go into the order of additional projects we have and he might also just touch on what we have at the end of this year too.","Jeffrey Hutton","Sure I'll try to keep it fairly larger number. So we have a number of projects at 20,000 a day here and 25,000 a day there they do add up. But probably in the near-term we have Colombia East expansion that\u2019s coming on later in '15 and Cabot has a 50,000 a day position there Leidy Southeast project comes on December '15 and we have some additional long-term market associated with that. Probably the -- I might mention one other Pen East project coming along in October of \u201917, we have 100,000 a day position on that, and that will connect and take gas off Leidy system. But the big project is the 850 million a day coming on in September 2017 that is the Williams project is known as Atlantic Sunrise and that's a new 40 inch pipe connected in the heart of our production area. And as we mentioned late last year the capacity there kind of 850,000 a day 100% of those volumes are committed for sales, we announced the co-point say in the time of long-term sale of 350,000 a day for 20 years and we announced the 0.5 Bcf a day sale to Washington Gas Light for 500,000 a day. So that is certainly going to take us into 2017 with a good program and a good plan and try to working on the next projects.","Operator","That next question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Drew Venker","Dan before you spoke about the volumes in the Marcellus sticking down in 2Q and 3Q, just curious if you can provide color, if that's managing to expectations of demand there, if there is something else going on there?","Dan Dinges","No two things, looking at just the system as a whole depending on what type of inflection we get with the supply side and the propensity of gas being curtailed, if in fact the indices fall off or stay too low. I think selling into a lot cost market or a low value market is going to be rationalized a little bit. But what occurs during the deriving shoulder months would be some pressure up on the pipelines and during that period of time it can back gas off the market even though there has been a number of projects to compress and to mitigate the line pressures in the past, so that is one component to the lower volumes that I have alluded to in the second and third quarter. The other is just putting a soft spot in our guidance for low gas prices, if we see low gas prices we're just not going to give our gas away and we would take gas off the market. So that's the reason, nothing operational except for the midstream part of the operation to give us that well.","Drew Venker","And just a follow-up on that, potentially weak pricing in the middle of the year, it's my understanding that in Leidy there is somewhat limited power gen demand especially in the summer. But we've heard some expectations that that will expand over the next couple of years. Can you guys provide any color there or any thoughts as to potential quantitative impact?","Dan Dinges","Yes, Jeff?","Jeff Hutton","Yes Drew there are certainly as you are aware there is an announcement about Panda just this week on new power generation at Central PA. There is also several facilities planned in and off the Leidy system and we're actively in negotiations for those facilities and they're good loads for base loads kind of power gen, and it is something producers love. So it's a little premature I guess to say that how far we have come but we're certainly in negotiations.","Drew Venker","And Jeff give us a sense of what the volume impact would be in 2015 in terms of demand?","Jeff Hutton","Yes, overall\u2026","Drew Venker","In 2015.","Jeff Hutton","So overall these plants are in that 300 million a day plus range. It's up to the power generator, if he is going to split and load between different parties and so forth, or is he wants to deal with one party just how things and scenarios that happened at cove point where you have half the LNG buyer wanting to go to one supplier and the other went with was three to four. So it\u2019s kind of yet to be seen but we're in a great position to serve a couple of these plants and we're in a great position to serve all their needs.","Operator","The next question comes from Subash Chandra with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Subash Chandra","Is there an update on percent of sales in 2015 into Leidy and for the last one I saw was sort of mid to late '14 around 20%.","Dan Dinges","Well I know that, as I have mentioned in my comments that though the three indices we have between approximately 50% that is moving into those three indices, Leidy, Tennessee and Millennium, I don't have a breakout in front of me on what's going into the Leidy.","Subash Chandra","And then on the reserve increase you talked about wells being better 18 Bs and 16.9 is there an average Bcf per lateral foot for 1,000 lateral feet that you can boil it down to?","Dan Dinges","Well we have and in the past we've indicated the approximately 3.6 to 4 Bcf per 1,000 foot of lateral and that's kind of a range that that we feel comfortable with.","Subash Chandra","So we're still in that range going from '17 to '18 I suppose?","Dan Dinges","Yes.","Subash Chandra","And then I guess for the PDP wells you've talked about the offset locations the number of PDP wells is 360 or so in the Marcellus the right number to be using?","Dan Dinges","I think it's actually 380-385 something like that.","Subash Chandra","380-385 okay that's the gross?","Dan Dinges","Yes.","Subash Chandra","And that will be high as well okay got it. And then service cost I guess what we've heard from other operators in Appalachia is that unlike some of the oil producing basins there wasn\u2019t really excess margins service companies who're generating last year so the view is that given 2015 dynamics they don\u2019t have that much room to give to where the types of cost deflation we're seeing from the oil basins of 20%-25% expected Q4-to-Q4 may not be realized so I think you did say that 25% is possible, but what would you say about that context provided by other Appalachian operators?","Dan Dinges","Well I would just make a statement about our own experience and the each service provider can be a little bit unique on what their ultimate goal is some would prefer to capture margin and some would prefer to keep their equipment and their personnel busy and they would sacrifice margin. So our operation is a very consolidated acreage position. We have a very efficient operation from the standpoint of the service providers and I'll talk about frac crews just as being the highest percentage of any one completed well besides the rigs but we move from one location to the other and everything is set up ready to go so they keep their equipment and personnel running 24x7 I think very efficient. And I think that is attractive to them, but you look at the reduction that we've referenced already and we go from say $7 million well to $6 million to $6.5 million well we're already seeing those incremental reductions in service cost and again whatever the rest of the market does is and what service cost realizations they see it's going to be all unique and individual but we are seeing service cost reductions.","Subash Chandra","And a final one for me thanks so much. The final one is your transportation cost I guess $0.70 or so from 65 or so in '14 if you look forward to 2016 what do you think that could look like?","Dan Dinges","Well it's probably going to be close to the same a lot of that's dependent on if the transport cost end up with our customers or not.","Subash Chandra","Could you repeat that I'm sorry?","Dan Dinges","So the additional transport cost will be realized by constitution Atlantic Sunrise if those rates are shown up in the revenue by higher gas prices to offset the transport cost.","Subash Chandra","But I guess you would have a separate line item for transport and the revenue line will show up separately?","Dan Dinges","Yes. Yes it will.","Subash Chandra","So if you were to just strip out the transport cost of constitution it came on as expected in '16 could you hazard a guess what that line?","Dan Dinges","Yes well we anticipate in '16 is having a similar range of transportation cost as our current guidance.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Allman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joe Allman","To start in terms of dropping the rigs activity are you terminating rig contracts early to reduce the rig count and could you just talk about the process involved in dropping the rigs any cost you're incurring and did you explore other options including drilling wells and deferring the completions?","Dan Dinges","Yes I'll let Steve why don\u2019t you go at that.","Steve Lindeman","Yes Joe in the South region the first rig that we released had a very short-term contract on it so we were within that term. We are still negotiating the terms of that release with our other contractor whether we add time on so forth and that\u2019s what we're working on right now.","Joe Allman","Could you talk about other options that you've explore or exploring in terms of including drilling wells that defer in completions as EOG announced yesterday?","Scott Schroeder","Yes as Dan stated in his comments will edge the year with about 20 Eagle Ford wells in inventory, and so that\u2019s completion activity that we have scheduled for the later part of the year that we're going defer into '16.","Joe Allman","And could we just review again the trajectory of production for the year. So are you expecting production to be up in the first quarter? Sounds like if maybe down the second and down in third and then is it going be a fairly meaningful ramp in the fourth quarter and you expect fourth quarter to be kind of a flattish with 4Q '14. Could you just help us with that and break it up North versus South if you could.","Dan Dinges","Well I think you summed it up on what our expectations is through the year than we've given that 50% to 60% expected growth in the liquids for the year. Liquids production or the production profile in the South region is going to be more consistent than the production profile that we guided and put into our program in the North region, we have more flexibility on swing volumes in the North region and the Marcellus area then we do in the South region. ","So I guess that level summary Joe we would kind of maintain and grow a little bit of our production year-over-year in the South region and in the North region higher first quarter just like you grow through the year. The second quarter, third quarter down and then increasing again in the fourth quarter.","Joe Allman","And then lastly just a quick one. So for constitution just to be clear are there not any other permits that you need including Army Corps of Engineers, just to be clear on that.","Dan Dinges","I'll pass that to Jeff.","Jeff Hutton","Yes the Army Corps of Engineers permit is included within the New York permits as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Holly Stewart with Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Holly Stewart","Just maybe a couple of quick follow ups, Jeff appreciate all the detail on the different pipes. Could you just maybe sum up '15 to '17 for both FT and FS for us?","Jeff Hutton","I'm sorry, I didn\u2019t quite catch the question.","Holly Stewart","Just the overall firm sales and firm's transportation total. What's the detail on the different pipes? Could you just give us your overall position?","Jeff Hutton","I think our current sales is -- we have a lot, we currently have and some we have later this year and certainly in 2016 and '17. I don\u2019t have -- all added up your query I'm sorry.","Holly Stewart","We'll follow back up. And then maybe the Dan or Scott just kind of back to the capital allocation. Should we expect anything on the share repo in 2015?","Dan Dinges","We don\u2019t have that as a budget item. You're going have to see a different price point in both of oil and gas for us to make that consideration, both commodities are fairly low and number of companies are struggling even to make a program that they can maintain some level of growth and also fund. So it's not in the cards right now and the only way it's going to get into consideration would be having a difference in the price points from today.","Holly Stewart","And then one final one just on upper Marcellus anything in the 70 net wells and then were there any changes to your booking there?","Dan Dinges","So our focus right now is to complete in the deeper section first. And then we will have a long-term plan that would move up the whole as we continue drilling off the field.","Operator","The next question comes from Marshall Carver with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Marshall Carver","A question on the seasonality of production is there any reason that pattern wouldn\u2019t persist in future years like '16 and '17 maybe wouldn\u2019t be quite as dramatic. But is there any reason to pick that wouldn\u2019t happen again with line purchase, et cetera.","Dan Dinges","Yes possibly a couple of reasons. One would be that we're restricted right now and reason why we have punitive differentials is because the volumes of gas moving into the three pipes up there. In the future we would expect the pipes that Jeff has been talking about that are on the drawing board and moving forward and have expected commissioning dates, with those pipes and allowing additional gas to get out that particular area and also those three pipes in particular is going to allow certainly different dynamics going forward than we're experiencing today.","I can't predict exactly what the impact is going to be on supply side or the demand side, let's say at the end of 2017. But I can say that we're going to have a significant level of additional volumes of our gas that would be sinking and priced in different markets than we're experiencing today.","So operationally Marshall we could still have operational floor waters and pressures on pipes based on the amount of volume we're including but I think the opportunity to -- the flexibility that additional price is going to afford us and the future is going to be fairly significant.","Marshall Carver","So with constitution coming on in the second half of next year maybe you could give some seasonality between Q1 and Q2 but you wouldn't expect this once constitution comes online.","Dan Dinges","Yes, and I would say you would probably see since there is not the volumes of gas that have access to the aircore system, I would say that you would probably on those particular volumes I would think that you probably would not see as much of the seasonality effect on that pipe and as we experienced today on the pipes Tennessee, the Leidy and the Millennium with the volumes of gas that was trying to force their way on those pipes today.","Marshall Carver","And one more question, do you have expected lateral links for the Marcellus completions or the Marcellus wells that will be going online this year versus last year and also the expected number of stages in '15.","Dan Dinges","Don't have the granular nature of the stages but will be over 5,000 foot on our lateral links.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Portillo with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Matt Portillo","Just two quick questions from me. On constitution I wanted to clarify to hopefully get a little bit more color on how you're thinking about those volumes in 2016 and beyond. Is the plan to potentially shift some of your existing production away from Leidy and Tennessee into that pipe and therefore improved margin or are you planning on completing new wells to grow production into 2016.","Dan Dinges","Both are really good questions. The indices in the price received and the three pipe areas that all of the operators are exposed to right now up in that six county area, there is going to be somewhat of a determining factor on whether or not we release the amount of gas that is on those three pipes by just a flat sale transfer of 0.5 Bcf actually it would be 650 million a day because Southwest is part of that constitution pipeline being 650 million a day capacity or would it be an incremental volumes of that we flow into the pipe.","And that decision Matt is going to be a combination of price point and the ability to diverse the amount of gas that is flowing into those three pipes with some of the new pipes that are coming online, Leidy Southeast the impact on those three pipes, the TETCO expansion and some of the other smaller projects that Jeff mentioned.","So I can say this though but from a planning standpoint we're going to be prepared to have incremental volumes going into the constitution pipeline, but we're also going to remain focused on the best returns and price rationalization what the market has not done that for us.","Matt Portillo","And then my second follow up as you talk about previously your Eagle Ford assets continue to improve in terms of the breakeven economics given the enhanced completions you put into place. Could you provide some color as to how you are thinking about potential reaccelerating that program in the out years and potentially what commodity price you need to see at this point given service costs to that risk factor in that market.","Dan Dinges","Well again our balanced focus Matt has been on let's look at the amount of cash flow we're generating and the amount of cash flow we generate is going to kind of dictate what we do with our capital program. So it would go hand in hand, we have a higher price point, better cash flow will level into a consideration for adding rigs whether it'd be in the Marcellus or the Eagle Ford. It is our objective though in the Eagle Ford to maintain all the acreage we have out there. We like what we're seeing, we like what the group is doing now and we like the returns that we can get, but at 50 bucks we're not impressed with the returns at 50 bucks. At 60 bucks 65 bucks certainly it has a return profile that starts getting attractive again.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Christensen with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Robert Christensen","First question is how do you balance between debt pay down and share buyback, what are things we should think of in that decision?","Dan Dinges","I'd say good financial question and I have a financial expert sitting right across the table in front of me.","Scott Schroeder","Bob its Scott Schroeder as Dan alluded to based on Holly's question in terms of the repurchase clearly for 2015 the question you pose isn\u2019t on the table in line of how far we have to ratchet back our capital program and we're still not quite exact equal with cash flow, but at the end of the day when we're balancing that decision in different times we're looking at the disconnect between the underlying value we see in the shares and what the market at any one moment is giving for our shares in the marketplace. We've seen those disconnects over the last couple of years and that's why between probably between '13 and '14 we've brought in just under 10 million shares on that kind of dynamic.","Robert Christensen","In terms of the termination of a couple of the rigs, I guess we haven\u2019t seen the expense related to whatever negotiations that you're having with the rig provider, is that in front of us some termination type expense?","Scott Schroeder","Yes we balled it up in our capital program number it's in the $900 million number.","Robert Christensen","And my final question is, could you just put a little more color out there on this concept of gas by wire if you will off of Leidy and Panda and other projects? What's the timeframe of some of these potential projects and volumes? And the economics I guess versus selling gas directly on a pipeline to somebody I think? Does it sound interesting?","Scott Schroeder","So Bob some of the projects that are being proposed is actually in excess of 20, I have on my desk that we're interested in some more than others, some that we have very good access to some that maybe more difficult to get to and I'm talking about transportation path. But there's a lot of projects planned in the Mid Atlantic states and in Pennsylvania. There's been a push to in conjunction with the ISO in that area to build some power generation and feed it with local supply.","But we're looking at projects that are closed back Susquehanna County or have direct routes pipeline routes that we can reach these projects. I think the some of the plans we did mention the Panda project they probably have four or five other projects that are well on the way in terms of finding locations and permitting the financing and so forth. But most of these guys they get their power deal done first in other words access to the rig and then they come to gas suppliers and they have their wish list and we have our wish list and we try to work through those and come to terms.","There's a group of power generators of the aircore system that we're working with as well and there are some off the Tennessee system and there are some off the Leidy system. This is one of the process that goes on probably next five years to 10 years even just a lot of opportunity for power generation with natural gas with coal retirements and with coal switching and oil switching. So it's a piece of a demand puzzle and it's very active and very dynamic and we're situated in Northeast corner we're probably the closest supply to the market there is and so we're comfortable with these kind of markets. And we'll probably be announcing if we are very successful in the next year or two on some of these projects.","Operator","The next question comes from Eric Otto with CLSA Americas. Please go ahead.","Eric Otto","Just a quick follow up on the DEC, can you give us a little bit of color behind your thinking about the permit approval in 2Q just sort of thinking about the fact that the DEC has never had to reveal linear pipeline project in this magnitude, the time it took them to issue notice of completing application and attendance at the three our public hearings?","Jeff Hutton","Well I think at some point Williams I think they had their call yesterday they had I think they had some questions on this as well. The way we understand process and getting feedback from Williams on the progress, I'm not sure I agree with what you said about the magnitude of the project versus what DEC assumed in the past, there is lots of major pipelines through the state of New York of gas pipeline, lots of power, lots water lines and so on so forth. This is a relative simple 124 mile pipeline through old New York, it's got its environment challenge as all pipelines do.","I think New York the EC is being very careful and thorough examination of the route and issues and listening to the concerns of surface owners and are doing that what they should be doing. And at the end of day we have to get a permit that let us pipeline be build in a timeframe that we've illustrated so far.","Eric Otto","I guess just hypothetically if this led to 3Q. How does that impact construction in the end services day would it move it out significantly? ","Jeff Hutton","No I think I mentioned earlier it's going to be a year of construction plus or minus a month or so depending on when the permits actually come out. And when the notice to proceed is granted by FERC just given the windows during the construction period.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dan Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan Dinges","Right appreciate everybody's interest in Cabot. I think we've been able to demonstrate a good '14 program. We have queued down '15 program but our expectation is that we will end the year in a very good order. And we look forward to our next conference call. Thank you Gary.","Operator","Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Dinges, Chairman, CEO, and President. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Dan, and good morning all. Thank you all for joining us today for the Cabot first quarter call. With me today as usual are several of our management team. Before we start, the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements do apply to my comments today. ","I would first like to touch upon a few financial and operating highlights from the first quarter that were outlined in this morning\u2019s press release. First, equivalent net production for the first quarter was slightly above 1.9 Bcfe per day, an increase of 43% over the prior year\u2019s comparable quarter and a sequential increase of 15% over the fourth quarter.","Of particular note, our daily liquids production for the quarter increased 132% compared to the prior year\u2019s comparable quarter and 20% sequentially over the fourth quarter, highlighting the success of our team in the Eagle Ford. ","Net income, excluding select items, for the quarter was 49 million or $0.12 per share and discretionary cash flow for the quarter was $240 million. Both of these items decreased relative to the first quarter of \u201914 due to a 34% decline in realized natural gas prices and a 55% decline in realized oil prices. ","On the cost side, our team continues to work hard and deliver on driving down unit cost, which is evidenced by the 10% decline in cash unit cost to $1.22 per Mcfe. I think this decline is even more impressive when considering that we have increased the percentage of oil focused activity in our mix, which typically is more costly to operate on a per unit basis. ","Additionally we reaffirmed guidance even with the planned curtailment, which is I think the right economic decision. In the Marcellus, our operational results for the quarter exceeded expectations. The company averaged over 2 Bcf per day of gross Marcellus production, which is 1.7 Bcf per day of net production, an increase as mentioned previously, 43% over last year\u2019s comparable quarter.","We completed 19 wells and play 17 wells on production, which drove the 16% sequential growth for the quarter. These production levels highlight the productivity of our Marcellus assets and demonstrates that the asset quality and well performance are quite unique assets for Cabot. However, we would like to see more favorable natural gas prices, which we anticipate will materialize upon the in-service of several new takeaway projects in our area, scheduled over the next 12 to 18 months, along with a continued increase in natural gas demand growth.","I want to also highlight that during the first quarter the state of Pennsylvania began reporting monthly production data and did report for both January and February Cabot was the top producer in Pennsylvania, which is not bad for a company that has never operated more than six rigs in the state. Marcellus pricing continues to be the primary focus of our conversations with shareholders, and I imagine is front of mind for everybody on this call today.","Our first-quarter natural gas realizations were $2.46 per Mcf, which is $0.52 below the average NYMEX price for the quarter, an improvement relative to the $1.04 differential in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the hedges, our realizations were $0.75 below NYMEX as compared to $1.21 in the fourth quarter of \u201914. Primary driver of the differential narrowing quarter-to-quarter was that our marketing team was able to secure a meaningful amount of favorable fixed price contracts for the winter season prior to the most recent decline in natural gas prices. Many of these deals do roll off in March. However, we do have over 20% of our expected volumes sold at a fixed price above $2 in the second quarter.","Based on our current view of where the regional indices will sell over the quarter, we anticipate that second-quarter price realizations will be between $0.82 and $0.92 below NYMEX and before the impact of hedges. Additionally we anticipate another $0.40 to $0.45 uplift in realized prices from our hedges based on the current strip. Since we frequently get asked the question we have provided a split of our pricing exposure by index on our website, which should provide some clarity on how we\u2019re marketing our gas for the quarter. We anticipate that the third quarter will look similar to the second quarter as it relates to the percentage of sales by index.","As we have guided, we have reduced our production volumes for the second quarter relative to the first quarter in response to our expectation of continued weakness in pricing during the second quarter, some of which is being driven by numerous maintenance and construction projects directly related to our downstream market. Virtually all of the pipelines our production reaches have planned or scheduled projects during the second quarter. Most notably is the new looping of the Transco-Leidy line in conjunction with the Leidy Southeast expansion project.","Although this expansion of 525 million cubic foot per day of new capacity will ultimately be very beneficial to Cabot at in-service in December of this year. The 43-day construction period is expected to affect throughput on the Leidy line currently resulting in pricing pressures during this period. We expect to produce between 1.55 and 1.6 Bcf per day of gross production in the Marcellus for the second quarter, and will continue to monitor the price environment before we make any decisions on selling more gas into the local market.","It is clear from our first-quarter production that we have the ability to move volumes in excess of these base load levels but we are not going to chase production growth to the detriment of cash margins. As planned, we recently decreased our level of activity in the Marcellus to three rigs and one frac crew, down from five rigs and two frac crews at the beginning of the year. Our current operating plan and capital program assumes this level of operating activity remains constant for the balance of 2015. However in light of our expectations for continued weakness throughout Appalachia, during the summer months we do often re-evaluate our program and may consider delaying completions as we await a more favorable price environment in the future, again not anticipating affecting our guidance.","In the Eagle Ford \u2013 moving on to the Eagle Ford, our team had an outstanding quarter operationally in South Texas. It is evident by the 19% sequential growth in daily liquid volumes over the last quarter. During the quarter we placed 20 wells on production, many of which weren\u2019t [current] [ph] in line until late in the quarter, which resulted in the strong sequential production growth. As a reminder, much of this activity was driven by near-term held by production commitments primarily from the acreage we acquired late last year.","If we take a step back and we look at where our Eagle Ford program was a year ago, it really highlights the significant improvement we have seen from this asset in a short duration of time. On last year\u2019s first quarter call we had just made a change in the management team overseeing the program and made the decision to increase our rig count from two to three. The increase in rig count was predicated on an increase in the return profile to over 50%, hoping as a result of well performance enhancements and decreased well cost.","Keep in mind that we were running our economics at $90 per barrel at that point. we had approximately 600 gross locations identified based on 400 foot spacing and frankly we are pretty excited about the long-term value generation opportunity afforded us by these properties. If you fast forward 12 months and a lot of things have changed, the most obvious thing, the underlying commodity price. However, as a result of significant improvements in our operating efficiency and well performance along with a reduction in service cost, our operation now eclipsed the same 50% [return] threshold at a price of $65 per barrel, which is only $5 higher than today\u2019s 12 month strip.","Relative to the 600 gross locations we had mapped at this time last year, we have now increased that location count to over 1300 locations as the result of our bolt on acquisitions in the fourth quarter of last year and the success of our 300 foot down spacing program across our acreage position. We have also seen a 30% decline in operating cost in South Texas as our team continues to work on driving down our cost structure.","We are currently running two rigs in the play with plans to decrease to one rig by the end of May. Our plan is to remain at this level throughout year-end. However, we will consider acceleration of completion activity in the Eagle Ford if we see a sustained oil price recovery or further reduction in drilling and completion cost, which have decreased to date 20% to 30%.","Now let us move to another area that has many questions in regard to our time with investors on the year end call, we discussed a few of the significant accomplishments the constitution had recently achieved such as the FERC Certificate of Public Convenience approving constitution pipeline and the New York DEC formal notice of complete the application for the final New York permit. Also we briefly discussed the regulatory process in New York requiring a public comment period extension, which closed on February 27, 2015.","Today we can continue that update with the following. The project remains on its current schedule for in service during the second half of \u201916. The New York DEC is currently finalizing responses to the comments received during the public comment period. The constitution now has possession of 100% of all the tracks necessary to begin construction. The constitution is working towards the finalization of New York State permits by the end of the second quarter and FERC implementation plan is expected to be filed by [Williams] during the second quarter. Based on the progress during the last few months, we continue to be optimistic that construction can begin mid-summer assuming all these permits are in hand.","As we also mentioned in our press release, we recently amended our credit facility increasing the total commitment from $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion providing us ample flexibility in this challenged environment. Our lenders also approved an increase in our borrowing base from $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion despite the lower commodity price environment.","A total of 20 lenders participated in this upsized facility including six new banks. We are appreciative of the support we saw in this transaction and we believe it demonstrates the quality of our company both operationally and financially. Pro forma for this increase in commitment, we had over 1.5 billion of undrawn commitments as of the end of the first quarter.","In this morning\u2019s press release, we initiated second-quarter production guidance, which implies slightly over 1.5 Bcfe per day of net equivalent production for the quarter at the midpoint despite the sequential decline in production relative to the first quarter due to the previously mentioned curtailments in the Marcellus. ","We have reaffirmed our 2015 production growth guidance range between 10% to 18%, based on a stronger than anticipated first quarter and expectations for increase in production above second quarter levels later in the year. Our capital program for the current year remains unchanged at $900 million. I would however highlight that not only is our 2015 capital program weighted heavily to the first half of the year, the first quarter capital expenditures on the cash flow statement also reflect carry-forward cash outlays associated with the capital incurred in \u201914 but not paid until this year. We have also decreased our unit cost guidance for LOE, taxes other than income and DD&A. These updates can be found on our website.","In summary, a strong first quarter production highlights that Cabot is able to achieve operationally strong performance. Currently lower natural gas prices are a reality through Appalachia, however we are optimistic the environment improves over the next few quarters through a combination of decreased levels of operating activity, increased demand and new takeaway projects.","Our goal in the interim is to protect margins and ensure we aren\u2019t giving away our valuable resources at marginal prices. Despite our planned reduction in volumes for the second quarter we remain confident in our production guidance range for the year and continue to be excited about our mid-term outlook as we increase our portfolio of firm sales and firm transportation to close to 3 Bcf per day by the end of \u201917 of which approximately 70% reaches markets outside of Appalachia.","With that then I will be more than happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Subash Chandra of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Subash Chandra","Yes, hi, good morning. I was curious strategically if there is any interest at all in securing a southern Marcellus foothold, as I suspect there is a shakeout coming, the American energy folks of the world et cetera, and if there is any interest in doing that, and then secondly, if you can maybe get more granular on the impressive operating costs experienced in the first quarter? Thanks.","Dan Dinges","Okay. First I will respond to any M&A considerations within our company. We are proactive in evaluating opportunities out there. Each year I think as you are probably aware that we have our strategy session and certainly in environments as we are in today, we have a time set aside in our executive board session just as we did yesterday to talk about all the macro-environment including M&A opportunities, considerations.","We are not in any discussions with a southwest Marcellus or Utica opportunities down there but we want to be aware of what opportunities are available, and we will continue to evaluate any possible opportunities, but specifically for the southwest part of the state, again we are not in any transaction discussions or anything at this particular time.","In regard to the operating side of the business, two of the guys here, Steve Lindeman, who is running our South region and Phil Stalnaker running our North region, I will let them comment on just some of the things that we have seen in the operating side of our business.","Steven Lindeman","Yes. For the South region in the first quarter we really tackled our unit saltwater disposal costs. So that is one of the big drivers, and then secondly we switched out some of our treating chemicals and have driven that cost down. And we\u2019re still looking at \u2013 there are some things we are trying to tackle for the second-half of the year in terms of electrification and other things that we can do to reduce our operating cost.","Phil Stalnaker","Again for the North region, this is more of the same thing on the optimization, yet looking at our recycling and our trucking cost just kind of across the board working just to lower the cost.","Subash Chandra","If I could just follow up just on the Eagle Ford, the electrification is, I suspect that is for the artificial lifts et cetera, is there \u2013 do you see that happening in a timely fashion with getting land owner consent and that kind of stuff, and given a sense of what kind of operating cost efficiencies we can have by maybe getting off diesel, which might be what is being used currently?","Steven Lindeman","Yes, we do. We have made a significant effort over the last half of the year and into the first quarter to get right away purchased. One of the main substations that we need for electrification was put in service in the first quarter. As a matter of fact we are \u2013 some of our team was over there for an opening ceremony last night, and we are in the queue for several projects to get put online and we are hoping to have a portion of the field on power kind of into the third quarter of this year.","Subash Chandra","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Dan Dinges","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","David Deckelbaum","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Dan just curious if last quarter you alluded to this, or you guys communicated that you wouldn\u2019t have a high point in production in the first quarter and naturally with seasonal winter demand and taking advantage of some of the firm sales contracts and then decline into 2Q and 3Q and rebound in the 4Q, is the plan today with the reiterated guidance, are you guys more or less within the original plan that you had set out a few months ago?","Dan Dinges","Yes, we are. We cannot predict exactly what the realizations were going to be. We thought they were going to be a little softer. We were glad to see quarter-over-quarter a little bit of reduction in the differentials, but our plans is still intact with our original guidance.","David Deckelbaum","And just for context and maybe you could go into little bit more how you are managing the curtailments, I know that there is downtime associated with project maintenance and construction, but, just allowing sort of field volume pressures to build and naturally curtailing volumes that way, and what sort of recovery in prices are we thinking about before you would start accelerating the volumes here?","Dan Dinges","Well, we are not going to go into specifics on the pricing for that decision process, David. But we do expect to see better realizations later in the year than we anticipated during this period when the maintenance projects were going to be implemented and you were in the shoulder months. In regard to our field operations and methodology of how we are reducing the volumes out there, we have discussed in the past that we have a very flexible gathering system that allows us to move gas even from one particular pad to multiple outlets.","We do anticipate that as we raise the field pressures in the field and allow that to happen that we would naturally bring down some of the volumes that we would be moving into the pipe. And so it is not a shut in a particular portion of the field and produce the others at those volumes that they were at. It is more of a across-the-board consideration of how we would bring the field pressures up a little bit to allow the volumes to be reduced.","David Deckelbaum","Got it and if I could just raise here one more, perhaps for Jeff or anyone who wants to take it, with Constitution potentially coming on in the summertime of \u201916 how are you guys thinking about the [ends] [ph] market there right now in terms of pricing and, is it \u2013 I know that you would partially do it naturally be better than Appalachia, but do you have a sense of how close that pricing should be to NYMEX and what you see \u2013 how you see that dynamic kind of building out?","Dan Dinges","Well, certainly on a historic look, the price points up there at that [right station] [ph] and into that line are close to the NYMEX pricing. Various times of the year it exceeds NYMEX pricing by a considerable margin. We\u2019ve already kind of broadcast that we will make that call on how we would roll into the Constitution volumes whether it would be just total incremental volumes to what our current production is at that point in time of commissioning or if it will be a phase in by displacing the volumes from our current price points to the Constitution pipeline.","I think it is safe to say at that point in time regardless of when Constitution is commissioned, whether it is in the middle of summer or right at the beginning of the third quarter I think it is safe to say that those price points more likely if they are consistent with historic is going to be at a higher better price point than the current indices that we are selling into. So we would naturally move and fill 100% of constitution immediately, but it may be just a displacement from the Millennium or Transco or Tennessee lines.","David Deckelbaum","Thanks for that color Dan.","Dan Dinges","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Dan Dinges","Hi Brian.","Brian Singer","Actually wanted to follow up on that exact point, which is how you strategically determine the appropriate mix of filling constitution with production you already have versus kind of new production, when do you have to make that call? Are you planning on increasing your production capacity from where it is today by the full 500 million a day, and then you make that \u2013 you can make that call at the last second or is there a point where earlier on where you have to figure out your rig count and make that call on the split between transferring production currently oversupplying or potentially oversupplying the local market versus new production to go onto constitution?","Dan Dinges","That is a big question Brian, and how I answer the question will be dependent upon how much I make Phil Stalnaker squirm over here in front of me. But keep in mind that the capital intensity necessary for us to ramp up our volumes is minimal comparatively speaking when you look across the space to be able to find another half a Bcf a day. The driving consideration for that volume of production is going to be not necessarily in the rig count, but it is going to be how we stage in frac crews to allow timely completions of those wells that we have in the queue.","So the plan building up to that decision point it would be our intent to have in the queue that will allow us to have that maximum flexibility is to have wells drilled and in the queue waiting on completion if you will as opposed to backing up a step and saying that we haven\u2019t even drilled the wells or drill those pad sides yet.","So when you get towards the end of this year, the discussions that we will have with the North will be all right, let us look at our capital program, let us look at our cash flow, let us look at the dynamics of the macro market, and let us make a call on bringing on another rig if we felt we needed it in the first part of 2016 but also looking at ahead at the end of the second quarter beginning of the third quarter how many frac crews do we want have land up to get ready to move those volumes in the constitution.","Again, keep in mind that constitution is going to be failed immediately upon commissioning the decision is going to be do we back fill Tennessee Transco Millennium with those volumes and how long do we want to take to backfill those volumes. But at the end of this year, as we go into the planning stage for our initial budget for 2016 which we present to the board in October will have some of these discussions.","Brian Singer","Great, thanks. And my follow up is if you could just two other points one whether you\u2019re seeing any substantive cost deflation that unrelated to your activity levels could push down your budget this year or not. And then your outlook for committing to additional substantive [indiscernible] arrangements?","Dan Dinges","Once you cover the midstream going to have that\u2019s going to roll out.","Jeff Hutton","Okay Brian, this is Jeff. I think there is a number of smaller projects that were involved with what we felt this fall being the very important project that we\u2019ve some long term sales associated with the petroleum per pricing. There is of course, following up with that there is the Columbia east side expansion we\u2019ve some additional capacity come along at that point. After that we have of course constitution midsummer of next year and those are the \u2013 more or less short term drivers on new capacity and Atlantic Sunrise in 2017 and also new project for Tennessee at the smaller scale project about 150,000 a day that\u2019s \u2013 over into New Jersey area from our production area. So that\u2019s the kind of the short longer term of projects.","Scott Schroeder","And Brian on your question about cost let me just answer this and if I don\u2019t answer this and if I don\u2019t answer fully just let me know but we do anticipate seeing additional incremental cost reductions and the inter operations we have not realized any of the saving as state indicated inside electrification of solar operations in the Eagle Ford. But we also think that the service providers are up, also obtaining and getting additional cost concessions from their providers that would naturally be shared somehow with the operators. So, we do anticipate that additional cost reductions would roll through our program between now and year end.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Our Next question comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons, please go ahead.","Pearce Hammond","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Dan, there are being many reports in the press about frac log or significant backlog of drill but not completed wells and previously Q1 earnings you said that cabbage should exit 2015 with approximately 45 wells in the queue for 2016 in the Marcellus and approximately 20 wells in the Eagle Ford and I know you talked about this little bit in the Q&A and in some prepared remarks. But I want to see if that was still the case and then if so, how do these figures compare to the number of wells that you had queued up entering this year and if you have any big picture thoughts regarding this industry frac log, is it real, is it overstated or what not, love to get that color as well?","Dan Dinges","Well, first off, on our expectations for year end 2015 we do still maintain our expectations, 20 wells in the Eagle Ford and 45 wells or so in the Marcellus that is going to remain consistent, I don\u2019t see much getting in the way of that expectation. In regard to frac log and looking at the backlog it\u2019s always seems to be a moving number that you see out there and I\u2019ve seen different accounts what is backlog at any one give time. I do know that from a operation standpoint and I\u2019ll talk more geographically about say where that could have a larger impact in our Northeast Pennsylvania in that six county area, if you look at that area, we\u2019ve talked in the past about how many rigs are running and how many frac crews are up there. Our most recent intelligence is that you had through say January, February, March, a certain number of rigs running up there and most recently in April we place the number of rigs up there in that particular area and our neck of the woods had only 12 rigs that are currently running and we have at any given time 6 to 8 frac crews operating in that neck of the wood.","Now if you do the simple math, and you look at the 8BCF or so a day that's kind of coming from that area 12 rigs and 6 rig frac crews are going to have one hell of a time keeping up with any natural declines that you might suspect from the volumes that are being produced. Now do you think that there were and have been just like we had some curtailed volumes that could keep maybe back filling some of that gas volume and you are maybe today not seeing any type of real inflection point but it doesn\u2019t take a [indiscernible] to do the quick numbers on RPs and 30 day averages and all that for those number of pieces to the equipment to say that there has to be some depletion of the backlog if you will and the ability of wells to keep up with the natural depletion that would occur and under those circumstances. So on 2014 at the end of 2014, I think we had a similar number we might actually have a couple of more wells at the end of 2015 as we had at the end of 2014 but for the most part we are going to have a similar backlog for us.","Pearce Hammond","Thank you for that. That color is very helpful and then my follow-up is some oil service providers have highlighted the tremendous opportunity in re-fracing wells can you see the same opportunity for Cabot and so and in what region?","Dan Dinges","Well, I have had a just a recent discussion with Phil in regard to our Eagle Ford operation just the industry in general on kind of what\u2019s being done out there and then it kind of end up in a high level I\u2019ll let him just kind of talk about maybe some of the areas that a re-frac might be considered.","Scott Schroeder","So Pearce, when we look at that successful re-frac throughout the industry really what has been targeted is wells that have had I would say less sand concentration or lower con activity of frac jobs pump as compared to what the current standard would be and then secondly a group of wells that might have different pup clustering then what's being used. So a lot of people are targeting wells that may have been let\u2019s say pup at 100 foot spacing and now what people are targeting 50 foot spacing and the same thing kind of on the sand basis where people may have done 800 pounds per foot versus now what people are pumping closer towards 1600 pounds per foot. Cabot does have some opportunity for refracs. I would say that we would target those when we would do the down spaced wells and do those in conjunction with that so you could get the full benefit of the zipper frac both on the refrac and on the new wells that we drill in the down spaced perspective.","Pearce Hammond","Great. Well thank you very much for the color.","Dan Dinges","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Christensen of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Robert Christensen","Yes. Thank you. My understanding that 60 days after the public commentary in New York which ended February 27, under the uniform procedures that 60 days we should have some news out of the DEC of New York at that would imply next week. Is that the case we should hear from them one way or another next week?","Dan Dinges","No Bob that's not the understanding we have from \u2013 at this time. The DEC has taken the time to thoroughly review the comments that were submitted in the public comment period. Our understanding is that they are close to releasing the answers so to speak on these comments. There is still some work in progress surrounding the permits but we made a lot of progress here in the last couple of months and our expectations are that those permits will be issued sometime in the second quarter May, June time period.","Robert Christensen","And if you could answer a little bit about nothing materially that was \u2013","Dan Dinges","Absolutely. So, from the comments that have been submitted our understanding from Williams is that the comments are very similar in nature that the comments were submitted to PERC as so there has been nothing in their review of the comment has been substantially different I guess than what they have seen before so we are encouraged by that so far. ","Scott Schroeder","One worry I have is that they would come with something that said we have got to study this and study it equally to the study period of the PERC and that period I believe took from February and go forward to October, February 14 to October 14 like 8 months. And we want the same time that the said tab I am studying this that's the concern I have. Should I have that concern that they can come with that type of thing.","Dan Dinges","I think the application for the permit has been in New York DEC hands for a much longer period of time than what you\u2019re referring to, I think they have had a very lengthy time to review.","Robert Christensen","Got it. Well thank you very much.","Dan Dinges","Thanks Bob. ","Operator","Our next question comes from David Beard from Iberia. Please go ahead.","David Beard","Hi good morning gentlemen. I apologize if this question has been asked, to access I\u2019ve trouble getting on my call but I just wanted to review just to see to have a bit more volatile production here first quarter, second quarter I was surprised with the prices being fairly week I would have expected volumes to be commensurately low or can you just talk a little bit about the press volume relationship, I know we are talking a fairly short term point of view and maybe what to expect on forward relative to that price volume relationship?","Dan Dinges","Well, we made an early determination and based on our crystal ball which again is no better than anybody else but with our crystal ball we made and placed our guidance out there early on that did take in considerations curtailed volumes and where we are right now our first quarter volumes were robust and we felt good about our operational performance in the first quarter but in the second quarter when anticipation again the maintenance projects and all particularly affecting the pipes that we sell into up in the Marcellus, we thought that by the continued supply increase and the construction project and maintenance projects up there that we would see softness in prices at this period of time. I think that is holding true. We are backing up some of the volumes and we think just from a prudency standpoint to protect shareholders assets and not to compromise our margin to the extent that the current price would yield we think it is prudent in this environment to take some of the gas and protect our margins. I think that's a prudent economics decision on our part and we are going to stick to that.","David Beard","That's helpful. And just to change subjects on a follow-up, given we have seen some reduced rigs operating in the Marcellus both east and west do you think there will be an impact relative to production from the curtailment in the second half of the year or is that likely to be pushed off into next year for the industry?","Dan Dinges","I think by the second half of the year whether or not you see a rollover is debatable, I think you will see a possible inflection point in any of the growth profile. Again back to just the numbers that are out in front of us if you believe that up in that 6 can area that there is in April beginning in April there were 12 rigs running and 6 to 8 frac crews in that area and producing approximately 8 BCF a day even if all those wells were to the degree and to the performance levels of Cabot type wells, you are going to have a difficult time being able to maintain much less grow the production volumes from that product base. So I think the numbers have reflected that the other wells that are drilled out there are not like Cabot wells and so therefore I would be inclined to believe that some point in time you are going to see an inflection point on the volumes produced. ","David Beard","Now that's helpful. Thank you gentlemen. I appreciate the time.","Dan Dinges","Thanks David. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Guffey of Stifel, please go ahead.","Dan Guffey","Thanks. You guys continue to generate salary results and you referred specially compared to earlier vintage wells I guess could you give details surrounding your current standard completion zone and any technical improvements you are currently testing to further enhance productivity?","Dan Dinges","Well, I will get real granular on it but I will let Steve answer some of this but our lateral links are beyond 6000 feet and our profit per lateral foot is 1600 or so right now when we certainly are aware that some companies have gone up to 2300, 2400 maybe 2500 pounds per lateral foot and our south region will explore with some of that as we continue our operation we have got our down spacing program that we feel comfortable with and have a number of pilot programs that had given us the confidence at 300 down spaced is going to be how we place our wells from this point forward as we have been successful in maintaining our primary term acreage and we have had responsive landowners negotiate with us in regard to the timing of obligatory wells or continuous development wells out there on their properties some of those mineral owners do not want to produce their well into a low price environment. So we have been able to extend some time on those particular leases. So between now and the year with one rig, and a not a 24\/7 frac crew some of the experimentation if you will and completion efforts that we would be implementing are not going to be very numerous simply because we are kind of in a somewhat of a holding pattern with one rig and one crew.","Dan Guffey","Okay. Thanks for the detail. You kind of touched on the 300 foot space in your prepared remarks just now I am curious how many pilots you have at 300 feet space is that kind of standard completion is on and how are you looking at it is it stack and staggers or are you just landing kind of in the lower zone and keeping it at 300 foot apart.","Dan Dinges","Well, we are in the lower zone with our 300 foot spacing but we have several points within the lower zone that we are landing our wells. And we have 20 or 30 of the pilots that are out there that have shown good results. But again, we have not gotten to the point of doing anything yet in the upper Eagle Ford on the staggers that some have been talking about. Our staggers are in a narrower range within the lower Eagle Ford on our placements. But we have also had 300 foot space laterals that have been in the same landing points also within the lower Eagle Ford that we feel comfortable about.","Dan Guffey","Okay. Great. And you touched on M&A previously but curious do you guys are interested in seeing bolt on acquisitions and opportunities in South Texas?","Dan Dinges","Well again, to not get granular on it we look at all the opportunities that are available out there. We are just fresh up taking up two properties that were good fits to our operation in the Eagle Ford that we closed in the fourth quarter the results that we have seen from that efforts proved out an efficient program and consistency with our expectations or exceeding expectations with the wells that we drilled on those properties. So it all comes together and you can get into an environment that is little bit more robust and a $50 roll price then it will make sense.","Dan Guffey","Thanks. I appreciate your color guys.","Dan Dinges","Yes, thank you Dan.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dan Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan Dinges","Okay. Right appreciate it, appreciate everybody's focus on Cabot as you are well aware and we are all well aware we are in a challenged commodity price environment in both oil and gas, efficiencies are being realized and cost reductions realized, the radar operations both side cash cost basis for our unit production but also in our capital program and we expect to see continued improvement throughout the year. And thanks again for your interest in Cabot.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Shaun, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us for today's Cabot third quarter 2018 earnings call. We do have a number of executive management team with me at the table. I would first like to emphasize that on this morning's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.","For the third quarter of 2018, Cabot generated net income of $122.3 million or $0.28 per share, compared to $0.04 per share for the prior year comparable quarter. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2018 was $108.9 million or $0.25 per share compared to $0.07 per share for the prior-year comparable quarter.","For the third quarter of 2018, Cabot's cash from operating activities was $242.2 million compared with $189.1 million in the prior-year comparable quarter. Discretionary cash flow for the third quarter 2018 was $298.8 million compared to $207.2 million in the prior-year comparable quarter.","Cabot returned to free cash flow generation during the third quarter of 2018 delivering $28.6 million of free cash flow compared $4 million in the prior-year comparable quarter. We've now generated positive free cash flow for nine of the last 10 quarters and expect this trend to be the new normal given the inflection point we find ourselves at today.","As previously reported earlier this month, daily equivalent production for the quarter was 2.029 Bcfe per day which represents a 10% increase relative to the prior-year comparable quarter, and a 7% sequential increase relative to the second quarter of 2018. On a divesture adjusted basis, third quarter 2018 daily equipment production increased 19% relative to the prior-year comparable quarter.","Realized natural gas prices increased 16% relative to the prior-year comparable quarter despite a 3% decline in NYMEX benchmark prices driven by an improvement in pre-hedge basis differentials from minus $0.99 last year to minus $0.54 this year.","Our unit cost continue to improve as we posted an 18% decline in cost relative to the prior-year comparable quarter. Cash unit cost which excludes DD&A stock-based compensation and other non-cash charges were below $1 per Mcfe for the quarter [hovering] our ability to generate strong levels of cash flow even in a low natural price cycle.","During the quarter we returned $188.5 million of capital to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases and also paid off $237 million tranche of a 6.4% senior notes that matured in July resulting in over 15 million of annualized savings going forward. Our continued reduction in capital employed coupled with our growth and earnings has resulted in a return on capital employed for the trailing 12 month of 10.8% and improvement of over 500 basis points relative to the trailing 12 months ended in September 30, 2017.","Our capital allocation update, in this morning's press release we highlighted our commitment to returning cash to shareholders through the continued execution of our share repurchase program and the announcement of our third dividend increase in the last 18 months. Our share repurchases reflect continue to believe that our stock is currently trading below intrinsic value while the dividend increase highlights confidence in the company's ability to generate strong levels of free cash flow going forward.","Year-to-date Cabot has repurchased 30 million shares and win including year-to-date dividend payments as well as our expected dividend payments for the fourth quarter we will have returned over $820 million of cash to shareholders in 2018 representing a total shareholder year yield of almost 9% based on our market capitalization. Since we reactivated our share repurchase program since second quarter of 2017, we have reduced our shares outstanding by over 7% to 431.2 million shares.","As a reminder, we currently have approximately 20 million shares remaining authorized under our share repurchase program. We also highlighted our commitment to returning over 50% of our annual free cash flow shareholders going forward. We believe our firm commitment to provide this level of payout shareholders annually while still preserving financial flexibility to remain opportunistic to all commodity cycles maximizes our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders.","Our focus on increasing return of capital coupled with an expectation for continued earnings growth should allow us to deliver continued improvement in our return on capital employed which already significantly exceeds our cost of capital.","The Cabot's long-term plan to be successful, we have highlighted our four critical infrastructure projects to be completed during 2018. While we have frequently provided updates on the progress of these projects, today I'd like to provide specific details on these major accomplishments as our marketing strategy to create new major takeaway Greenfield pipeline and development in key basin and demand has finally and effectively come together.","Regarding in-basin demand, we're happy to confirm that the Moxie Freedom power project was successfully placed in service during the second week of August. As with all startups we have had some volatility during the first few months of service by placing the 1,000 megawatt facility in service prior to the winter season is a great milestone for Cabot.","Moving on to the Lackawanna Energy Center with the Trains 1 & 2 fully in service, we are only waiting Trains 3 to complete this testing - to complete its testing phase. Currently Train 3 remains on schedule for December 1 and we are anxious for this mammoth 1,485 megawatt power facility to be 100% complete and fully in service for our December business.","In summary, our two large-scale power projects will add significant invasion demand for Cabot for years and provide basis for an additional project as we continue efforts to increase local demand in the Northeast Pennsylvania area. On October 6, 2018 the Atlantic Sunrise project was placed in the service for Cabot. No single project could be viewed as significant and material to Cabot's financial and operating stream as this new 170 mile Greenfield pipeline that will connect Cabot's position in the Northeast Pennsylvania asset area to the Atlantic Coast market area.","On the operating front, we had several seamless successful transition as we diverted gas from in-basin out of multiple sources and immediately filled our new pipe to full capacity. With Cove Point LNG facility already in service, this new pipeline provides a direct path enabled Cabot to capitalize on its 20 year 350 million per day supply contract with Pacific Summit Energy and realize an opportunity we all have been waiting and working towards for over five years.","That said, the in-service Atlantic Sunrise also triggers several other significant events for Cabot. To start pipeline now allows for service to commence for the following sales agreement. One, a 15-year 500 million per day sales to Washington Gas Light, secondly, a 50 million per day sales to southern companies, and third a three-year 150 million per day sale to an undisclosed customer.","To recap, on October 6 Cabot commenced delivery of 700 million cubic foot per day to three new sales customers while delivering an additional 350 million per day to Cove Point for a total of 1.05 Bcf per day to new markets with significantly better pricing realizations. With the addition of close to 400 million cubic foot per day of new in-basin demand from the power plant, Cabot has successfully shifted its primary pricing mix from supplier pricing to market area pricing for close to 1.5 Bcf per day, a milestone that frankly is unheard of in today's environment.","I might add these are not temporary in nature as these transactions for the most part average 10 to 20 years in duration. Personally I would like to thank both our Pittsburgh-based employees and our field personnel along with our partners and board for the commitment and execution of this step change event for Cabot.","Moving on to our recent announcement of the new Leidy South project. We feel good about the scale and timing of this expansion of the new pipeline infrastructure. This 250 million a day - per day project consist primarily of additional compression for Cabot's new capacity which will significantly decrease the risk surrounding cost and construction timing. This project also allows for about 20% lower transportation rate to move our production down to the Washington DC market area. More to come on this new addition to our marketing portfolio.","Now moving into the fourth quarter and the full-year update for 2018. This morning we also reaffirmed our previously announced fourth quarter 2018 net production guidance of 2.225 to 2.275 Bcf per day. Additionally we reaffirmed our 2018 growth production guidance range of 7% to 8% or 12% to 13% on a debt adjusted per share basis and our full-year capital budget of $940 million.","Based on recent forward curves, we expect to generate approximately $200 million of free cash flow during the fourth quarter and approximately $250 million of cash flow for the full-year highlighting the impact of our increased production volumes, improved local realizations, our sales agreement to the Moxie Freedom and the Lackawanna Energy Power plant and our access to new markets via the Atlantic Sunrise pipeline.","On the local realizations front, we have experienced a significant improvement in prices since the beginning of the fourth quarter driven by the in-service of the Atlantic Sunrise project during the first week of October prior to Atlantic Sunrise coming online, local gas prices averaged to $1.40 compared to an average of 2.90 since the in-service of Atlantic Sunrise.","Cash prices in the Northeast have continue to improve throughout the month with this week average price over $3.10. For reference, last year October local cash prices averaged $0.72 highlighting the impact of new takeaway from the area and increase in-basin demand.","Now moving on to the 2019 preliminary operating plan. This morning we also provided our 2019 production growth guidance range of 20% to 25% or 25% to 30% on a debt adjusted per share basis. This production growth is based on a capital budget range of $802 million to $850 million where we land within this capital range will ultimately be dependent upon our use of natural gas macro in 2019, 2020 for which this coming winter season will certainly have a large impact.","The demand remains strong and supply growth does not overwhelm. We could easily target the higher end of the capital range allowing for stronger trajectory heading into 2020. However, if winter weather disappoints, while growth continues to outperform expectations and we're more than comfortable targeting the lower end of our capital range with a focus on maximizing free cash flow and returns on capital which will result in a modestly lower 2019 exit win.","I would also note that our 2019 capital guidance includes approximately $10 million of capital for pad construction and drilling in our expiration area. We have continued to make progress on evaluation of this area but our progress has been slowed somewhat lower than forecast due to - slower than forecast to permitting in weather delays.","Currently I estimate that our valuation will be complete sometime in the latter part of the first quarter of 2019. Based on current market indications for NYMEX and basis differential, we expect our natural gas price realizations for 2019 to average $0.30 below NYMEX resulting in free cash flow levels of $650 million to $700 million for the year or over a 7% free cash flow yield based on our current market capitalizations.","Additionally, this program would generate earnings per share growth greater than 60% and return on capital employed over 20% both of which are extremely competitive when compared to the broader S&P 500 averages.","As it relates to production range for 2019, let me first highlight that this has nothing to do with well performance or asset quality. In fact, we recently released production data for the state of Pennsylvania for August further confirms this with Cabot delivering 15 of the top 20 wells in the state.","And instead the current production levels forecast versus our preliminary guide back in February is a result of extremely capital efficient program that only requires three rigs and two completion crews and includes larger pad and longer laterals that require at various times existing production to be shut in on offset pads and completion operation.","These pads or wells may be shut in anywhere from a month to six-month depending on location. I would also note that these shut in wells returned to pre-shut in rates once placed back in production. Our expected production growth in 2019 is only 25% to 30% on a debt adjusted per share basis off of a two plus Bcf net per day base it is slightly lower than our original forecast.","However, so is our capital budget lower by a considerable amount when incorporating the impact of higher expected realized price our free cash flow expectations are in line with our estimates from our earlier projection. So we do remain excited about the setup for 2019 driven by our ability to generate a healthy combination of growth and earnings per share. Free cash flow and ROCE.","With that Shaun, I\u2019ll be more than happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Leo Mariani with NatAlliance Securities. Go ahead Leo.","Leo Mariani","Just wanted to follow up a little bit on your comments regarding guidance for 2019. Just trying to get sense obviously you\u2019re targeting slightly lower CapEx, slightly lower production growth you explained some of the rationale. But just big picture is there kind of concerted effort by Cabot here to spent a little bit less money and just kind of generate more free cash flow with the thought of returning much higher percentage of that to shareholders. So a lot of this just kind of part of a master plan and a shift to return more of that capital just wanted to get some of the thinking behind that.","Dan Dinges","Well it\u2019s exactly that Leo we have - the last couple of years been directing our attention to a value model versus a growth model. Our efforts to become the lowest cost producer out there I think is certainly realized and our efforts to return capital to shareholders and also a return on capital has been highlighted in our prior comment. So our plan is a laser focused on having a value model coupled with modest growth.","And I think in this environment particularly in an environment that has a healthy supply component to it, I think it's the prudent way to go and we're one of a few companies out there that can manage with superior assets, manage a return of cash to shareholders, return on capital that competes favorably with not only our space but also the broader S&P 500. And it\u2019s our objective to continue along these lines we put benchmarks in our release of returning a 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.","And we're doing everything we can to balance both the capital spend and be able to react if you will to what the macro market does in the space. We see absolutely zero reason to grow into an environment if in fact the commodity price does not provide superior returns.","Leo Mariani","So I guess just to that end assuming that gas prices stay strong as you work into 2019 and your free cash flow goals are materialized. And I guess should we continue to expect to see potential bump up in the share repurchase program in consideration for even higher dividends as we work our way in next year?","Dan Dinges","No, we're putting in there if in fact you do have the commodity price improvements we think this winter is going to be an interesting period with the supply and storage being where it is. If we do have a winter event I think it's going to and certainly we've been shutdown in a couple of areas to be able to get needed pipelines to the Northeast area.","We haven't been able to get a pipeline across New York, but we think that some of those customers are going to suffer a higher energy cost up there if we do experience a cold winter in light of our ability or lack of ability to be able to get the natural gas into areas that they certainly the market is needed and has asked for. And with that improvement in pricing, we do plan on delivering as we laid out a return of our cash flow to shareholders.","Leo Mariani","And I guess just lastly can you folks just talk about progress on sort of the new generation frac design on some tests in the Upper Marcellus?","Dan Dinges","While we have said in the past that our design we\u2019re landing on for the most part is our gen-5 design which we talked about in the past. We've also indicated that we are - as part of our 2018 program we have a number of Upper Marcellus test that we are also completing. We've indicated that the early look at the Upper Marcellus meets with our or exceeds our expectation of what we put out as far our production curve.","And we don't see anything that is going to deter from our position that the Upper Marcellus is a distinct and accretive zone different than the Lower Marcellus. So we're comfortable with that position everything we've seen and what we\u2019ve done with our completions out there supports that position. And once we have more production to be able to represent the production curve and the curve fit we will be adding more clarity and support and be more open with what we see early time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead Charles.","Charles Meade","This is another question. I think maybe it's an attempt to kind of simplify some of the detailed thoughts you gave us. Can you give us an idea of what data points will be on, kind of, your internal dashboard or the kind of the dashboard of management there as you guys decide to dial up or dial down on CapEx? I imagine, NYMEX is part of it but also your local basis where you'd be delivering incremental volumes and also, share price? But are there other items there? Or is that the right way to think about it?","Dan Dinges","It\u2019s all the above Charles, if you have a say, we have a disastrous winter season and you get softness in the price. You have overpressure pipelines up there where they have restrictions on pressures and it hits the price point for our natural gas pricing well. It\u2019s not going to make sense to just continue to ramp up as our asset would allow a bunch of gas into that environment.","On the other side if in fact as forecast there is going to be the possibility of a colder winter and there would be a strong support through the winter on the commodity price which would challenge the market to supply the demand that might be anticipated. We will we will be part of that demand equation, spend the money.","Phil Stalnaker is here, who runs our North region. His group will move forward expeditiously to continue to execute their program in a very efficient manner and we will be able to ramp up our deliveries in what we think would be a timely fashion.","Now it's not instantaneous when we start ramp up spending capital but it does support the back end of 2019 rolling into the 1920 winter season where if in fact the storage is similar to what we see and we want to enhance our possession rolling into that winter season all macro points considered NYMEX and some of the points you brought up Charles we will be fully capable of upping our 2019 exit and our expected 2020 production levels.","Charles Meade","And then following up a little bit on that point. You gave some interesting color in your prepared remarks about the local basis up there before and after Atlantic Sunrise came on. And then, obviously, those - that was - those numbers that you gave, I believe, you said above 40 before and 290 after, that seems pretty dramatic to me and better than I would have guessed. But could you talk about how that - how it did versus your expectations, what you guys were going to see before and after, and if anything has surprised you?","Dan Dinges","Well, we certainly have - always had the expectation that Atlantic sunrise was not only going to take out of basin and that's the supply basin. Our 850 million that we had committed to that pipeline but it was also going to be an incremental 850 million to get to the Atlantic Sunrise full capacity of 1.7 Bcf a day that is being taken out of basin. I think a direct result of the enhanced position of the basis and in the improvement in the basis is a direct result of 1.7 Bcf a day being evacuated from the supply base.","So to tell you how quick it happened for us, Jeff has mentioned being a little granular that at 10 AM the Atlantic Sunrise project was commissioned on October 6, and a little more than two hours later we had already transferred out of the supply basin 850 million cubic foot a day to the market basin where we were getting and receiving different price points.","So that's how quick we moved it out of basin and others I don't know they're coming that others for the other 850 million, I'm sure it was done in a timely basis because we were going to be reaching the bread a better price point but along with his evacuation certainly the dynamics of the storage and the early predictions of winter has had an effect on the local basis.","But it is reflected in our guidance of having 2019 expectation of our realizations being $0.30 less NYMEX is a significant improvement where we have been in the last four years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Brian.","Brian Singer","There is a glass half - empty glass half full way of looking at greater than 50% commitments to returning free cash flow or the commitment to returning greater than 50% of free cash for the shareholders. Certainly I think people can look and say, wow look here as a company that is committing to share repurchase and dividends and then the other side would be what's going to happen to the other 50% or slightly or less than 50%. Can you add some color on how you're thinking about the remainder of that free cash flow the extent that that would be - that paydown acquisition expiration and then maybe give us an update on the expiration side well as part of that.","Dan Dinges","Yes, you can look at the past Brian and you followed us for a long time. We have always managed in - what I would couch as a conservative method and a conservative management of our balance sheet. We did not have any problems keeping close to $1 billion of cash on our balance sheet when we sold our Eagle Ford and closed on that. We had cash on our balance sheet right now with $1.8 billion undrawn on our facility and that position just that we sleep well, at night I think our shareholders sleep well with that at night and if in fact we found an opportunity to utilize that additional 50% of our free cash flow in a prudent way the way we manage the rest of our business.","We would think about that and we would have a ability to execute on an opportunity if in fact we see it. The issue is with our tremendous capital efficiency how we allocate our capital. What we expect when we allocate our capital sets a high bar and that high-class problem makes it rather difficult to find a competitive area to allocate that incremental 50% but at this time we're comfortable having it on our balance sheet.","Scott's referencing, I didn't answer the expiration side. We\u2019ve been delayed up there because of the construction build out, some weather slow down permitting issues to try to get to the data gathering point we need to drill and complete tasks that slowdown has pushed into where we think the completion of what data gathering that we had set out when we first started this effort that we need to evaluate the project.","We think we\u2019ll have gathered in the middle to the latter part of the first quarter and then have an evaluation certainly subsequent to gathering that data. We will make the appropriate call just as we have in the past on whether or not we want to allocate capital further or we do - will begin with our refill project and with that, we don't see it can compete for capital we\u2019ll call it a day on that project and move on.","Between now and gathering that data or in 2019 we expect that they - and we budgeted about $10 million for 2019 to accomplish that.","Brian Singer","And then my follow-up is with regards to any type of constraints that maybe impacting production currently. Can you talk about whether there's any flexibility without meaningful incremental spending, should the pressure situation be right in that and in the Marcellus to bring more production online? So what degree is there - what level is there production heightened. What is the environment in which you would bring that on?","Dan Dinges","Our guidance is a - what I would couch is a conservative guidance from the standpoint that we are ramping up into our gathering system. Our guys in the field along with the Williams personnel continues to look at the most efficient way to ramp up production into the system. We look for all different kinds of ways to make our gathering system efficient.","We scheduled where we complete well, when we bring on wells in a way that balances the current production within a particular pod area of the gathering system to compare to another area in the gathering system in the field area that would allow us to bring on completed well into an area that the production is kind of trended down where we would not have as much inner pod pressure issues associated with our new production and its effect on old wells.","So we balanced that way out in advanced as we schedule drilling and completions and the number of wells we drill off a pad. As we go through this completion operation and you look at having to offset, shut in offset wells so we would mitigate any of the frac hits or pressure sensitivities that's been done throughout our industry. Everywhere that you have laterals that are in close proximity to new laterals are in close proximity to old production that\u2019s happening across the entire industry space.","And everybody is dealing with how you manage bringing on completions and bringing on new wells and its effect on offset production. So our guidance we think is conservative in that respect on how we have sensitized that impact and mitigated that impact and we made our best guess forecast on how many days we\u2019ve had certain wells or pad shut in as we bring on new wells. And that again just a balancing act but I can assure you every opportunity we have to bring a well back on that's been shut-in and to expedite or reduce the shut in period but we\u2019re going to do that. But we feel like we've managed through our guidance the effects of that process.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead Doug.","Doug Leggate","On the quarter I wonder if I could just touch by kind of couple of the comments you made about in base and capacity. And the line of sight you have for you\u2019re basically the constraints on your growth as you go forward. Obviously you've laid out 4 Bcf a day gross today. Realistically when do you think you\u2019ll get there given all of the above in terms of capital allocation piece of growth market conditions and so on what do you think is the timeline when we see you lift your production to that level?","Dan Dinges","Well Doug - it\u2019s a great question and I'm sure one that everybody would like to see us lay out a three-year, four year, five year forecast. But there is so many variables that go into laying out that forecast I\u2019d first start by saying that if in fact the market will allow the macro market would allow us to ramp up production even beyond 4 Bcf a day in the earliest possible timeframe. Our assets and our efficiencies would allow us to do that.","We might bring on another rig, we might bring on another frac crew, we might schedule it out a little bit different, but we could stage in a reasonable timeframe a tremendous ramp up and production with our \u2013 asset base that we have. With that being said to guide to a ramp up it would be a timeframe that takes into consideration all the variables whether it's NYMEX pricing, whether it is the storage impact on pricing, whether it's the weather, whether it's the supply side by other operators up there and is it is going to be \u2013 and a growth for the second growth out there by others.","If that happens and it's going to have I would think a negative effect on the capital efficiencies of those companies that grow for the sake of growth. And we all kind of looked at what is prudently and rationalizations of the market that oversupplied at any given time and I think at some point in time the market and those participating in the market are going to make a rational decision that say that growth is not everything in this business that you better be able to create a significant value become a low-cost producer and participate and giving back some to the shareholder in that manner as opposed to growth for the sake of growth.","So we're not going to step out on the limb of forecasting three years, four years out into the future because of the variables I could say this that if in fact we forecast some sort of growth out there even though I know we could get it operationally if in fact the market influences is and the macro influence did in a way that would not be prudent from a value consideration to grow into that we would probably get hammered because we cut back on our guidance and we did not allocate the capital to get there.","Even our 2019 program illustrates that we felt like we were prudent and in dialing back our capital spend, dialing back our 2019 guidance to 20% to 25% growth in 2019 which is 25% to 30% growth on a debt adjusted per share basis. And that's of a 2 Bcf plus net production we think that's fairly robust production regardless of what we said earlier.","We think that's fairly productive, but we get reports that have come out and some of the headlines and reports are, guidance and production is light in 2019. Yeah its light okay its only 20%\/25% but we think it's also reasonable to take in consideration the value proposition that Cabot brings to the table.","Doug Leggate","Well appreciate the long answer Dan and I think the debt adjusted metric is the right one to look at your point. My follow-up hopefully a quick one I really just wanted to take a more holistic view as to the free cash flow story here because just obviously extraordinary. I just wonder first of all if and when you get to that 4 Bcf a day what is the sustaining capital look like and [indiscernible] to hold that it seems to me that in your pursuit of obviously trying to create shareholder value may be the market is not looking at you the right way.","Perhaps the free cash annuity story is a very different valuation metric than the E&P story if you like so I\u2019m just curious would you ever consider in some way changing the company structure MLP comes to mind something of that nature not exactly in our form obviously but you get the idea as free cash annuity how do you feel about the current company structure to meet your goal and what would that sustaining capital look like if and when you did get the 4 Bcf gross production number?","Dan Dinges","Yes, great question Doug and certainly directionally, how we try to operate first the maintenance capital that\u2019s required to get to our expected you know our growth trajectory and pick your number of what we have in our guidance or what we have in our current infrastructure capacity of 4 Bcf. Our maintenance capital which is always critical when you talk about an MLP is extremely low when I would venture to say our maintenance capital compared to any other assets out there is unparalleled on what it takes to maintain a level of production.","But it is probably you know here's a swag $650 million to $750 million as a maintenance capital number out there. With that maintenance capital you can use your own back of the envelope numbers of 4 Bcf production profile throw in whatever commodity you want, commodity price you want.","We're going to generate a lot of free cash and to get back to your MLP consideration that cash flow that distribution if you will is something that we are guiding towards in the future. It\u2019s our expectation that we will deliver that return of capital to shareholders and it's our expectation that we are going to manage to a return on capital that we think will - in the long term compete very favorably with the S&P 500 benchmarks that are used out there. And I think, one, a generalist looks at Cabot and it sees that even in a commodity based environment that we would be able to still deliver on a return of capital return on capital, a yield that is competitive and consistently at or above other industries in the 500. I think then we will get a multiple credit that we would all enjoy. And that is kind of our longer term vision that we have.","Doug Leggate","Yes, I guess - again, I appreciate the long answer, Dan. I guess my consideration was more - as you move into a more sustained cash tax-paying position, the free cash story speaks for itself on this. Maybe if I may just one very last quick one. Given how strong everything is in the Marcellus, how do you kind of slowdown or given up on your diversification ambitions, are you quite obvious with what you've got or should we still anticipate updates on the exploration front?","Dan Dinges","Well, yes. You could expect expiration updates and behind the gathering of data that I've referenced in the first quarter of 2019. And as far as our ongoing vision and what we do with our capital, it's compelling and I think incumbent upon myself and the Management team to look at any way that we can continue to enhance shareholder own value. That is a broad open ended what you might do.","However, I think from a street perspective, investor perspective, look back historically on how we made decisions in this Company and I think that you would have to have a little bit of faith that if we do make decisions that we're going to make prudent decisions on how we might spend or allocate available capital.","But it is continuously our effort to not only enhance our lot on shareholder value and how we create value in the future, it's also our obligation to mitigate any kind of risk that we might see out there as far as diversity or one base in consideration.","Again, we've always had that though. We've always had and we've that now for years that consideration because that's how Cabot's been viewed. Again, we haven't jumped to just jump. We have to look at the value consideration, value proposition.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead, Michael,","Michael Hall","Congrats on a solid update. I was curious on a few things, maybe first on the payout side of things has been covered a good bit but how should we think about the relationship to payout of that free cash flow relative to gas prices? Is there any connection there, meaning, as gas prices increased so are you more willing to pay out even higher - materially higher than 30% or lower gas prices environment you hold onto more of it? Is that a reasonable way to think about it or any color on that?","Dan Dinges","Well, there's options available for that. We've kind of guided on a percentage of free cash flow generated and we'll stick with that guidance. You have available if you wanted to speculate, which this is speculation. If you wanted to say, okay, we had a period of time where the commodity prices went up 450 and generated a lot of free cash. Maybe there'd be discussion of a special dividend. But that speculation again on my part, but that's one way you could look at it.","But I think we would still as far as sideboards guide towards a 50% of our free cash flow ","and work within those parameters. But, I think speculation to talk better otherwise.","Michael Hall","And in terms of the payout, like, I mean how about the split between dividends and buybacks, what's your current thought process on that? Obviously one requires a little more maybe commitment than the other I guess from a long term standpoint. What's - like if we were to split the payout, I mean how might that look dividend draw buyback?","Scott Schroeder","We're not going to get granular on that. As we've said before, we like both of those vehicles equally as well. What we don't want to find our self in is being a little too aggressive over a period of time on the dividend and then get caught in a down market that we will periodically have in this industry somewhere out in the future.","So it's a measured approach on the dividend. As you can see, a year ago or so we made a big step change and then we've had a couple smaller increases. We'll be methodical in those increases with the dividend and continue to be mindful of the underlying, what I'll call, firm commitment, that the dividend payment presents before - as we go forward in the future.","As our cash flows continue to expand you could see more dividend increases. But the highlight yesterday is the fact that with this inflection point with all the new pipelines, the infrastructure projects, we're very comfortable moving to the $0.07, which is $0.28 per year right now.","Michael Hall","And then there's some views out on longer dated on the gas market around. Some potential challenges in supply-and-demand that may emerge, call it 2020 plus. As continued supply growth particularly that as a basin Northeast but also in the Northeast potentially overwhelms demand. You guys have a view kind of broadly on long dated supply-and-demand dynamics and then what's the kind of sense or how should we think about that in the context of the free cash flow outlook?","Dan Dinges","I think the supply-and-demand function is going to remain as a topic of conversation. There's going to be a number of impacts I think on both sides. Supply side, I've referenced already at some point, once you get this near term infrastructure build out on the pipelines that have been recently commissioned and the allocation and direction gas is allocated, I think the basin and certainly the Appalachian basin is the largest supply area in the country.","I think there will be some rationalization of how you grow into the future. I don't think there's going to be growth for the sake of growth. And I think there'll be rationalizations. I've said in the past, I think there'll be opportunities for consolidation in the basin. I think to become a lower cost producer I think some are going to maybe require some synergies to be able to get to a point where they deliver acceptable returns to their investors.","But from a demand standpoint, there's going to be demand inflections. The LNGs approval even though there's been delay on LNG, we think that is certainly coming. There's projects that are under construction right now, that's going to have the impact. We think the exports are going to be part of the equation. Not on everybody's radar screen, we think in-basin demand opportunities are going to be in the future.","And when gas is allocated in basin, it kind of doesn't get out there in the market the fact maybe the macro pricing. It's priced maybe as - maybe what we have done with our power plant, priced on a power benchmark versus a NYMEX benchmark.","But there are 26, I think in-basin projects that are being discussed in the Ohio, Pennsylvania area. If you look at all of those 26 projects and you kind of get them up to speed and you commission them along the levels and size that are forecast up there, that's greater than 3.5 Bcf of in-basin demand, that I don't think a lot of people talk about.","And I think that is going to be impactful particularly if you have the rationalizations that we're looking at. So I think the supply-demand balance and being able to manage that is something that industry if acting prudently and accepts the value model a little bit more than growth, I think we'll manage well and I think it'll be managed at a price point that will certainly be attractive for Cabot investors.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jane Trotsenko with Stifel. Please go ahead, Jane.","Jane Trotsenko","My first question is regarding free cash flow. Does your free cash flow guidance include any cash tax refund proceeds, and if it's an organic free cash flow or post dividend free cash flow?","Matthew Kerin","Jane, this is Matt. So our Q4 and 2018 guidance does assume that refund of the empty credit carry forwards. As far as cash taxes in 2019, the current guide assumes that we just have 100% of our income taxes differ but there's no refund.","Jane Trotsenko","And you guys don't include the dividends in that free cash guidance?","Matthew Kerin","We do not.","Jane Trotsenko","It's pre-dividend, right?","Matthew Kerin","That's correct. It's a discretionary cash flow less capital.","Jane Trotsenko","That's perfect. And then the second question is regarding Atlantic Sunrise and its impact on transportation gathering and processing line. I saw that you guys are guiding to kind of flattish per unit transportation gathering and processing expense quarter-over-quarter for 4Q, despite that Atlantic Sunrise has been online since early October. So I'm kind of curious if we should see a pickup in per unit expense in 2019? I was surprised that we didn't see it in 4Q 2018.","Scott Schroeder","No, we're guiding for next year for 2019, $0.66 gathering transport. The reason you don't see that pick up in our gathering transport line is that we are netting transportation costs for the sales on Atlantic Sunrise against the realized pricing. So if you go and look for instance in our guidance slides for Q4, you'll see that the volumes that are reaching trans goes on $0.69 New York, they're actually deducting around $0.65 from those to account for the transport deduct. So it's already accounted for in our $0.30 differential guidance for 2019.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dan Dinges, for any closing remarks.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Shaun, and thanks for the questions. And I am pleased that there are a number of questions that we've received directed towards the value model that Cabot is putting forth. Again to reiterate we do look forward to continuing our same style of managing our balance sheet and how we allocate capital. We'll have a focus on value and what it does for our shareholders. So, thanks again and look forward to catching up on the next quarterly teleconference and year-end teleconference. Thank you, Shaun.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Dinges, Chairman, President, and CEO. Please go ahead.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kate, and thank you all for joining us this morning for the second quarter earnings call. With me today, as usual, are several members of the executive team. Before we start, let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward statements do apply to my comments today.","First, I'd like to touch upon a few financial and operating highlights from the second quarter that were outlined in this morning's press release. Equivalent net production for the second quarter was 1,516 million cubic foot equivalent per day. Our quarterly results reflect the impact of our previously announced strategic decision to reduce our production levels during the quarter as a result of the lower price realizations throughout Appalachia. We estimate that we reduced our gross production volumes by approximately 500 million cubic foot per day during the quarter.","Despite this significant reduction in volumes during the second quarter, the company's equivalent production for the first half of 2015 increased 25% as compared to the first half of 2014 and the company's liquid production for the first half of 2015 increased 95% relative to the first half of 2014.","The company generated a net loss of $0.07 per share for the quarter. However, when adjusting for select items including a $36.5 million non-cash mark-to-market loss on derivatives, Cabot generated adjusted earnings of $0.03 per share. Operating cash flow, discretionary cash flow and EBITDAX were $171 million, $183 million, $204 million respectively. All of these financial metrics were lower relative to the second quarter of 2014 primarily as a result of a 38% decline in realized natural gas prices and a 43% decline in realized oil prices.","Moving to specific comments regarding the Marcellus. As I mentioned, in light of the continued weakness in Appalachian pricing, we curtailed a significant level of volumes in the Marcellus during the second quarter. And we plan to continue this strategy into the third quarter as we await potential improvement in pricing in the fourth quarter with the addition of new takeaway capacity and stronger winter demand. While our marketing team continues to take advantage of short-term opportunities to improve netbacks in the Marcellus, there are limitations on the pricing front in the near term as we await some of the larger, more impactful projects like Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise pipelines.","However, we continue to accomplish our ongoing focus of enhancing margins by improving the cost side of our operations through efficiencies, and also with cost reductions. Drilling operations in the Marcellus continue to set new records for the company. Our SPUD to SPUD cycle time during the quarter was under 15 days as compared to approximately 19 days for full-year 2014 due in large part to new highs established for gross feet drilled per day during the quarter. As a result of these efficiencies, we have seen a 15% reduction in cost at rig release year-to-date. We anticipate further cost reductions as we move into 2016 as two rig contracts will expire in December of this year, and our expectations are for a significant reduction in day rates going forward.","On the completion side of our operations, we have been successful in working with our service providers to realize additional cost reductions. All of these drilling and completion efficiencies and savings have allowed us to achieve the lower end or slightly below our $6 million to $6.5 million range for a completed well cost.","I would like to highlight that our wells placed on production year-to-date in 2015 are tracking our industry's best type curve of 3.6 Bcf per thousand feet, highlighting the consistency of our wells throughout our lease position.","Regarding pricing, our second quarter natural gas realizations were $2.15 per Mcf which is $0.49 below the average NYMEX for the quarter, an improvement relative to the $0.52 differential in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of hedges, our realizations were $0.89 below NYMEX.","Assuming the regional differentials we observed in the second quarter persist in the third quarter, we anticipate that Cabot's third quarter price realizations will be somewhere between $0.95 and $1.05 below NYMEX before the impact of hedges. Additionally, we anticipate another $0.30 to $0.35 per Mcf uplift in realized prices from our hedges based on the current strip. If you want more details on the split of our pricing exposure by index, check out our guided slide on the website.","Similar to the second quarter, we expect to produce between 1.55 Bcf and 1.6 Bcf per day of gross production in the Marcellus during the third quarter. We will continue to be patient as we anticipate a better opportunity to move additional volumes in the local market. We firmly believe that stronger demand and improved price realizations for Cabot are on the horizon, and we will continue to be disciplined in our approach to managing through this lower price environment as we have through all the commodity cycles.","The bottom line is that we remain focused on improving margins and returns and maximizing long-term value, which I believe is evident by our ability to continue to efficiently grow our production and reserves in this low price environment without straining our balance sheet or issuing equity. This clearly sets us apart in the industry.","In the Eagle Ford, couple of comments there. Our second quarter volumes were flat to our first quarter volumes despite decreasing our rig count to one and slowing down our completion activity. Our efficiencies in the field continue to improve as we have decreased our drilling days by about 20% relative to 2014 and increased the average number of completions per day by about 20%.","As a reminder, much of our activity in the first half of the year was driven by near-term primary lease terms and continuous development obligations. Given that we have already met the majority of these obligations for 2015, we only plan to operate one rig during the second half of the year. We still anticipate exiting the year with over 20 wells waiting on completion.","We frequently get asked at what price we would look to accelerate our completion activity in the Eagle Ford. Despite the significant reduction in cost that we have achieved, upwards of 30% across all service lines, we do not believe that allocating incremental capital in the Eagle Ford is the prudent investment decision in this oil price environment, especially given the implied increases in cash flow deficit that would result from the increased spending.","Okay. let's move to Constitution Pipeline update. During our first quarter teleconference, we highlighted the additional progress that was made regarding our efforts to finalize the permit process for Constitution. Today we can continue that update with the following. Constitution filed its implementation plan with the FERC on May 19, 2015. This was a critical step documenting how Constitution will comply with the environmental conditions placed in the FERC order and it's the last step prior to the FERC issuing its Notice to Proceed regarding construction. Also, Constitution is now providing a weekly update to the FERC. Constitution filed its final reroute variance report also with the FERC last week. This completes all outstanding issues regarding the route, and Constitution now has 100% of the required right of ways.","Regarding the New York DEC, our understanding is the last reroute that I just mentioned was one of the final loose ends prior to their issuance of 401 water quality permit. Therefore, our expectations are that we are very close to wrapping up and completing all remaining New York DEC outstanding issues. In summary, we continue to make important progress and remain optimistic that we will receive final clearance so that we can begin construction this fall and place the project into service during the second half of 2016.","Regarding our third quarter guidance, production guidance included in the press release this morning implies approximately 1.5 Bcfe per day of net equivalent production at the midpoint. Natural gas guidance for the quarter is unchanged relative to second quarter guidance, while the midpoint of our liquid volumes we reduced by 1,500 barrels per day as a result of the slowdown in completion activity that we have discussed previously due to front-end loaded capital program resulting from drilling obligations in the first half of the year.","We have remained our 2015 full-year production growth guidance range of 10% to 18%. If we were to hold the midpoint of our third quarter guidance flat into the fourth quarter, we would achieve the low end of our full-year guidance. However, we do anticipate at least a moderate ramp in our Marcellus volumes in the fourth quarter in response to seasonal winter demand.","Our capital program for 2015 remains unchanged at $900 million. We have received a few questions about our program spending this year, so I'd like to take a brief moment to clarify our guidance. The $900 million for 2015 refers to the capital associated with activity incurred in 2015 for this year's operating plan. However, because of the timing gap between activity incurred and payments for services, we have had cash outflows this year associated with activity incurred in 2014.","And because of the significant decline in capital spending year-over-year, we are in a position this year where cash outflows on the cash flow statement will be higher than our capital guidance for the year. The majority of this impact occurred in the first half of the year where the capital incurred for 2015 activity was $540 million, but the capital expenditure on the cash flow statement were approximately $660 million. The $550 million incurred in the first half of the year for our 2015 program is approximately 60% of our full-year guidance which is, in fact, below the 65% guidance we provided last quarter.","Our unit cost guidance for the year remains unchanged. However, I would highlight that year-to-date cash unit costs were $1.25 per Mcf, $0.07 below the midpoint of our full-year guidance. This includes a $0.85 per Mcf cash unit cost in the Marcellus and a $15 per barrel cash unit cost in the Eagle Ford. While we are pleased with these low costs, the mandate the organization has is to continue to focus on further improving our cost structure.","As for 2016, we're still in the planning phase and we'll have more detail to provide on the third quarter call in October once we've had an opportunity to fully vet our plans with the board, including an updated review of our five-year plan. Based on a preliminary look at the five-year plan, we are extremely excited about the long-term value created by our Marcellus asset as we begin to assess more favorable price markets which will allow Cabot to not only accelerate production and cash flow growth, but also significantly improve corporate-wide margins and returns.","In summary, we continue to focus on improving efficiencies, reducing cost and increasing our margins, with an emphasis on maximizing the long-term value of this top-tier portfolio we have. In the near term we remain optimistic about Constitution construction beginning in the fall and remain confident in the second half of 2016 in-service date. Additionally, we are pleased with the progress being made on the Atlantic Sunrise pipeline which is another important step in our strategy to monetize our low-cost Marcellus assets at premium prices. Lastly, we will continue to be disciplined through this low commodity price environment with an emphasis on managing the balance sheet and protecting returns and margins.","Kate, with those brief comments, I'll be happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, Dan. Good morning, everybody.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I've got a couple, if I may, Dan. First of all, thanks for the clarification on Constitution, but I guess it's a tough question to answer, but when Atlantic Sunrise and Constitution and so on are where you expect to them to be, let's say, a year or so from now, what do you think the steady state differential for Cabot is going to look like?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The commissioning or two years after the commissioning, it's not...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No \u2013 well \u2013 yeah, well, what I really mean is when all is said and done, if you want to think about the long-term sustainable basic discount, if you like, or transport discount, what \u2013 I know it's a tough question to answer, but just order of magnitude compared to the kind of dollar you're getting to in Q3, I mean, where does it get to in your mind when you don't have the bottlenecks that you have in place today?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It is a good question. Again, it's one that we have made a specific effort to clarify. In fact, we have commissioned a third party recently and engaged them, had them evaluate the entire space out there, looking at every aspect of the market on the supply side, the demand side, looking at the North America market as a whole, the macro market as a whole.","And then narrowing down to Cabot specific and the parts of that dynamic, supply-demand dynamic that would affect Cabot. We have reviewed that study, and we have incorporated the findings \u2013 excuse me, of that study in our first effort towards our five-year plan. And we are building and fleshing out that five-year plan to present at our board meeting in October.","The early look of this third-party assessment and analysis of the dynamics in the market and where Cabot's realizations would be as we work through this five-year plan is that at \u2013 towards the end of that five-year plan and as you commission some of the infrastructure, and you look at some of the demand dynamics that were specific in the study, we get to a very low differential to a positive differential to NYMEX.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate the full answer. My follow-up just also, a little quicker, Dan. Hedging for 2016, I don't think there's anything in place right now. Just thoughts on that and I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Hedging is going to be just subject to what the market will yield. Right now, in looking at the strip, we don't see anything in the strip that would have us place any incremental hedges on at this point in time. But as an ongoing part of our business, we continue to be interested in placing hedges. And historically, we've always liked to be between 25% to 75% hedged depending on what the market would give us. So, it is going to be and will continue to be part of our program. We just don't see that opportunity today.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks again.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","The next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth of BMO. Please go ahead.","Phil J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Phillip.","Phil J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Last quarter, you had discussed the possibility of Constitution displacing volumes from some of the weaker price indexes, but also achieving 50% returns at a $2 realized gas price. So would we be right to assume that the threshold for displacing volumes is below $2 an Mcf? Or could you take a view that it's NPV accretive, play it for higher prices?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're going to evaluate the market upon the commissioning of Constitution, and how I've had to answer the question with uncertainty in what the market is going to be at that snapshot in time on the commissioning. What we've said is that we're going to have a program that would allow flexibility in displacing or adding incrementally to our growth profile in placing the 0.5 Bcf a day into Constitution.","Or in fact, if the market is challenged at that point in time, we've talked about just displacing, taking volumes off the pipes that we're selling into today and moving that 0.5 Bcf into the Constitution Pipeline. So, that decision in how we fill the line and flow into Constitution will be made based on market parameters. We have not discussed and I'm not prepared to discuss whether it's at a $2 benchmark or not on how we would handle our commissioning of Constitution.","Phil J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But certainly our objective is to \u2013 and I'm extremely confident that the commissioning of Constitution is going to enhance our overall price realizations.","Phil J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. And I appreciate the update on Constitution. I was also hoping that you could discuss some of the key milestones to watch for, for Atlantic Sunrise over the next 12 months to 18 months.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Phillip. I'm going to let Jeff Hutton, who's our VP of Marketing, to discuss where that project is. Good question, because it's a great project for us.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Yeah, Phillip. So far so good on the Atlantic Sunrise front. I think there's been a lot of progress that came right out of the box. There is \u2013 as you know, we've already filed the application for the project. There's already been quite a bit of boots on the ground in terms of community outreach and run past all of the open houses for example.","At this point, we continue to purchase right of way and options on right of way. I think if I recall, the survey permission level is above the 80% number at this point, which is \u2013 if you kind of go back to when we started pre-filing that's quite a lot of \u2013 accomplished in a short period of time. So, things look good in \u2013 for Atlantic Sunrise, particularly, as you know, the project is 100% in the State of Pennsylvania. And there's quite a bit of effort from a manpower resource perspective on Atlantic Sunrise and we feel good about it right now.","Phil J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks a lot.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Phillip.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Dan and everyone else. Thanks for taking my questions.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet, David.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I'm just hoping to get a reconfirmation on the Leidy Southeast Expansion, is that still expected to be in service by the end of the year?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Jeff?","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Yes. That's a December 1 in-service date. And we understand that the Greenfield portion of that, the new pipe looping has been completed and now it's some adjustments to compressor stations and I think away we go.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","We should see, I guess, a benefit from the firm sales that you'll have going on once that expansion is complete in terms of basis.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Yes. That's correct. The \u2013 two things. The capacity that's been created on Leidy Southeast, the 525,000 a day is \u2013 was a market poll project, so you'll have a new area to market the Leidy Line production or receive gas into, about 0.5 Bcf a day, we think that's going to benefit Leidy Line pricing as a whole. In addition to that, Cabot has some long-term sales that will kick in December 1, when the project starts. And the sales are more related to the market area than the supply area, so they will benefit our realizations.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful color, Jeff. Thank you. And, Dan, if I might ask about Wood County. Is there any update on your thoughts around there in Utica activity? I know you said on past calls that you're kind of evaluating the area out there one way or the other. Can you give us any color on what you're looking out there now?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, with our effort being exploratory in nature, we're usually cautious when it comes to discussing exploration efforts. And our position in West Virginia as you head around Wood County and as you head south, we have a fairly significant acreage position throughout West Virginia. We have almost 1 million acres in West Virginia. So, we do have an ongoing exploration effort looking at the deeper section. We have drilled a deeper test south of Wood County and we are flowing that well just to get a test. It's a vertical well. Just to look at a section. We also have some additional section to look at in addition to what we're flowing back right now.","And we have another area that we are \u2013 there are a couple of areas that we're continuing to look at that we think has exploratory opportunity anyway. We don't have anything we could add as far as color, David, that would say here's our next development program at this stage. But we do have acreage that's HBP in these areas, we do have B minerals in the areas that we're looking and we have enough reason to believe that it merits further capital at some point in time.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. So it might merit your own capital or someone else's capital?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're going to spend our own capital at this stage.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for the color, Dan. I'll get back in queue.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks, David.","Operator","The next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Yes, good morning, Dan, and to the rest of your team there.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I wanted, if I could, to ask you a bit about what kind of circumstances or what are the pieces you're foreseeing to bring some of these volumes that you voluntarily curtailed up back on. I think Jeff already talked about that Leidy Southeast Expansion coming on December 1 and your firm sales there, so that will be a piece of the step-up in volumes for Q4. But to the extent you're willing to share, can you talk about at the margin what kind of local pricing you would need to see on that Leidy Line to open up some of the chokes and reduce your gathering pressure?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Charles, we're not going to get in price specific. And I'll flip it over to Jeff to talk about the dynamics of the market. What we would hope to see, though, that would influence us to open up some of the wells more so than they are today would be just the seasonal dynamics that we anticipate rolling into the winter period. We also have a couple of things that Jeff had mentioned and he can flesh those out. But as far as being price specific, we're not just going to get price specific at this stage on what we might do on bringing additional volumes on.","But, Jeff, would you \u2013 yeah.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Sure. Yeah, I think the market dynamics of worst-case have bottomed out and we're seeing some optimism in the marketplace, not to the point where gas is going to come back on, but we're certainly gearing up for a better fourth quarter. And for the winter, we have some utility sales that kick in in the winter that aren't around in the summer for feeding load. And we mentioned Leidy Southeast. We have another project that we're involved in, the Columbia East Side Expansion, which adds well over 50,000 (30:46) a day shipper on that project.","So in terms of the three pipes we're currently producing on, Millennium, Tennessee, and Transco, we've seen some other volumes curtail up there and we've seen some decline. So we're optimistic that we'll see better days ahead in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2016.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks for the detail, Jeff. And, Dan, certainly understood that you don't want to talk individual or specific price. But if I could go back, Dan, to one of your prepared comments on the CapEx picture, and that's definitely helpful, the detail on the CapEx incurred versus your cash flow CapEx.","But just taking your $540 million for the first half 2015 CapEx incurred, you're still looking like a pretty significant drop for a run rate for the back half of the year. And I'm wondering if you could maybe offer some commentary, you're keeping four rigs running, but you have that CapEx dropping. Is that a function of deferring more completions on that? I know you gave us your drill to complete count at year end, but how does that look from your perspective? How are you going to get to that reduced CapEx run rate?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's exactly what it is, Charles. We have guided that we would have the 20 wells or so in the Eagle Ford and we've also guided that we would have 45 wells in the Marcellus and that's anywhere from probably 1,200 to, I don't know, 1,400 or so stages that we have at the end of the year.","And it is our plan to sometime between now and the end of the year, for example, in the Eagle Ford, we would plan to cycle out the frac crew that we have right now and then bring that frac crew back in towards the latter part of the year in the Eagle Ford. And we would anticipate sliding some of the frac stages that we have in the Marcellus to the beginning of 2016 also. So you're exactly right on the management of our capital discipline is going to be through completions for the most part.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful, Dan. Thanks a lot.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Subash Chandra of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning, Dan. I was hoping you could break down that five-year study with a potential impact of Constitution only. And then I guess you talked to the Constitution plus the Atlantic Sunrise, but is it possible to talk about what that study is saying about the Constitution impact on differentials? And I guess the second part of that question is, did that differential outlook include what are presumably higher transport expenses which are a different line item, or was it all-inclusive?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, to answer the last part of that first, the study was an extensive study. It utilized all the available data out there, certainly integrated all of the positions that were out there that you can see and the different crags (34:50) and different positions and different guidances and expectations out there. So it was a fully encompassing study.","In regard to the Constitution diffs, I mean, you can look at Constitution today and look at what the prices of that index is on Iriquois and you can look at today and look at the difference compared to what we're receiving right now on those three pipes. So, there is a significant uptick that we anticipate being able to capture with that 0.5 Bcf moving into Constitution.","In regard to the transportation, we certainly take all of that in consideration when we look at what our realizations are. So, with a roll-forward in the five-year model and looking at then Atlantic Sunrise, we have 850 million a day in the Atlantic Sunrise. We have all of those volumes already sold, and we have 300 million of that \u2013 350 million of that sold to Cove Point, Sumitomo in Cove Point under a contract and we have the remaining portions of that allocated already also. Those price points are going to be outside of the price points we're currently exposed to.","So rolling forward again, putting together in the middle of our five-year plan as you might suspect because we're just now getting a lot of this data in and digesting a lot of this data and building our operations model around the expectations and macro market, but rolling forward and looking at the price points, we're going to be able to achieve and the volumes we can move to those price points, we think that our price realizations will be above the NYMEX towards the end of this five-year period.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","That was great. Thanks. And to follow up, just real quick. Can you just comment on the number of completions in the second quarter, Marcellus and Eagle Ford?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, on the Eagle Ford, in the third quarter \u2013 I'm not going to go with the rest of the year. But in the third quarter, I think we have about five wells we're going to complete. And I don't have that number in the Marcellus. But it's going to be a similar number that we had in the second quarter. And I want to say that's probably going to be 18, 20 type wells.","Subash Chandra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right. Got it. Thank you very much.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","The next question comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Co. Please go ahead.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Pearce.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Dan, as you peer into 2016, do you think that you can keep CapEx flat year-over-year and grow production? I think, in the past you mentioned that maintenance CapEx was around $600 million, $700 million.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We \u2013 yeah. We think we can grow production at the same capital exposure. We think we can also \u2013 the volumes that we're capable of producing today, which is over 2 Bcf, we think we could quite frankly reduce the capital we have in the \u2013 we're spending in the Marcellus this year and maintain a flat production profile for slightly better than 2 Bcf a day.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Great. Thank you for that. Then my follow-up, can you remind me of the stream-crossing window and tree-cutting windows for the construction process for Constitution.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Jeff, why don't you...","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Yes. Pearce, the stream crossings are June 1 through September. And the tree clearing is October 1 through March.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","And so, Jeff, if you were able to get the permits from the New York DEC relatively soon, I know you said second half 2016 \u2013 I don't know if you want to get this granular, but when you take all that in to account, do you think it's a more kind of a late 3Q or 4Q of 2016?","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Yeah. At this point, we're sticking with the second half of 2015.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Pearce, what I think is going to happen is that hopefully we'll get the approval from the DEC. Again, we know that we have continued to be as transparent as the information is available to us, but we would hope to get the DEC approval. What we would also expect is that some of the stream crossings we think we can complete in \u2013 prior to the September closure period for open cuts and streams. But I don't know and I don't think that we could get all of those stream crossings done prior to September. Some of it depends on weather and certainly some of it is based on the timing the DEC gets out there.","We did change our capital allocation number a little bit from \u2013 reduced it from 70 to 38 I think as \u2013 with our assumption that how much we're going to be able to do on those stream- crossings in 2015 versus 2016. But coming out of the 2016 \u2013 into 2016, the beginning of the summer of 2016, depending on how many stream crossings we have remaining, if we have some remaining, we anticipate to start immediately on those, complete those, and then the project would then \u2013 could be commissioned following that.","Keep in mind during this period of time, it's the stream crossings that have these sideboards on them. The rest of the pipeline, we can keep continuing the tie-in and do all of those things that we have to do. It's just those stream crossings and tying in those pinch points on the streams that we're juggling in the schedule. So, sometime \u2013 if we have stream crossing sometime after the June period, depending on how many and when we hook those up, will dictate when we can commission the pipeline.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Thank you, Dan. Very helpful.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Pearce.","Operator","The next question comes from Phillips Johnston of Capital One. Please go ahead.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks. I just wanted to clarify the quarterly cadence of the Eagle Ford completions this year. I think the plan was to complete 40 to 45 wells. And I think you completed 20 in the first quarter. I think you said you expect five wells in the third quarter. What was the second quarter number again? I think I missed that one.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Steve Lindeman is in here also.","Steven W. Lindeman - Vice President-Engineering & Technology","See, we completed in the second quarter about 350 stages, and so we had about 13 wells in the second quarter.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then if we look at liquid volumes, I guess you were flat for the quarter sequentially. Looking at the guidance, it sort of implies mid- to high-single digit sequential declines in both Q3 and Q4 with that one rig program. I'm wondering what you guys estimate is your natural PDP decline rate in the Eagle Ford if no activity is assumed.","Steven W. Lindeman - Vice President-Engineering & Technology","Well, that's a good question. I would say that the blended rate would probably be in the 15% range in terms of decline. We'll look at that more carefully at yearend. But that's what I would I guess right now.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just one more if I could. Last quarter, you guys noted that 10 wells that were drilled on the new acreage in Eagle Ford were sort of tracking 50% above your type curve. Can you give us an update on how those wells are holding up now relative to the curve? And of the 13 completions you had in the second quarter, can you tell us how many of those were on the new acreage?","Steven W. Lindeman - Vice President-Engineering & Technology","Yeah. I would say a significant number of the 13 were on the new acreage. The ones that we've got, I would say, 60 to 90 days' worth of history, we're very, very confident in how they're producing and they look like we indicated right in with their expectations. And obviously, the new wells, we're still monitoring how they're coming online.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Phillip, one thing that I would add is that in looking at the production profile and our deliveries, one of the things that you have to take in consideration, and it is a variable, is it's dependent upon what pad site we are fracking, when we \u2013 how many days we stay on that pad site, and how much production and the type of wells that we shut in, offsetting that pad site during the cycle does affect your production volumes for that brief quarterly calculation. So, you have to take that in consideration also.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.","Thank you, Dan.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Drew.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I was hoping you could \u2013 Dan, if you could expand a little bit more on the Utica acreage you mentioned \u2013 or West Virginia, I'm sorry. Could you talk about how much is prospective for Utica or if you have a sense for that?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Being exploratory and looking at what we're doing, everybody is aware there is \u2013 the deep Rome Trough runs through the middle of West Virginia. We have a significant amount of acreage on this Rome Trough. It is a deep section, predominantly unexplored, and very few penetrations into that deep section. So we have, not just the Utica section, but other sections that we would look at in West Virginia. I might also add that, certainly, our Utica opportunities, as we move to the east, in Pennsylvania and under our Susquehanna properties, we think we have Utica in that particular area of our portfolio also. So, in summary, we're looking at not only what Utica potential there would be, but other section that might be an opportunity in the Rome trough in West Virginia. But we're also looking at different section and will look at different section at some point in time in our Susquehanna acreage.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And is that something that \u2013 the Rome trough, would that get a fair amount of capital in 2016? Or is it still be determined? I mean, is there plans to test that near term I guess really is the question.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. 2016 and looking at what percentage of our capital will be allocated to exploratory is still in the works. We are \u2013 we do a bottoms-up build, we look at our program, we look at the landing area that we would want to achieve on our production. And certainly, that is in concert, and it will continue to be in concert with the macro-infrastructure aspects. And then we would \u2013 then as not an afterthought, but as not as high a priority look at the cash flow and our available cash to allocate on exploration programs and we dovetail into that any lost opportunities we would have if we didn't allocate capital, both on our development areas and our exploratory efforts.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just a follow-up on that in Susquehanna for the Utica, if you can compare for us the Utica rock in that area versus the Marcellus of a similar thickness and rock quality?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I can't yet, we haven't drilled it. But I would say from our deeper mapping and carrying some of the Utica drilling that's been done in Tioga and looking at that section, that section there is a couple of hundred feet thick. And certainly we are modeling an eastern extension of that Utica. And we think we have some equivalent thicknesses and we think we have similar maturities and TOCs as seen in the Tioga area.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Dan. That's very helpful.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Drew.","Operator","The next question is from Eric Otto of CLSA Americas. Please go ahead.","Eric Otto - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning. Could you give us just an update on the Corps of Engineers Section 404 permit status?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Eric. I'll let Jeff go over that.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Yeah, so when the State of Pennsylvania issued their 401 permit and what we're waiting on with New York on their 401 permit, that essentially is what enables the U.S. Corps of Engineers to issue their 404 permit. So it's the data coming out of the New York 401 permit that is missing. And our understanding is it's a supplemental addition for the U.S. Corps to add to their 404 permit and that permit generally comes out just a few weeks after all the information is received.","Eric Otto - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, thank you.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Eric.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","With the sharp move down in valuations in the forward curve, what are your latest thoughts on willingness to add to positions? And would you consider adding in Appalachia or be more focused on oilier assets, if at all?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a good question. We have continued to run our operation with the primary focus of maximizing returns, as I've said, and the efficiencies, trying to protect the margins or improve our margins. We think in this environment that a good strong balance sheet and one that affords the greatest flexibility not only allows you to conduct your operations prudently and allows you to manage from a position of strength, but if there is an opportunity that presents itself, then we're certainly in a great physical and financial position to take advantage of it.","As far as looking at the two commodities, looking at oil, gas, we're really returns-focused and we feel like that is going to remain our focus. You can get into the discussion about how you would want to look at a more diverse program, add a little bit more oil to our program, obviously diversify us a little bit. But I've been in the business a long time, Brian, and looked at these different cycles that we've gone through. And our view of our crystal ball rolling forward for our position in the natural gas space and what we think we can do with improved infrastructure, we think we're going to be able to deliver extremely strong returns with our natural gas position.","And we think it is going to be with our crystal ball look at the liquid side of the business that natural gas liquids are going to be challenged for an extended period of time. And we think that on the oil side, it's such a dynamic market with the international influence that affects the oil market, that crystal ball is not, in my opinion, I'm not as confident as what the oil price is going to do as I am what I see available to us on the natural gas side.","So with that being said, we're focused in natural gas, we'll remain focused in natural gas. If we have the opportunity to improve our liquids position, it's going to have to compete with what our view is long term in natural gas.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. And then secondly, you may have mentioned this before, in which case apologies. But are you still planning to have the wells needed to source your 500 Mcf a day Constitution commitment drilled but not completed by yearend? And how are you thinking about the merits of completing those wells in 2016 versus keeping them in inventory?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, our position on Constitution still remains to have the flexibility to add incrementally to our growth position, but also a decision that we could just displace our level of production at the time of the Constitution commissioning and transfer those volumes to Constitution. So it is our intent to manage our completion schedule in light of what we see as the commissioning date of Constitution. And the macro market is going to dictate a little bit how we respond. To our filling of Constitution, that will absolutely happen regardless of what the macro market is doing, but the macro market would influence is it going to be incremental or is it going to be just a displacement initially.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry I can't be any more specific than that. We are going to look at the market at that time and make the call.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm sure we'll ask again next quarter. Thank you.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's all right, Brian.","Operator","And the next question comes from David Beard of Coker Palmer. Please go ahead.","David E. Beard - Coker and Palmer Investment Securities, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, David.","David E. Beard - Coker and Palmer Investment Securities, Inc.","A lot of detailed questions have been answered so I wanted to hear your thoughts, big picture, really back to the very first question of this call relative to differentials. It seems people in the industry, you and others in the Marcellus are fairly optimistic, two, three, four years out on differentials, narrowing down pretty substantially, while there's \u2013 it seems like many financial players are saying the differential is going to stay at $1 or more relative to transportation costs. I'd just like to hear your thoughts about why there is such a, I guess a variant view relative to what takeaway capacity can ultimately do to differentials? Thanks.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, David. I think the market is going to be \u2013 is going to continue to be diverse. I don't think differentials are going to be equal across all spaces. I think differentials will be \u2013 continue to be subject to \u2013 even in the longer term, will continue to be subject to gas-on-gas competition. In our specific instance, what we see is getting to price points and to areas in the market that we feel like will have the demand side of the equation matching the supply side and the ability for just that amount of gas to get to different price points. Constitution, as an example, we're going to be able to move gas, not only south from Wright Station, but we're also going to be able to move gas north into Canada from that position.","We also would hope to be able to move gas to a different price point when the Atlantic Sunrise comes on. Cove Point is a unique project for us and the differentials that are attached to that project are basically part of a contractual \u2013 a confidential contractual arrangement. So we feel confident about what our realizations are going to be on that marketing of that volume of gas. We also have a price point set at the 500 million, the remaining 500 million of the Atlantic Sunrise volume.","So, in looking out where we are, we just feel in looking at point-specific areas that the narrowing of the differential seems to \u2013 and tying it to the demand situations in those areas and at that particular \u2013 those particular price points, we just feel confident that the volume of gas that can get to those price points is going to measure up to the demand that we see.","In other areas, to your point, David, on some of the modeling out there has \u2013 still has differentials of $0.50 a dollar. There might be areas that have those type of differentials and those are going to be areas that have ongoing bottlenecks where gas-on-gas competition is not going to be able to get the volumes of gas out that are on the supply side to reach the demand areas and there could be those specific areas that have those type of differentials.","What our \u2013 and kind of to your to point, David, that was part of the reason why we commissioned a unique independent study for Cabot's behalf to answer some of those questions on the market dynamics from a macro sense and also a micro sense on its effect on Cabot, and where we're moving our gas.","David E. Beard - Coker and Palmer Investment Securities, Inc.","All right. Good. I appreciate the color and thank you for the time.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, David.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kate. And thanks for all the questions. The focus remains on the macro market as it probably should at this period of time. I think everybody is clear that our operation will deliver the volumes into the market. But certainly I've been in this business over 30 years. I've seen a lot of cycles. And this is one of those draconian down markets. But I do reflect back on what we have available in our program, what our market will be able to \u2013 what our properties will be able to yield and what our program will yield.","And I'm very confident if we get these pipes out and we get to the markets that are available to us at the end of the pipes that we already have in progress that Cabot's outlook for the future, and when you look at this five-year plan, Cabot is going to be a company that's going to deliver significant growth. It's going to deliver that significant growth with the realizations I think we'll see with a free cash flow program. And we are going to be able to generate a significant level of free cash.","So with that, I appreciate everybody's patience. I understand the frustrations with this type of market, but I can assure you that there are better days ahead.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ericson, and thank you all for joining this morning for Cabot's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I have today with me several members of the executive team. Before we start, let me do say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements included in this morning's press release applies to my comments on today's call. Cabot's second quarter results highlight our ability to deliver production growth while also generating positive free cash flow even in a low commodity price environment. We believe this characteristic sets us apart from most of our industry peers.","Cabot averaged 1.67 Bcfe per day of net production during the quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015. This increase was driven by 14% increase in our Marcellus production volumes as compared to the prior-year comparable quarter. Despite a realized natural gas price of only $1.63 per Mcf, we generated positive free cash flow for the quarter and we anticipate that the company will be able to deliver a more meaningful level of free cash flow during the second half of the year based on current strip prices.","Natural gas realizations did improve by 9% sequentially, as compared to the first quarter of the year, due in part to a significant improvement in local basis differential during the quarter. Before the impact of derivatives, Cabot's realizations were $0.40 below the average NYMEX settle price of $1.95 during the quarter, as compared to $0.60 below the average NYMEX settlement price in the first quarter. While basis differentials have subsequently widened in the third quarter due to a significant increase in the NYMEX prices, the good news is that we are forecasting much higher price realizations during the second half of the year, resulting in more free cash flow for the year than originally forecast. This increase in expected cash flows has allowed for the introduction of a second frac crew in the Marcellus for a portion of the second half of the year, which will help give us a jumpstart on 2017 production.","Using the current five-year forward curve for Leidy Line, which is a good proxy for the most punitive pricing a portion of our Marcellus production receives, our well level internal rate of returns are over 100% and our PV-10s are approximately $14 million. I cannot think of another asset that generates those economics in the current price environment, and therefore, we feel extremely comfortable about slightly increasing our levels of operating activity beginning with this additional frac crew.","The second quarter results also demonstrate our continued emphasis on cost control with unit costs declining by 12% compared to the prior-year comparable quarter, and 2% compared to the first quarter of this year. We have now delivered a sequential decline in unit costs for 12 of the last 13 quarters and expect this trend to continue, further improving our industry-leading cost structure.","Our balance sheet remains extremely strong with over $500 million of cash on hand and a net-debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of only 1.8 times at quarter-end. Based on our current forecast, we anticipate de-levering between now and year-end while our current liquidity of $2.2 billion should continue to improve, given our outlook for positive free cash flow in the second half of the year. This financial flexibility will serve us well as we formulate our plans for 2017 and beyond.","In the Marcellus, we continue to operate one drilling rig, and as mentioned, have recently added a second frac crew to accelerate the completion of our DUC inventory, which will allow for an acceleration of production in the first quarter of 2017. During the quarter, we drilled seven wells, completed eight wells, and placed 12 wells on production. The average lateral length for the seven wells drilled during the second quarter was approximately 7,000 feet. However, given that all the wells, 100% of the wells we placed on production year-to-date were drilled in 2015, and the average lateral length was a little bit shorter and closer to 6,000 feet.","The good news is that we should continue improvements in capital efficiency in 2017, as we've began placing on production the longer lateral wells from this year program. On the production front, we averaged approximately 1.54 Bcf per day of net production for the Marcellus during the quarter, which was slightly below the midpoint of our expectations due to unscheduled downtime related to infrastructure maintenance in the region. Had we not experienced this downtime, we would have eclipsed the high end of our production guidance range for the quarter. Unfortunately, July production volumes have also been impacted somewhat by outages on Transco for the majority of the month. However, we are confident that we'll be able to keep production levels flat to the second quarter based on our plans of placing 12 wells on production during the third quarter.","On the operations front, our drilling team continues to capture more efficiency gains, which was evident by a new record for drilling days during the quarter of approximately nine days for spud to TD, and 13 days for spud to spud. We also drilled our longest Marcellus well today, with a total measured depth of over 18,000 feet and a lateral length of over 10,000 feet, which the schedule will be completed in 2017.","A brief comment on our Eagle Ford Shale. Despite a significant reduction in our Eagle Ford operating activity, including no wells drilled and only three wells completed during the quarter, our oil volumes for the second quarter exceeded our guidance due to outperformance from the newer wells that were placed on production. Given that our last Eagle Ford well was placed on production in May, we are not placing any wells on production during the third quarter, we are forecasting declines in our oil production volumes for the remainder of the year which is in line with our original plan.","At this point in time, based on our current outlook for oil prices, our plan is to continue to allocate a minimum amount of capital to our Eagle Ford assets and instead focus on arresting base declines, meeting our leasehold obligations, and waiting for our slightly higher oil price environment before allocating any additional capital to this asset. I would highlight that even in today's prices, our returns in Eagle Ford far exceed our cost of capital; but given the much higher returns we see in the Marcellus, we believe the best place for additional capital today is in Susquehanna County.","As you may all be aware, Cabot is directly involved with multiple pipeline ventures that focus on our growth opportunities over the next several years. I would like to provide a few updates and comments on the progress of these important infrastructure projects since our last call. Regarding Constitution, our initial appellate brief was filed on July 12, 2016 with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Included in this brief is a very comprehensive summary of the issues we found regarding the New York DEC water quality application process and additionally outlines the schedule for the appeal process. Together, this brief should answer a majority of your questions concerning Constitution.","We have made progress as well with Atlantic Sunrise. During early March, the FERC issued a scheduling notice for Atlantic Sunrise and on May 5, 2016 issued the draft Environmental Impact Statement. Our expectations are to receive the final Environmental Impact Statement during October and to remain on schedule for a late 2017 in-service.","For the Tennessee Gas Pipeline Orion project, the FERC also issued their scheduling notice for environmental review during June and indicated that the final environmental assessment would be issued by mid-August 2016. This $135 million per day project remains on schedule for a June 18 in-service date. Also of note was the recent issuance of the draft Environmental Impact Statement by the FERC on the 1 Bcf a day PennEast project. The final EIS is scheduled for mid-December, and this project remains on schedule for late 2018. As a reminder, Cabot has $150 million a day committed to the PennEast project.","Moving on to our recent announcements of the Lackawanna Energy Center power facility. We are very excited to be the exclusive provider of up to 240 million cubic foot a day to Pennsylvania's largest natural gas facility and one of the most efficient power plants in the U.S. Together with our previous announcement to provide 100% of the natural gas requirements to the Moxie Freedom plant, Cabot will be providing more than 400 million cubic foot a day to local demand projects. Both facilities are essentially tied into our gathering system, eliminating the need to commit to expensive, long-term FTE agreements.","And our pricing terms, although confidential, provide very attractive rates of returns with netbacks that are expected to be materially better than our anticipated netbacks in the local region. Assuming a gross exit rate for this year of approximately 2 Bcf per day, we have line of sight to double our production to over 4 Bcf per day, assuming all of the announced projects are approved and built.","For all the Constitution naysayers out there, while we are still extremely confident that the project is ultimately constructed, even without Constitution volumes, we still have direct line of sight to have the ability to produce over 3.5 Bcf per day by the end of 2018, which is effectively double the production levels we averaged during the second quarter. Not to mention, our marketing team continues to evaluate additional projects that would all be incremental to the numbers I just discussed.","I have an outlook comment. As a result of continued efficiency gains and incremental cost savings, the company plans to complete an additional 15 to 20 Marcellus wells during the second half of the year and will also incur an additional $20 million of capital. The production impact of accelerated Marcellus completions will not be realized until early 2017. Therefore, we're leaving our current 2016 production guidance unchanged. While our plans for 2017 are still being evaluated and our official budget will not be announced until October, I can say that measured growth in the 5% to 10% range in 2017 is a prudent and reasonable assumption. And based on today's outlook, we would generate even more positive free cash flow next year than we will this year.","When you look at Cabot's story over the next several years, I see a company with a strong balance sheet that continues to get better, best-in-class economics that continue to improve, cash margins that are expected to almost double by 2018 at this current strip, a growth outlook that allows for a doubling of Marcellus production volumes once the majority of our infrastructure is in service and a significant level of free cash flow accumulated during the period of time, providing optionality for program acceleration, dividend enhancement, share buyback, balance sheet management, et cetera.","Needless to say, the outlook for Cabot is certainly bright and I look forward to providing more details about our long-term plans in October.","Ericson, with that brief statement, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Excellent. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And our first question comes from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. And nice details, Dan. Say, Dan, a question for you. Given the single well economics that you're discussing out there, obviously very positive, over 100%. When you look at that and when you look at inventory, why not bump production even more given the efficiencies? Is it more about takeaway or are there other bottlenecks that you're considering?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's a great question, Neal, and we have that internal debate often. When you look at the macro market and you look at the volatility still out there in the macro market, even though there are additional volumes we could move today, we do think it's prudent to be rational into the market. We've seen NYMEX increase in the third quarter, beginning of the third quarter, but we've seen the differentials expand a little bit.","Even though our realizations have improved over second quarter, we still think as we gain traction, continue to get regulatory approvals on the infrastructure buildout, we think it's prudent to be rational at this point in time until we see the infrastructure projects put in place. And at that particular time, be prepared for the ramp-up. And by doing so in concert with that buildout, we don't think it's going to create liabilities to the existing basin and the limited infrastructure we have.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And then, yeah, Dan, I just want to hit on efficiencies real quick. You mentioned about 13 days spud to spud. Is that now what you guys \u2013 is that just occasionally? What do you guys look at now as a typical spud to spud, given you've had some great value improvement on efficiencies?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We have Phil Stalnaker here, who's our VP of our North Region up here, and he's looked at it across the quarter. And Phil, what do you see for that?","Phillip L. Stalnaker - Vice President & Manager-North Region","Those numbers on the wells that we drilled during the quarter, that was actually the average for the quarter. So, yeah. We continue to build on those efficiencies. It's not just a one-off. It's what we're projecting right now.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Wow. Very good. And then lastly, just, Dan, any comment on the diffs. Is that just seasonal? Again, they certainly were a bit lower for second. I think guidance was back up again. Just any thoughts on the gas diffs.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The gas diffs stay volatile just as the market does. We saw a nice day this week yesterday after storage numbers how rapidly it can swing. I'll let Jeff make a brief comment on the diffs, Neal.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Yeah. Okay, Neal. The differences in the second quarter certainly improved and a lot of that was related to the drop in NYMEX. We saw Henry Hub in the second quarter average $1.95, and compared to the second quarter of 2015, for example, it was $2.64, and we saw about half the differential this year compared to last year.","Of course, we had (18:04) during June on NYMEX going forward for the rest of the year, and so our diffs definitely widened out a little bit. But we're going to see that volatility all year long as we watch these storage injection numbers and watch the market tighten.","Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Very good. Thanks, guys. Great quarter.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Neal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. I was hoping you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of acquisition opportunities. You have significant free cash flow generation, which I think is rare nowadays amongst your peers. So, just would like to hear what you're thinking about it.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Drew. It's a good question. We get that M&A question because we do have such a strong balance sheet and great cash flow. We look at deals out there. We look at opportunities, and we try to stack them against what we have as our ongoing model. We put together, or I should say, on the process of putting together a five-year model. We'll present this five-year plan to our board in October.","In discussions with that model, we look at organic program, what we are able to achieve, what the assumptions that we place in there on commodity pricing. And then, we also look at the available opportunities out there and also just our own internal ideas of what we might be able to do different to enhance long-term shareholder value.","And that's a continuing discussion we have in our board meeting, not only in every board meeting but we also have an off-site meeting that many are aware in September that is a strategic discussion at the 30,000-foot level, of the macro market, the movements in the market, strengths of the market, opportunities in the market to see how we can continue to enhance shareholder value.","So, we have not been an acquisitive company but we have been a company that continues to evaluate the opportunities that are out there and the asset basis and\/or, in some cases, the corporate companies that have possible needs and their future to do something different. So, we haven't made any decisions but we do evaluate the market.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks, Dan. Just a follow-up on that. I guess part of what I'm curious about is with the rates of return you can generate in the Marcellus, whether you really see much that's competitive with that on the acquisition front or if that's how you think about it. And as you've gone through the deal process, has there been anything that's come close to meeting those thresholds that you'd need to move forward with an acquisition?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. We have, I think, demonstrated with our plan how we're running the company and what we have done in trying to rationalize our growth, and measured growth is what we have provided. We do that because we are trying to maximize our return in a soft commodity price environment, and we're certainly trying to look at the market in the macro sense to determine what we think best \u2013 our input into the market and how we think that would best maintain the margins and strength of Cabot.","So when you look at the M&A market, diversity is one of those areas that we discuss, not only geographic diversity but also commodity diversity. We look at that in a way that compares what we have in our organic program, the risk of execution of our organic program, and how we might be able to enhance the valuation, the return profile in our program, if in fact, we had a bolt-on, we had a new greenfield operation or we had a merge opportunity out there.","And to your point of what we receive on a return profile, with every dollar that Cabot invests, it does challenge us to look at the market out there and to look at other assets and to be able to say that we're prepared to displace any capital allocated to our Marcellus and allocate elsewhere. And we don't get comfortable with that, in essence, dilution of that investment in that context. We do look at the infrastructure buildout. We know we have a significant growth profile coming for Cabot, and it's just around the corner. It's now not measured really in years. It's measured in months of when we're going to see that. So, our focus is more internally right now to get our program lined up and to be prepared to grow into that market, double our production or greater, and do that as efficiently as we can.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Dan.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Drew.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Dan, and Scott and Jeff. Thanks for taking my questions.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, David.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Dan, can you give any color, I guess you talked about exiting this year I think at 2 Bcf a day growth and then, I guess you'd be ramping into that first quarter there. Is the thought I guess you'd be basically at your capacity almost in 1Q in terms of deliverability, and you'd more or less hold that number kind of flattish throughout the rest of 2017, unless there was some other release capacity out there?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We think that the \u2013 and I'll let Jeff talk kind of about the market and how we might grow into the market a little bit and focus on 2017 pre-infrastructure buildout. But when we look at the exit at 2 Bcf, again, we're measuring our growth at this point in time. We have cash on the balance sheet, we have the ability to ramp up as you might suspect.","But we think prior to, again, getting closer to the in-service of the infrastructure, we think it is a benefit to keep this in-basin dynamic of restricted growth on the three pipes and the supply side in somewhat of a balance. But we do see it relatively \u2013 and our plan is to stay relatively flat from an exit volume of 2 Bcf and that's what got to my measured growth comment in 2017 of 5% to 10%. Jeff, you want to make any comments about kind of the dynamics of the market up there right now?","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Yeah, sure. David, if you recall, we've been to 2 Bcf before, 2 Bcf today is not a stretch in terms of moving gas, and finding capacity, and expanding our existing markets and our customer bases. Right now, and we've talked a little bit about this on the first call, about the availability of excess firm capacity in the marketplace and the secondary market. We look at that every day.","We're pretty happy we didn't pull the trigger back in February on a number of these capacity deals. Quite frankly, the rates keep improving, the options keep getting better, the volumes are more to our liking, the durations are more to our liking. And so we're watching this capacity release market very closely.","And as we get further into the year, we find that there's more producers or I should call them producer-shippers that aren't using their capacity, and it's quite dynamic. But it's something that we think at some point we will pick up some additional capacity that just bridges the gap over to \u2013 closer to 2018. So, a lot of options right now, and I think they're really good options to improve netbacks.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I appreciate that color, Jeff. So, it sounds like there is some potential I guess to see some release capacity in 2017, then.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Potential, yes.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just the last one that I had for you guys is, how are you thinking about hedging right now? We've seen a lot of your peers putting out hedges sort of in this $3 range in 2017. And you guys kind of set foot on that right now. How are you guys thinking about the hedge book going into next year?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Our desire is to underpin some of our volumes with the hedge. We continue to look at the market, and again, trying to get a feel for the forward curve. We think that the opportunity to place hedges in the range that have been in the recent past, we think that opportunity still exists out in front of us. And we think actually the opportunity could maybe improve from where some of the hedges have been placed behind us.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. So, it sounds like you'd probably wait until like wintertime I guess before layering in something more.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We'll be opportunistic. I can't \u2013 the market is, as you know and we all know, is very dynamic and hard to predict with accuracy. But at least, it is our consensus with our hedge committee that we can still protect our volumes into 2017 between now and the end of the year.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Dan. Appreciate all the color.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Holly Stewart of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Holly.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Just, Dan, you outlined in your prepared remarks just a lot of the projects that are coming online over the next couple of years to increase your capacity and ultimately your pricing. I think, Jeff, if you could maybe just help us a better understand these power agreements, I think it's close to or over 400 million a day. Just trying to get a sense of maybe how we should model it. You mentioned I think within one of the releases that your gas price is directly linked to power prices. So, is that based on a market heat rate, and then maybe which power price is that associated with, I'm assuming PJM?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll turn it over to Jeff to give color, and he knows and I'm sure he will reiterate the confidentiality of it, but it should be able to help give some better scoping of the power pricing.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Okay, Holly. This is, of course, a sensitive subject.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Sure.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","And we've \u2013 first of all, we're very, very happy to be with our partners in the power generation business, diversifying our commodity a little bit more to power from gas and it being in the local PJM areas you mentioned, it's our benefit to link some power pricing to our gas prices.","So, the benefit of these two particular projects are unique and that, as Dan, mentioned in the speech, that we \u2013 literally, no FTE that we had to buy to get there, so we're all of a sudden out of the gate, were $0.50 to $0.60 better than having to purchase long-term liability FTE to get to these power plants.","That said, the pricing for the power plants, a small portion of each one of these plants is local pricing because power plants generally just buy gas, daily gas. So a small percentage of that load is related to local gas daily pricing.","However, what we've done is set arbitrary floors and caps under the agreement that protect Cabot and also protect the power generator. And we fluctuate between those floors and caps based on day forward power prices or at least a percent of day forward power price. And that enables essentially the generator and for Cabot to win, and it's a great structure for everyone.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. So is there like a minimum volume if the plant doesn't dispatch? Do you still get paid?","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Keep in mind, these are brand-new, high-efficiency plants. Their run time in the first five years will be at least 95% to 96%. So you'll have a couple of days of maintenance each year. Recall, too, that we have a fuel manager between us and the power generator. And that fuel manager's role is to continue to purchase gas and move gas during days or an hour or whatever the case may be, that the plant may not be operating. But we fully expect these plants to operate at a very, very high load rate, at least through the first five years to seven years.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Got you. Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on \u2013 I know you mentioned the pipeline maintenance, there's a lot of maintenance going on during the third quarter. Have you anticipated any curtailments in your guidance for 3Q?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There's a minimum curtail volume. I don't have the exact amount of curtailed volume. As we typically do, Holly, we put a risk profile on our production volumes and we have a curtail volume there also. I don't have that number right in front of me. I'm sorry.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","And, Holly, this is Jeff. One more thought on that. These projects sometimes tend to get out of control. In other words, when the maintenance is done, sometimes it extends longer than the notice scheduled it for. But in this case, the majority of the maintenance that we're experiencing on Transco in particular and \u2013 quite frankly, just pipe replacement, we're almost through it. In fact, it ends on July 30.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, great. Great color. Thank you.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Dan, and to the rest of your team there.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I'd like to explore a little bit more your intent to be opportunistic in 1Q 2017 and how that interacts with your decision to accelerate your completion pace here in the back half of the year. Is this the sort of thing where you're committing to delivering more volumes in 1Q 2017, anticipating some better realizations there? Or is this more about you building the optionality to perhaps capture just a week's worth of high local pricing in the event of a cold winter?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we're not really doing it just for a short-term grab, Charles. If you look at our plan that we're going to present in October to our board and you look at \u2013 I obviously have the benefit of looking out a little ways with the draft we have currently. And if you look at that bill that we have out in front of us and you go back to the infrastructure projects that we've highlighted here, and there's other things that Jeff is working on, we have to start at some point in time to plan, schedule in an efficient way and the most efficient way, getting out ahead of a ramp of almost 2 Bcf a day additional production.","And if you think about that, you'd say real quick it's not that difficult. I have Phil Stalnaker sitting over here beside me and he squirms every day when we look out at the end of 2018, which is not that far out in front of us, and it's his group that is less than 100 people up there but with some excellent rock. His job is to manage the economic growth of our operation up there and to build into this infrastructure.","Now, what ideally we were hoping would happen is Constitution would have come on by now. And as everybody knows, the pains of that process. But we've stacked these other infrastructure projects in line now. But the good news is they're all going to happen, but they're going to happen kind of on top of each other and contemporaneous, which does require us to start out ahead of that ramp-up in a way that would have some of the decisions we're making today in preparation for what we expect to be able to build into as these projects come online.","So we like the dynamics of where the market is and we certainly like the better pricing we see. For example, to your point in the first quarter of 2017. That's all good and certainly we'll be in that space to benefit from it. But we're looking at more of long-term build and getting up to the 3.5 Bcf, 4 Bcf production range towards the end of 2018.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Dan, that's helpful increment detail. And if I could pick up on one of the things you talked about with this, your really much stronger roster of options on takeaway and demand things in the area. My read is that really the big one, both in terms of volume and time line, is really Atlantic Sunrise. But I'm wondering if you'd agree with that and if you could kind of rank or maybe put on a discussion in terms of both time line and volume, which of the other of these projects, whether it's the Tennessee Gas or the PennEast line that, that would be number two behind that Atlantic Sunrise in terms of the ports?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Quick comment. We had 850 million a day on Atlantic Sunrise, that is the largest project that we have in the pool. And again, without Constitution and these other projects, we can get to the 3.5 Bcf plus or minus capacity without Constitution, and so that's all positive. And I'll let Jeff talk about the lineup, but each of these projects get different price points for us and should be an enhancement to our realizations. Go ahead and run through it, Jeff.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Okay, Charles. Thanks for the question, by the way. The Atlantic Sunrise project is a big project in anyone's eyes. The scope is large and the good news there is, 850,000 a day of new capacity with a brand new pipe coming into our backyard, but also 100% of the 850,000 a day of gas is sold, and it's sold to two very good markets in the \u2013 the Cove Point LNG with Sumitomo, and of course, Washington Gas light in the D.C. area. So absolutely, that's a standout project for us.","As we move down the list, it's interesting that the next four projects that we have and in total these all add up to about 1.5 Bcf a day, I'll just make one comment. The good news is on the 1.5, all but 50,000 a day is already placed and sold to very good markets. So in terms of ranking or just how excited we are about these projects over the next 18 months, both power plant facilities are way up there on the list.","Good markets, no transport, ratable burns, I mean it's very exciting. The TGP Orion project of 135,000 a day again, 100% of that gas is sold. It's going to South Jersey to a power plant that they're going to operating in the southern part of New Jersey. There's been great pricing there. And then, the PennEast pipeline, that pipeline is 1 Bcf a day and we have 100,000 sold already and 50,000 of capacity, but keep in mind the impact of a PennEast or the impact of Atlantic Sunrise, what that's going to do to basis differentials on Transco.","As you start moving a lot of gas off that pipe and a lot of gas out of our supplier, our expectations are that pricing basis differentials both on Tennessee and on Transco are going to improve. I mean, there's just no doubt in my mind. So not only do we have all these projects to take away to the region, a rising tide lifts all ships. And in this case, we expect an upgrade to local pricing connected to all these projects.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Jeff, that's great detail. Thanks a lot.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Charles.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Brian.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Dan, you talked to your lateral length of drilled wells rising to 7,000 feet and then a record well I believe at about 10,000 feet. Can you talk to how you see your average lateral lengths trending as we go into 2017? And as well, give us an update on any changes impacting productivity and from wells adjusted for lateral length.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, we have been able to continue to push our laterals out, and in 2017, we expect our lateral lengths to continue to expand out beyond the 7,000 feet. So that's an ongoing project up there in Phil's area, and certainly an objective of ours to continue to lengthen laterals. The productivity is, as you might suspect, is in the \u2013 several that we have in this range, we do see very good productivity and it's simply a function of more stages in the lateral lengths and it's staying fairly consistent with the average that we see per stage.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. So the increased well performance will be a function essentially of the higher lateral length, if we divide it by lateral length, we'd get to a similar type rate?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, yeah.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thanks. And then I wanted to follow up on Holly's question with regards to the power plant contracts. And maybe I'll try to characterize it this way and I'm sure we can all model and come up with our estimates for the future, but to the degree that you had all the incremental volumes from the local power plant contracts on now or in the second quarter, would that be accretive, dilutive or neutral to corporate \u2013 to your average gas price realization before hedging?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the one comment I would make, first is when you're modeling, keep in mind one of the biggest components of the power plant is going to be the \u2013 don't put any firm transportation in the mix. We just don't have any of that, so that's going to be a firm input into your model.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Yeah. Brian, if we laid it all out today and made the assumptions, we will be $0.25, $0.35 below NYMEX.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Got it. Fair \u2013 got it. So, that is \u2013 that would be relative to, say, what you reported in the second quarter or your guidance for \u2013 where you'll be below NYMEX for the third quarter, which should be a substantial improvement even before we talk about probably the reduced FTE, or is that more of an overall margin point, or can you add a little bit more color there?","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","That's just a point in time the market.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. So, $0.25 to $0.30 below NYMEX. And then in addition to that, the benefit of not having FTE.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Correct.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Correct.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Kelly of Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Dan, you gave this kind of softer hypothetical 5% to 10% production growth scenario for 2017, saying that that'd be reasonable. Do you have a sense of how much CapEx would be required to get to that range? Thanks.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll say, we'll put that number out in October...","Scott C. Schroeder - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","October. But it probably \u2013 Mike, it'd probably be about 50%, 60% higher than where the guidance is this year.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Appreciate that. And I'm curious if you'd give us an update on what the current DUC count is and how you intend to manage this in 2017, especially in light of all this fixed transport that comes on in 2018. Thanks.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The DUC count we anticipate at year-end is approximately 15 wells in the Eagle Ford and 30 to 35 wells in Pennsylvania.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great. If I could sneak one more in. Just curious also if you're still curtailing any gas up in the Marcellus. Thanks.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Not really. We were force curtailed by virtue of the unscheduled downtime. But if our analysis including the volumes for Cabot \u2013 it's our analysis that the gas that can move up there is moving not only by us but our peers, and we think that the day of the curtailed volumes is behind us.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Great, guys. Appreciate it.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons Piper Jaffray.

Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Pearce.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Just now on the last questioner, you had mentioned that CapEx might be 50% to 60% higher to \u2013 relative to this year's guidance to meet that 5% to 10% growth rate for next year. Is that sort of the level of CapEx that you'd need to kind of get to that double your production by the end of 2018, or would you need to build upon that?","Scott C. Schroeder - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","We would have to build upon that, Pearce.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Again, the ramp up into that infrastructure will start with our 2017 capital program. And, again, a SWAG number and it's anywhere from 650 to 675 for 2017 as kind of a SWAG number. And then, as we go into 2018, I do plan on putting out a little bit more forward-looking statements in either October or November of what we see building into that infrastructure buildout.","I probably would not get granular with numbers on capital at all in 2018 at that time, but I do plan on and we will have discussion on how much of a look do we want to give \u2013 what we look \u2013 and our comfort level of our five-year plan. And with that, I think that would give the market a great deal of comfort on what Cabot is going to be able to do to deliver value. And some of this, what you do need to keep in mind, something different than where we are in 2016, we kind of stripped out of 2016 our investment capital, pipeline investment capital, out of 2016. And we have, in that number I'm giving you out there as a SWAG of 650 to 675, we have in that number plus or minus $125 million of that investment capital back in the 2017 capital number. So...","Scott C. Schroeder - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","For the pipeline.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. For the pipelines. That's right. So, it's a risk of throwing numbers out here because I'm not being granular on it, but I don't want it to be confused that we're not including the investment capital in that number I threw out.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up just relates to what's the latest on the Pennsylvania potential severance tax on natural gas production? I thought that here recently when they were looking at the state budget that, that had been kind of dropped off as a potential proposal or is that an option that was being discussed. So, it seems like that might be a positive thing.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, it is. You're accurate. It is \u2013 it was discussed early on, trying to get the budget approved. But it is not a topic of conversation at this time.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thanks very much, guys.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Pearce.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Morris of Citi. Please go ahead.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. A little late in the queue here, Dan, but I've got one more question on the budget. You bumped that up by $20 million, but that's for the additional completion crew. And you mentioned that is partially offset by the efficiency gains and cost savings. So can you quantify the efficiency gains or cost savings? In other words, if you had not added that completion crew, then that $325 million budget would've come down to what?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't have that number handy. I'm sorry, Bob. I don't have that number handy. And we have slides that show a percentage of efficiency gains through the process. And Phil had shown some of that to the board. And some of it was the example where we are on the quarter on more rapid penetration rates and running pipe and spud to spud moves. But I don't have it in the form you're asking.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Sure. That's fine. And then just a clarification. When you said you're going run that additional completion crew for a portion of the second half, does that just relate to adding it here shortly and continuing to run it throughout the rest of this year and into 2017? Or might you drop that later in the year?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're looking at that right now. It's part of forming our buildout of our plan in the fourth quarter of 2016 and how we finalize our recommendation to the board in October for our 2017 programs. So, we're looking at the utilization of that crew for the entire second quarter. But I thought it was prudent to represent that at this stage. That is for a portion of the quarter.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","You noted in your most recent presentations that you added 15% more locations with recent spacing tests. I'm just wondering, is this effort more or less complete? Or are you still testing downspacing in the Marcellus?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we will continue to test, not only how tight we can get locations. And Phil has a couple of downspace opportunities or wells that we look at. But we'll also continue to explore with the stage loading and spacing between clusters as part of our efforts to see how we can enhance the program.","One of the dry period for (53:39) Cabot at our board meeting is the opportunity for our geologists to stand before the board and talk about our exploration projects, ideas that we have. And we do have some and we did present several to our board on Wednesday. But one of the things also the technical group has done in the north is taking a step back.","We have a huge database, as you can surmise, and look at the entire space and determine what we might do different with a blank piece of paper, starting over to try to look at all the different aspects all the way from landing areas, steering, penetration rates, how we initiate fracs, how we bring back the wells. All of that is being scrutinized in a project-orientated fashion that I imagine Phil would come back and discuss at a later date. Phil, do you want to make any comments on some of what...","Phillip L. Stalnaker - Vice President & Manager-North Region","No. Our guys are doing a great job. Kind of like Dan said, we're looking at every aspect of it, so stage spacing, clusters, number of clusters, landing points. The challenge is breaking down each component of the reservoir. So, again, it's an ongoing effort here to continue to optimize our potential out there.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And one of the things also is not only looking at the upper Marcellus all the way through the Purcell over Marcellus, but the complexity of the geology, looking at the relationship to production profiles within some of the proximity to some of the larger faulting systems. And also looking at a couple of different zones in the section that we think hold what I would couch today as exploratory promise.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","On that last point, would the Utica be one of those that you might look at at some point?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the Utica is certainly out there. And my reference was from an exploratory standpoint and the data that we have. And actually the shallower section above the Marcellus is an area that we have significant data points that we think holds the potential I was specifically referring to. But certainly, the Utica is the deeper section.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Right. You mentioned earlier in the call, 30 to 35 Marcellus DUCs year-end 2016, if I got that right. You've also been talking about a production bump-up in first quarter 2017. So, I was wondering, do you have an estimate of how many of these DUCs you're going to actually tie and line in the first quarter of 2017?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't have that yet, Jeff. I would say it's probably going to be between 10 and 15 wells. We have a little bit of scramble looking at the piece of paper that might have that on it. But my guess is going to be 10 to 15 wells.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And if I could last finish with kind of the upside, a quick question...","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Scott just pointed to me, the number is 11.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. If I could finish with kind of a little devil's advocate question, but it also relates to something that Jeff was talking about earlier about the potentially growing availability of capacity on existing infrastructure. To what extent do you think you could protect your incipient Atlantic Sunrise volumes if that project is delayed? Meaning can you scramble around on some of the existing infrastructure and the freeing up capacity to help you if there is some kind of environmental pushback on that and I guess delayed by six months or nine months or whatever?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll let Jeff answer that.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Yes, so we have \u2013 let me back up. We watch this very closely, of course. And we are very comfortable with where we stand with the permitting process and the regulatory process. So, we are content for the project that's moving forward and excited that it's moving forward and have some in-service opportunity late 2017.","That said, we do have plan B and plan C and plan D to move on into different directions and different places to \u2013 or should I say just in case that the project is delayed a month or three months or something to that extent, so probably wouldn't be able to find a home day one for 850,000 a day into premium markets, but we would be able to adjust to that based on the deadline that we would see if it was delayed.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. And yeah, I didn't mean to dampen the enthusiasm, but we've all had some disappointing surprises with this stuff over the last year or so. So, it's just \u2013 I think it provides some comfort to investors to know that you guys are really looking at that and have some (59:21) to be able to respond.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think it's a good question, Jeff. And it is one that we tried to plan the contingencies around and certainly, we've had an ongoing education and effort doing that by virtue of the delays that have been \u2013 we've seen with the New York DEC and Constitution.","Jeff L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the answers.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, Ericson. I don't have any additional remarks but just to reemphasize that we are extremely pleased with the operational side of our program. We are building into the infrastructure buildout, starting the early stages of some excitement about seeing some tangible results in that area. And I think it's going to be fun for our operating group to now diligently start being able to use their talents, secure the services and equipment and start a very diligent process in building these significant volumes.","If you look out there in the space, I don't know of any other company that has an opportunity and the rock to be able \u2013 and the balance sheet to be able to grow production, double production in the next couple of years and have the benefits to its shareholders as Cabot does. So thank you for your interest, and we are excited about presenting our five-year plan to our board in October. And we do anticipate offering maybe a little bit more color either in October or February \u2013 we haven't made that call \u2013 of a little bit longer outlook for what Cabot has to offer. So, thanks again and look forward to the next quarterly call.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","Dan O. Dinges","Thank you, Emily. Good morning, all, and thank you for joining us for this call. I have a number of members of the executive team with me today to assist in the Q&A session. Before we start, let me say the standard boilerplate and forward-looking statements included in the press release apply to my comments today. On the call today, we will plan to cover the following: our third quarter 2013 operating and financial results; an update on our operations in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford; and finally, an update on our guidance for 2013 and 2014, including our capital budget and operating plans for 2014.","Before I go into details of these topics, let me start with the financial highlights from the quarter, which was, by the way, one of best quarters we have had. For the third quarter, we produced 107 Bcfe of total company net production or approximately 1.16 Bcfe per day, which is an increase of 61% over last year's comparable quarter and a 13% increase sequentially over the previous quarter. Liquids production increased 43% over last year's comparable quarter and 18% over last quarter, driven by 28% sequential increase in our Eagle Ford liquids volumes.","Net income grew significantly during the quarter, increasing 91% over last year's comparable quarter. While net income, excluding select items, increased 73% over the same period. In the third quarter, we also continue to generate robust cash flow growth with discretionary cash flow and cash flow from operations, increasing 69% and 61%, respectively, over the last year's comparable quarter.","Our third quarter unit cost of $2.97 per Mcfe were down 15% over last year's comparable quarter and down 4% relative to last quarter, continuing to demonstrate how our already industry-leading cost structure continues to trend lower. In fact, our cash costs for the third quarter were only $1.25 per Mcfe, down 19% compared to last year's comparable quarter, and down 8% relative to last quarter. Our natural price realizations were approximately 96% of the average NYMEX last-day settle price for the third quarter, which exceeded expectations based on the mid-point of the basis differential guidance range we provided in early September.","Now let's move to our Marcellus highlights. Our operations in the Marcellus continue to provide peer-leading well results across our acreage position. In our press release yesterday, we highlighted the results from several of the recent wells that further reinforce the productivity and consistency of the wells in our operating area. These results included 13 wells from a total of 4 pads. As you can see, we're still drilling just a select number of wells from pads. We have not yet got to the pad, full-pad development drilling. We completed -- these wells were completed with a total of 272 stages for a peak production rate of 323 million cubic foot per day. Very impressive results from our team in the Marcellus on the execution of our operation, and an equally impressive demonstration of the quality of Cabot's Marcellus position.","These results highlight the true differentiating factor of Cabot with the most economic wells in the Marcellus, and I think it's without question. You can cut the publicly available data in a few different ways and arrive at the same conclusion. When focusing on initial production rates, the previously mentioned wells, on average, had an IP rate of 5.4 million cubic foot per day per 1,000 lateral feet, and a 1.2 million cubic foot per day per completed frac stage. And this is not just a case of our wells coming online strong with open chokes and dropping off immediately.","The average 30-day rate for these wells was approximately 90% of the IP rate. While this is only a sample of our wells from the third quarter, these results imply an increase in an IP rate per foot and per stage compared to our typical 14 Bcf well from our 2012 program, which is especially impressive, considering our 14 Bcf well was already best-in-class among Marcellus producers when comparing EUR per lateral foot of 3.4 Bcf. This compares also very favorably to today's public data for Marcellus players.","While we do not provide updated EURs and reserve data until year end, I will say, that on average, our 2013 program lateral lengths are several hundred feet longer than our 2012 program, and we are using approximately 200-foot spacing between frac stages on all our wells. As a result, we are completing 3 to 4 extra stages per well in our '13 program as compared to our industry-leading 2012 program. Also, I recently reviewed our forecasted drilling programs for '14 and '15, and I can tell you that a portion of the increase in our '14 program, and that's an increase in our capital program, is a result of longer lateral lengths and more stages per well than our '13 program. Additionally, our '15 program will provide yet longer laterals and more stages.","Regarding pricing sensitivities, even in our highlighted low-case pricing assumptions for '14, we still generate greater than 100% return. While there's been a lot of focus on near-term pricing over the last few months, we believe, as this quarter highlights, the focus should be on the fact that we have the most economic resource in the U.S. What the third quarter also shows is our ability to exceed growth expectations while producing record results in a tough price environment.","Let me move to some comments in our Eagle Ford operation. Beginning in the third quarter, we redirected our focus in South Texas to our Eagle Ford program, and it is beginning to pay off as we experienced strong sequential growth with Eagle Ford liquids production increasing by approximately 28% over the second quarter.","As we discussed on the second quarter call, we added a second rig in the Eagle Ford in August, which is solely focused on pad drilling, and we will continue to operate 2 rigs in the play for the remainder of the year. We also noted in the last night's press release the substantial cost savings we are -- we have realized with our most recent drilling and completion operations.","On the previous call, I was asked what is -- what it would take to accelerate the Eagle Ford operation above our 2 rig program, and I said we were hoping to see returns of 60% to 80% based on the results we are seeing from the longer lateral wells and the cost savings we're realizing on the drilling and completion activities. I think those returns are achievable in a consistent manner and, as a result, we continue to be excited about the future of our Eagle Ford program. We will have more incremental results to discuss on the next call as a result of the multi-well pad drilling we are currently conducting.","I'm now going to move to our 2013 and 2014 guidance. And based on our year-to-date production, we feel very comfortable reaffirming our full year 2013 production guidance of 44% to 54%, even assuming a loss of the quarter of production associated with the sale of the Marmaton and West Texas properties. Also, despite our strategic decision to hold back certain volumes periodically due to pricing in the day market in the third quarter, our robust growth in the third quarter through -- our robust growth in the third quarter further reinforces our ability to grow, not only production, but also cash flows in light of the headwinds related to natural gas pricing. We anticipate fourth quarter realized pricing will be stronger than we saw in the third quarter, with an unhedged basis differential guidance range of plus $0.10 to minus $0.30 relative to NYMEX. However, regardless of pricing, we fully expect to meet our production guidance for the year.","In regards to asset sales, we made it clear that the Marmaton was a potential candidate for divestiture due to the focus elsewhere and the result of lost opportunity in this area without sufficient capital deployed. The small legacy West Texas piece was not strategic and never received the desired capital. The implied metrics for the deal were very compelling compared to the recent transactions, and the proceeds will make Cabot cash flow positive for the year.","For 2014, we are reaffirming our 30% to 50% production growth guidance. Capital spending for the year is expected to be $1.375 billion to $1.475 billion based off a 7-rig program in the Marcellus and a 2-rig program in the Eagle Ford. Approximately 85% of our capital budget will be spent on drilling and completion activities. 75% of the drilling and completion capital will be allocated to the Marcellus, and the remaining 25% will be focused on the Eagle Ford. We plan to drill 170 to 190 net wells next year, with 130 to 140 net wells in the Marcellus, and 40 to 50 net wells in the Eagle Ford. Virtually all of our wells are 100% working interest in both areas, and I suspect our 2014 net well count is considerably less than our peers and will still deliver best-in-class production growth.","Our basis differential assumption for full year '14 is a range of flat to NYMEX to minus $0.40 per Mcf, even at the low end of that range. Again, we will generate a free cash flow positive program. Our unit cost guidance for '14 is expected to decrease by 10% at the mid-point relative to 2013 unit cost guidance.","On production, we have been continuously asked about what factors are driving the low end and high end of our production range. I do not plan to get into the granular details around each assumption that was made. However, I will say that we ran multiple sensitivities internally, as we always do on our budget processes. And even assuming a reasonable level of curtailments throughout the year, our production growth remains well above the low end of our guidance.","As we have done in previous years, we will review the guidance quarterly. And to the extent we feel we need to update the range based on current information, we will do so. Cabot has generated 3 consecutive years of annual production growth over 40%, and the mid-point of 2014 guidance implies a fourth consecutive year of 40% production growth. More importantly, assuming the current strip and the continued reduction in our unit cost, we expect cash flow growth to outpace production. And while these top line growth numbers continue to be best-in-class, given that we are doing it with a cash flow positive program, our relative debt-adjusted growth numbers will be very compelling in an industry known for more outspending cash flow.","As we have previously discussed, based on our budget, we expect to be free cash flow positive in '14. However, the magnitude of the free cash, which will ultimately be dependent upon the pricing dynamics in the Marcellus during the year. Given the addition of a sixth rig in August this year and a seventh rig beginning in early '14 for our Marcellus program and the magnitude which we can increase our production with this level of activity in the Marcellus, we will consider further acceleration of our high-margin, high-return Eagle Ford program, assuming we do continue to deliver the results we expect, and changes to our distribution policy will be the primary candidates for the use of free cash in '14.","As it relates to distribution policy, in the past, we have ranked an increase in our regular dividend as a high priority, which was evidenced by the 100% increase in our regular dividend in August. However, in light of our recent underperformance in the market, share repurchase have become increasingly more attractive, as we believe there is a disconnect between our market valuation and our intrinsic value. As a reminder, under our current share repurchase plan, we have authorization to repurchase up to 10 million -- approximately 10 million shares, which certainly can be increased if the situation warrants.","And finally, a couple of comments around our marketing effort. With regard to pricing, we mentioned earlier our overarching assumption for the full year 2014 is that our average realized price will range from flat to minus 40% compared to the NYMEX last-day settle price. This assumption includes the potential for seasonality outside this range. Additionally, the low range is representative of weak third party -- third quarter index levels that we saw, and persisting continuously throughout 2014, which we do not expect.","Our sales strategy remains unchanged as we combine our winter and summer sales with our long-term firm sales, while also utilizing our firm transportation position. This approach will allow for approximately 5% of our volumes to reach the day market, which is generally necessary for operational purposes. Collectively, we have already placed over 1 Bcf for the '13 and '14 winter period, and approximately 900 million cubic foot a day for the April, October summer period for 2014. These positions will certainly be expanded on in the normal course of business.","Regarding our hedging strategy for the year, we currently have approximately 30% of our 2014 gas volumes hedged at the mid-point of our guidance range at a floor of $4.10 per Mcf. We will continue to lock in additional NYMEX hedge contracts throughout the year when the opportunity arises. Given the fact that a significant amount of our volumes are already contracted at a fixed premium or slight discount to NYMEX, these hedges will help reduce volatility in our overall realized prices.","In closing, we certainly remain enthusiastic about the future of both our Marcellus and Eagle Ford effort. Yes, we will have near-term headwinds, just like the entire industry will have in various different places at times, but we will continue to adapt and adjust to respond to those circumstances. Even with all the negatives in the last 8 weeks, this quarter for Cabot ranks as one of the best of all times. As one of you has recently mentioned in the end, it's the rock in the economics that matter, and we still have one of the best, if not the best, in that regard. Emily, with those brief comments, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Penetrating on the buyback program, are you currently authorized to start buying back shares? And can you offer some more color on where that program can go?","Scott C. Schroeder","I'll answer that, Drew. This is Scott Schroeder. We have had an outstanding buyback authorization for a longer period of time. With the splits and the adjustments in it, it is up to just under 10 million shares. Our blackout period will end today so -- and we're fully operational if we choose to go in and buy shares on weakness at various points in time. And it'll be up more after-the-fact kind of disclosure, where we just wanted to, in light of all the questions we had around free cash flow, in light of the weakness of the stock, we wanted to be more proactive in saying that we do have that as an arrow in our quiver, and we will use it when we see it appropriate.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And it looks like if we look ahead, you could be generating, I guess, more cash flow than I was thinking before, at least. Are you guys open to maybe looking at acquisitions or expanding into new areas where that's organic or where acquisition-based? Do you have any thoughts there?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, Drew, we have -- with our current capital guidance that we've given, we have several areas that have been included in that capital exposure that are exploratory in nature. And if, in fact, those are areas that yield returns that are competitive with our existing projects, we will consider expanding into those areas. At this time, we have also continued to pick up some acreage in the areas that we operate. And -- but we do not have plans and are not focused on buying a bolt-on in an area that we are not currently exposed to.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Lastly, just on well costs. I guess given that you're talking about longer laterals, bigger wells, overall, going forward, where do you see well cost going from here?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, the well cost, again, when you look at the average and you look at the nets that we have and 100% working interest wells, the increase on the drilling side is typically not that substantial because the drill rates and penetration rates are so robust. But the incremental ad that we have will be by virtue of more stages in those longer laterals. And in our pumping services, we are -- we have very good contracts on our pumping services, and the uptick will be a direct proportion to the incremental number of stages. So I would say probably anywhere from $250,000 to $500,000 on some of the expanded wells that we drill.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And thinking, maybe, where you are right now with well costs?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, on -- and we've gone to and we've still used, as we have highlighted in our discussion points in our presentation, our '14 Bcf well, for example, in the Marcellus is around this $6-plus million range. In the Eagle Ford, we have highlighted, and particularly in our press release with the most recent drilling that we've been able to do and particularly on, we're on a pad right now. We haven't gotten to TD, but we're drilling pad wells there with a walking rig. And we think, again, reiterating what I've said in the release, that we think we're going to be saving, just on the drilling side, $500,000 to $600,000 per well in the Eagle Ford. And we think we're going to get our well cost below the $7 million range.","Operator","Next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The 100% working interest wells this year, is that more of a high-griding exercise? Or what -- how sustainable is your drilling program at that level? And maybe you could help us with the average working interest across the 2 plays, currently.","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. It is a little bit of an aberration as we go into '14, and there is a couple of reasons for that. The couple of reasons that make the majority of impact is, one, through '13, we had a significant level of joint venture wells that we operated and we drilled in our joint venture with Osaka. So from a net perspective, we had a number of gross wells in there, but we didn't net out the higher percentage because of Osaka's interest. Additionally, by virtue of the sale of the Marmaton up in Oklahoma, we had a number of nonoperated wells up in the Marmaton that we participated in. And we also had on the operated wells, we also were anywhere from, say, 35% to 85% working interest in the operated wells. And that was one of the reasons why we elected to refocus into our core areas where we have blocked acreage and where we can have greater efficiencies at 100% operated wells going forward. We do anticipate that by virtue of, again, having to anomalous events, the JV in the Pearsall and the sale of the Marmaton, that we will have a much, much higher working interest percent on average than we have in the past.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Really helpful. And I guess so, that my follow-up would be in your prepared remarks, you talked about you expect in your capital review, your plan for next year and the year after. You expect longer laterals in sequentially '14 and -- well, '13 and '15 over '14, but also more stages per well, I guess. Can you just help us understand this? How much further do you think you can go in terms of improving the efficiencies of these individual wells? And I'll leave it at that.","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. It's a good question, Doug. And the industry, as a whole, has certainly been pushing the limits of extended laterals and reduced spacing on frac stages. Some other ideas being tried is increased profit per stage. I think it is true, we'll continue to tweak and try different ideas that would enhance the efficiencies. In our Eagle Ford operation, as an example, we had averaged 4,000 or 5,000-foot type laterals in a pad that we are currently on right now. We are going to average out to 9,000-foot on those particular Eagle Ford locations on that pad. How much further you get out is at least, in our sense right now beyond 9,000 feet, is going to be pushing it with current technology and current efficiencies to be able to assure yourself you're getting effective fracs at the tow stages. But nevertheless, as you can see going straight from 5,000 to 7,500 or 9,000, certainly, is a step further out in the Eagle Ford. In the Marcellus, we continue to extend our average lateral lengths in those particular wells. And we have some wells that we have planned for '14 that would allow us to put, say, place 40-or-so stages in a particular well. So we are extending them out further, but it's not going to be as aggressive of increase as you have seen in the past, by industry as a whole, I might add.","Operator","And the next question is from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","I was wondering, Dan, could you give us an idea on both the timeline of these long-lateral Eagle Ford wells that you're drilling, the timeline we should expect results on? And really, what kind of rates you're looking for out of those wells?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. Charles, that's a good question. We have, again, on one of these pads we're on, we have drilled 6 of the top holes on a 6-well pad, and now we're going back and we're starting the laterals on that 6-well pad. As a placeholder, we had completed a 4-well pad. And we completed that 4-well pad that had a measured depth of 58,000 feet, and we completed it in 58 days. So pretty simple 1,000-foot average throughout 4 wells on a -- on that particular pad. So I don't know if that will hold true, Charles, as we get out even further with the lateral lengths. But that kind of gives you a benchmark to work with.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. But just the key thing here though, is that you're batch drilling, and are you going to do a batch completion on that pad as well?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, we will. Yes. And just one other quick point, Charles, on that. And that's the reason I kind of said, well, when we come out with the data, we will probably have something at our year-end call in February, we would hope, a little bit more color on results of these wells. But the 6-well pad is probably not going to be a great -- a lot of time on that particular pad site, but we should have some more color, certainly, on our year-end call.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. It'll be a lot of oil when it does come at you. But before I...","Dan O. Dinges","And we -- we're working on...","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Before I -- right. The other thing I wanted to ask, just to touch briefly on this Northeast differential issue, I looked up at one of the regional hubs out there, and there's actually been a dramatic or -- there's been a pretty quick tightening or narrowing of the basis just in the last week. And so I was wondering if you could -- we're about -- we're close to 1\/3 of the way through the quarter, and I could just -- wondered if you can offer a few more thoughts on how it's looking for the last 2 months of the year.","Dan O. Dinges","Well -- and I'll let Jeff just add some brief color to it. But I will say this. I looked at it, and we had our board meetings, of course, yesterday and the day before, and we kind of glanced at it. One of the indices was up $0.72. Again, volatility is the name of the game. But -- and we ran through a lot of sensitivities, as I mentioned, in the little talk here. And we think it's going to be volatile. There is going to be times when we don't like the number, and there's going to be times that we can catch up. And through all that sensitivity, we feel like the range that we've given is supportive. And not only that, with the type of wells that we're drilling and the unit cost discounts that we're seeing, our return profile for this program is going to be significant. And in fact, if you back up a little ways and you take the noise out that's been most recently discussed in regard to the most recent past differentials, our returns are probably going to compete against returns that we had when we didn't have this differential noise. Yes, I'll let -- I think Jeff wants to make a comment also, Charles.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Yes, Charles, I'll get a little more specific with your question. The Leidy Line that you're speaking of has seen, I think, a great improvement just in the last week. Although I will say it's been improving in the last 6 weeks little by little, as Tennessee has improved as well and demand has improved in some of the other pipes. I think on the Leidy Line, the volume of gas that reaches that pipeline is pretty much at its max. So the pipe is full. What's been missing up there has been the demand. And now the demand piece has shown up, we're going to see improved price in there. And in fact, I think yesterday's gas day was maybe $0.05 under NYMEX, so a big improvement. And then on Tennessee, with that pipeline opening up on November 1 with the new capacity in the Bcf a day, since we'd want them -- about 300 went west, about 700 went east, the transportation opportunities and the path has opened up. And we've seen a big improvement there. Not quite like Transco's Leidy Line, but we expect to see, as winter progresses, more flattening of that basis as well.","Operator","And our next question is from Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Were there any one-offs that impacted Q3 Marcellus differentials like pipeline maintenance, things like that, that are worth highlighting, which may not be repeatable, say, next year?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, I'm going to flip that right off to Jeff, Pearce.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Okay. Yes, particularly in the third quarter, we had, I wouldn't call it as bad as a perfect storm scenario, but we have a number of scenarios that changed the dynamics of pricing, particularly on Tennessee. They had some -- obviously, they had construction all summer to facilitate new capacity coming on November 1. So that was hammering some of the areas that normally did not see reduction in capacity. We also had folks taking gas off Tennessee trying to get to other locations that were already full, and so that also intensified the problem. We had some -- the weather, I don't want to harp on how mild the weather was, but the lack of power-gen on that particular pipeline is very sensitive to demand regarding whether, both winter and summer. So we have that concern at the same point. There was obviously a little bit of new production that came on, that also added to that scenario. But overall, we think that with this new capacity and normal weather conditions, that will return to a more historic-type basis.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then, Dan, what are your thoughts about de-risking other horizons on your Marcellus acreage? I know you've done some completions in the past on the Purcell, but what about something like in Onondaga?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, Pearce, one of the things -- one of the processes and procedures that we're going to be able to get to in our '14 program is that the examples of pad drilling that we've been discussing. And pad drilling means getting to the 6, 8, 10 wells per pad, maybe 12, 14 wells per pad. But the opportunity at that time will allow us to try multiple ideas on that particular pad that would be -- allow us to look at analogous similar geology, and the information and gather -- and data points we get from that similar geology will allow us to maybe make a little bit better interpretation of what the results are telling us. So in some of the things that we're going to try to accomplish, which are going to be reduced spacing in the Lower Marcellus. We'll have also the Purcell test. We'll have the Upper Marcellus test. And we will look at the -- any other ideas that we have in additional rocks that might be something for the future. So that's the time we're going to do that, Pearce. Yes. And I would say towards the end of '14, we would be able to give you some additional color on all those points.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","When we look at your end markets for gas, I think you had said about 65% of this year's contracts are linked to Henry Hub. Can you talk to what that number is for next year? And how is the relationship to Henry Hub of next year's contracts compared with this year's?","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. I'll let Jeff give you a brief executive summary on that.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Yes, Brian, the 65% for 2013, we're going to look at growing that number for 2014 just because of the production growth. And so what I'm trying to say is most of the next round of contracts pertaining to the production growth will be tied to NYMEX-based contracts. So it's pretty much as simple as that. As far as what's going on in '14 compared to '13, we -- as we've talked about before, we took great lengths to put together all of our portfolio of contracts and transactions to be able to supply you with this range for pricing going forward. If you tried to compare that to pricing in 2013, I know we were relatively flat in NYMEX in quarter 1 and quarter 2. And then you saw the results for quarter 3, and we're probably pretty close to our guidance for 4. So you can kind of work the numbers from there.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just to make sure I understood the early part of your response, when you talk about adding new volumes to increase the number, are you increasing the percent above 65%? Or are you keeping the percent reported at the same soon-to-be and just adding contracts given your growth?","Jeffrey W. Hutton","The percent will grow.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then when we think about the key milestones to meeting the midpoint of the 2014 guidance, can you just walk us through key items that you see on the critical path regionally within Susquehanna County? I guess, one would assume if you get to your -- if you get the rig count ramped up on schedule then those items on a critical path will be more from a midstream perspective.","Dan O. Dinges","Are you talking about our production volume, Brian?","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. So for us to have confidence that you are at versus above versus below, or for you to have confidence that you are trending at versus above versus below your 2014 volume guidance, what do you see as items on a critical path as you go forward through 2014?","Dan O. Dinges","One, on the operational side, I don't see anything that is going to deter us from achieving the volume rates that we have forecast. Operationally, we have the -- one, we have a significant level of wells that we're going to roll into '14 and a significant number of stages in those wells that we roll into '14. And with the level of drilling that we have between now and then and the addition of the seventh rig, I think we are going to be able to meet or exceed the guidance that we've given with our operations program. The length of laterals, the number of stages and our ability to secure the pumping fleets up there are all within our reach, and I see no issues in regard to that. The 30% to 50% guidance we gave, as I've kind of talked through in the teleconference write-up, we are -- we're looking at the -- all the sensitivities on us pulling off, even throughout the full year, us pulling off production that would be representative of some of our day gas. So even in light of that, we have a significant opportunity to meet or exceed our production guidance. So I'm -- any key milestones, it's really going to be conducting our operations as effectively and efficiently as we have in the last few years.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So basically, there's nothing on the critical path from a midstream perspective? That's all in place, and so it is executing on the upstream and watching the markets to make sure that demand is there? Or are there midstream -- key midstream items to think about?","Dan O. Dinges","There's not anything in the midstream that is going to be a critical path item for us to be able to achieve our higher rates that we forecast. In fact, at the end of '14, we will have in the form of compression, dehydration and our measurement capacity, 3.4 Bcf available to us.","Operator","And our next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A couple of questions. One, you mentioned the quality of the rocks early on as a kind of a commanding advantage. Have you guys ever benchmarked through the Northeast gate [ph] what advantage the rocks have versus what your own proprietary completions have?","Dan O. Dinges","Say that again. I'm sorry, Bob, I...","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can you separate how good the rocks are from how good your completion strategies are up in the Marcellus?","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. I appreciate that. Well, the feedback we get from the North region personnel is it's all their completion technique.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That would be expected.","Dan O. Dinges","But to quantify that, we do things in our completion operations up there. We were first movers. We discovered the Northeast Pennsylvania, Marcellus, and we have developed it with the first drilling up there in that particular area. And we have a core group, extremely talented individuals that have paid attention to it and have done their tweaking and evaluation. And so I certainly think what we do has some bearing on it. But I also think that the Marcellus that we drilled in our particular area is uniquely thick compared to the rest of the Marcellus you see across the entire state and into West Virginia. The maturity of it is at a perfect maturity that allows it to have a very low amount of connate water frac-ing. And viability of that allows it to be extensively fractured with the fracs that we put on it. And I think the recoveries that we get up, in place reserves as a result of that, and not having any water in the system and any concerns about permeability issues down the road, we are in the absolute best spot you can find, as far as reservoir quality.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And a follow-up, you talked about differentials being flat to minus $0.40 off of Henry Hub. What's your view for Henry hub for next year?","Dan O. Dinges","We haven't looked at the Henry Hub, except to say that, on average, we are going to be between the, say, $3.80 and $4.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investment.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I just wanted to ask one question to each regarding Eagle Ford and the Marcellus. I'll go with the Marcellus first. It looks like your average production per stage is spot-on with the wells you highlighted in the second quarter. And -- but in the second quarter, you gave us some locational color with regard to the wells being north and northeast of Zick. I was wondering if you could give us some kind of indications of what the locations of the 4 pads highlighted in the third quarter are.","Dan O. Dinges","They were at -- they were scattered throughout our areas. We had a pad site to the northeast, not just east, but to the northeast. We had a pad site to the south and southwest, and so they were scattered throughout our area. And by the way, they were in 4 different townships.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, good. That's helpful. And with regard to the Eagle Ford, about the time you guys were at our conference in August, you had reported an 8,000-foot Eagle Ford well that had basically no decline over a 3-month period. And I was just wondering if there's any follow-on data with regard to that well, and if you've seen any kind of similar type of behavior in the wells that you've drilled subsequently.","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, I'll let Matt Reid respond to that and kind of give you maybe what we produce to date, and it's still performing well.","James M. Reid","Right. That's our Pickens B16 well, had a lateral length of about 8,200 feet, 30 stages. That well's produced 125,000 barrels in about 200 days. It still continues to produce an equivalent rate of about 600 barrels equivalent per day. So it's been fairly flat, great producer, good EUR. So -- and the wells we're drilling off the current pad will be similar in length to the Pickens well.","Operator","Our next question is from Biju Perincheril of Jefferies.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. The wells that you highlighted in the Marcellus earlier today, and looks like even compared to some of the reduced cluster spacing wells that you had talked about earlier, looks like there's an improvement. Other than the longer laterals, are there other things you're doing on the completion front that is still diving improvement in productivity?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we have got our spacing down. Some of our -- a small portion of our '12 program had the 200-foot stages spacing. And all of our 13 wells and our wells going forward are going to have that phasing -- spacing. And when you look at what we do on the completion side, again, back to the comment I made on, I think, to Jeffrey was that -- or Bob, the guys up there have continuously tried different techniques and processes on our completions and we have a good database right now and we try different things all the time.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as far as northeast demand is concerned, I think you guys have been looking pretty close look at it being a longer-range plan. Anything you can share in terms of new market opportunities for pipelines or incremental demand?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. I'll chuck that to Jeff, Biju.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Yes. Biju, we have -- it's an ongoing process for us as we look at different options getting out of Susquehanna County. I think you'll -- if you follow the open seasons, by the compliance, particularly the nonbonding open seasons, you see a lot of projects around drawing boards that get gas out in Northeast PA, particularly to the Carolinas, to the mid-Atlantic area and additional pipe. More in, obviously, the Constitution and into New York here in November. But I think the other thing that's a little bit missing from the equation is all the new projects in Southwest PA that will move gas most likely to Canada and obviously back on racks. And all the backhaul projects and pipe reversals that are going on there will also influence the Northeast production and probably obtaining more market share of the projects I mentioned previously. So it's ongoing. We have a number of ideas and it's -- we hope to expand on that in the next few months.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And in the next few months, is it likely that we could hear it from kind of like Cabot-sponsored pipeline like the Constitution? Is that -- or is that on the industry projects that you're referring to?","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Yes. Probably bad choice of words, the next few months. These projects take a long time to develop. And I think the pipelines are putting them together as we speak. We're trying to make decisions on which projects are best for us. And then if it's more than one, just what share of those projects that we participate in. So it's ongoing. There's more than a dozen that would benefit us directly. And so we're in an evaluation stage at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from Gil Yang of DISCERN.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Just a couple of questions sort of following up on some of the other questions. The role that you were talking about for going into 2014, are you in any way because of the curtailments that you had voluntarily placed on, are there more wells sort of waiting to be turned on than you would have expected? And does that lead you to go into 2014 a little hotter than you would have originally planned and sorts of make it easier for you to grow?","Dan O. Dinges","Gil, it's a good question. We have certainly capacity. And in fact, I think today's rate is probably a rate that is higher than maybe we've seen. But the result is that we do have -- we do have volumes that are upcoming with some robust completions that we expect that we have risked, if you will, on the production profile we've included in our forecast.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Okay. The risk via the curtailment issues.","Scott C. Schroeder","Right. Not versus productivity, just reframe the timing of when they would come in. And Gil, this is Scott. Just based on the simple math, we do have 6 rigs running in the Marcellus now. So just by the nature of that activity, we're going to have a higher number of completions going into the next year than we had last year.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Sure. Right, okay. And then with regard to completions, have you given much thought to -- or have you also been tweaking lateral spacings? Or do you think you're pretty much optimized in terms of the distance between laterals or any Chevroning of the laterals within that formation?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. Well, on the -- are you talking about the frac stage spacing?","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","No, no. Well, obviously, you've gotten on to the 200-foot spacing within the frac -- for the frac stage length. I'm just talking about the spacing between the laterals that you're drilling.","Dan O. Dinges","Oh, okay. Yes, all right. Yes, Gil. Well, that is a -- like I've mentioned before, once we do get on some pads, we will be looking at reduced spacing. We will and, in fact, we have drilled a couple of wells that have gone down to 800-foot, and we will continue to look at what we think is a very optimal spacing. But that is the plan to continue to reduce from the 1,000 feet we have right now to something less.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","You want to say -- can you say what happened to the 800-foot spacing?","Dan O. Dinges","Still too early.","Operator","Our next question is from Jack Aydin of KeyBanc.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Looking at the -- is any of those 4 pads that you had in the quarter, any of them is Reilly Pad? Or Reilly Pad was not included in those?","Dan O. Dinges","No, we don't have the pipeline yet hooked up out there, Jack. I know we're still waiting on that. And the anticipation is that, that we would be able to get it hooked up this quarter, and we still believe that to be the case. But again, we did -- these are pads that are outside of the area where the majority of our drilling has taken place. And as I mentioned, they're in 4 different townships.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And second question, do you have another opportunities to acquire additional acreage in Susquehanna? Is there anything available to add on bolt-on in your acreage in Susquehanna? Or did you do any purchases in this quarter?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, the -- some of the purchases that we've done has just been by virtue of some of the small tracks picking up the lessors that have, or the mineral owners that have desired to wait until there is going to be a well drilled near them and in the event they lease on them. And we have picked up some acreage in that regard throughout the year along those lines. There, as far as a bolt-on piece of acreage that we could buy, we're not negotiating any at this time.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Some clarification, Dan. You mentioned you placed 1 B in 2013 at a fixed, and about 900 in Bs from April 2014 to the end of the year. Is that fixed, firm or what? What kind -- could you clarify it a little bit for me what you mean by that?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, yes. Jack, I'll let Jeff on.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Okay, Jack. What we're telling the world here is that we have a Bcf a day of gas already placed for the winter period. That's November through March of this year and first quarter of 2014. When we say placed, we mean we have that wet gas under contracts and similar-type contracts that we always have with splits between different indices, but primarily based on NYMEX. And then that we have approximately 900,000 a day for the summer period, that's April through October. It's already under contract. So those are all firm sales. And for the most part, we've utilized the majority of our firm transportation with those sales. So we think we're in pretty good shape with a large majority of our gas already under contract.","Operator","Our next question is from Gordon Douthat of Wells Fargo.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Question on the lateral lengths for this year. So at 200-foot spacing, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments, you've added about 3 to 4 frac stages this year. So does that get you about 47,000, 48,000-foot lateral?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, that's good math.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Not 47,000 feet.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm sorry, 4,700 feet.","Scott C. Schroeder","There you go.","Dan O. Dinges","Scott will always get the numbers right. He's good with numbers.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then I believe you had some of those on since 2012. I'm just trying to get a sense of what type of production history you need on those longer laterals with the tighter frac spacing in order to feel comfortable increasing those EURs.","Dan O. Dinges","Well, on the flowbacks and what we see early-stage time on the wells that we have brought on, we feel very comfortable that we're going to have increases in those wells based on what we've seen through our other wells. And the fit on the production curve is going to tell us fairly quickly that we can expect a better EUR. There's nothing that we see right now that's going to deter us from our position that EURs will be higher in '13 than they were in '12.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned that probably with the reserve report, on the 2013 reserve report, you'd discuss that further. Is that something that you'd talk about in February?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then to what extent is that incorporated in 2013 production guidance and then also 2014 production guidance?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we kind of look at what the production curve fit is for our normal wells out there, and we use that curve fit and roll it all the way through the year to come up with our production profile. So from that sense, the EUR is applicable when used in what we forecast. But I'm not sure I'm answering your question though, Gordon.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm just trying to get a sense of what -- is there upside to the numbers? I know you've given some fairly wide ranges next year, but what extent do you feel like -- I know production has been pretty strong, but what extent there might be more upside?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, I think the guidance we've given is robust. I think the guidance we've given is going to be in the top of the class. And we've kind of made a statement in the past, Gordon, that if we wanted to grow by putting in, say, we put in another spot crew in for 4 months and we average a number of stages that we complete in a day is, say, 6, well, I can assure you that if that's what we wanted to do, that we could really increase our production profile. So I'm comfortable with the range that we're in, and I think you've seen in our past guidance that we have been probably a company that has underpromised and overdelivered, and we're not going to change our methodology.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Christensen of Canaccord Genuity.","Robert L. Christensen - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Can you just please -- and some of my question was previously answered. But as the next pipeline, I'm looking at all the projects that the pipelines are putting up. How are the negotiations going with these pipelines in terms of getting a deal done? Are you pleased? And could such a thing happen where you'd have a big write-out or 2 out of the area by '15, get some steel in the ground in '14 if you get behind 1 or 2 of these things? And then basically, permanently and these worries over basis differentials, give us a sense on how it's going.","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. Well, I'll start and I'll pass it to Jeff. But, Robert, when you look at the space and you look at differentials, there's going to be a number of things that between now and '17, and I know that's not the term that you've talked about, but between now and '17, now and '16, now and '15, that will make a difference in the takeaway capacity. In particular, up in our area in the northeast. But if you look at some of the things that are going on away from us and you look at, maybe, the intangible benefits, those are going to have an impact on us also. There was a question earlier in the Q&A session, talked about are there anomalous events that have created a burden on differentials in this period. Well, if you go back and you look at the southwest part of the state, there was a period of time that there was a purchase of a lot of the Rex gas to be able to move gas and comingle with the volumes in the market that exasperated, if you will, the problem. And some of that was a result of some dominion issues that they had and maintenance things that they had down there. That had a direct impact during the third quarter that we don't think is going to be another recurring event. We think that there is a move of foot to reverse Rex and take southwest gas in the west direction. And we think there's projects that are going to be going down and alleviating some gas that is currently flowing east, to flow in other directions from other areas. We think Gulf Coast gas is going to be finding different homes versus flowing on the long-haul pipes up into the east. But as far as pipeline negotiations, I'll turn it over to Jeff. And he can, maybe, make more detailed sense out of what I just said.","Robert L. Christensen - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I'm not trying to invade the propriety of the discussion you may have, I'm just trying to get a sense of how much -- how well the discussions are going to, maybe, take gas to Atlanta for all intents and purposes.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Okay. Yes, it's certainly dynamic times. It's actually kind of fun at this point to be involved in so many projects and also be in the position to offer up a substantial quantity of gas dedicated to some of these projects. So we are involved in practically every single one of them in some way, shape or form. We think smaller positions and some make more sense to us. But we also think the region, in general, needs a larger stroll out of it. And there's obviously several very large diameter pipes planned to leave the area. You mentioned Atlanta. Obviously, there's discussions around that particular city. There is in Birmingham, Alabama, all the way from Susquehanna County to Birmingham on the Atlantic Sunrise project that we're very interested in. First, negotiations themselves. Obviously, you want to be involved in a project that you think will work and has constructibility aspects to it. And also, we want to make sure that the pipelines that we participate in are kind of slam dunk in terms of FERC approvals, those sorts of things. So we work very hard to that end to make sure those things happen. I don't think you'll see those, any of the projects that are on the drawing board right now who have progressed to almost to the prefiling stage of FERC be built in 2014. But I do think in 2014 with the projects that are coming on in November of this year, that we'll have spare capacity through that period of time. That's why we're pretty confident that we're not going to see some of the issues that plagued us in the third quarter. So with the current spare capacity coming on combined with 2015 projects that we know about, and I'll put Constitution out there for just a moment and try to give you a timeline for how these projects get built, we came up with a concept, the Constitution in November 2011. So it's been 2 years. But the good news there is it's just 17 months away. And in the pipeline world, that's not far. And it's going to open up a whole new world for us and others. And so these projects are kind of a 3, a 3.5-year horizon on completions. But keeping in mind, the Bcf that's coming on November was started about 3 years ago, and here we are. So they're ongoing. And again, I think we're in a very good position to be able to be a shipper on a number of projects.","Operator","Our next question is from Zach Berger of Conatus Capital.","Zachary Berger","My questions have been answered.","Operator","And the next question is from Matt Portillo of TPH.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question for me. In terms of in the Marcellus, you mentioned the longer lateral lengths over the next year. So I was wondering if you could give us some context in relation to your acreage position and how you think about kind of the longer term in terms of the lateral length you're able to achieve. Is that closer to 5,000, to 6000-foot in lateral length? Or just how should we think about kind of your drilling plans on a go-forward basis?","Dan O. Dinges","We will be able to achieve over 5,000-foot laterals.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Perfect. And then just in regards to your drilling plans next year, you mentioned a very robust 180 to 190 wells. I was wondering how your inventory levels will fluctuate around that, and if you guys plan to maintain a similar inventory, potentially below down sort of inventory you have, or maybe see a little bit of build. Just trying to get some context around that.","Dan O. Dinges","So we'll have -- both areas will have a significant inventories out in front of us, the 400-foot spacing in the Eagle Ford. We have over 500 locations, and we have 3,000 locations in the Marcellus. And we're stacked in multiyear inventory based on the number of wells that we project to drill in '14.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry. Just -- I apologize. To clarify that, just in regards to the drilling program, you mentioned 180 to 190 wells. How should that compare to the completion side of it? So are you planning to kind of have a one-to-one drill to completion? Or will we expect the inventory to build a little bit next year in the Marcellus?","Dan O. Dinges","No. We're going to have 7 rigs running. So when you drill several wells from a pad, and you're -- and you have more rigs, say, 7 versus 6, we would expect that, just by nature, you're going to have some drilling activity happening on now 7 pads versus 6, that's going to have wells that will be in the near-term backlog and in the Q waiting to be completed. So yes, we think that will build a little bit. And we also think that, obviously, the number of completed wells and completed stages will be increased also.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then last question for me on the Eagle Ford. I was just hoping to get an update on how you're thinking about spacing at this point in terms of the spacing between the wellbores and potentially tighter spacing on a go-forward basis?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, there's a lot of different pilot programs being conducted in the Eagle Ford, different areas. Of course, each area is unique with its own unique geology. But we have 400-foot spacing and results from 400-foot spacing that we're comfortable with. We will try wells slightly closer and see if there's merit to that. But certainly, at this stage, we're very comfortable with the data we have at 400 feet.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. Thank you, Emily. Appreciate the questions. I hope that we were able to clarify how we arrived at our projections in our guidance and the supporting data that we used to determine that. And I think the focus has been, for the last 6 or 8 weeks, intently on the differentials. I think if you combined what our program offers and the continuing efficiencies that we deliver in our program, not only with the longer laterals and reduced cost, but our unit costs are going to continue to go down. And I think the bottom line and the measure of what you might be able to accomplish and yield return for the shareholders, I think, should be measured on what you can deliver in your report card at the end of the year. And with what we've seen in '13 so far, and what we see coming in the fourth quarter of '13, I think we will be able to deliver a report card at the end of the year that will be very robust and indicate what type of capital efficiency our program yields. Additionally, with what we see in '14 and the enhancements and improvements we see through our program in '14, I am very confident that we'll be able to deliver an equally impressive report card at the end of '14. Thanks for your attention. Goodbye.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Carrie and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings call. With me today, as usual, are several members of Cabot's executive management team. Before we start let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements are -- included in this morning's press release, applies to the comments on today's call.","This morning's press release, along with our press release from two weeks ago outlining our updated 2016 budget, highlights that while our industry continues to struggle to adjust to persistently low commodity prices, Cabot remained well-positioned to navigate through this challenging market environment due to our high-quality asset base, low-cost structure, strong balance sheet and our capital discipline.","While most financial metrics were down year-over-year, admit a backdrop of lower commodity prices, I am pleased with our overall report card for the year which included 13% production growth despite continued price related curtailments and a significant reduction in capital spending. Additionally, we grew reserves 11% despite reduced operating activity and lower SEC prices used in calculating year-end reserve. I believe these results highlight the quality of our assets and their ability to generate positive result in most commodity price cycles.","Our ability to grow production and reserves in a capital efficient manner is certainly impressive equally as pleased with the continued reduction in our cost structure throughout the organization. 2015 marked another year of lower operating costs and finding cost for Cabot, driven by a combination of internally driven efficiencies and lower service cost. This reduction in cost has allowed for improving project level economics despite lower commodity prices and positions the Company well for the eventual recovery in both natural gas and oil price realizations.","Capital discipline has been a hallmark of Cabot strategy over the years and 2015 was no exception. We ended 2015 with a capital program that came in 14% lower than budget while still delivering on our production guidance for the year. This reduction in capital spending was especially apparent in the fourth quarter as we generated positive free cash flow despite realizing our lowest price for the year. Our previously announced 2016 budget also highlights the Company's financial discipline with another 58% year-over-year reduction in capital spending. We remain committed to our prudent capital allocation strategy and will strive to continue to improve capital efficiencies throughout our operation which we believe will result in continued value creation for our shareholders.","As I highlighted to our shareholders over the last 18 months, our game plan has remained relatively unchanged during this down cycle, giving our strategy has always been to first maintain balance sheet strength while also align our capital spending with anticipated operating cash flows and allocate capital to our highest return projects. We also run a lean, efficient operation in order to keep operating costs, including low overhead. And we focus on delivering long-term value creation from our high-quality asset base. This strategy has allowed us to prosper in most favorable price environments and we think we will continue to be able to navigate successfully through this current downturn.","Now let's move to the Marcellus. 2015 was another successful year for our Marcellus program which generated positive free cash flow for the year despite lower natural gas prices realizations. We continue to allocate the majority of our capital to our high-return asset in the Marcellus which still generate good returns despite the low realizations.","We averaged approximately 1.5 Bcf per day of net production despite curtailing over 75 Bcf of net production during the year. This surplus curtailed volume at year end gives us significant flexibility this year and allowed us to reduce capital spending substantially year over year with minimal impact to our production.","On the operations front we went from three drilling rigs in the fourth quarter down to one rig in the mid-January. We're currently running one frac crew on daylight operations only and plan to continue at this pace throughout 2016. With a decrease in drilling activity, we plan to work down our backlog of drilled uncompleted wells throughout the year from 63 at year-end 2015 to 48 at year-end 2016. This inventory, along with expected curtailed year end volumes, provides us with flexibility to ramp our volumes in 2017, assuming both a timely in-service for Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise and an improvement in realizations in Appalachia.","Our team in the Marcellus continues to improve their operating efficiencies which is evident from the reduction in well cost by over 30% relative to the prior year. We expect to average a 7,000 foot lateral from 2016 Marcellus program at a well cost of approximately $6.7 million or approximately $960 per lateral foot. This well cost does include all capital associated with roads, pad build-out, production facilities and things of that nature.","On the operating cost front, we continue to see a reduction in our per unit cost with direct OpEx decreasing to $0.04 per Mcf and total cash cost per unit decreasing to $0.82 per Mcf with gathering and transportation being the biggest component.","In this morning's press release we announced an increase in our Marcellus EUR guidance as well as a 15% increase in our Marcellus inventory to 3,450 locations and an increase in our lower Marcellus guidance per EUR per 1,000 foot from 3.6 Bcf to 3.8 Bcf, further reinforcing our estimated recoveries as best-in-class across the entire Marcellus.","Pricing remains the biggest challenge for us in the northeast PA; however, we're optimistic about the future, giving the significant reduction of activity in our operating area which should ultimately result in a reduction of supply. For example, in the six county area in northeast PA that accounts for over 8 Bcf per day of natural gas production, there are currently only four rigs operating and four daylight-only frac crews working.","While no one can refute the wells in this part of the state are very productive and there is a backlog of wells still waiting for completion that can add volumes to the mix with a relatively limited capital investment, these production levels are simply not sustainable based on the reduced level of activity we see today. This could set us up for a favorable rebalancing of supply and demand later this year or in early 2017 which could certainly greatly benefit Cabot.","While it is far too early to provide any significant details on our plans for 2017, I would highlight that our unique set of assets in the Marcellus provides us with optionality as we assess our plans for the future. If market conditions improve and our takeaway capacity is placed in service according to our current expectations, then we can deliver on a program that generates double-digit production growth in 2017.","More importantly, this program can provide even greater cash flow growth due to increasing margins as we assess more favorable markets, all while deleveraging the balance sheet of today's strip. However, if there are any unexpected delays in infrastructure build-out or, more generally, market conditions remain depressed, we have an asset that requires minimal capital investment to maintain flat production. In that scenario, while top-line production volumes would be flat, we would still realize significant cash flow growth in 2017 due to improving price realizations while generating free cash flow and deleveraging the balance sheet.","While there is still a lot of uncertainty on how market conditions will evolve over the next 12 to 24 months, we're fortunate to have this set of assets that allow for this type of flexibility as we weather the storm.","Moving down south into Texas in the Eagle Ford, our team experienced another exceptional year operationally which was unfortunately overshadowed by lower crude prices. Our drilling team continued to outperform expectations reducing our spud-to-TD drilling days for a 7,700 foot lateral to eight days. This has resulted in a 45% reduction in drilling cost relative to 2014, almost all of which was driven by internal efficiencies as opposed to service cost reductions, given that our rig was under a long-term older contract priced environment during the year.","The team drilled is longest lateral to date of 11,588 feet in 11.6 days from spud to TD with the total measured depth of 19,930 feet. Kudos to the drilling team. Additionally, the rig we utilized during 2015 ranked second in total footage drilled among the roughly 200 rigs that our third-party provider contracted throughout all basins in 2015 -- another good indication of our efficiency.","We do anticipate an eventual recovery in oil prices and we believe our 86,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford can provide for long-term value creation in a slightly more favorable price environment. As a result our focus in 2016 is to reduce our operating activity to the minimum levels needed to ensure we maintain all our core acreage.","We recently released our Eagle Ford drilling rig. Based on our anticipated level of activity, we will be able to maintain all of our lease-hold obligations through 2016. We exited fifth 2015 with 23 net wells, drilled but uncompleted and we'll work down some of that inventory throughout the year due to conditions -- continuous operation commitments which should help arrest some of our natural declines we see in the field. We plan to exit 2016 with 13 net drilled uncompleted wells in our backlog.","Now move to the approved reserve results. In this morning's release we announced our sixth consecutive year of double-digit reserve growth which is truly an impressive, giving the increasing trend of declining reserves across industry due to price related revisions. Our year-end reserves increased 11% to 8.2 Tcfe, despite a 40% and 47% reduction in natural gas and oil price realizations used in our reserve report, respectively.","Cabot's all source finding and development cost for the year were $0.57 per Mcfe while our Marcellus all source finding and development cost were $0.31 per Mcf, both significantly lower than prior years, driven by strong performance revisions in the Marcellus as our well performance has continue to exceed expectations. Approved developed percentage decreased slightly from 61% in 2014 to 59% in 2015, primarily as our percentage of proved undeveloped reserves associated with drilled but uncompleted wells increased from 7% to 11%. 2015 is another positive year report for Cabot, especially in light of the environment we're operating in today.","To get to Constitution, I'm sure it's on many of your minds. Recently we had a flurry of activity surrounding Constitution Pipeline. While we do not have specific details we can share today regarding our final permit issuance, I can assure you that discussions to have the permit issued as soon as possible are ongoing.","As a backdrop of 2016 activity, on January 8 Constitution asked FERC for a partial notice to proceed with non-mechanized tree clearing. On January 29 FERC issued the Notice to Proceed for tree felling but limited our activity at this time to Pennsylvania. Tree felling began February 5 in Pennsylvania. As of today, approximately 60% of the trees in Pennsylvania on the Constitution right-of-way are down. This represents approximately 18% of the trees for the entire right-of-way. Additionally, the FERC is still considering our request for felling trees in New York.","Also, on January 28, the FERC issued an order on the pending rehearing request regarding the December 2014 order that issued our FERC certificate. The order thoroughly considered and firmly rejected all arguments and ultimately declined all requests for rehearing -- another positive step for Constitution.","Moving on to the Atlantic Sunrise project, as a reminder, this new pipeline will transport 850,000 decotherms on Cabot's behalf to markets in the Atlantic -- in the mid-Atlantic area. To date, the project remains on schedule with initial pipe shipments already on location and the draft environmental impact statement expected shortly from the FERC.","Before I move on, I would like to make one quick point on perceived versus real impact of pipelines. Bottom line, pipelines get buried, the right-of-way gets reclaimed with a much faller footprint than renewables. In the case of Constitution, there are approximately 1,100 acres of right-of-way. For example, for solar to produce an equivalent level of power generation it would require instead of an 1,100 acre foot right-of-way of a buried pipeline, solar equivalent would take 25,600 acre footprint of solar panels. And for wind, on an equivalent level of production as Constitution might produce, it would require approximately 2,000 turbines spread across 260 miles which is double the length of the Constitution buried pipeline right-of-way. Certainly staggering differences, yet the narrative is not discussed much. Again, just fun facts.","In addition to Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise Pipelines, Cabot is also involved in three other significant projects in the Northeast beginning in late 2017, the PennEast pipeline, Tennessee's Orion pipeline and the Moxie Freedom power plant. Collectively, these projects add approximately 445,000 decotherms per day of new long-term sales and transport capacity for Cabot.","Our involvement in the Moxie Freedom project is especially unique as we will be the sole supplier of up to 165,000 decotherms per day of natural gas to this new facility located just a few miles away from our existing infrastructure. These projects highlight our ongoing marketing strategy along with other projects in the queue.","Another marketing related item I would like to highlight is our mix of firm sales and firm transportation capacity moving forward relative to our planned production profile. There has been a lot of discussion recently around the industry about capacity being over-built and the significant commitments and liabilities that producers have subscribed to over the past few years.","While we have been questioned during the past few years for not having enough firm transportation out of our supply area as the Northeast market became over-supplied, longer term, I believe our strategy of not over committing to FT and instead focusing on high-quality capacity with strong demand on the other side of the pipeline, is the appropriate strategy. As a result, we feel our overall marketing strategy and the modest amount of commitments we have going forward will continue to provide significant growth from our future production plans and continue our long-term strong financial position.","I'll move to our guidance -- brief comment there. As a reminder, earlier this month we released our updated guide for 2016. Our updated budget of $325 million was designed to allow us to spend within operating cash flows at strip prices while still providing measured growth in 2016 in the 2% to 7% range. We also anticipate between $80 million and $150 million in contributions for investments in Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise which will be dependent upon the ongoing regulatory process and the corresponding impact of the timing of actual construction activities.","Drilling completion and facility capital account for approximately 92% of the capital budget with approximately 70% allocated to the Marcellus and 30% allocated to the Eagle Ford shale. In total, we plan to drill approximately 30 net wells in 2016 and complete approximately 55 net wells. This level of activity allows us to meet all of our obligatory drilling and operating commitments and maintain operating efficiencies throughout the program, while our anticipated year-end backlog of 61 drilled uncompleted wells Company-wide provides us flexibility into 2017.","As for pricing, we're currently forecasting a Company-wide natural gas differential of $0.70 per Mcf for the full year before the impact of derivatives which represents a $0.15 improvement relative to our 2015 differential. Obviously, this overall program is dependent upon the reference to infrastructure projects and their timing. If delayed, these numbers could move lower.","In summary, that is our program. And, Carrie, I would be more than happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade","Thank you for your comments and I particularly appreciated the fun facts session. But if we could go back to -- you have already touched on a lot of these themes. But if I could try a question that would maybe tie it together.","Looking ahead to the time when you have the more takeaway and more local demand, how should we think about the cost and the number of wells that you will need to turn the line to fill up those new pipes? And with this -- what I'm really after is how should we think about your capital efficiency? Because it's hard to judge, based on your results, because you guys have been infrastructure constrained for so long. So when you look to the day -- you have to deliver another 500 million a day, how many wells and how much capital should we think about that requiring?","Dan Dinges","That's a good question. And we have certainly put together a five-year budget. We don't layout our five-year budget but we talk about it. And we look at all of the scenarios, both upside, downside and a lot of sensitivities.","But as you roll forward into 2017 and looking at fulfilling our growth opportunities with additional infrastructure, in 2017, as an example -- and let's look at it historically, Charles and historically we have never been over six rigs. And we have had the majority of the time one to two frac crews, episodically we have had three frac crews on a one-off pad site or something like that. But typically in the past we have never been greater than two frac crews.","When you roll into 2017 and looking at our buildup of our program in 2017, we do not envision to get much greater, if greater at all, than the six rigs and two or so frac crews to fulfill our additional infrastructure capacity that we create.","Charles Meade","And this is maybe a follow-up to that and the part of the same question, I suppose. When you mentioned 75 Bcf was curtailed or you ended up behind choke in 2015, by my math that works at around 200 million a day, is that the right number for year-end 2015 or is year-end 2015 that number a little lower?","Dan Dinges","No. And keep in mind that 75 Bcf is a net number and also 2015 at year-end it was higher.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Glick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Glick","Maybe just to dovetail on Charles' question a little bit, as it relates to new pipes, how should we be thinking about price points where you grow versus displacing existing volumes and maybe how much flexibility you have on that point?","Dan Dinges","Okay. That's a good question, Michael. And certainly the macro environment at the time of commissioning of new infrastructure is going to play in our decision on how much will be acceleration incremental volumes, if you will, versus how much is going to displace off the three pipes that we're currently producing on. And I'll let Jeff answer some of this in a brief second.","But in the beginning, Michael, I think it would be prudent for us to fill the new infrastructure first because the price points we're going to be receiving on the new build is going to be a price point out of the challenged realizations that we have had either on Millennium, Tennessee or the Leidy Line. So we would fill that immediately and there will be a transition period of the backfill of the displaced volumes that we put into the new pipes. And we will continue to, again, backfill.","But we do expect that we would probably see with the volumes that we would be lifting out of the current area and off of our current three pipes, we do expect to see a compression of the deferential. And when you look at the timing of commissioning of those -- the new pipes out of that area, we think it could be contemporaneous with an inflection point of the supply side due to the limited amount of activity up in that particular area as we speak.","So there's going to be a combination of things that will help dictate and set the table for us on how we would grow into that new capacity. I will also say this though, we're delivering returns today and we're in a -- been in a punitive price environment and realizations, more so than most, for an extended period of time.","The program still, today, delivers free cash flow with good returns. The incremental volumes that we move into, new areas with, we think, improved realizations is going to -- even in spite of keeping the current strip, we think is going to significantly improve our life from where we're today.","Michael Glick","And could you maybe just speak to how you're thinking about leverage and maybe what leverage ratio you're comfortable with kind of over the next year or year and a half.","Dan Dinges","You want my opinion and then Scott's?","Michael Glick","Sounds good.","Dan Dinges","Well we certainly have tried and I think we have done a good job to keep our balance sheet with strength and allowed optionality on our program. And lower realizations have certainly pressured everybody's balance sheet and we're seeing it now in the market. Not only in what's going on out there with a lot of companies but certainly the reduction in capital programs is reflective of a balance sheet. But I will let Scott discuss our leverage and he can lay out what he is comfortable with. And I will weigh in if I need to.","Scott Schroeder","Well you better weigh in. Michael, we're comfortable with where we're at. As Dan said in his comments, we have always tried to target and our guidance highlights that also, that we're trying to stay -- create a capital program that is right on top of where -- or inside of the anticipated cash flow based on the assumptions. Now the one caveat to that is we do have the two infrastructure projects that we're watching very closely and its impact on our leverage and looking at what levers we may or may not need to pull on that as we go forward.","As you look back in history, Cabot has always done a great job of -- when it did want to ask to expand capital in better markets, it used the combination of asset sales and the like to make -- hit our desired levels and kind of maintain our financial strategy. And that is no different today, although that market, that asset sale market is very challenged. And you hear a lot of people that are going to be there. But we're very comfortable with the base plan. We're comfortable with the low 50% debt to total capital.","Our year-end number 2.5 times -- obviously just the math will move up. We would like it to stay at 2.5 times. But clearly with the underlying commodity prices and where cash flow is it is going to move up some during the course of 2016 which we're comfortable with. Because as Matt laid out in Dan's comments, we see a delevering event in 2017 just by the nature of these infrastructure and what our new volumes will get to. So we're very comfortable where we're at right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Pearce Hammond","My first question, just following up on Charles Meade's question, is how much production was curtailed at year-end 2015? And then how much do you think could be curtailed at year-end 2016 if you assumed the current ford strip and your differential assumption?","Dan Dinges","300 million to 400 million.","Pearce Hammond","300 million to 400 million at year-end 2015?","Dan Dinges","At year-end 2015, yes.","Pearce Hammond","Okay, and then what about year-end 2016? I know that's hard but--","Dan Dinges","Year-end 2016 -- that is a hard one, Pearce. Kind of depends on the macro market. We do think we're going to have, as I indicated, we do think we're going to have volumes available to us to be able to respond to the infrastructure build-out that we anticipate to occur in 2017. But it's a hard number and I don't have the exact number. It is a hard number two project in year-end 2016.","Pearce Hammond","And then what is your base decline right now? And then I was intrigued with your prepared remarks. And you mentioned in 2017 you felt like even if some projects were delayed that you could still generate -- you can keep production flat, you could generate free cash flow and continue to delever. So I was curious some of the assumptions around that as far as what base decline might be and maintenance CapEx.","Dan Dinges","Base decline is 25%, 28% or so -- is the base decline. And CapEx, as we indicated in some of the comments in the speech, to keep that production level maintained flat, it is going to take very little capital intensity and activity to be able to do that into our 2017 program.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","First question I want to ask is I just wanted to make sure I understood the Eagle Ford. It looks like you're not running a rig there now but you're going to drill five wells. So can you just add some color as to when you're going to get a rig or how that's going to take place?","Dan Dinges","Yes. We have Steve Lindeman in here who's running our region -- south region and can comment on that.","Steve Lindeman","We have drilled three wells to date and released the rig. And then the two remaining that we have will be late in the year. We've got one -- I think it's in August timeframe and then we'll come back in December.","Jeffrey Campbell","I wanted to ask a different pipeline question. And as a New York State resident, I guess I'm not really happy with them, but to your knowledge, are there any examples of FERC ultimately superseding state authority and forcing the construction of a FERC-approved pipeline after a sufficient period of stalling on the part of the state?","Dan Dinges","Jeff, I don't know if that ground has been plowed yet. And there is a number of considerations. And as you might appreciate, we have looked at all angles and all options and all scenarios on getting to the commissioning and construction stage of Constitution. We do think that there has been adequate amount of time and deliberation in New York. 29 months is the process to date.","So we have had great discussions in the past with New York on trying to address all concerns and mitigate the -- each stakeholder's concerns about laying the pipeline, how it would be done. We have rerouted, we have discussed about stream crossing and how to bore, how to open cut, all of those things. In this environment and in the environment we live right now there is certainly a contingent out there that don't want hydrocarbons in the mix. And that contingent is vocal and they speak out.","There is a belief that we have that the Constitution pipeline, from what we have been able to tell from the Governor's of New York's plan and looking at the energy future for New York, natural gas is an energy source that is required for him to be able to fulfill his plan. So we think we're going to get to the endgame and we certainly would like the input of New York into the process and all of the work that we have done in the past to be used to -- actually for us to follow to the endgame on Construction for this pipeline.","The FERC has a job to do also. They have a fiduciary role to the public to have projects move forward. They have a lot of projects in front of them. Certainly their jobs have become more challenged in the world we live today. But nevertheless, I think they have a job to fulfill to be able to take all parties issues under consideration, look at the validity of all of this considerations and make prudent decisions that is best for the public's need.","And we think they will do that. But I do not think, Jeff -- again, back to your -- the core of your question, I don't think it's ever been challenged yet through the court system that the FERC is going to have to override a state's either lack of response or a negative response.","Jeffrey Campbell","Well I appreciate that comprehensive answer. And I guess just a follow-up to that and then I'm done. How do you see the FERC backing down on the tree felling in New York State as part of this fed-state dynamic? Or does that say something potentially about their view that some kind of resolution of this coming sooner than later? Do you have any opinion about that?","Dan Dinges","Yes I do. First off, just from a chronology standpoint, we had early approvals from Pennsylvania in regard to the 401. And we had -- and we have the ongoing delay from New York. In FERC making that determination, they felt like that they had all of the things they needed to see handily to be able to rule on the right-of-way in Pennsylvania.","And during this period of time, the FERC has worked diligently to look at all aspects of their ongoing decision process to grant non-mechanized tree felling in New York and make sure that they have addressed all concerns that might be out there by all of the stakeholders. The rulings have certainly made clear what authority they have. And we think, in due time, that FERC will make a decision in regard to tree felling in New York.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Bakanauskas of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Bob Bakanauskas","Just a follow up quickly on Constitution, given the FERC -- given FERC rejected the request for the rehearing, what has been communicated to you as the reason for the delay at this point?","Dan Dinges","I will turn it over to Jeff, Bob.","Jeff Hutton","Bob, I'm sorry, I heard the first part of the question. I did not hear the end. Do you mind repeating?","Bob Bakanauskas","Sure. Given FERC already rejected the request for the rehearing, what has been communicated to you guys in terms of the delay now in New York State in terms of the reason for the delay?","Jeff Hutton","Okay. So in New York State, the communication has been sparse. But we do understand that the application itself has been thorough. There has been no data request to supplement it. There has been no routes or reroutes requested. But just don't have a good answer to that question except to say that it's been fully considered and it's on the -- we think it's on the verge of being issued.","Bob Bakanauskas","And just can you remind us on the timeline in terms of -- I know it's sort of a difficult thing to answer given you need the final approval from New York State. But can you just remind us of how you're thinking about -- do you need the permit in the next couple of months to get it on by the end of the year? Are you assuming that 2017 at this point? Or just generally, can you put some parameters around it?","Jeff Hutton","We're still sticking with the fourth quarter 2016 as our in-service dates. Our time is running out but we still have weeks. And we used to have month but now we have weeks. But we still are good with the second half of -- or late 2016 in-service.","Dan Dinges","Bobby, I might add also that we have crews cutting trees right now. We have additional personnel that we anticipate being able to utilize for felling trees. And we continue to do the appropriate training and mitigation efforts to answer any concerns that any party might have in regard to non-mechanized tree felling.","Bob Bakanauskas","And then just switching to the Marcellus noticing the longer laterals going from a 5900 to about 7000 feet. Understand that some production is being curtailed at the moment, but just in general, could we assume a proportionate increase in ITs and URs relative to lateral length?","Dan Dinges","Yes. You certainly can.","Bob Bakanauskas","Just one more quick one just on maintenance capital. Should we think of this -- the $325 million in 2016 as an ongoing maintenance capital to keep production flat?","Dan Dinges","I would think that it would be probably $350,000 million to $400,000 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","As you watched the Easter movement of the Utica shale into northern West Virginia and southwest PA, how concerned, if at all, are you that this will represent greater long-term competition for you gas to find an accretive home directionally south and west? It's really more of a longer-term question above and beyond Atlantic Sunrise and Constitution and how you weigh the asset quality improvements you have discussed with whether it makes sense to be northeast PA or more diverse beyond your existing Eagle Ford position.","Dan Dinges","I will let Jeff kind of take some of this. But first comment is in looking at the two areas and you've kind of identified in laying out your question, Brian. But the northeast of where we're, majority of gas is -- goes east and southeast. We do have gas on Atlantic Sunrise which will go towards the south also. Although, all that volume, 850 million is committed right now to WGL and to the co-point LNG facility.","We think that the volume of gas that is out there right now obviously strains the supply demand curve. We think additional demand is coming. We think there will be in the South -- to your point -- in the South and along the Gulf Coast we think there's significant amount of LNG displacement that will occur with some of the supply volumes that are in the South. And we think that we have is equally as good opportunity to be able to market our gas, not only directionally to the east, northeast and southeast up into our area, but we do think that we will be able to market our gas into the South.","More supply -- just on a general note -- more supply, whether it's oil or gas, into a limited demand circumstance is going to be -- is going to have that dynamic of lower prices. We think that maybe through this period of time, looking at what's going on in our industry and looking at the capital programs that have been reduced, looking at the ratings that have been imposed -- public rating -- on some of the companies, looking at the oversupplied market, maybe there would be some rationalization in the market as we move forward also. I'll let Jeff comment also.","Jeff Hutton","Yes, Brian, it's been interesting to watch the last few years as we've gone from 5 Bcf a day from production in northeast PA to the current level of 8 Bcf. And if you examine it closely and look at the meters along the six county area that we produce in, we're actually the null point for the three pipes that we produce in.","So for example, most of our gas that goes into Millennium goes to the east where a majority of the gas out of Bradford, Tioga County for example goes west. Same thing happens in Tennessee and the same thing happens on Transco. So we're -- we like where we're geographically and getting into the pipes. I think with Constitutional and Atlantic Sunrise it enhances that. But I don't see a large over-built situation in northeast PA like we do and southwest PA and the Utica. We feel like that over-built infrastructure will absorb some of the Utica gas but it will definitely head west and northwest and south.","Brian Singer","And then separately on the resource side of things, you highlighted the impact that some of the measures you have taken over the last year reducing the spacing along the laterals and then how you do the 200 foot stages and the impact that's had on your resource per well and location count. Can you talk about the 2016 program and whether -- what you're testing in 2016 and to what degree you are able to do that within the capital program that you have set up?","Dan Dinges","Well we have recently -- on the spacing side we have ongoing wells currently producing that have term production and certainly setting their own production curve that we will continue to utilize and evaluate the spacing that we think we can get down to. We just had enough data -- enough well results to be able to determine that between 700 foot and 800 foot and we were comfortable that stage.","But we will continue to look at it -- down the road we will continue to look at the viability of the spacing that we think we can get down to without the creation of an acceleration profile to our mix. So and with that being said, we have tried all different frac stage spacing scenarios and we have a fairly voluminous database in that regard and feel that 200 foot spacing is a good design.","We continue, though, to look at any of the ideas that are new to industry, whether it's something as simple as more profit per stage or different profit size. All of the things that are discussed and looked at out there by the industry, we will continue to look at it.","And both Steve Lindeman and Phil Stalnaker, who runs our North and South region, they and their crew continue to read and look at and, in some cases, test all the different ideas that are out there in industry that we all hear about and we talk about and they visit with the third-party service sector on what might be applicable to enhance efficiencies in our program. So I don't have anything specific that I will talk about today but we do look at all of it, I can assure you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marshall Carver of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Marshall Carver","One question around the shut-in production factored into your 2016 guidance. What would your average shut-ins be that's cooked into that 2016 guidance?","Dan Dinges","It's a number based on timing of when we decide to bring on any given pad location. For example, if we bring on a pad location that has three wells on it versus -- and that -- we still have some opportunities to address where we go with our frac crew. And that movement of where we move a frac crew can dictate how much in a snapshot period of time, our a finite period of time, we would curtail.","If we bring on a 3 well location that has 32 frac stages per well versus an 8 well location that has 40 stages per well the -- and the timing of that is three or four months, it affects the amount of volumes that we might have curtailed for 2016. So it's a hard number to just say exactly what it is. I'm not trying to dance around your question. I'm just saying that it's hard to be specific but it's certainly 100,000 to 200,000 cubic foot per day.","Marshall Carver","Okay. And on the increased inventory count, is that a mix of upper Marcellus and lower Marcellus and what would the--","Dan Dinges","Keep in mind just as a backdrop, Marshall, the entire area that we have out there has both the upper and lower Marcellus under our acreage. So as we reduce the spacing in those areas, we will have both upper and lower Marcellus in those additional wells that we're adding to the inventory.","Marshall Carver","Okay. So it's roughly an even split?","Dan Dinges","Yes, roughly.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Beard of Coker Palmer. Please go ahead.","David Beard","I just wanted to follow up a little bit to just understand what you're thinking relative to balance sheet and cash flow. Should the pipelines get approved and you say you wouldn't want to go above six rigs, is there an out-spend number which gates how quickly you would add rigs? Or do you think your balance sheet is strong enough that you will bring the production on to fill the pipes or something in between?","Dan Dinges","Let me give it a stab, David. We feel very comfortable about our balance sheet. We feel very comfortable about being able to ramp up a level of activity to a level that we have already experienced in the past. We feel very comfortable that our balance sheet will be able to handle that level of activity and the outspend being minimal through that process. I'm sorry, the last part about your question --","David Beard","No. You have answered that just relative to the outspend and the ramp in production -- just try to get your feel there and, no, you have answered it. Appreciate the time and congratulations on nice year.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Hanson of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Mark Hanson","So just curious here -- at current strip prices and given your 2016 drilling plans, obviously knowing that things can change over time, where do you envision total debt to EBITDAX ending up at year-end 2016? And if you do get tight, what are some of the levers that you can pull to kind of move around that 4.75 times max under the senior note amendment that was recently filed?","Scott Schroeder","Mark, you are correct. We model the upper 3's the low 4's. We're not -- unless there's a dramatic drop in the strip even further, the 4.75 does not come into play. But we do have some -- as I mentioned earlier, we have some assets that we could potentially trade.","We do have a level of interest -- not committed to doing that but it is an option. We could also slow down activity further if we really decided. And one of the comments is our activity level at 3.25 which we reaffirmed, is contingent on continuing progress on the infrastructure project.","If those get delayed, that spend which is part of our overall analysis, goes down also. So we could conserve capital to manage through that process. Our effort and the amendment process of the covenants was to give us enough flexibility through 2016 and we believe we accomplished that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karl Chalabala of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Karl Chalabala","I had a couple issues I would like to raise. One, can you give some clarity -- I have June 18 for the startup day for the Moxie Freedom Power Plant over there. Is that good? And then what is the index price that is tied to? And are you in any other conversations with the new power plants up in Pennsylvania?","Jeff Hutton","Yes. You are correct on the in-service for the Moxie plant, June 2018. That could be a little bit early, a little bit later than that but the project has all the financing and is full steam ahead for that facility.","In terms of pricing on the Moxie, we did the press release along with Moxie that the pricing terms on that could also contains a power net-back pricing mechanism so that our gas price does move somewhat with power pricing. However, we also put in the press release that we have natural gas protection -- price protection in the agreement.","So that we have -- I think we quoted in the press release -- a guaranteed high rate of return on the development of the reserves for that project. So in other words, there is a gas price floor that is attractive to us that we haven't revealed. So it's a gas price that moves with power pricing. Yes, on the third part of your question, when we press released the news about Moxie, we had a number of power developers who like the structure and we're in conversations with several.","Karl Chalabala","And then how should -- there's some concerns with the deal with Williams and CapEx spend there. You guys are an equity investor and you have commented that you're continued -- or you're planning to have that spend planned in CapEx. What would -- how should we be thinking about slippage risks for Atlantic Sunrise which does not face the sort of regulatory environment concerns that Constitution does?","Jeff Hutton","Okay. If I understood the first part of your question, you were asking about whether or not we felt that Williams could continue to fund the projects?","Karl Chalabala","Yes, correct.","Jeff Hutton","Okay. So we have had that discussion with Williams. And I don't know if you listen to the call yesterday or a press release they made a few weeks ago, but they are committed to their interstate projects. They feel any cutback on funding would have to do with expansion of nonregulated interstate projects such as processing plants or even in the gathering infrastructure world where they operate in Ohio and southwest PA.","But they are committed to the funding on the interstate pipeline projects. And I think they even mentioned that they are really not moving ahead with any projects that are in the design phase but are going to concentrate on the ones that are fully committed to and in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Wolff of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jon Wolff","I was going to ask about the interesting observation about the pipelines coming on contemporaneously with potentially production slowing or falling in northeast PA. Production has obviously been resilient with other operators in the region not being very active at all. Any evidence that an industry shut-ins are lower than they were and\/or any evidence that there is some hope that production in the region can fall and help you gain a little share?","Dan Dinges","I think the lack of activity drilling and completion, Jon, is going to show up in any curtailed volumes, just like Cabot. Any curtailed volumes that were back earlier in the year and whatever volumes they were, you're going to have some natural runoff with the lack of activity of your base decline. I think that is certainly going on. I can't give you an exact figure of what's curtailed today. But whatever is curtailed today, I think is significantly less volumes than that were curtailed back in the summer of 2015.","Jon Wolff","Yes.","Dan Dinges","All I can really answer is directionally, I'm sure less volume curtailed.","Jon Wolff","We look at the number of [indiscernible] and a guess we're only able to really see it on statewide basis but any feel for -- I guess you know your own ducks -- but of uncompleted wells counts of -- I would imagine if I had to come down given the rig count has been so low.","Dan Dinges","Yes. I think that is exactly the case. Ducks are -- will be coming down some and with 4 rigs and 4 daylight frac crews running up there in an area that has 8 Bcf, you could do some real simple math and determine that it's not going to maintain production flat. We get the question, what kind of maintenance capital is necessary to keep 1.5 Bcf or 2 Bcf flat. And you look at that maintenance capital that is necessary and we had the absolute best rock in the northeast area of Pennsylvania.","So that other 8 Bcf, you might note, is not coming from the similar rock as Cabot. It's good rock and I'm not throwing stones at it but it nevertheless -- statistically, it is not as good as Cabot's rock. So 4 rigs and 4 frac crews is not going to keep 8 Bcf flat.","Jon Wolff","Just out of curiosity, what is non-mechanized tree felling? Is that using in axe or something?","Dan Dinges","That's a hatchet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Guffey of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Dan Guffey","Transportation and gathering has trended around low $0.70s per m in 2015 -- expected to be there in 2016. I guess as you look at your five-year budget, once Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise are in service, where do you see that trending?","Dan Dinges","I think it's between $0.85 to $0.90.","Dan Guffey","And then just one follow up on Constitution. So you mentioned you have a few weeks window to get this online by fourth quarter. Assuming New York sits on their hands and this gets pushed out another month or two, assuming it gets approved in the spring, how far back with the in-service date get pushed?","Dan Dinges","It would go to the end of the first quarter, end of the second quarter of 2017.","Operator","And this concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Carrie. I appreciate the time today. And I appreciate everybody's interest. And I can assure you by the results that you've seen in our 2015 program that we're going to be able to navigate through this difficult environment. And we expect that 2016 numbers will be equal to, if not better, than 2015. Thanks again and we will see you at next quarter call. Thank you.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day."],"4467":["Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (NYSE:COG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 25, 2019  9:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Dan Dinges - Chairman, President, and CEO","Scott Schroeder - EVP and CFO","Matt Kerin - VP and Treasurer","Jeffrey Hutton - SVP, Marketing","Phil Stalnaker - SVP, Operations","Conference Call Participants","David Deckelbaum - Cowen & Company","Leo Mariani - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Holly Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Drew Venker - Morgan Stanley","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers","Charles Meade - Johnson Rice","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Dinges, Chairman, President, and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Eily [ph], and I appreciate everybody joining us this morning for the third quarter 2019 earnings call. I also have the Cabot management team with me today.","I would first like to remind everybody that on this call we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Additionally, some of our comments will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, were provided in yesterday's earning release.","Cabot's third quarter results solidify our position as the leading natural gas producer in the United States, as we continue to consistently deliver strong financial results even in this challenged natural gas price environment that experienced the lowest quarterly average NYMEX price on record since the second quarter of 2016. Despite these lower NYMEX prices, we were able to successfully execute on our strategic goals by delivering the following improvements relative to the prior year comparable quarter.","They are as follows, 16% growth in adjusted earnings per share, over 150% growth in free cash flow, a 21% increase in return of capital to shareholders, an increase on return on capital employed of over 1,400 basis points to 25%, 18% growth in daily production, a 15% reduction in operating expenses per unit including interest expense and G&A to $1.43 per 1,000 cubic foot equivalent, and a reduction in net debt to 0.7 times EBITDAX. Additionally, during the third quarter, we announced the divestiture of our non-core interest in the Meade Pipeline for $256 million, representing an accretive transaction multiple of over 13 times expected 2019 EBITDAX. This transaction remains on track to close during the fourth quarter and will provide additional available funds to further support our continued return of capital to shareholders over the coming quarters.","Year-to-date, we have generated $454 million of positive free cash flow, of which we have returned approximately 100% to shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases and dividend, including the repurchase of 10.5 million shares during the third quarter at a weighted average share price of $18.21, reducing our shares outstanding to 407.9 million shares. I'll get that straight. This represents a 12% reduction in shares outstanding since we reactivated our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2017. We currently have 21 million remaining shares authorized under our share repurchase program or approximately 5% of our current shares outstanding.","We also announced an 11% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, the fifth increase in our dividend, since May 2017, which is underpinned by our expectation for continued free cash flow generation even under NYMEX price assumptions materially below the current forward curve. I fully anticipate continuing to be active on our opportunistic share repurchase program, while also evaluating further increases to our dividend which currently delivers a 2.2% yield based on current share price. In yesterday's release we adjusted our 2019 production growth guidance to 17%, which is in the midpoint of our prior range of 16% to 18%. This implies a 25% increase in our production for debt adjusted share highlighting the impact of our ongoing share repurchases and debt reduction which will continue to allow us further accrete our growth per share adjusted over time.","We also reaffirmed our 2019 capital budget range, of $800 million to $820 million. For the full-year, we remain on track to deliver between $500 million and $525 million of positive free cash flow, representing a 7% free cash flow yield based on an average NYMEX price assumption of $2.60, which is derived from the average of the actual settlements for the first 10 months of the year and recent strip prices for November and December. At this price assumption we also expect to deliver a return on capital employed of 20% to 22%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 38% to 42% in 2019.","As you will recall, we provided a preliminary 2020 plan on the second quarter earnings call that is expected to deliver full-year production growth of 5% or 7% to 8% or a debt adjusted per share basis based on a preliminary capital budget range of $700 million to $725 million. We continue to believe this moderated growth plan is appropriate strategy for maximizing shareholder value in 2020 given it provides the best combination of free cash flow, return on capital employed, growth in per share metrics assuming a $2.50 or higher NYMEX price. However, subsequent to the second quarter earnings call, the 2020-2021 NYMEX forward curve has continued to decline to levels below the $2.50 NYMEX budget price.","As a result, we incorporated a slide in our investor material, back in August that highlighted Cabot's ability to deliver competitive free cash flow in 2020 under a $575 million maintenance capital plan assuming prices continue to remain lower than our original budget price assumption. This maintenance capital plan, which includes non-drilling and completion capital will allow the company to hold fourth quarter 2020 production levels flat to the midpoint of our fourth quarter 2019. Net production guidance range of approximately 2.4 Bcf per day, resulting in 2% to 3% growth in full year production per debt-adjusted share, while still generating excess free cash flow after our newly increased dividend commitments even at a $2 NYMEX price assumption.","Both the growth plan and the maintenance plan assume a moderate amount of curtailments during the shoulder season based on expectations of normal pipeline maintenance, higher line pressure and weaker spot market prices. We are currently in the process and be evaluating both scenarios to determine which plan will deliver the most value for our shareholders in 2020, while also positioning the company for continued the value creation in 2021.","Ultimately, our outlook on natural gas prices for both 2020 and 2021 will dictate our plan forward, as we mentioned on the second quarter call, there are still numerous variables that will be better understood as we navigate through the winter withdrawal season, including the impacts of weather, they continued reduction and operating activity levels across North America natural gas basins associated gas production growth and continue natural gas demand growth primarily from exports in a 250 or higher natural.","NYMEX price regime we believe the growth scenario delivers selling combination of free cash flow returns and per share growth while positioning the company for continued growth in 2021. In a sub 250 NYMEX environment, we believe the maintenance capital scenario allows us to maximize our free cash flow available to opportunistically repurchase more of our outstanding shares and a low price environment, while compromising some growth in a per share metrics, which we believe is prudent if the expectation for natural gas prices remains challenged in 2020 and 2021.","As a result, we plan to communicate our final 2020 plan to the market on the fourth quarter call in late February once we have a more refined near and mid-term outlook on the natural gas markets. Either way, both plans are designed to deliver a combination of strong free cash flow generation, high return on capital employed, continued return of capital shareholders, low financial leverage and growth and production and reserves per share while remain optimistic that better days are ahead of us for natural gas prices. We believe our business model is extremely resilient and will continue to deliver compelling financial metrics, even in the lows of the natural gas price cycle that compares favorably not only across the energy sector, but against the broader energy markets as well.","And Eily, with that, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operation Instructions] Our first question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen.","David Deckelbaum","Good morning, Dan, and Scott, Matt, everyone, thanks for taking my questions.","Dan Dinges","You bet, David.","David Deckelbaum","Just curious, Dan, as you as you look out and you're weighing all of these factors now for what you're going to spend this next year. You've talked about I guess there's probably lots of different iterations of plans or what you think the NYMEX price is going to be next year. In the past, you've also -- I think been mindful of market share and keeping your place in the pipe, I guess with other people slowing down, are you less concerned about that now? And I guess as you think about the implications for 2021, which you all laid out today in the press release, how do you think about I guess the optimum program for where you're most efficient, so that you know if you're operating in a flattish band of commodities, or a narrow channel between 240 and 260 capital is best optimized and crews are best optimized as opposed to having to change things from year-to year?","Dan Dinges","Yes, David, you're right. There's a lot of variables that we're looking, a lot of sensitivities. What we try to do in laying out the plan, both the maintenance plan and the growth plan, is look at it as kind of book-ins right now with the knowledge we have and some of our early expectations of what we might see in natural gas prices. Book-ins being that we feel like that on a maintenance program we can deliver everything we're delivering today to the shareholders. And we focus on that, and we focus on the financial metrics. We think we can do that in a maintenance program if you had this steady state. And basically we've kind of been in this narrow bandwidth of natural gas prices for an extended period of time as is.","So, navigating in between the book-ins maintenance and this growth that we've laid out, we're comfortable in that zone right now and kind of toggling back and froth and in-between that fairway we think is a prudent spot to land. And we'll continue to look at the market and look at the tea leaves and what our best estimate it is for natural gas prices as it rolls forward, but trying to continue to do what we've done in the past, i.e., protect our balance sheet, show a little bit of growth or have return on capital, return of capital both in dividends and share buybacks, we're going to continue doing the same, and I think our history shows that we're prudent in how we're managing that.","Our position has been to give back 50% of our free cash flow. When we said today, where we've given back 100%, which illustrates that. As our balance sheet stays strong, the strip price stays in a bandwidth that we're comfortable generating, that we're going to generate free cash flow, we're prepared to go deeper than just the 50%. So we'll know -- have more clarity in February, and we'll get a little bit more precise in February, but we kind of look at what we've laid out here as the booking [ph].","David Deckelbaum","I appreciate the color on that, Dan. And I guess just as a quick follow-up to that. As you go into '20, I guess this maintenance plan or lower plan, we should just think of it as sort of a holistic slowdown in activity, there isn't necessarily a high grading component there, it would just be moving slower through, like HN8 [ph], the general program that you've already laid out?","Dan Dinges","Yes, David, I think that's a fair assumption, yes.","David Deckelbaum","Thank you, guys.","Dan Dinges","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.","Leo Mariani","Hey guys. Just a question around sort of fourth quarter production guidance here, certainly noted that you had quite a few well completions in the third quarter. I think the number was 29. And I guess your guidance, you're not expecting much growth, and midpoint basically flat in fourth quarter. Just wanted to get a sense of sort of what the dynamic is there. Are you guys expecting some potential maintenance or downtime in the fourth quarter? Or what can you kind of tell us about that?","Dan Dinges","Yes, we're experiencing maintenance time right now, and we have through most of October. We've incorporated that into our guidance. There's nothing unusual operationally or performance-wise that's affecting that [indiscernible]. We're in a shoulder period, maintenance happens historically as this time. There has been, as an example, on one of the weekends in earlier part of October I know the day rate gas that we had was -- it was a bad weekend, and we curtailed a little bit of gas over a weekend because we didn't like the price. So, it's all normal operations, Leo.","Leo Mariani","Okay. Now, that great color for sure. And I guess just back to your comment around the band between maintenance scenario and the growth scenario, it makes perfect sense. And you guys are basically $2.50 on the growth scenario. And just wanted to get a sense of what do you guys kind of see as the band on that maintenance, is that closer to that $2.00 level where you still generate free cash flow, just trying to kind of put some parameters around the gas price associated with the maintenance CapEx.","Dan Dinges","Yes, we're just kind of giving two plans that would allow us with our price assumptions that would allow us to keep our plan rolling forward, as David mentioned, is it kind of like moving through the plan just at a slower pace, and that's what it is. We really look at the price and where we are in February and we're going to think the in between what we've indicated and that in between is somewhere in between a $575 million maintenance program and a $700 million to $725 million 5% growth program on absolute basis.","Leo Mariani","All right, now, I think that makes a lot of sense. Okay. I guess just on your stock buyback here, obviously you guys have not been shy last couple of quarters, buying back, substantial stock much as that you said you would here. How do you think about the buyback versus dividend increases? Is it as simple as when the price is a lot lower on the stock that you start to favor the buyback more than more robust dividend increases? How do you sort of think about that internally?","Dan Dinges","We have that discussion with the board, and the board is fully in tune. What our strategy is and opportunistically it is our process. We don't have a scripted buyback program. And when you look at the, sum of the volatility that we've seen in the market and mainly as a result of commodity price expectations, then we've been in the market and we bought back some shares. We look at the dividend more long-term, the dividend is continually increasing since we started in '17, increasing dividends. This was the fifth increase we've provided to shareholders. And we're not just jumping out with a big number. We're just kind of moving it forward at 2.2% yield is above for the most part above the class out there, and we're comfortable with that. So we look at it in tandem. And again, just by definition, opportunistically, it's just when we feel like the market is going to allow us to be in the market to buyback.","Leo Mariani","All right, thank you very much.","Dan Dinges","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Holly Stewart of Scotia Howard Weil.","Holly Stewart","Good morning, gentlemen.","Dan Dinges","Hello, Holly.","Holly Stewart","Dan, maybe just to follow-up on David's question, he talked about the maintenance plan moving at a slower pace in 2022. So should we assume, with that plan versus the original plan, sort of similar rig in crew cadence? Or would this be sort of a duck building inventory? Just trying to kind of put some parameters around it?","Dan Dinges","Yes, Holly. It'll be a little bit of both. We have Phil is sitting here at the table with me. Him and his crew up there in Pittsburgh are in negotiations now for both rigs and frac crews. Those negotiations are as you might suspect, are considering what we're laying out to the public as a maintenance program and a growth program. For the maintenance program, we don't need three full rigs throughout the year and we don't need two full frac crews for the year. So trying to work both in and full respect of our service providers, but also be able to accomplish some optionality for us on rigs and frac crew. Those are the discussions they're having right now and trying to find that good balance between what our needs are and certainly trying to allow the service providers to be as efficient as they possibly can, on delivering what they do to us.","Holly Stewart","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe one for Jeff, just very strong basis during the quarter, versus kind of where midweek all settled out, anything sort of unusual or maybe just to highlight here going forward and then we're in also during the quarter and then as I look at the 2020 assumption that you guys have in the guidance, anything to think through right now, obviously we've got some seasonal weakness but just trying to get a bigger picture view in that?","Jeffrey Hutton","Yes, sure, Holly. You're correct, of course, and the strong basis differential for the year, I think we're coming in line probably close to $0.45 under which is obviously big improvement over 2018 and much better improvement over 2017 and 2016, but our outlook consist of our very comprehensive sales files with the future outlook on our differentials and combine all that with what the subjective piece that we put on it to give the guidance, it does look very favorable. There is in-basin demand continues to inch-up a little bit, the overall demand picture is very good. We did have some hiccups, I guess, on basis in September, and October with typical shorter month, it was an opposite. We've had massive storage injections all year. And then we've had, Cove Point had their maintenance program in September. So we continue to have the fall hiccups on differentials, but the longer-term outlook is very, very positive, and we're happy that all the in-basin project and the takeaway that's been established up there over the last three, four years has finally proven itself to be the answer to our basis issues.","Holly Stewart","Good color, thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley.","Drew Venker","Hi, good morning, everybody. I just got a follow-up on the comments about the breakeven prices and protecting company and the returns to downside. Is there a price at which you might allow production to decline? It sounds like from your comments, you already have to get to very low price, and you could still be generating free cash at $2, so, curious if you guys have thought through that scenario?","Dan Dinges","Well, we think of all the scenarios, Drew. But as far as really what our outlook is today again thinking we're going to have more clarity and be better prepared to offer what our 2020 program is going to be in February. We feel like that the bandwidth that we provided on maintenance and growth is a reasonable guidance with our expectations today and if you go prices weigh down to $2 or below. And if it's instantaneous, or it's in any given month, we're not going to have a knee jerk reaction to that. If again we see sustainable prices continue to lead and will react and just and counter to that, if we see that the with the less rigs in the Northeast and less frac crews anticipated in the Northeast, if we see that and that has an enhancement on pricing then we'll react to that, but quite frankly we feel like that the two programs we laid out is probably going to cover what our near-term expectations are.","Drew Venker","That's fair and thanks for the color. I guess everything conversely, if prices are better, I guess really thinking probably from your perspective beyond 2020. You talked about an activity price I believe around mid single digit growth kind of for the next few years. What price would you need to target some higher growth rate or where your CapEx based on returns would drive higher growth in that mid single digit range?","Dan Dinges","Yes, we'd make -- that decision would be made the same way we're making a decision today. Our priority focuses on returning value to shareholders. We recognize that shareholders like to see a return both in dividends and buybacks. So we'll focus on those financial metrics as priority first, growth is in our opinion is secondary, if we can deliver the financial metrics and have a moderate growth program. We think in this macro environment that that is the prudent course of action to take and even with higher prices, I think there is a lot of shareholders out there including a lot of shareholders around this table that would like to see value come back to them, as opposed to just see growth for the sake of growth.","Drew Venker","Okay.","Dan Dinges","We'll just balance that. It's a high class problem, if we get to higher prices, and we do think higher prices are in our future, just not our immediate future.","Drew Venker","Okay, so just to clarify, I'm sure I'm characterizing this correctly. So something like a $2.75 or $3 price, you might increase growth a bit, but probably not substantially?","Dan Dinges","Our guidance right now is what we put out there, and that's the $700 million to $725 million, 2020 capital program.","Drew Venker","Understood, thanks Dan.","Dan Dinges","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Dan Dinges","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer","Can you give us just the latest update on cycle times, well costs and how they're evolving versus productivity and I realized the year is not over yet, but do you expect that this will lead to lower flat or higher signing in development costs per Mcfe this year in your overall supply costs?","Dan Dinges","Well, cycle times we continue to eke-out cycle times, I know Phil in presentation to the board illustrated a couple of different areas where we're continuing to pick-up ","minutes on each connection and looking at AI on the drilling side and Steve Novakowski is looking at all of those nuances that can improve cycle time, Jim Edwards on his logistics on the operations side is also focused on how we save a minute here, minute there and they've done an excellent job, they continue to do those things that will enhance production or cash cost as you see we're down this quarter. So we're entirely comfortable with continuing to try to squeeze what we can in cycle times. I don't know Phil you have like one or two things, one or two things that we pointed to in the board meeting that in the drilling for example, that we're doing.","Phil Stalnaker","Right, and some of the things is looking at the flat time we have and so some of the things we're doing is an offline team meeting where we'll as we run casing and we walk to the next hole, and then go ahead and seem at the casing offline. And that saves us, several hours of time, we're looking at intelligent software packages in all the rigs, like Dan said, looking at connection time, looking at how you're bringing your pumps and weight on bit, again that same this time. And then we've seen more improvements in like bit designs, and we continue to save hours there. So again, all this adds up over time, additional efficiency saving to us.","Brian Singer","And then I guess on the F&D side on the capital costs per proved, when you think about well costs, and then your average EUR this year, do you expect that presence that you would have lower versus flat versus other changes in F&D?","Dan Dinges","Well, I'm going to have a look at that once Steve Lindeman kind of gets the year-end reserve report to us and what our F&D is going to be, I'll be able to answer that much more clearly Brian in February.","Brian Singer","Great, thanks. And then I guess my follow-up is you highlighted and Jeff you highlighted just the strong local demand and on a longer-term basis based on the growth rates that you are currently envisioning for Cabot over the longer-term. Are you looking at underwriting incremental pipeline takeaway? Is that even worthwhile, do you see strong enough local demand to support Cabot's needs?","Dan Dinges","Yes, Brian, this is obviously it's ongoing here. We are still involved day-to-day on looking at new projects, obviously, with the intent of improving realizations and there may be a niche project here and there for us in the future. We're very much looking forward to Leidy South, it is on schedule and of course we have 250,000 of capacity on that project. Whether or not there's another two or three Bcf a day pipeline out of the Northeast and whether or not that's necessary at this point is still being studied. But I think we're positioned very well to take advantage of the opportunities that we've worked long hard for last three or four years, but again, if in-basin demand projects particularly offer better price realizations and keep the gas in basin we will look strongly at that.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell","Hi, Dan, and congratulations on the quarter.","Dan Dinges","Thank you.","Jeffrey Campbell","I just want to ask one question going back to some of the macro stuff that you talked about earlier, you mentioned, looking at reduction in Nat gas activity levels and also deceleration of associated Nat gas production growth. I was just wondering hey is there NAT gas or an oil price range that you think will generate a meaningful pullback and Nat gas activity and do you think this might already be underway?","Dan Dinges","I think it's underway, Jeffery. I think the - when you look at the NAT gas basin you look at the some of the stress and tension in the in the market and to make capital allocation decisions in a way that one protect balance sheet or does not do any further damage to a balance sheet is extremely important in this environment. We've seen some releases recently on where the dead towers are, and how you manage the dead towers. We all had conversations and talk about the re-determinations and the borrowing base coming up, and that's being managed proactively, I think, right now by the industry. But I also think that there's a clear understanding that over allocating capital into a macro environment that is already stretched or saturated in some ways is maybe not as prudent as it should be for financial metrics. We're also saying the ills of prior decisions on foreign transportation commitments that have been made in the marketplace. I think some of the additional drilling that might be taking place today is an effort to just fulfill commitments, and in that particular area. And I think that's influencing a little bit of market, I think that will dissipate with time. I don't think that's a sustainable model, if in fact the natural gas price stays in the range it is.","I think it creates issues maybe with the future issues with balance sheets, if that continues. So I do think that you're seeing some reduction in rigs and frac crews, take one frac crew we know it's going to be down at least one frac crew up in the northeast as well. That's probably 1,500 stages on an annual basis, 1500 stages is a lot of gas compared to having that crack crew there, the same with the drilling rigs, the rigs, you might you lose drop one rig, and that's probably going to be plus or minus 200,000 lateral feet, that you're going to be taking out of future gas production that would be available for the market. So, I think you're seeing it and I think you will continue to see that rationalization occur. And the being able to say that reduction, I think is if we can get the sum of the cost of doing business down then I think companies will be more inclined to not have to grow into a growth profile to fulfill their objectives, I like it's going on and I think it's prudent.","Jeffrey Campbell","Great, I appreciate it. That was really good color. Thank you.","Dan Dinges","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Dan, you and your team there.","Dan Dinges","Hi, Charles.","Charles Meade","I want to go back to something I believe I heard you say in your prepared comments where you said that under the maintenance scenario, you would be buying back more shares? Is that the correct read, and assuming it is, does that reflect just the fact that you'd have more free cash flow in that maintenance scenario, or is there something more there that under that maintenance scenario, you're more shifted to buybacks versus dividends?","Dan Dinges","No, the implication is that we're going to remain opportunistic on buybacks. It's not saying we're going to buyback more, it is connecting the dots, and assuming that under the maintenance program, our assumption is that the commodity strip is going to be less, and that with a reduced commodity strip, we think there could be pressure on the share price, and if in fact there is pressure on the share price, then that would create that opportunity to be in the market again buying back shares.","Charles Meade","Got it, that's helpful, and I appreciate your clarity there. And then second question, hopefully maybe it's just a quick one. From my seat following that -- this is on constitution pipeline, it looks like there're some signs of life there, does it look the same from your point of view and you guys as equity holders, is that something worth talking about?","Dan Dinges","Yes, I'll just let Jeff make a brief update comment.","Jeffrey Hutton","Hello, Charles. You're right. There was a small battle of [indiscernible] ongoing war with New York over compensation. It's the fact that Burke finally agreed and the waiver did occur in New York. D.C. was positive. All that said, I'll just repeat what the partners public outlook is on the project and that is it needs further evaluation, and so, we are taking the next steps to look at the all aspects of the project, the -- further permitting the commercial aspects of the project, and sometime over in the next few months we'll try to get collectively decide on path forward, or -- and again, it's a small win, but there's still a lot of work to be done.","Charles Meade","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dan Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan Dinges","Thank you all, and thank you for the good questions. We look forward to seeing you once again, and visit in February of 2020. We have FULL expectations that Cabot is going to continue to deliver as we have in the past. Thank you again.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Garry, and good morning to all. Thanks for joining us today for Cabot's second quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are the members of Cabot's executive team. I would first like to emphasize that on this morning's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.","For the second quarter of 2018, Cabot generated adjusted net income of $57.9 million or $0.13 per share, compared to $0.14 per share for the prior year comparable quarter. Our adjusted net income for the quarter was impacted by $51.1 million exploration dry hole expense resulting from our decision to cease investment on one of our two exploratory operating areas. Excluding this one-time charge, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter would have been approximately $0.09 higher.","Daily equivalent production for the quarter was 1.895 Bcfe per day, which came in at the high end of our guidance range and represented a sequential increase of 4% relative to the first quarter when adjusting for the Eagle Ford Shale that closed at the end of February. Our unit cost continued to improve as we posted an 8% decline in cost relative to the prior year comparable quarter. Excluding the previously mentioned exploratory dry hole expense and a onetime noncash interest expense related to income tax reserves, our unit cost would have improved by 24% relative to prior year comparable period and by 4% sequentially relative to the first quarter of 2018.","Despite strong production volumes continued improvement in our cash operating cost, the Company did generate a free cash flow deficit during the second quarter, driven primarily by lower than anticipated realized prices in May and June and the funding of the majority of the remaining capital associated with our equity investment in Atlantic Sunrise pipeline project. We anticipate a return to positive free flow generation in the third quarter based on our expectations of improved price realizations and higher volumes.","On the pricing front, I would highlight that while May and June bid week prices were about 18% lower than April, which placed downward pressure on our realized prices for the quarter. We have seen an improvement in Northeast Pennsylvania pricing with July bid week prices settling 15% higher than the second quarter average and early indications imply August prices will look similar to July. Based on the forward curve, our third quarter differentials would be 10% to 15% better than the second quarter.","On our share repurchase program there in the second quarter of 2018, Cabot did repurchase an additional 11.6 million shares at a weighted average price of $23.54, bringing our year-to-date total to 20 million shares repurchased. Including our year-to-date dividend payments, we have returned approximately $535 million of capital this year represented a total shareholder yield of 5%. At our board meeting yesterday, we obtained approval to increase our authorization by an additional 20 million shares, which effectively reloaded program back to 30 million shares or approximately 7% of our current shares outstanding.","Given our strong balance sheet and our outlook for continued free cash flow expansion, we remain committed to opportunistically executing on our share repurchase program as long as we continue to see a disconnect between our share price and our view on the Company's intrinsic value. Since we reactivated our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2017, we have reduced our shares outstanding by 5% to 441 million shares and assuming we fully execute on the current 30 million authorization. We will reduce shares outstanding to levels lower than before our equity issues in early 2016.","Moving to the exploration front, as I mentioned, during the second quarter, we recorded an exploratory dry hole expense associated with one of our two exploratory operating areas. Based on the data we gathered over the last year, we have ultimately made the decision to cease capital allocation to this area. Over a year ago, we announced our intention to allocate a nominal amount of capital to exploration. We were clear with the market that our primary focus was on generating returns focused growth from the Marcellus shale and returning an increasing portion of capital to shareholders via dividend and share repurchases. However, at the same time, we did see the merit in allocating a limited portion of our capital budget to testing new concepts that have the potential to create long-term value.","We're also very clear that we have an extremely high hurdle for capital allocation internally given the returns we generate from our world-class asset in the Marcellus. If a new venture did not generate competitive full cycle rates return, provide meaningful inventory depth and resource life and the ability to be self funding in a low commodity price environment and we would have no problem walking away, and that is where we find ourselves today as it relates to this exploratory area. We will also continue to test our second exploratory area and plan to provide an update on this area on the third quarter 2018 earnings call in October. Our financial position remains strong as ever with over 2.4 billion of liquidity and a net debt to trailing 12 month EBITDAX ratio of 0.8 times at quarter end.","Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we did close on our previously announced Haynesville divestiture for approximately $30 million. Additionally, we paid down our $230 million 6.5% senior note that matured this month with cash from the balance sheet. While this transaction had no impact on net debt to EBITDAX, it did improve our absolute debt to EBITDAX from 1.5 times to 1.3 times, which is right in the fairway of our target leverage range of 1 to 1.5 times. We are forecasting a continued deleveraging over time as our cash flows expand in the coming quarters driven by increased production volumes and improving price differentials resulting in additional balance sheet capacity for future capital deployment.","Operationally, we delivered another strong performance in the Marcellus during the second quarter with volumes up 4% sequentially despite meaningful downtimes both planned and unplanned throughout the quarter. Our production guidance for the third quarter of 2.1 to 2.2 Bcf per day of net production represents an 11% to 16% sequential increase relative the second quarter and is driven by our expectations of placing 37 wells on production throughout the quarter. Due to our year-to-date actual volumes being slightly lower than originally budgeted primarily resulting from delays in third-party compressor stations in the first quarter and downtime on Transco and Millennium during the second quarter, we have lowered the top end of our annual production guidance range from 10% to 15% to 10% to 12%.","Additionally, we're guiding more conservatively for the second half of the year given our unprecedented ramp in production that's occurring during a time a year when we tend to see some issues with high line pressure and pipeline maintenance. As a result, we are much rather air on the side of the conservatism. As it relates to our asset productivity, we continue to complete additional wells in the Upper Marcellus together more data related to our enhanced Gen 5 well completions. As we have highlighted previously, we have 30 Upper Marcellus wells that were completed with older completion designs that are on average tracking our 2.9. Bcf per thousand lateral feet type curve.","Our ongoing work continues to support the unique and incremental Upper Marcellus reservoir independent of the lower Marcellus. We are extremely confident in our resource potential in both the upper and lower Marcellus and that both zones productivity will deliver top tier economics when compared to the vast majority, if not all, oil and gas resource plays across the U.S. As we reported last quarter, we have enjoyed significant progress on multiple fronts regarding infrastructure and our in-basin demand projects. As a short recap, we announced the Dominion Cove Point LNG facility was placed in-service April 9th and the subsequent notification that our 20 year supply agreement with Pacific Summit Energy is now in effect.","We have been fulfilling that obligation through a combination of purchase staff and equity production. As I'm sure you are aware, William last week announced Atlantic Sunrise project is very near completion, and their expectations fall in-service subject to weather conditions is during the second half of August. This new greenfield pipeline is Cabot's unique transportation path to supply 100% of our LNG commitment with a direct connection to Cobot's equity production and Susquehanna County.","We are excited to deliver approximately 350 million per day via Atlantic Sunrise to Cove Point in the very near future. Additionally, let me remind everyone that Cabot's 15 year agreement with Washington Gas Light for approximately 500 million cubic foot per day along with several additional sales agreement will also take effect with the in-service of Atlantic Sunrise project. In summary, this long-awaited new pipeline infrastructure positions Cabot to deliver approximately 1 Bcf per day of production to new markets with significantly better price realizations.","Moving on to our in-basin power projects. First, the Lackawanna Energy Center was placed in-service on June 1st. As expected, train 1 is burning approximately 70 million cubic feet per day and has been very consistent in its early operation. As a reminder, train 2 and 3 remain on schedule in-service. And on October 1st and December 1st, respectively in fact train 2 is currently receiving test gas as the developer takes additional steps towards commissioning.","Regarding Moxie Freedom power generation facility, we had previously reported that an early in-service date of June 1 was obtainable. Unfortunately, the facility required some additional modifications and further testing. However, we have been notified recently that the full in-service of Freedom plant could be as early as the first week of August. We are currently providing large volumes of test gas initially awaiting final go-ahead for this 160 million per day project.","These three projects will drive a significant improvement in differentials going forward resulting from access to premium markets post-Atlantic Sunrise in-service and exposure to seasonal higher power prices. These are very exciting times for Cabot as our long-term infrastructure and growth plans have finally come together and will provide I think huge benefits for years to come.","In summary, we continue to believe our differentiate strategy of high return growth coupled with increasing return on capital and return of capital is unappreciated by the market due primarily to general apathy for natural gas as a model. But I think if you replace natural gas with another widget and delivered the same financial return and leverage metrics, we would -- and that we\u2019re delivering today in our year-to-date share price performance would likely look significantly better than they do today.","With that being said, I have been in this industry long enough to know that sentiment around commodity will change over time. I especially believe to be the case today with natural gas both near-term given the current storage deficit, to a 5-year average is the lightest as being since 2014 and long term as we\u2019re nearing major inflection points for natural gas demand from exports. Regard to where the sentiment on the commodity is I can promise you that the team at Cabot will continue to execute on this strategy in an effort to create long-term value for our shareholders.","Gerry, with that, I\u2019d be more than happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Drew Venker","Dan, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the Upper Marcellus test that you drilled in the past. I know it\u2019s something in the focus of yours right now. Can you just talk about what assumption do you made in that in case you\u2019ve made out before like a 20-year production forecast? What assumptions are made in that forecast for the Upper Marcellus?","Dan Dinges","20-year forecast that you\u2019re talking about we\u2019ve assumed where we\u2019re today and what we\u2019ve seen Drew with the 30 completions that have been completed in our old technique. We\u2019ve assumed the 2.9 in that forecast.","Drew Venker","And then, on the focus on return of cash to shareholders, the incremental buyback today obviously positive with -- what you guys have said in the past more I think you used to have more preference for buybacks, but also would like to grow the dividend over time. Can you just update us on thoughts on dividend?","Dan Dinges","Yes, on the dividends each board meeting, we had discussion on dividend. We made it clear when we started ramping the dividend and we took kind of incremental step last year. And we\u2019ve taken a smaller step again beginning of this year but our commentary at that time was that it was our intent and the board\u2019s intent to see the commissioning of these infrastructure projects that are imminent to commission. And we felt it was prudent at the time to make sure that we're not going to be any delays. We\u2019ve all experienced the pains of the delays of some of these projects and getting them commissioned. So we thought it was prudent to keep the dividend where it is right now once we get the cash flow coming in the door from the commission and these infrastructure projects, we would then again revisit the dividend policy.","Drew Venker","Thanks a lot Dan. Just one last one from me. When you all started this exploration play process I think in the beginning that you said if you didn't have success then you would market the acreage on the backend. Is that still the plan?","Dan Dinges","We've taken the write-down on some of the capital expenditures that we spent and we have -- the acreage is still intact, and we will go through that process on the back end.","Operator","The next question comes from Leo Mariani with NatAlliance Securities. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani","Hey guys just a question around CapEx here, obviously, you had a tiny bump in your full year guide. But just trying to get a sense of where we should see kind of CapEx over the next couple quarters? Is 2Q the high point? Does that come down at all in 3Q? I know you got quite a few more completions in 3Q, the thinking you can sort of do to kind of about any of that quarterly apex cadence over the next couple of quarters here.","Dan Dinges","Well, our guidance on CapEx for the full year will remain intact, as we bring on wells into the infrastructure, we'll continue to complete those wells and bring those wells inline. So, we have a little bit of a ramp up heading into the commissioning of Atlantic Sunrise.","Leo Mariani","Okay and I guess just looking at the share repurchases obviously you guys came out and increased the program here. But I guess if I just sort of look at that, high level we have kind of seen some weakness in NYNEX gas prices and you guys also had this debt repayment that you had to recently make here over the last couple weeks. Irrespective of that stuff, I mean, should you guys still plan on being pretty aggressive here in the in the second half of the year with the buyback program?","Dan Dinges","Yes, Leo, the conversation again at our board meeting this week was specifically along the lines that I have mentioned in the past and that was that our authorization is not optics, it is proaction and that it is our intent to execute on the authorization that the board has granted. So the take away would be that we fully intend to continue our program that we have implemented.","Leo Mariani","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just lastly on the Upper Marcellus wells that you mentioned, completing some wells you know recently here. Just any kind of early indications out of those and when might you have a little bit more robust look at those for the market here?","Dan Dinges","Well, the early indications are wrapped up in my comment that we continue to believe and that our Upper Marcellus is incremental and accretive reservoir independent of the lower. We work as indicated that and we're also of the opinion that our completion techniques will improve off of the 2.9 per thousand foot lateral.","Operator","The next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade","One quick question for you and then maybe a bigger second question. As far as the completion pace that you have in the back half of this year. I'd like this disclosure where you gave out, what, 37 in Q3 but then about half of that Q4. Can you give us a sense of what we should be looking for going into 2019 on whether you're more going to be on that 37 sort of pace or on that 20 pace? And then, are you moving frac crews? Are you bringing any frac crews or sending them home? What's the outlook?","Dan Dinges","The increased second half 2018 has always been in our design, as we get to the commissioning of Atlantic Sunrise. So that level of activity and timing this activity is right on cue. In regard to '19, we don\u2019t anticipate bringing in any additional frac crews than what we have done in 2018. And we are going to stay fairly consistent with our completions in '19 and some of that is depended upon -- and the timing is depended upon how many wells we have on any given pad and how many stages in the lateral links on those pads.","We had recently a long pad -- not a long pad -- a pad that had long laterals and 12 wells. And we had been on that location for good while completing that 24x7. And we have another pad that in that particular area of the field, we had 6 wells. And those 6 wells were not quite as long at least a couple of more not quite as long as say the 12 wells pad. So to look at I won't say lumpy because we are scheduling these things out fairly consistently with turning in line in areas of the field that returns these in line. Then we have our forward looking plan for that. But I think through '19 as being fairly consistent with what we have seen in '18.","Charles Meade","And it sounds like you've spent several months on that 12 well pad. But going back to a comment you made in your prepared remarks about guidance being conservative in the back half of the year. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about that because as I look at your guidance you are guiding for an incremental 250 million a day about in 3Q over 2Q, and I just start add up the pieces whether it's the -- to be honest, I don\u2019t have the numbers for this piece, but the Transco and Millennium downtime but then also you have got that first train of Lackawanna on that\u2019s probably 55 to 60 net to you, right. And then you have got some volumes from market that for you and then you have got really the big whopper with Atlantic Sunrise. So when I start to add those pieces together and I recognize that Atlantic Sunrise volumes are not all incremental on big one, but I started to add those pieces together. And it feels to me like I must be missing something on what's going to happen with sequential volumes?","Dan Dinges","Are you missing the conservative part?","Charles Meade","Well, I -- maybe the magnitude of it, Dan. But it's -- maybe -- I appreciative your comments, but you may be you said is -- I know in the past he said all of that -- all of Atlantic Sunrise, when it comes online, are given the take in volumes that go from, that are in the local market, onto Atlantic Summers. But is it possible that you not actually be delivering your Bcf a day on within a couple of weeks of startup that you going to ramp to that?","Dan Dinges","Atlantic Sunrise?","Charles Meade","Right.","Dan Dinges","Charles, we\u2019re planning on utilizing the capacity available in at Atlantic Sunrise as soon as it is available. The connection to our gathering system of the upstream portion of Atlantic Sunrise is designed to take the volume of gas that we committed to and is our full intent to deliver the gas as soon as Atlantic Sunrise will take it. One other thing on our conservative, I wouldn't try to be cute on the comment on conservatives, Charles, but one of the things that I think is relevant, the ramp up and shifting in a small area a Bcf a gas and coordinating two power units that are coming on at the same time and moving gas around in a small geographic area, is done with a -- the switch of the valves I guess, but it's multiple valves it\u2019s multiple coordination to get it done and get all smoothed out.","So in light of the time of the year which the shorter month time of the year, when you get a little bit of the early cool weather, it ramps up the pressure in the pipes, the pipes that are within the basin. And the amount in volumes that the pipelines will accept at a higher pressure starts creating some reduction in the volumes that you're going to be able to put into the pipe. That has happened every year back to back, back to back without exception. So the timing of that and when that occurs is a very difficult proposition to be able to forecast. What we have done is, is made some swag, it's saying, okay, how much gas is going to be knocked off by higher line pressure into the pipeline, us moving the gas out into Atlantic Sunrise should help, but to what extent is still a swag.","We\u2019ve had now as an example that you know we thought maybe there was a chance of Atlantic Sunrise coming on in July. Well, we've kind of moved it to the back half of August. That is a large swing large volume of gas being moved around out there. When you look at the Lackawanna plant and it\u2019s come on very good and it's kind of operated in a timely fashion and we\u2019re happy with that. In our forecast when we look at the deliveries of end of Moxie Freedom plant, we had thought June would've been a good time to fill that up and they thought the same thing. And I'm sure they still think the same thing however to line out the facility to get it commissioned to the fullest extent under all the protocol and safety reasons that commissioning takes place, and has a test period, that's what they're in right now and they're tweaking that.","Well that goes from June to August as possible date right now. How do you account for that Charles in your earlier forecast? Well, we try to do it and part of what we try to do is, plan on these contingencies and in fact, if we get delays or we see line pressure go up or we don't immediately get the full acceptance of the Bcf and Atlantic Sunrise, we forecast some of that contingency. If we can over jet and we can get on the high side of our numbers we're ecstatic about it but we think and it\u2019s been consistent with our policy and our demeanor to guide conservatively more so than aggressively. And we're comfortable with that.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","Looking at Slide 10 that Charles is just referencing and then taking and your remarks that 2019 completions will be fairly consistent with 2018. Does that imply that you see less variance from quarter-to-quarter than we had in 2018 and I'm bearing in mind that there were no completions in first quarter of '18?","Dan Dinges","That's getting fairly granular, Jeffrey. I'd have to get back to you with -- but my top line comment would be and my expectation is because I haven't looked at quarter to quarter to quarter, I've kind of looked at the entire guidance but I think the guidance is going to be fairly consistent throughout the year.","Matthew Kerin","Jeff, this is Matt. One thing I'd add is, we have to be careful about looking at quarterly turning lines because if we have an 8 well pad that's completed in the last week or two of the quarter and it get pushed into the next quarter that would drastically change the outcome. So we like to think about it more holistically as a full year. We just on slide 10 got a little bit more granular given we're a quarter away.","Jeffrey Campbell","No, I appreciate that. I think the reason I'm asking is that if you just look at it, it kind of looks like there's this huge push as Atlantic Sunrise is coming on and then there's backing off. But if in fact you had been able to complete wells in the first quarter of '18, this might have looked a little bit smoother and that doesn\u2019t challenge what you're just saying because pads can always slip a week or two and have a big effect on the quarter but that is really where I was trying to go.","Dan Dinges","Jeffrey, keep in mind on that point you just made as a reminder, we did not turn one well in line in the first quarter.","Jeffrey Campbell","Right, and that's kind of where I was trying to get at. I would assume in '19 if you don't have that kind of gap that things would look a little bit smoother over the course of the years as opposed to this big jump in the third quarter, which was probably predicated on Atlantic Sunrise and the first quarter of '18. The other question is. It sound like your bias for 2019 is to continue increasing lateral lines. Would 2018 average laterals at 8.3 thousand feet and those are the average? Do you think 2019 increases are going to be incremental or can that average move meaningfully longer?","Dan Dinges","I think it'd be incremental, right now. We have efforts ongoing to in any areas that we can to extend laterals and we will continue with that effort. Right now we think '19 is just going to be incremental if we are successful as again we have been throughout '17, throughout '18 to throw in longer laterals in the mix. We will continue to try to do that.","Operator","The next question comes from Bob Morris with Citi. Please go ahead.","Bob Morris","Dan, you hit on some of my questions. But let me just circle back on the exploration play that you didn\u2019t write off here. And you did mention you come back to the process and try to monetize what you do have there. But I know you can't disclose what it is, but can you give us some color on whether potentially it's economic even though it didn't meet you hurdle and there some value there you can find hydrocarbons in that it just didn't meet your current rate but might be attracted to someone else?","Dan Dinges","No, we did find hydrocarbons and there's some dynamics going on, as we are all aware of in the Permian. In the last couple of years working on this project, you are seeing near term headwinds on infrastructure out there. You have seen service cost increase out there in the last couple of years. And even though you have seen certainly an increase in the commodity price there's still some punitive differentials today and going to be apparent for a little bit longer till we get the pipeline build out there. But the results that -- we have gotten the field and consideration the other impacts that affect our return we made the decision not to move forward.","Bob Morris","And then of the $50 million write off you took how much of that were dollar spent this year in the $75 million budget for total exploration?","Matthew Kerin","That was too close. Bob, it was about 35 million this year 17 million related to last year.","Operator","The next comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","I wanted to ask on the competitive dynamic [indiscernible] it's the question you have gotten before. But as see asset maintain a balance sheet improved amongst some of the players. How do you -- the plans of others [indiscernible] through wells behind pipe ducks or rig activity influence the level of activity that you may gear towards in 2019?","Dan Dinges","I think that in looking at Appalachia and looking at natural gas, looking at macro dynamics of what's going on in the natural gas space. I think parties that have the ability to increase their profiles -- production profiles, complete ducks to move gas to a different price points to obtain better realizations, I think is a prudent course of action. If in fact that you have some gas under this environment moving into the same punitive realizations and ramping up gas into that type of environment, I think there's going to be a point in time when particularly for public companies that shareholders are probably going to want to see some kind of rational approach in the environment and moving gas into again oversupplied markets that create the lower realizations just like what we have dealt with now for a number of years.","And I would not be surprised to see some management take the opportunity to look at the space and try to get more efficient with their capital dollars -- highly allocated capital dollars in a way that would allow every dollar they spend to maybe obtain better realizations from the efficiency created by model that would have controlled growth, as opposed to growth just for the sake of growth. And every company has its own strategic initiatives its own internal complexities, but I just can't help believe with where we are in the natural gas space and the supply dynamics that everybody talks about out there that there\u2019s not conversations and a lot of boardrooms that talk about how we get more capital efficient with our allocation in a way that allows for there to be some rationalization in the marketplace.","Brian Singer","And then I wanted to follow up on the CapEx conversations that -- and questions that have already come up on the call just maybe add a little bit of more clarity. There\u2019s three different elements of the CapEx budget, the Marcellus upstream exploration then an investment in equity method investment. Is it fair to say that as we think about 2019, the investment in equity method investments go away because of Atlantic pipeline, Atlantic Sunrise pipeline pending design, explorations CBD depending on the second results of the second play and that the CapEx in the Marcellus seems that in your comments to be relatively flat in \u201919 versus \u201918. And when is the flex on share repurchase depending on the exploration side of the equation?","Dan Dinges","On the equity side, it is -- the answer is, yes, that the equity investment in 2019 goes away. We continue as I mentioned on the second exploratory effort. We continue to spin a little bit of capital there, very-very manageable on the capital allocation in that particular area. And on the allocation to our Marcellus, it\u2019s going to be fairly consistent with the allocations that we\u2019ve had this year.","Operator","The great question comes from David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","David Deckelbaum","Just curious I know like in the -- and you've reiterated your multiyear long-term outlook and free cash generation for various sensitivities. I know in those assumptions you have a lot of things around cost, but specifically I am curious about your assumptions on the LOE side. And if we should see any optimization at all or should we expect a step change in optimization at the field level, once you sort of fill in some of these larger volumes into a more unconstrained environment?","Dan Dinges","From our number that we're seeing in '18 I think it is safe to say looking at '19 that we would expect a tick down in our direct costs associated per unit.","David Deckelbaum","Okay and then just a little bit more color on the Moxie Freedom project. Did that plant originally begin testing gas in April and then the project needed to be re-modified after that? Or has it not tested gas yet?","Dan Dinges","Yes, David, I'll let -- Jeff has been kind of live in that project. I'll let him talk about that.","Jeffrey Hutton","Sure, David. Just to back up a minute. The project was originally scheduled for in server August 1st from the time we first started negotiating our contract and going through financing and the rest of that. So, they made a lot of progress on the construction front and was able to move up the in service date what we thought at one point would be around the June 1st date. And so, they did take a little bit of gas in April and took some larger volumes of test gas in May, and they have gone through a number of performance testing and emissions testing that sort of thing.","And on the specifics, I can't go into that on the -- and I would call very, very slight modifications that they're simply tweaking and finding the best way to operate the facility. This is a beautiful 1,000 megawatt facility that's kind of in any day now start up or COD event. And so, we're really excited about the facility, but it's again just some minor tweaks on how they plan to operate it surely and I wouldn\u2019t say anything much more than that.","David Deckelbaum","Appreciate that Jeff. And just the last one from me, on the exploration side, Dan, I know you kind of gave some guidance around how much capital was spent and the reasons why. Just curious if you could remind how many wells or zones have been tested? And then how does that compared to the second play with how comprehensive the evaluation is going to be?","Dan Dinges","Well, we had -- we had five wells that we tested and we tested several zone in our project, second project we will have similar number of wells and we'll be testing what we find in those wells.","Operator","The next question comes from Jane Trotsenko with Stifel.","Jane Trotsenko","Could you please update us on East project and what do we need to pay attention from a regulatory standpoint? And what's the probability of PennEast getting built?","Dan Dinges","Okay, Jane, I\u2019m going to turn that to Jeff to answer that, thank you.","Jeffrey Hutton","Yes, Jane. PennEast from our understanding and keep in mind that we are a little bit from position, we already shipped on that facility. But from the conversations that PennEast operations have had with the shipper group and the customer group. PennEast has not changed their disclosure for the second half of 2019. My understanding is that they made a lot of accomplishments on permitting in Pennsylvania.","They still have some remaining challenges in New Jersey to get their final permits there. I do understand that the PennEast owners all have our public companies have analyst calls coming up in a few weeks. And so, we will be watching that to see if they push that into back a little bit. But right now they continue to through surveys and building the information make sure to get the proper permits. And that\u2019s where it stands from our perspective.","Jane Trotsenko","My next question is should we expect any impact from maintenance on Transco line this quarter?","Jeffrey Hutton","No, from our understanding and the maintenance on Transco was early on. This year, we actually had two events just regular maintenance playgrounds that sort of thing. Of course we have the outage when time Cabot\/Williams gathering system into Atlantic Sunrise which is something that we had expected. So looking out we have no maintenance notices from any of the three pipelines.","Jane Trotsenko","And then the next question is on Atlantic Sunrise. It looks like a section of the Atlantic Sunrise is already on line. It's like 500 Bcfe COD. My understanding is that you are not flowing on the --- do you know if any gas flows on that section already?","Jeffrey Hutton","I didn\u2019t quite understand what section, you're specifically talking about. Let me just try to answer it this way. There's been gas introduced into the pipeline, we are aware of that. The commissioning process for the stations and the hydro testing of the pipe and of course all of the meters and regulation stations is ongoing. I can't -- as a shipper, we don't have the details of which sections of the pipe. There is actually jam packed in for example, but I do know that the commission is ongoing and that gas has been introduced into the pipe in certain areas.","Jane Trotsenko","And my last question is on the difference between first and the second exploratory areas. Is it only geographic allocation that different? Or is there something else to that?","Dan Dinges","You asking every identified the geographic area?","Jane Trotsenko","No, I\u2019m just trying to understand is it -- the board's exploratory areas are targeting Upper Marcellus. So the difference, is it on your geographically different locations? Or is it like different debt? I don\u2019t know different pressure or something else makes it -- you identify as separate exploratory operating areas?","Dan Dinges","Yes, the Upper Marcellus is not an exploratory project for us. And where we\u2019re allocating and identifying a second exploratory area is geographically different than the Marcellus.","Jane Trotsenko","So difference between the first and the second exploratory operating areas just solely based on geography right, all the allocation of the wells?","Dan Dinges","No. It\u2019s based on geology.","Jeffrey Hutton","Geology or away from in the Marcellus.","Jane Trotsenko","So it\u2019s geography and geology, but it\u2019s same Upper Marcellus. Is it the same Upper Marcellus into of all that you're testing, right?","Jeffrey Hutton","Let me clarify. The exploration projects that we\u2019ve are not in the Marcellus. They are located in different parts of the United States. The Marcellus is a development project. It has been for more than a decade.","Jane Trotsenko","So, the exploration result, so the dry hole to that you guys reported this quarter they\u2019re not related to Upper Marcellus, right?","Jeffrey Hutton","That\u2019s correct.","Jane Trotsenko","My last question sorry about this, the activity levels in Northeast Pennsylvania, do you see it becomes from other operators in front of Atlantic Sunrise coming online?","Dan Dinges","Activity levels?","Jane Trotsenko","Yes.","Dan Dinges","Yes, we keep track on the activity levels and going in the past activity levels have traditionally been a small ramp up at a summer period of time in anticipation of maybe moving some winter gas. That has occurred each year. The level of increased activity that we see up there right now is not atypical of that type of activity.","Jane Trotsenko","I see but it\u2019s not like really through the Atlantic Sunrise coming online and everybody is picking up drilling?","Dan Dinges","No.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Hall","A lot has been covered. I guess one thing as just about costs, you guys kind of reiterated the nearly 0.3 million coverage well costs. So if memory serves well, there has some inflation in it, spin some commentary around Northeast service cost pricing perhaps improving a little bit. Do you guys seeing any of that? Anticipate any of that? Just kind of curious on what the latest on well costs are for you guys?","Dan Dinges","We\u2019re fairly comfortable with a flat trajectory on the cost up there and we kind of benchmark review as Michael has been a $1,000 per lateral foot and we\u2019re pretty good with that.","Michael Hall","So then you don\u2019t anticipate any potential reduction on a near-term basis?","Dan Dinges","Well, keep in mind our major costs that we moved the needle are where we\u2019re contractually committed on both rigs and frac crews, so that's\u2026","Michael Hall","What's the term on your frac crew costs like how long are those contracts?","Dan Dinges","We go through the end of the year.","Michael Hall","Okay and then I guess the other side is just kind of following up a little bit on the exploratory programs but in the context of the dividend -- I'm sorry of the buyback. You talked about one thing that is kind of gaiting item for the buyback has been getting the infrastructure up and running and commissioned as expected. Just wondering to what extents have the exploration programs also been kind of governors on committing the even more on all your buybacks? And to the extent you did see or you did move on let's say from the second program? Would it be fair then to assume you achieved another step up in buybacks, any commentary along those lines?","Dan Dinges","Well, the exploratory portion available cash has not influenced our decisions on the level of buybacks. We anticipate our buyback program to be as we've laid out opportunistic and it dovetails now, along with the comment I made on mayo dividend, it dovetails now with our anticipation of both in-basin power demand and our commissioning of Atlantic Sunrise. So the amount of money compared to Cabot's available capital and cash that is being allocated to the exploratory effort is de minimis and it does not impact our decision on buybacks.","Michael Hall","I guess more kind of thing about the potential forward capital requirements would maybe restrain buybacks and I guess maybe more so dividends but it doesn't sound like that.","Dan Dinges","No, no, I'm comfortable that we will be able to have our growth profile into new market areas for better pricing. I'm comfortable that we'll have our capital program allocations to the Marcellus with undeterred. And I am also comfortable we'll be able to buyback our authority shares that the Board has granted. And I'm also comfortable that we would be very prudent on allocation of a capital into an exploratory and hopefully into an exportation phase of this exploration area we're on right now.","Operator","The next question comes Sameer Panjwani with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Sameer Panjwani","You touched on this a little bit in the prepared remarks, but with leverage tracking below your target range and set to further improve in the coming years. Can you just provide some color on your willingness to use the balance sheet to return additional capital to shareholders?","Dan Dinges","Yes, we have at our last board meeting we got the authority to increase our authorization by 20 million shares. And the board's expectation is that we would execute on that authorization as we have indicated in the prepared remarks that would fall in completion of that buyback would be a 7% yield, 7% of our outstanding shares. And that is our full intent to execute on that authorization, as we continue to see a disconnect in our intrinsic value additionally, once we get Atlantic Sunrise and the power plants commission that we are generating the free cash that we anticipate. I\u2019m sure the board will revisit our dividend policy also.","Sameer Panjwani","Just to clarify, I\u2019m thinking more longer term, I think right now and in the presentation you guys highlighted trailing 12 months levered is 0.8 times, but your target is 1 to 1.5 times on the leverage. So overtime, should we expect you guys to use that leverage capacity let's call it between the 0.8 times and the 1 times GAAP between your low end to increase buybacks further?","Dan Dinges","I think our policy is going to be fairly consistent even though we have identified as opportunistic policy at this stage, and again I preference it several times on infrastructure build out commissioning. The use of a component of a regular buyback plan is certainly something that we have visited. But we have also made it clear that we wanted to see the steady stream of cash that we anticipate. So, using leverage, I\u2019ll let Scott talk about the leverage position and the balance sheet and how we might look at the balance sheet what we might do with maturities or reload.","Scott Schroeder","Sure, thanks. Sameer, in terms of that long-term look, historically, we haven't leaned on the balance sheet. We haven\u2019t borrowed money to buy back shares and then that doesn't change really. When you look out forward into the long term, we will be generating a significant level of free cash flow. So, obviously, the first part of that would be to use -- would be the first funding source for any buyback. But I\u2019d emphasis that if we saw a big disconnect outsize disconnect we have no problem reading on our undrawn revolver at any point in time if we had to make an impact in the buyback program.","That's not our optimal use at this point, but at the same point we wouldn\u2019t shy away from that on any of those disconnects. Keep in mind, we are at 1.3 on an absolute debt to this point that 1 to 1.5 is a target level but we are not. If we fall below the target we are not going to go on borrow money or do something with money just to get back to that level. It\u2019s a guide level. It\u2019s a nice sweet spot to be in. We will work towards that but there's a lot of dynamics that play into that decision.","Sameer Panjwani","And then last question, if I may. I know you guys are always looking to expand the takeaway portfolio. Is there anything to provide an update on right now or anything that's become more likely since the last quarter call?","Dan Dinges","Yes, I'll let Jeff to answer that.","Jeffrey Hutton","Sameer, we talk about this quite a bit and we continue to have two very active on the initiatives, both with the in-basin demand project and an additional pipeline takeaway. And just to -- maybe talk a little bit about the in-basin demand program, we were out there in a various challenged environment, we were trying to relocate industry and we\u2019re trying to find the right sized projects, the right scale.","And we\u2019re trying to find projects with ultimately improved our realizations and it\u2019s -- right now, it\u2019s all moving in nature but it\u2019s also exciting. We\u2019ve all learned a lot about natural gas users and their requirement and working in Pennsylvania and those requirements and it\u2019s exciting. And I am pretty confident we\u2019re going to find several in-basin demand projects that are good for Cabot and good for those industries.","That said, we\u2019re always looking at pipeline options every day. But together remember we\u2019ve got the -- we\u2019ve always had the underlying question that does this project improve our price realizations. And currently with the outlook on basins and the in-basin demand that we have, our realizations are improving. That said, we\u2019re going to be up there for a long time, and I think there\u2019s -- there are additional pipeline projects to be built and that would be good for Cabot. We\u2019re just being very selective and working through the details.","Dan Dinges","I might add that we have really good idea for a project that goes from our field into Evercore pipeline. And there\u2019s a much demand in many users over there and New York have asked when we could get some gas up in that area. So, we haven\u2019t given up on that effort to deliver much needed gas to that part of the country.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Dan Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Gerry, and I thank everybody for the questions and interest in the details. We are looking forward to our October quarterly call. That call will be the first call in many years that hopefully we\u2019ll have the privilege of discussing commissioning of lot of overdue infrastructures and I would look for the opportunity for us to again support the shareholder friendly decisions that we have made in the past and with the clarity of cash flow that we\u2019ll continue to make in the future. So, thank you, look forward to the third quarter conference call.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan O. Dinges","Thank you, Maureen. I appreciate the introduction, and good morning. Thank you for joining us for this call. I have a number of our executive management team with me in the room this morning.","Before we start, let me say that the standard boilerplate forward-looking statements included in the press release do apply to my comments today.","On the call today, we plan to cover several topics: our first quarter 2013 operating and financial results, an update on our expectations for all of 2013, followed by an update on operations in the Marcellus, Eagle Ford, Marmaton and Pearsall.","Before I go into the details on these topics, let me first start with the highlights from last night's press release. For the first quarter of 2013, we produced 89.3 Bcfe, an increase of 50% over last year's comparable quarter and 13% over the fourth quarter of '12. During the quarter, we set new quarterly records for production, revenue, operating cash flows and discretionary cash flows even in light of the relative low realized natural gas price. We continued to de-risk our acreage position in the Marcellus, stepping out our drilling to the Eastern portion a little further than we had previously, and these results are very consistent with our initial drilling area. We also see noteworthy results from our Marmaton program.","Now for the quarter, moving into the financial and operational results. The company reported clean earnings of $54.2 million, or $0.26 per share, up 90% over last year's comparable quarter. Discretionary cash flow was $234.4 million, up 69% over last year's comparable quarter. The increases were driven by higher relevant -- excuse me, higher equivalent production and, to a lesser extent, higher realized crude oil prices that more than offset the weaker natural gas prices. Total per unit cost, including financing, were down 15% compared to the first quarter of '12, as all operating expense categories decreased on a per unit basis, except for transportation and gathering and G&A expenses. Transportation and gathering expenses were up slightly from additional Marcellus infrastructure expansion, while G&A increased due to the company's higher stock price and the resulting mark-to-market for our liability awards.","As I mentioned earlier, we had another record quarter for our production. As anticipated, Cabot averaged slightly less than 1 Bcfe per day of total company net production. Our daily production moved up modestly from this average thus far in the second quarter as well completions continued to add to current production levels. We still believe that production will be somewhat ranged down until late June when Central compression becomes operational. This long-anticipated infrastructure addition was originally designed as a primary discharge station into Springville pipeline that goes down to the Transco line. However, combined with our newly installed infrastructure, Central will now assume the role of managing overall field pressure while also acting as the primary discharge station to the Constitution Pipeline, which is scheduled for March of '15. In addition to Central, we will be seeing incremental new compression and dehydration facilities being commission throughout the remainder of '13, putting us at a total gathering capacity of 2 Bcf per day by the end of the year, as planned.","On our guidance last night, we reaffirmed our full year equivalent production growth range of 35% to 50% for the year. Annualizing first quarter daily volumes gets you to the low end of our guidance. Additionally, our cost guidance was also unchanged for the year, as was our expected capital program of $950 million to $1.025 billion.","On our hedging, in terms of the recent uptick in natural gas prices, we, like many, have utilized the late winter conditions and increasing prices to add to our hedge levels in both '13 and '14. Today, we're about 62% hedged for 2013 based on the midpoint of our guidance, with no immediate plans to add additional hedges at this time for '13. For '14, we have 30 contracts with $300 million collateral -- collared for our natural gas hedges, and we'll continue to be opportunistic adding to this position.","Now let's move into the operational side of the business. In late March, we achieved a new 24-hour gross production rate in the Marcellus at a record of 1.054 million cubic foot -- excuse me, 1.054 Bcf a day. During the quarter, we turned in line 17 horizontal Marcellus wells. However, most of the wells that were turned in line offset some of our existing production as a result of the field pressure constraints. As I mentioned before, we expect the field pressure constraints to be relieved mid-year when the Central compression station comes online.","Here are a couple of milestones from some of our wells that occurred during the quarter. We had our first well reach 8 Bcf of cumulative production in just 667 days. That kind of equates to about a 12 million a day average. We also had our fastest well -- wells to reach 3 Bcf and 6 Bcf of cumulative production in only 88 days and 270 days, respectively. Also, we continue to add additional data points on our acreage position. And as the press release highlighted, we brought on line 2 wells in the quarter towards the east of our acreage and east of our Zick pad that recorded IP rates of over 16 million a day and 22 million a day for a 9-stage well and a 17-stage well, respectively.","Our completion efforts continued to improve, with a significant uptick in activity during the quarter, as highlighted, with a 70% increase in completed stages from the first quarter of 2012 and 23% over the fourth quarter level. We currently have 429 stages completing or cleaning up or waiting to be turned in line, along with an additional 279 stages waiting to be completed in the Marcellus.","We are also pleased to announce that our CNG station in Susquehanna became operable during the quarter. Our CNG initiative will not only result in reduced energy costs for the company, but it will certainly allow us to utilize the energy efficiencies and environmental-friendly natural gas. We currently have 44 fleet vehicles running on natural gas, and we are waiting technology to allow our water hauling trucks that have bigger power units in them to afford us the same opportunity. Operating rigs on natural gas and when extensive pad drilling becomes a reality, which will happen towards the end of this year and early in '14, using natural gas to power the completion process will clearly lead to several cost-saving opportunities. This is just another component of our efficiency program.","On the Marcellus infrastructure, we continue to see good progress on the infrastructure program by our midstream partner. Williams is on schedule with right-of-ways, permitting, construction and all the ancillary aspects of continuing an ongoing infrastructure build-out. Recently, we had a few questions regarding the timing of our Constitution Pipeline. And although our actual FERC filing had been delayed a few months, we do expect to file a FERC in early June, and we'll see no changes in the Constitution in-service date of March 2015.","Now let's move to our South region. In our South region, we continue to hold acreage in the Eagle Ford through our Pearsall drilling. We had 3 rigs operating in the Pearsall, 1 rig has moved back to the Eagle Ford during the quarter and 1 in the Marmaton. The Pearsall, it's still a young play and remains a science project for us, much like Marmaton in the early days. We have a thick column of hydrocarbon and continue to work on all aspects of drilling and completing a cost-effective well. The matrix porosity in finding the extensive fractures remains an issue as the wells are productive. But when you look at the rates compared to the costs so far, it makes it economically challenging when you compare that to our investment alternatives. The joint decision with Osaka is to finish up the drilling program as we had planned, and as such, the plan for the full year is to drill a total of 15 gross horizontal wells in the Pearsall. Currently, we are drilling 3 wells. Well, 3 wells are completing, waiting on completion, and 9 wells are producing on line. The 30-day average production rate for the 6 wells that have produced for 30 days or more is over 600 Bcf -- Bcf, that'd be great -- 600 BOE per day, with an average of 50% oil cut. We continue to refine the placement of laterals within the formation and try to optimize our completion procedures.","Moving to the Eagle Ford. We don't have a whole lot to say on the Eagle Ford since we just moved a rig back there during the quarter. But to date, we have 43 wells producing in the Buckhorn area, with 3 wells waiting on completion and 1 well currently drilling. While we've had limited activity, as I mentioned, in the Eagle Ford due to the Pearsall effort, our last 4 wells produced at an average 24-hour rate of over 650 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with an oil cap of approximately 90%. During the quarter, we drilled our longest lateral to date in the Eagle Ford at 8,200 feet. The well was completed with 30 stages and is still in the early, early stages of flowback. However, it is already providing oil rates above the field average IP. It's good data but still very early.","In the Marmaton, during the quarter, we completed 5 wells, with an average of 21 stages per well. We keep gaining efficiencies there. These wells averaged an initial production rate of over 800 barrels of oil equivalent per day.","So we continue to be very pleased with our operation, the growth generated from our assets and progress we're making on a number of fronts. The Marcellus continues to deliver outstanding results, and efficiency enhancements are just around the corner as we continue our planning for full pad development. The Marmaton cost reductions and well results are materially better, and work in progress in the Pearsall continues with more easy drilling on the horizon.","With over -- with the overall macro environment, the natural gas improving, which includes future natural gas demand expectations, and our expanding production base, I think we are certainly in an excellent position to continue to deliver significant value to our shareholders.","With those brief comments, Maureen, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is Amir Arif from Stifel.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Couple of quick questions. One, can you just tell me what was your backlog of completions at the start of '13 and where you think that's going to be at the end of '13?","Dan O. Dinges","So our backlog, are you talking about just Marcellus?","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, just Marcellus.","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. Our backlog stays relative consistent throughout. If you look at the, say, 5 rigs running, and we have several wells, a couple, either 2 or 3 wells, on each pad at this time, and we're drilling a little bit longer laterals and we are -- reduced our spacing on frac stages for our '13 program, we will continue to have, oh, about 500 to 750 stages in the queue, if you will, just waiting for the rig to move off location and the frac crew to get lined up and scheduled to move on those locations that the rig moved off. So Amir, it's a similar number as we have right now.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it's not really -- it's not being constrained because of the compression or dehy, it's more just getting the frac crews out. Is that the first step?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, it is just the operational logistics out in the field.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a second question, if you can give any color on what your thoughts are on the free cash flow used as you start up in '14?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we have had a number of questions in regard to that, and we're certainly, again, cognizant of the fact of the excellent returns that we get from the Marcellus. So -- in fact, we had a slide in our investor presentation that kind of outlines various different options. But when you look at a primary consideration and the most value creation, it would be to enhance our Marcellus capital contribution and expand that program in a material way. But we also look at either dividend increase, special dividend, share buybacks and -- but the free cash that we anticipate of any material sense will begin in earnest in 2014.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. But it still sounds like you're leaning more towards accelerating activity. So is that a decision still to firm up in the second half?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, yes. Yes, it is. It's a decision and a conversation that we continuously have internally. And we also have ongoing work with the North region in looking at what is possible and still be able to maintain our level of [indiscernible].","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one final quick question. In the Reilly pad, have you drilled wells out there yet or are you step -- or you're just totally stepping out in that direction?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, we've drilled wells, but we do not yet have the pipeline hooked up to that pad location. We are -- I can't tell you the exact status of that particular pipeline, but the expectation is, early part of third quarter, we ought to have a pipeline out there.","Operator","Our next question is from Pearce Hammond, Simmons Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Dan, just following up on the prior questioner. Given the jump in gas prices, do you foresee any -- a change in activity for this year or maybe pursuing that very large well pad?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, Pearce, we have all been blessed with an uptick in the natural gas price. And when we have in our initial plan, in our operation moving into '13, we thought about not only having one completion crew, but we had explored the opportunity early in the year, actually, towards the end of '12 of having a second completion crew in the field for a short period of time to just take care of some spread-out wells that we had on a waiting-on-completion status. After we saw the -- towards the March period of time, we saw the opportunity for maybe a little bit higher gas prices. We have maintained that completion crew working for us, and that was one of the catalysts that increased the number of stages that we are able to deliver, 70% over the first quarter of '12 and a significant percentage over the last quarter of '12 also. So we're looking at just how we keep that extra completion crew going as an option. And we also have discussions ongoing to determine when we might want to bring a sixth rig into the field to start drilling off a given pad. It does not necessarily move up in the queue the extensive pad drilling or pure pad drilling. What it does do, though, it moves it up in theory because the rig -- the sixth rig we moved back in location will be capturing primary term acreage sooner, which would, as a result, allow us to start pad drilling sooner.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then have you noticed any changes in service costs or just general service capacity in the Marcellus here recently with the uptick in gas prices?","Dan O. Dinges","No, we haven't. But keep in mind, the largest component of our cost out there are rigs and completion crews. And we are in kind of a unique area of the Marcellus out there. And that equipment out there is going to be in that area, and we think we get good pricing. We have a long-term contract on one of the crews, and we're using another as a spot crew. But we have not seen any increases in prices at this stage.","Operator","Our next question is from Abhi Sinha, Bank of America.","Abhishek Sinha - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. Basically, I'm just filling for Doug Leggate here. So -- an overall question, I'm just trying to see, by when would you be done with down-spacing testing in the Marcellus and developed optimizations to shift gears to full development mode?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, in the Marcellus, we have remained spaced at a 1,000 foot between the majority of the wells we've drilled. We have drilled several of the Upper Marcellus wells that were staggering in between the Lower Marcellus wells at about 500 feet. Once we get on a full pad development, we are going to experiment with down-spacing the wells to see what might be the most effective and efficient spacing in the field. And I'm sorry, I didn't get the latter part of your question, Abhi.","Abhishek Sinha - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The same thing as to well optimization queue. Like, when would you be done with down-spacing and well optimization when you're talking about different lateral lengths.","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. And, again, the timing of this will be once we circle a rig back around to do the extensive pad drilling, which would be towards the latter part -- beginning the latter part of '13 or the beginning of '14. And keep in mind, once we put a rig on location and say we're going to drill 10, 12, 14 wells, say we drill 10 wells, you're going to be -- you're going to have that rig on location for a good period of time before you can come back in and complete the -- each well. So we're excited to move in that direction. And we have extensive study ongoing to allow us to cut costs in a material way once we get to pad drilling.","Abhishek Sinha - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you give us a sense of, like, on how much of your acreage in the Marcellus will have a little bit prospective for Upper Marcellus?","Dan O. Dinges","How much is prospective for the Upper Marcellus?","Abhishek Sinha - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, sir.","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we think we have Upper Marcellus across all of our acreage in the -- in Susquehanna, as you move to the very north end of our acreage. And the entire section thins from 350 plus or minus in the middle part to the northern part to about a gross interval of 250 feet. We would look at those particular wells in a stand-alone case to determine in today's return environment that we're trying to achieve whether or not our capital dollar is going to be spent there today or down the road to compete with the significant returns we're getting in the rest of the area. And, Scott, correct me, I think I -- I think I said northeast. I should have said northwest in our area, where we have about 10% of our acreage up there that we'd be looking at as Lower Marcellus completions but still going to have a science project on the Upper Marcellus completions.","Operator","Our next question is from Gil Yang, DISCERN.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","The couple of wells that you drilled, that you said was east of  [indiscernible] pad, were -- is there -- the 16.3 on 9 stages versus the 22.2 on 17 stages, could you characterize the difference in a per stage volume? Is there a rock quality issue? Or is there a production engineering issue or a constriction sort of issue that would account for those differences in performance?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, each stage, I think the average on one is 1.3 million a day and the average on the other is 1.8 million a day. It might be -- Gil, it might be just the immediate connectivity to the fractures in a particular area, maybe several stages, maybe all the stages. But that delta for us does not -- we don't have the ability to discern that level of difference between the wells. But certainly, each of the wells on a per stage basis, actually on average, is a little bit higher than our entire field.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Okay. Great. The issue of pad drilling, drilling a dozen or so wells from 1 pad in the future, can you talk about -- given that your wells, when they come on so strongly, you're already knocking off existing wells off of the -- in terms of production. If you bring on a dozen wells at the same time, so to speak, how will the cost savings of sitting on a pad versus issues surrounding knocking nearby wells off line repeatedly play out? And then does it require upsiding infrastructure that could increase costs?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. And I'll chuck the ball to Jeff to respond to you after my brief comments. But we have a high expectation of significant volumes coming from a fully developed pad site, as you might suspect. We have been discussing exactly your question with Williams for an extended period of time. And through those discussions, as we develop the infrastructure, as we continue to look at all the options that we can create in the field with the locations of compressors, dehys, for example, the Central compressor, we are taking into consideration the expectation of high rates off a pad site and our ability to have the longer-producing wells that have lower pressure to remain producing. And I'll let Jeff fill in the blanks.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Well, a few more blanks, but Dan did a good job because we have been working on this for 18, 24 months with Williams, doing the hydraulic engineering necessary to make sure these pads are able to produce at 100%, plus capture some of the older wells at the same time. And we're basically doing that with more compression and larger diameter pipe and moving the pipelines and additional paths into Tennessee, new stations. And it's the whole ball of wax of activity that we're out there doing today to bring the capacity to the 2 Bcf level by the end of this year. But there's a lot of hidden projects. In fact, we have no less than 60 projects going on to facilitate the pads when we get to that point. They won't be all over the system, so it's a massive undertaking. But we have -- I think we have a very good plan in place to address the pad completions.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","And then presumably, the drilling cost savings outweighs the extra cost of the infrastructure you're putting in place?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, the infrastructure in place is 100% Williams' cost, and we have a transportation fee that is netted basically from our gross price.","Operator","Our next question is Matt Portillo, Tudor, Pickering & Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a few quick questions from me. I was hoping that you could give us a little color on your production constraints to date. You mentioned that some of the wells are being produced at a constrained rate or they're getting knocked off from pressure. So, just curious if you could kind of quantify that for us. And then as you get some of the compression facilities on in June, I was hoping to get a little bit of color on how that could potentially affect your gross volumes in the Marcellus heading into the back half of this year.","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. On the first question on the production constraints, and again, it's just -- Matt, physiologically, if you look at the higher rates coming on and, to your question, knocking off the other wells, the line pressure in the field has remained high. We, I think, are still free-flowing even some of our gas directly into the pipelines, not going through compression at this time. But with our relatively high line pressure already and the wells producing into that, when we bring on and have brought on some of these other wells, we might increase our line pressure anywhere from 100 to 150 pounds. And obviously, that delta inhibits the same flow from those existing wells. I can't really put an amount on the amount that we knock off. I mean, it would be a simple math project. I don't have it. Say a well was producing 5 million a day. And you brought on a 20-million-a-day well, instead of netting 25 million out of it, you might be netting 23 million or 21 million. I don't know, something to that effect. But I really, Matt, don't have the number at my fingertips. And your question on the compression facilities was what exactly?","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just as compression comes on stream, could you give us, I guess, a bit of color on how that could potentially allow you to see an uplift in your volume? So I'm just trying to get a better sense of if you're producing about 1 B a day of gross production in the Marcellus, how does that production, that compression coming on stream help change that trajectory in the back half of this year?","Dan O. Dinges","Well -- and there's 2 components for that. One is the Central station that is going to allow us to reduce the majority of our field line pressures. And so we may see an enhancement to our production as a result of just going from 800 or 900 pounds to whatever we can lower the line pressure to, reducing that 100, 200 pounds or whatever we might be able to achieve. So we think we might be able to see something from that. And as we put ongoing compression and dehy in strategic spots in the field, in those immediate areas, we're certainly going to allow each of the wells to produce into a lower line pressure than you might if we didn't have those compressors in that area. Jeff, I don't know if you want to add anything else.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","One last comment. The other factor that is involved here is that, as we build up the infrastructure to the extremities of the acreage position, the older wells are naturally located closer to some of the compressor stations. And so the extensions of the pipeline going out to the newer wells is naturally bound to happen that the newer wells are going to push back some of the older wells off line until we get the line pressure issue corrected throughout the system. So that's something that all producers face as they start in 1 area and build out throughout their acreage positions.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just on -- switching gears quickly to the Pearsall. With the wells you have onstream today, could you guys give us, I guess, an idea of how you think about kind of EURs there? And then also, on the updated Marmaton wells, just kind of curious how you guys are thinking about the EURs on those wells as well.","Dan O. Dinges","Well, first, I'll start with the Marmaton. The Marmaton is a -- we've seen some really good results in the Marmaton. And it's looking like between our, if you will, shorter laterals versus our extended laterals, it looks like that we can get maybe a 50% increase in our EUR to be up in the 230 or higher range. We don't have a number of those wells producing long enough to where I could -- I can lock in that EUR. But we are very pleased with what we were seeing in the Marmaton. In the Pearsall, still early to tell on the Pearsall because we have tried so many different things, whether it be the landing point -- and this is different from what we are doing in the Marmaton, whether it be the landing point where we're drilling the wells or whether it be drilled in the deposition, much further north in our -- in the deposition, which is more oily, or further south in the deposition, which is more gas liquids attached to the further south, along with the different techniques that we're applying to the completion. So to give a range of EURs in the Pearsall, I'm just reluctant to do right now because of all the variability.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just my last question, just maybe a little bit more color on the rig count for the Marcellus. Could you give us, I guess, some color on timing of when you hope to get your sixth rig in place? And then is it reasonable to think in 2014 that you may be able to accelerate to an 8-rig count? Or is that a little too early to tell just given the constraints you've seen?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. Thank you, Matt. Well, the rig count at the Marcellus, what we've been looking at is, one, I mentioned the efficiencies and making sure we can maintain the efficiencies and consistency of our program. And some of that involves just clearing the locations for a rig on a consistent basis. It looks like it includes the scheduling of the completion. So we won't have stranded dollars out there any longer than we have to. It has -- also has the coordination with Williams on getting the gathering lines to the locations if we move our program up a little bit and looking at all the aspects of that. But what we're looking at is possibly towards the early fall. We might be bringing in a rig, a sixth rig to the Marcellus. And in regard to '14, still early to tell definitively what we might do in '14. We've been very pleased with the uptick in the gas prices through this shoulder period. We have some collars in place that protect us on some volumes on the downside into '14 now. So we are looking at what we might be able to do on our program expansion for our '14 period but a little bit early to say whether or not we'd go to 7 rigs or 8 rigs.","Operator","Our next question is Bob Brackett, Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A question on the Pearsall program. Those 15 gross wells, can you talk about your out-of-pocket costs sort of net of the drilling carries? And where will you be at the end of the year in terms of drilling carries from Osaka?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we will -- we have an expense interest in the wells that we've drilled so far and the wells that we will drill between now and the remainder of the year. We have a 9.75% expense interest in those wells.","Operator","Our next question is Louis Baltimore, Macquarie.","Louis Baltimore - Macquarie Research","Yes. It looks like you're starting to move south into Wyoming County, where some other operators have drilled some very productive Marcellus wells. And I was just wondering if you could comment on what you've been seeing from your wells down there and how big your position is.","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we include in Wyoming County the acreage that's directionally towards, say, Citrus acreage, which has the other top 5 of 20 wells in 2012, and Cabot has the other 15. But we like that acreage, and we do not anticipate any difference in that acreage down there than we see we're drilling right now.","Operator","Our next question is Gordon Douthat, Wells Fargo.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Question on the eastern side of your acreage in the Marcellus. How do you anticipate the delineation of that? Obviously, you're dependent on infrastructure, but how do you foresee that proceeding over the coming quarters and years?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, once we get our infrastructure build-out going in that direction and it be material sized to where we would allocate the rig and completion crews over there to be able to monetize that investment, we do not see any change in how we proceed with the eastern acreage than what we're developing right now. It'd just be a natural extension as we grow from where we started drilling and started our infrastructure as we grow out to -- towards the east.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And it looks as if you've got a number of things coming from the infrastructure standpoint later this year. Is that directed towards the eastern side of the acreage? Or any comments you can make as far as the timing of the infrastructure build-out as you move east?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, I'll let Jeff field that, Gordon.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Okay. I think if I heard you correctly, the -- well, let me just start by saying that on the Zick area in the eastern side, it's probably where we are best positioned with excess capacity. So for example, when we talk about today we have about 1.4 Bcf a day of capacity throughout the system, it's only in the Zick area and maybe a little bit to the north in the Hawley area that we do have excess capacity. So that's a good thing. And one of the -- we mentioned some smaller projects in the press release. It's actually in the Zick area. It's the second phase of a larger project that is giving us some additional compression on the east side around Zick. And so, again, that's a very good thing. So we feel real good about the eastern side in terms of capacities going forward.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then last question for me. Last night, in the press release, there was a comment about looking for ways to further extract value from your underappreciated assets. So, just wondering if you could provide any color on your thought process to what that -- what's behind that comment.","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we have the -- and that comment was kind of directed towards our Marmaton. And what we're seeing there is -- are good results, good returns. And we're not actively marketing our Marmaton at this stage. But if, in fact, it would be a -- if a transaction was to be had, we would certainly look at the Marmaton as an area that we would consider and utilize those dollars to enhance some of the other areas of our operation. And, again, let me emphasize, we're not actively marketing the Marmaton. But being underappreciated is really simply the fact that 90% of oil in those wells, and the well costs 3 million to 4 million, depending on the lateral lengths and number of stages, it's delivering very good rate of returns.","Operator","Our next question is Biju Perincheril from Jefferies.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can you give us an update on your takeaway capacity out to date of the Marcellus? And...","Dan O. Dinges","I'm sorry. Biju, I can't hear you real well.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can you give us an update on your takeaway capacity out of Marcellus today? And any new projects or incremental capacity coming on until the Constitution?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. Biju, that is a question that's directly up Jeff's alley.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Thanks for the question. Just to be clear, when some people talk about takeaway, they talk about the downstream interstate pipeline capacities that were utilized into marketing our gas. So I'm assuming that is your question and not necessarily the infrastructure?","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Correct. It's -- yes. It's interstate pipelines, right, not the gathering systems.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Okay. So currently, we are producing -- this is raw numbers in the Marcellus, the Bcf. And about approximately 500,000 of that goes down to Transco. And 400,000 and some change stays on Tennessee Gas Pipeline. And the remainder heads up to Millenium Pipeline. So as you know, we've been blessed with 3 very large interstate pipeline markets within 30 miles of our fields in either direction. So it's a great place to start. It's a huge advantage. But as far as firm capacity contracts, we own just shy of 400,000 a day of FT ourselves. And those firm contracts take gas out of Susquehanna County to different market areas, in fact, as far over in East Ohio area and throughout Pennsylvania and into the east. We actually have over 100,000 a day capacity that goes -- it leaves Susquehanna County and goes into the Boston area. We do, however, have a lot of long-term contracts, where we use sales contracts, where we use other people's firm to move our gas. And that's predominantly down on the Transco pipeline. So we feel like we're in a pretty good shape with long-term contracts, using other people's firms and the firm that we own ourselves. That's really been a huge advantage to date.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So if you're talking about adding -- going to 6 or 7, 8 rigs eventually, I guess that would largely mean using your customers' firm capacity to move gas. Is that...","Jeffrey W. Hutton","That will always be part of all producers in the Marcellus package of opportunities. Because if you think about it, the firm contracts, the historic firm contracts are all owned by the marketplace, the LDCs throughout New England and even in the New York area and down to the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. area. And what the producers have done is we've taken out a lot of backhaul contracts and moved gas to the opposite direction that the utility uses. But utilities will always be a huge part of our business with -- because they own the original transportation, whether it's 4, 5, 6 Bcf a day of capacity. Now, some of the nuances has been the expansions. As you know, the [indiscernible] expansion is going to take 600,000 to 700,000 a day down to the Carolinas. We have a role in that. We have a role in Columbia expansion into the D.C. and Baltimore area. And, of course, we have Constitution Pipeline that's going to move 0.5 Bcf a day at Cabot Marcellus gas in 2015 into 3 new interstate markets. So at the end of the day, we will have our gas positioned to deliver into 6 very large diameter state pipeline market areas. And that's been our plan for 2 years now, and we think it's a very solid plan.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And the Springville system that's moving gas down to Transco, is that at full utilization now? Or is there room to expand that?","Jeffrey W. Hutton","If -- okay. So it's a 24-inch high-pressure pipeline, and we're moving in excess of 0.5 Bcf a day down that pipe. We will have to -- there are plans to add a little bit more horsepower so that we can get up to around the 600 level. But basically, that's the extent of that pipe, unless it's looped or some other enhancements may be made to it.","Operator","Our next question is Brian Singer, Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Three small questions under the context of thinking about capital allocation with a potential sixth rig. First is, you've talked in the past about trying to making sure you get your drilling plan sometimes even 2 years ahead to your key midstream providers. What is the lead time you feel like is needed to ensure reliability? And what's the risk around it all kind of being ready as you talked about earlier for a sixth rig potentially 3 or 4 months away? I guess that's question one. Question two is just making sure whether the sixth rig for a portion of the year is in your CapEx budget, or not, and if you're seeing any efficiencies that would offset that. And then question three would just be how you're thinking about dividends or returning cash to shareholders in the context of a sixth rig and higher gas prices.","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. Well, on the -- the risk of planning is low -- excuse me, let me say that differently. We have planned to add our additional rigs, additional activity to our program. And as we have stated, we are actually working on 2015 with Williams as we speak. So the risk of getting things lined up is -- and implementing a plan that would allow us to utilize -- fully utilize a sixth rig is fairly low. What I'd be referring to on getting all the bells and whistles and ducks in a row for a sixth rig is just to confirm that we will be able to have the right people in place and we will utilize our in-house folks, GDS, that handles a great deal of our operations, not only the water hauling aspects but road building and location building aspects of it, just to make sure we can get ahead of it in all just the nuts and bolts of the front-end work to move a rig on, Brian. But in the permitting side of it, we have -- I don't have a high degree of risk on the permitting side. The North region has been great at staying ahead of their permit request over and above the budgeted programs, say, 85 wells that we have budgeted this year. So I feel good about that and would not think that regulatory issues would get in the way. A sixth rig has not been budgeted in our program at this stage. We might have had anticipation of maybe a very short time in December or something bringing in the sixth rig. But for all intents and purposes, a sixth rig has not been budgeted in the programming. What was your last question, Brian?","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Dividends.","Dan O. Dinges","Oh, dividends. Scott wanted to answer that one.","Scott C. Schroeder","Brian, in terms of -- clearly, the priority in -- as we approach this higher level of free cash flow is to explore accelerating the reinvestment in the Marcellus. We haven't gone much farther on terms of a special dividend, increasing the dividend yield or a buyback at this point in time. Again, that -- as Dan said earlier, that's more of a '14 decision. We have spent some time with some experts in terms of the impact, accretive, dilutive, best course of action. And quite honestly, on all 3 of them, based on where we're at, they kind of came to the decision that it was -- and, again, not ho-hum, but it didn't have the impact that it can have in some other applications because of the opportunity set related to the reinvestment back in the business, particularly the Marcellus. So haven't made a final decision. And, again, we'll kind of see as we flush out the '14 plan and the anticipation of free cash flow, together with anything else we do, before we come to a final decision on dividends.","Operator","Having no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dan Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan O. Dinges","Thanks, Maureen, and thanks, everybody, for spending their time on this conference call. We're very optimistic. We see a lot in the marketplace that is directing our attention to future demand for natural gas. I think we've said before that we know we have supply out there. We need to enhance the demand. And all the ancillary areas that I spend time looking at, I'm fairly excited about the increased demand that we're going to have in natural gas down the road. Again, I appreciate it and look forward to the visit on the second quarter conference call. Thanks.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Dinges, Chairman, CEO, and President. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Rocco, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's first quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are the members of Cabot's executive management team. And before we get started, let me say that the standard boilerplate regarding forward-looking statements including in this morning's press release do apply to my comments today.","As an opening comment, I think it's impressive that during the worst quarter our industry has faced in many years, Cabot's first quarter results highlight our ability to deliver growth without burdening the balance sheet, even in this low commodity price environment. Cabot grew daily equivalent production by 7% sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, while funding all investing activities with a combination of operating cash flow and proceeds from a non-core asset sale.","At today's strip prices, we do anticipate that the company will be able to deliver a cash flow neutral to cash flow positive program each quarter this year, as price realizations continue to improve and capital spending continues to trend downward over the next few quarters. Despite a significant improvement in our natural gas differentials during the quarter, which improved from a minus $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2015 to a minus $0.60 during the first quarter of 2016, the company experienced its lowest price realizations in many years. The lower realizations were the result of an average NYMEX settlement price of $2.09 per MMBTU during the first quarter, which was the lowest average NYMEX price we have witnessed since the first quarter of 1999.","While lower prices have certainly had an impact on industry-wide margins and cash flows, including Cabot, the good news is that the outlook for natural gas price continues to improve, as the country is beginning to experience a decline in dry gas productions stemming from a significant reduction in drilling and completion activities, and an improvement in natural gas demand driven by increased power generation and exports.","While the improvements in differentials had a meaningful impact on our results for the quarter, our ability to continue to lower our cost structure has also helped the bottom line. Cash costs, including G&A and interest expense, during the quarter were $1.18 per Mcfe, compared to $1.26 per Mcfe during the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition to our reduction in unit costs, we also reduced our capital spending relative to the fourth quarter of 2015, highlighting our commitment to financial discipline.","As mentioned, and as you are all aware, one of our core tenets is our commitment to maintaining our balance sheet strength. We took a major step during the quarter to ensure that strength by issuing approximately $1 billion of equity in late February, with a portion of the proceeds used to pay off the outstanding borrowing on our revolving credit facility. Subsequent to the offering, the company is extremely well positioned to weather the current environment and remain opportunistic, with liquidity of approximately $2.2 billion and a net debt to EBITDAX ratio of only 1.6 times at quarter end. Additionally, subsequent to the quarter end, Cabot's bank group unanimously approved a borrowing base of $3.2 billion.","Moving into the region in the Marcellus, we continue to operate one drilling rig and one frac crew working daylight hours only. During the quarter, we drilled 7 wells and completed 12 wells. Our primary focus is on enhancing operating efficiencies resulting in further cost reductions. The success of these efforts was evident in the first quarter with drilling and completion cost savings of approximately 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. On average, usable lateral length for the seven wells drilled during the first quarter of 2016 was over 7,400 feet, which exceeded our previous best quarter average by over 1,000 feet. Even with the longer laterals, we were able to maintain average drilling days flat relative to the fourth quarter of 2015 at 12 days from spud to TD.","On the production front, we averaged over 1.6 Bcf per day in net production for the quarter while reducing direct field operating costs to $0.03 per Mcf. We exited the first quarter with 54 wells waiting on completion, which does not include the 4 wells we are currently completing. In addition, we have over 60 drilling permits approved and ready to go in the Marcellus.","As we evaluate our plans for future operating activities in the Marcellus, it is important to understand the supply outlook for our operating area in the Northeast Pennsylvania. While there has been a lot of focus, recently, on the expectations for meaningful supply declines across North America, which we do fully subscribe to, and believe, will impact us positively, we're already seeing that dynamic play itself out in our operating area. For example, in the six-county area we define as Northeast Pennsylvania, there was about 8.4 Bcf per day of production in February compared to about 7.6 Bcf per day in April based on our estimates. Not surprisingly, these lower production levels have positively impacted the local basis, with Leidy and Tennessee differentials for the month of April coming in at their lowest levels since mid 2013. We expect that trend to continue in May, resulting in our second quarter differential guidance range of $0.50 to $0.55 below NYMEX, a $0.05 to $0.10 improvement relative to the first quarter, and a $0.35 to $0.40 improvement compared to the second quarter of 2015.","While curtailments are certainly driving some portion of this production decline, we believe that curtailments in Northeast Pennsylvania were not as substantial in April, since the cash price in the day market has been about $0.20 to $0.30 better than in February and March. Our reservoir team has spent a lot of time scrubbing the state data for over 4,000 wells in Northeast PA in an attempt to better understand the anticipated production declines in our area, as well as to assess the level of drilled, uncompleted wells.","Our engineers built production curves for all of the producing wells in the six-county area. Additionally, assumptions were made for non-producing wells as to whether we thought a well was temporarily not producing for reasons like curtailments, and would ultimately be placed back on production when prices were higher, or if the well would never be placed back on production due to poor performance, or a significant period of inactivity.","Ultimately, we found that even when assuming all shut-in production comes back online after the summer, we could still see a 25% decline from year end 2015 to year end 2016. Question then becomes, is there enough operating activity occurring currently to fill that void, or will the area see exit to exit production declines, resulting in a positive outlook for pricing next winter? Our best estimate is, at this point, is that approximately 120 wells will be completed in our area this year, and modeling suggests that that is simply not enough activity to backfill the declining production we see. This is very positive for Cabot.","Our engineers' study also revealed an estimate of drilled uncompleted wells that is significantly less than the 800 plus or minus wells, you hear reported by some of the third party sources. Only three rigs are currently operating in our area, and I do not expect that DUC inventory will grow. In fact, it will be shrinking throughout the year, which is positive as we think about 2017 and beyond. While there will always be some inventory of drilled, uncompleted wells, I'd remind everyone that the most capital intensive portion of drilling and completing a well is the completion side. Accordingly, I suspect it will take higher prices, healthier balance sheets and cheaper access to capital before we see a meaningful uptick in completion activity in our area.","In the Eagle Ford, the drilling rig release was released in early February. The drill team has turned its focus to the completions required to maintain lease obligations. During the first quarter, our team in South Texas completed and placed on production nine wells with an average completion lateral length of 7,760 feet. During the quarter, Cabot also completed its longest Eagle Ford well to-date with 46 stages and a lateral length of 11,200 plus feet. Capital efficiency and cost savings continue to be the primary focus with our Eagle Ford completions costs down by approximately 30% compared to the same quarter in 2015.","At the current strip, our plans for the remainder of the year are focused solely on maintaining all of our leasehold obligations through 2016, and not increasing our operating activity above these minimum levels. However, our anticipated backlog of 15 drilled uncompleted wells at year end 2016 does allow for flexibility.","Right now everyone is aware of the recent New York DEC decision to deny water quality certificate permit last week pertaining to Constitution Pipeline. Today, we are not going to dwell on the specifics of the denial notice, and unfortunately we cannot expand on the legal strategy going forward other than to refer you to our April 25 Constitution press release, which clearly refutes the allegations of the New York DEC. Because of this, we do want to remind you of our total commitment to the project, and we remain confident we will ultimately prevail. Because of New York's denial, we have pushed back the service date for Constitution to the second half of 2018. Moreover, we do want to reiterate that, although this additional capacity is important to our long term plans, we have successfully continued our efforts to access new markets.","Previously, we announced several new projects that collectively add approximately 450,000 MMBTU per day of new long term sales and transportation capacity to new market areas. Additionally, we have been very active with two additional projects that, again, solidify our long term growth profile and improve our infrastructure situation. We will be providing updates and details on these transactions in the weeks to come.","Regarding Atlantic Sunrise, the project continues to move forward on all fronts, particularly on land, regulatory and permitting side of the project. Our expectations are to receive the draft environmental impact statement soon and, per the FERC scheduling notice in March, the final EIS is scheduled for October. Cabot now anticipates contributing $30 million to $35 million to its equity investments in these pipeline projects in 2016, down from the original guidance of $80 million to $150 million.","In regard to the remainder of 2016, we have guided with curtailed volumes for our second and third quarters. Additionally, we are in the process of updating our plan for 2017 and beyond in light of the recent news regarding Constitution and the addition of several other projects we are working on. However, I will comment that similar to our plan for 2016, Cabot will be able to economically grow our natural gas production in 2017. While we have a range of outcomes for 2017 at this point, the ultimate level of growth will be the direct result of our underlying expectations for price realizations during the year. We also anticipate a further acceleration of our growth rate in 2018 in anticipation of the timely in-service of the various infrastructure projects I referred to earlier. These projects will add approximately 1.3 Bcf per day of new firm transportation capacity and long term sales in 2018, and this figure does not include any Constitution capacity.","In summary, our strong financial position, the lowering of our cost structure, reduced level of industry activity, improving natural gas differentials, and strong portfolio of future take away opportunities outside of New York, position us well for the future. And Rocco, with that I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","John H. Abbott - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. This is John Abbott calling in for Doug Leggate. I apologize. He's on another call. Just two very quick questions. First, with regards to Northeast PA, what sort of rig activity do you think we would have to see up in that area to stem declines? And then second, looks like you sold some assets in East Texas. Are there other opportunities for portfolio clean-up? And also, why don't you think we've seen more consolidation among the gas names in the current environment? Thank you.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, John, first in the Northeast PA, our study, I've given you some of the details of our study. We have an ongoing evaluation and plan on keeping this as a dynamic project to evaluate the production profile. And the coincidence between drilling and completions will dictate the level of activity necessary to show that production and maintain production at the level it is today. Certainly, we feel that three rigs and the number of frac crews up there is not the level of activity that we'll maintain. We anticipate a fairly meaningful decline in production.","In regard to the East Texas sale, we do have some additional properties in East Texas that we maintain. This was not all of our East Texas assets. And we do not have those on the market at this period of time, but certainly have additional assets that not only in East Texas but along the Gulf Coast that would be part of our portfolio. And what was the \u2013 I'm sorry, what was...?","John H. Abbott - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Consolidation amongst the gas players.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The consolidation amongst the gas players, I think, is a result of the commodity price sitting at the first quarter, or at historic \u2013 not historic lows, but lows as I mentioned in my opening comments all the way back to the first quarter of 1999. Consolidation in a very, very, very low market like that is difficult at best with some parties as we've seen having stresses in different components of their business, balance sheet, or possibly not having a portfolio that would look good in a slow commodity price environment. So consolidation in this environment makes it difficult. I would think that if you have continued support in the commodity price and you can see a more normal vision out there on the strip, then you might see a little bit more activity.","John H. Abbott - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charles Mead of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Dan, and to the rest of your team there.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask if you could maybe share a little bit more \u2013 I guess you gave us a lot of detail on your Northeast supply, but maybe you could share a little bit more on the conclusions or what it suggests to you. And specifically you guys guided to a tighter natural gas realization in Q2, but do you see that continuing into the back half of 2016? I think I picked up on that from your comments. And does that even tighten enough that it raises questions about the economics of new take away out of there if bases got that tight?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think on the supply side my reference to 25% or even 30% depending on looking at our models decline that's occurring is it's a real number on the baseline decline. And the level of activity with three rigs and less than a handful of pumping units up there I think it is apparent and I think we are seeing a meaningful decline, and I think that's being reflected in the differentials that you're referring to, and that our guidance is based on our expectations, our supply study we've done up there. Our expectations are that the supply side will continue to diminish, that you'll have narrowing differentials, and I think that will certainly bode well for realizations.","NYMEX is going to do what it does, but certainly the northeast has been one of the most punitive areas for differentials. And I think now that \u2013 with the supply side and lack of activity, it is now coming in, in more parity with other areas of the country. I would expect that when you look at the parties that are up in the northeast that have positions, I don't think the Northeast PA is going to be an area that they're going to run up to and commence a program any time near term. So I do expect to see continued narrowing of the differentials, and I think it's a positive for Cabot.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it, thank you, Dan. And on Constitution, I need to respect the boundaries you put about what you want to talk about and what you don't, but if I could just kind of explore a little bit where those boundaries are, it seems like you are regarding this as a delay, a delay, but that, in your mind, or in Cabot's posture, this project is still going to get done. Is that the right read that we should take from your comments?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, it's exactly right. We have looked at New York's own projections. Their 2030 projections have Constitution or additional gas as a part of their energy source. They anticipate that in 2030, that natural gas is going to represent about 50% of New York's fuel source, and the natural gas has to get up there and meet that demand in some way. The fact that the Constitution Pipeline and others are fully subscribed projects represent the demand that's necessary up there, and it's for the public need. And so when you look at what the future holds, the grants that New York has given to some of the southern tier counties in New York for taps into Constitution Pipeline for the use of natural gas in areas that are stranded and do not have the use of natural gas, I think it is obvious that the public need and the majority would benefit from Constitution being a fuel source for energy in New York.","When you look out ahead and you look at a desire to have renewables, we all know that we are a company and an industry that endorses renewables as part of the energy mix. We'll continue to endorse renewables as part of the energy mix. But we also think it's prudent to be realistic about scalability, timing, and to take in consideration the costs associated with renewables in this environment, and the general public and the consumer, and what it will cost if, in fact, there's not access to natural gas as the clean fuel that it is.","Keep in mind that a lot of the benefits from the CO2 reductions that we see today are a direct result of natural gas being a fuel source, and it's not a hard equation to \u2013 and it's not a difficult set of facts to understand. Though they, at times, are not represented in a lot of the media print.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Right. Right. Thanks for that, Dan. And just one clarification. The 1.3 Bcf in new take away that you mentioned in your comments, that's in addition to Atlantic Sunrise?","Unknown Speaker","It includes.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, not in addition to Atlantic Sunrise. It's in addition to Constitution.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","That includes Atlantic Sunrise.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I had a quick question at a strategic level. If you think about your portfolio, are you currently happy with your portfolio? Does it need any additional changes?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we love the assets, Bob. I think it's well documented that the footprint of our Marcellus assets, though challenged on getting infrastructures to this specific area, as illustrated by Constitution, we still think the future is going to allow some of the best assets in North America as far as natural gas is concerned to yield great dividends for Cabot shareholders. Would we like to have assets that would be out of a footprint that is narrow scoped like where we are in Northeast PA and not have the infrastructure overhang that we discuss every quarter and every conference we go to? That would be nice, and I would enjoy that. But I'm not going to compromise or dilute the best assets in North America.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Understood. Thank you.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","And our next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth of BMO. Please go ahead.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Phillip.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","On the two additional projects you mentioned were in the works, how long term are these? Meaning when is the earliest they could contribute to incremental demand for Cabot Gas? And can you talk about what indices these would be tied to or whether it could be fixed pricing?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Phillip I'm going to turn that over to Jeff Hutton.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Yeah, Phillip, I really wish this call was a few weeks away so we could talk in detail about these two projects. One has to do with bridge capacity. That capacity that can start as early as next spring. And the duration of that is up in the air at this point. We can make it three years or out five years to 10 years. The second project has to do with \u2013 it's a demand project with an end user. It's a large scale and it's in the 10-year to 15-year timeframe. And it would start, also, probably late 2018.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. And then, how much ability does Cabot have to sell more gas into the local market at the right price if local gas prices were to, say, rise to $2.00 an Mcf in 2017 level where returns to Cabot are very strong? Are you able to increase volumes at the expense of price or are you physically just unable to sell more gas than you're already producing above that feed?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, when you look at the study that we're doing up there, Phillip, and you take in consideration the supply side diminishing somewhat for Cabot to be able to pick up incremental space in the pipes, I think Jeff is very confident that we would be able to do that. There's also been conversation about firm capacity that with the low commodity price, the stressed balance sheets and capacity commitments that have been committed to, that there would be opportunities in different areas to maybe move additional gas.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Good morning, guys.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Pearce.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Dan, appreciate your prepared remarks. It was very helpful, especially on the gas macro. The NYMEX future strip agrees with you as gas for 2017's roughly $3.00, so what does Cabot look like at $3.00? You're on a run rig right now in Northeast PA. How many could you run? And then, if you push the growth accelerator in a higher price environment, how long does it take you to get a response given the evisceration with what's happened on the service side as far as people, specifically?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, on the response side first, Pearce, you're aware, and most others are also, that the maintenance capital and capital intensity of what's necessary to propel acceleration in Cabot's production profile is quite low. It does not take a lot of rigs and does not take many frac crews to be able to ramp our production with the quality of rock that we have.","In 2017, as an example, it would only be a \u2013 throw out a number, $250 million or so \u2013 to just kind of keep our production flat at $3.00; and if we wanted to just do that, at $3.00 we would be generating a significant level of free cash flow. And the ramp-up or taking advantage of the opportunity at higher price, it's part of our planning process right now and we're looking at the strip price. We're planning on the infrastructures projects that we referred to, and we will be building a program that allows us to ramp up production, not only in 2017, but I would say on our first pass, second pass sensitivities on 2018 \u2013 quite significantly in 2018.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Excellent. And then, my follow-up \u2013 and I know this is a hard question to answer, but just curious if you could provide what curtailments are right now for Cabot in Northeast PA.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Now, I'm not going to get into specifics of exactly what it is, but consistent with what we did this last year, we have a measured amount of curtailments in our volumes. And when you look at the December or so rate of 8.4 Bcf per day and rolling forward now to the 7.6 Bcf per day, there might be some curtailed volumes in that number, but I think it's safe to say that everybody is working off \u2013 by the lack of activity, everybody is working off their level of curtailed volumes and getting close to a baseline production.","Pearce Hammond - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Well, thank you very much, Dan.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, Pearce. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Glick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Michael.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","You all continue to make improvements on the efficiency side in the Marcellus. Could you maybe provide some color there in terms of the drivers? Then, on the other side in terms of productivity, is there anything you're testing that can drive that higher?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, one, as you can imagine with the scrutiny on one rig and a frac crew in daylight hours, we are able to allocate a lot of man hours towards a limited level of activity. I'll let Steve Lindeman discuss some of the ideas that we're implementing on not only the Marcellus but maybe some of the ideas that we have coming through on our Eagle Ford operation also.","Steven W. Lindeman - Vice President-Engineering & Technology","Michael, in both areas, what we're working to do is stretch out the length of our lateral. As we put in the quarterly results, we drilled or completed about a 1,000 foot longer lateral, and that doesn't really \u2013 in terms of the drilling costs, that's a very efficient portion of the operations. We can drill another 1,000 feet in a very, very short period of time, and that equally just offsets the amount of extra casing. So that's a very, very efficient portion of the operation.","We are still seeing a little bit of softening in some of the service prices, so we've been able to take advantage of that. In the south we again have been working to complete the longest possible laterals we can and using technology like dissolvable frac plugs and so forth \u2013 all of that to reduce the mill out time or the amount of time with coiled tubing rigs that we have on location to drive our average costs down. So those are some of the things that we're working on.","On the LOE side, we're really looking hard at what our water disposal costs are, and in both areas, we work very hard to drop those numbers throughout the year and especially quarter over quarter. And same thing on the chemical side, in the Northeast we've reduced some methanol use as we had a milder winter, and in the south again working on our chemical efficiencies.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then -","Steven W. Lindeman - Vice President-Engineering & Technology","Sorry, go ahead.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","You can go ahead.","Steven W. Lindeman - Vice President-Engineering & Technology","The other thing I was going to mention is in the south, we also are putting in quite a bit of electric infrastructure, quite \u2013 right now we've got over 50% of our wells on either utility power or on microgrid, which is significant cost savings from generation.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then I'll try one on the infrastructure side. So I mean generally, northeast, we've seen varying degrees of localizability with the new pipeline projects, and that's obviously impacting the timing or status of proposed projects. And then you balance that at the federal level, where FERC has been moving forward with projects that are in the interest of the public. So my question is do you see strategic importance in having the course clarify what the role of the state is in the pipeline regulatory process?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, just from kind of a macro comment, Michael, I think with the ramp-up in the activists that are against hydrocarbons, and their attack has now \u2013 narrowing down to infrastructure, and I think there is the sense that if we stop infrastructure, or we fulfill our \"leave it in the ground,\" comment. I think from both a state and federal perspective, I think it is prudent to evaluate the process, look at where the impedance are coming from, look at, again, the overall value of a fuel source, and determine what process is prudent to move forward to represent the majority, that at times might not have a voice. So I do think that we are in an area that would \u2013 is important that we do get clarity and we do understand the roles that are necessary to facilitate the greater public need versus a more specific agenda.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Deckelbaum of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Dan, Scott, and Jeff. Thanks for taking my questions.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I just wanted to expand on a few of the other questions you have been asked today. First, starting with the commentary around your internal team looked at, I guess, 25% year-over-year decline in Northeast Pennsylvania, absent, I guess, a working down of backlog and perhaps some curtailments. But if you couple that with your comments about others in your area not necessarily using their capacity, have you already started conversations with your neighbors about perhaps picking up some capacity in 2017 that you could trade them for perhaps longer down the road or pick up now that they don't intend on using? And if so, how receptive are those conversations right now?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","David, I'll let Jeff comment, but I know that certainly there has been firm capacity out there that has been discussed, probably even before we've had such punitive pricing and balance sheet stress. But I'll let Jeff comment.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","David, we started these conversations probably six months to nine months ago, not only with our neighbors in Northeast PA, but really in the entire Marcellus Utica Basin. It even gets a little further than that, as some of the legacy contracts are also not being used. In other words capacity from the Gulf Coast. It even gets deeper when you start looking at the future commitments on projects and the unused capacity that could be available there as well.","So we've been slow dancing (40:15) this a little bit only because we think that the timing is getting better. Each month that passes, we're seeing better opportunities. And so we're going to step into a little bit of additional capacity here, and maybe not for the duration that some of that you'll read about in the new projects. But there's definitely an improvement in the secondary capacity market. And I just think it keeps getting better.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And I suppose those agreements would be something that you'd probably want to hammer out before the end of the year?","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Sure. Yes.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. And then my next question just on the balance sheet and free cash, your updated CapEx today, I think, obviously makes sense not having the pipeline commitments, and looks like you'd be generating free cash this year and conceptually free cash in 2017. For now, does the free cash just get used for balance sheet purposes before you have better visibility on take away projects? And I guess sort of dovetailing on Bob's question earlier about the portfolio, with excess free cash, do you start looking up at beefing up other areas outside of the Marcellus that are in your portfolio?","Scott C. Schroeder - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","David, this is Scott. In response to your first question, the answer is yes. We would just use it for just to kind of, for lack of a better word, weather the storm and see just the ebb and flow. We are modeling it similar to that, with the free cash flow this year and next year. At least in several of the plans that Dan referenced in his prepared remarks. But you're spot on. As Dan answered that question, we are looking at our portfolio. And looking at, we still believe from a RoC perspective, we got the best RoC on the natural gas side of the equation in what we have in the Marcellus. And if we can beef up a position with high quality assets, we would be willing to use that free cash flow and some of the cash we have on the balance sheet to explore those ideas, too.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","That's helpful, Scott. Thank you. And then, the last one for me, I guess, without having you guys cite a specific number on curtailed volumes, could you give us a sense of perhaps percentage wise how much those curtailments that you have internally have declined from the peak of where it was last year?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Where our internal curtailed volumes were at the time that we had maximum curtailment? Is that kind of the -","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Relative to current -","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think you could look at it, David, just like you would look at the baseline decline.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You kind of look at where curtailed volumes were. Even though you weren't producing at that point in time, you bring the baseline decline. It's all proportionate to those curtailed volumes.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's a good starting point. Thanks, Dan.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Uh-huh.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","That's all.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Marshall Carver of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Can't hear you, Marshall.","Operator","Marshall, your line is open, sir.","Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Sorry, most of my questions were answered, but a quick question regarding the East Texas assets that were sold, was that legacy Haynesville or was that something else? And was there any acreage associated with the sale, like a very good price given the amount of reserves contained, and was there any production, too?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the production was kind of in the mid teens, and it was more the Cotton Valley assets and not the Haynesville.","Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Thank you. And the third party shut-ins in the Eagle Ford, how much did that impact the quarter? And is there any impact into second quarter, or has that all been resolved?","Steven W. Lindeman - Vice President-Engineering & Technology","That was about three quarters of a Bcf, just those alone for us in the south region.","Unknown Speaker","It was done in the \u2013 when did it...","Steven W. Lindeman - Vice President-Engineering & Technology","It was down most of \u2013 or half or so of the first quarter, and it's back online about April 20 or so.","Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","You mentioned on the transportation side you were working on or were close to signing some new projects, some of which are demand driven. Certainly, not surprising that the demand is there, but what gives you confidence that they won't face some of the similar issues that we're seeing, or is it just because those projects take gas to a different direction, different point?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's \u2013 I agree with some of what I read out there right now that the midstream space is being challenged by an effort to basically keep hydrocarbons in the ground, point-blank. I do agree with it being more difficult, and the activists trying to stop progress on the midstream. I think in certain areas of the country, it will be more pronounced than others, and geographically it seems to be up in the east right now where it's a little bit more populated; it seems to have more intensity and more emotion attached to it. But, again, I'll go back to what we referred to last quarter, and you look at the footprint necessary to get a certain level of energy to a demand source.","Natural gas has one of the smallest footprints that there are out there. If you make an equivalence to renewables and what it takes to deliver equivalent production, what's being discounted and not discussed is the footprint necessary to be able to deliver renewables and the equivalent production level. So all those things are part of it, but I think geographically it's going to be more difficult in other areas to lay the infrastructure. But I do think that the process is being considered by the administrators in a way differently than it has been in the past. And I think it's clear that there's not scalable opportunities for renewables to take the place of what hydrocarbons, and natural gas in particular, will deliver as far as demand is concerned; so just a difficult time right now","I do feel, though, that with the projects that we have in place, I think the mitigation discussions that we'll have going forward to mitigate in an objective way will also come into play. I think we do that, but we're going to be better at that aspect of it. We're certainly sensitive to all the needs out there, and we'll continue to move forward with what we think are projects for the majority's need.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. And kind of tying that back into some of the efficiency questions on the upstream side that you answered questions on earlier, I think you made a reference to some chemical type efficiencies. I just wondered whether, given some of the concerns out there, rightly or wrongly, with regards to water and chemicals in the water, et cetera, do you see \u2013 have tested or are testing any technologies that would significantly improve what some would call green footprint in terms of reductions in chemical intensity? And do you think that that has a place in the Marcellus?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first off, let's back up to the premise that is the reason for the question. One is what is the level of contamination of any water in the first place? That question has been evaluated in a lot of different ways, water well tests, and it's a significant amount of dollars and significant database that represents to us that the water has not been contaminated by the operations.","On the chemical side, drilling side, we have a closed loop system. We have, also, through the frac side \u2013 we have a closed loop system on the frac side that lets us accept what we put into the formation.","So we're confident that our operation using best available technology is mitigating any concern about water. Do I think that there are other areas that maybe has volumes of produced water, and those volumes of produced water then going through a process different than today and continuing to look at produced water and how you dispose of produced water? I think there's probably ongoing research that will continue to look at that and try to improve in an area that's very good right now, but would try to improve on any produced water disposals.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, thank you. My question was actually more towards these, could the best available technologies become even greater, could there be any kind of further improvement there? But thank you.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions]. And please note that today's event is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Dinges, Chairman, CEO and President. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, William, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. As usual, I have with me several members of Cabot's executive management team, and I would first like to emphasize that on this morning's call, we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release. ","On the first quarter, Cabot generated adjusted net income of $129 million or $0.28 per share, an increase of 46% relative to the prior year comparable quarter. Daily net equivalent production for the quarter was 1.88 Bcf per day, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range and represented a sequential increase from the fourth quarter despite the loss of volumes associated with the closing of the Eagle Ford Shale divestiture at the end of February. ","We also extended our streak of consecutive positive free cash flow quarters to 8 by generating $89 million of free cash flow. Our strong free cash flow for the quarter was a result of a 17% sequential increase in discretionary cash flow and lower-than-anticipated capital expenditures. ","Our unit cost continued to improve as we posted a 21% decline in cost relative to the prior year comparable quarter, which highlights the impact of our recent divestitures' hat on the company's overall cost structure in addition to our efficiency gains. On a Marcellus standalone basis, we saw a 4% reduction in cash cost relative to the prior year comparable quarter, and we anticipate further improvements in our cost structure, driven by economies of scale, resulting from our planned increase in operating activity and production over the coming years. ","Lastly, our corporate level returns improved once again quarter-over-quarter, highlighting our ongoing increasing profitability. As we stated on the year-end call, we plan to be opportunistic with our share repurchase program. Our decline in share price since the beginning of the year, driven in our opinion, by negative sentiment around the natural gas outlook represented an opportunity for us to accelerate our share repurchase activity. ","Ironically, the NYMEX strip for '19 and '20 are only about 1% to 2% lower than they were at year end, and are roughly in line with the base case price assumptions in our 3-year plan, yet our stock price is down 18% year-to-date. As a result, we were fairly active in the market subsequent to our year end call. Year-to-date, we have allocated $245 million in capital to repurchase approximately 10 million shares, and we'll remain opportunistic throughout the year, given our significant financial flexibility, including over $925 million of cash on hand at the end of the first quarter pro forma for the April share repurchase activity. ","As it relates to our broader plans around long-term capital allocation, we plan to continue to reinvest in organic growth in the Marcellus, as we have highlighted in our 3-year plan, while also providing sustained dividend growth and opportunistically buying back stock when we see a disconnect between the market value and our view of Cabot's intrinsic value. Above all, we plan to maintain an ironclad balance sheet with ample liquidity, allowing for financial flexibility through all commodity cycles. ","Now moving on to our operating plan. We delivered another strong performance in the Marcellus. During the first quarter, volume's up 3% sequentially despite not bringing on any new wells as we communicated on our year-end call. For the second quarter, we anticipate placing 20 wells on production, of which 16 wells have already been turned to sales. We have slightly tempered our outlook for sequential growth into the second quarter due to anticipated downtime for construction work that is being completed on Transco in order to connect our gathering system to the Atlantic Sunrise project. However, we expect significant growth in the second half of the year as we place an additional 60 wells on production to facilitate our ramp up in volumes as our new infrastructure projects are placed in service. Our conviction and our plan for the year was reiterated in this morning's release as we reaffirmed our 2018 daily production guidance range of 10% to 15%, and our capital budget guidance of $950 million. ","Now let's move on to pricing and our infrastructure comments. Marcellus differentials for the first quarter came in slightly outside our guidance range, driven primarily by wider differentials in February. However, they still represented an improvement of $0.19 per Mcf relative to the prior year comparable quarter. We are forecasting a sequential widening of differentials for the second quarter due to the shoulder season, and we have also slightly widened our full year guidance range by a few cents to reflect current strip prices. Even with this small change to differential assumptions, we still anticipate generating over $180 million of positive free cash flow for the year. ","As it relates to our ongoing infrastructure build out, we can begin by highlighting the progress from earlier this year on Moxie Freedom power generation facility. Moxie Freedom began taking test gas in early February, while making final preparations for full commissioning. Our expectation is that Moxie Freedom will be fully in service on June 1, and this 165 million cubic foot per day of new in-basin demand project will be a great long-term customer for Cabot. ","Regarding the Lackawanna Energy Center, we also recently began burning test gas for their first generation train at that location. Train 1 is expected to be fully operational on June 1, adding an additional $80 million per day to Cabot sale portfolio. As a reminder, Train 2 and 3 remain on schedule for October 1 and December 1, respectively. When all 3 trains are online in December, the total nameplate capacity of this project will be 240 million cubic foot per day, for which Cabot is the sole provider. ","Now moving onto Atlantic Sunrise. This project continues to make significant progress with regard to all aspects of the construction. Collectively between the pipeline, compressor stations and meter stations, the project is greater than 50% complete. Even though adverse April weather conditions, the construction crew have found ways to safely lay pipe and complete electrical and instrumentation work at the stations. We're very pleased with the current status. We remain encouraged that a mid '18 in-service is attainable. As most of you are aware, we recently added an incremental 50 million cubic foot per day of sales on this project, increasing our market share to over 1 Bcf per day. Cumulatively, these 3 projects will drive a significant improvement in differentials, going forward, resulting from access to premium markets post Atlantic Sunrise in-service and exposure to seasonally higher power prices once the Moxie Freedom and Lackawanna Energy Center plants are up and running. ","I'm sure everyone is aware that Dominion Energy announced on April 9 that their Cove Point LNG export facility has reached commercial operation status. Therefore, Cabot has received a notification that our 20-year supply agreement with Pacific Summit Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation, is now in effect. As we await in-service for Atlantic Sunrise, we are fulfilling our obligation through a combination of various transportation paths for Cabot's gas, combined with some third-party purchases. These arrangements are an ideal short-term solution. But we are looking forward to sourcing 100% of the contracted volumes from our world-class assets in Susquehanna County when Atlantic Sunrise is operational. ","Lastly, on the infrastructure front, we have had a lot of discussion with investors lately regarding our opportunity to continue to deliver organic growth from our high return Marcellus asset above the 3.75 Bcf of gross production we highlight currently. While we are not at a point where we will discuss specific opportunities, I can assure you that we are very confident in growing our production base above these levels, and continue to work with our midstream provider to build out the gathering system to facilitate production volumes above the 3.75 level. ","In summary, we continue to believe our combination of growth in discretionary cash flow, free cash flow, production and reserve per debt adjusted share growth, improving returns on capital employed and increasing returns of capital to shareholders is unrivaled in the independent E&P space. ","Despite recent headwinds in the form of negative sentiment around the outlook of natural gas, we have just as much conviction today in our ability to deliver on our top tier financial metrics from our 3-year plan as we did when we rolled the plan out last October. As we mentioned, over the last year, we took numerous steps to high-grade our company's asset base and further enhance our cost structure. These strategic moves have positioned us as the low-cost natural gas producer in the United States, and should allow for continued success throughout all of the natural gas cycles. Additionally, our year-to-date execution on share repurchase program highlights our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, and should provide some insight into how we view our current market value versus our view of Cabot's intrinsic value. We look forward to impending growth production during the coming quarters and we will again see the in-service of infrastructure projects that we have been waiting on for years, and especially excited about delivering significant positive free cash flow during the unprecedented ramp up in our volumes. ","With that, William, I'll be happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first questioner today will be Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles Meade","If I could ask, Dan, I appreciate all the detail you already went into about the moving pieces on your 2Q guide. That was an obvious question. Thanks for addressing that in your prepared comments. I'm wondering if you could perhaps add a little bit more detail on the startup of these 2 power plants and what it means for them to be taking test gas here at the end of April. I get that we have the June 1 start dates for both of those. But what would May look like? And is that -- and what could have looked like and what's implicit in your guidance about your expectations for gas you sell in May there?","Dan Dinges","Yes, that's a good question, Charles. And Jeff has been staying plugged in on the each step along the way, and is familiar with what's necessary to commission on the affected days. I'll let him fill in the blanks.","Jeffrey Hutton","Good morning, Charles. Yes, the pet gas and the commissioning process takes several months. The good news is pipelines are in place and operational, so that we're able to deliver the gas. Initially, Moxie is probably a little ahead of Lackawanna at this point. And we see days where test gas is 10,000 a day, and then there's a day of no test gas, and then maybe there's a weekend where it's 100,000 a day and so on and so forth. So we really get into the engineers at the locations of testing the different components and testing the trains and testing the actual production of megawatts. So it is a longer process for the commissioning of those facilities. I think, in both cases, two generation facilities also have contracts through the PJM process that start June 1. So it's not unusual to have early commissioning or early test gas use, but we won't see full demand until their power generation contracts start around June 1.","Charles Meade","Got it. Thank you for that detail. And then, Dan, if I could ask about your exploration efforts. I'm guessing there's not going to be a whole lot to say or you would have already offered some comments. But is there any kind of update on your thought or your process that you can share?","Dan Dinges","You're right, purposely just left exploration comments on the side. But briefly, I'll restate where we are that we do continue to make progress on gathering the data on both projects. Our objective has been clear that we're trying -- securing up data points to be able to give some very good color in our third quarter call. And as we've also mentioned, that both projects are designed to evaluate all prospects. So with that, we'll leave the exploration comments for the third quarter.","Operator","And our next questioner today will be Bob Morris with Citi.","Robert Morris","Any comment or color, additional color, on the upper Marcellus? I know you didn't tie in any wells in Q1 and I didn't know if any of the 16 wells tied-in in Q2 were in the Upper Marcellus. I know you're now planning to do Gen-5 completions on the Upper Marcellus in the second half of the year. But last quarter, you gave us some initial -- UR estimates seem to be encouraged about the outlook for the Upper Marcellus. So I didn't know if there's any incremental comment or data from -- if any of those 16 wells brought online this quarter were from the Upper Marcellus.","Dan Dinges","Yes. Several of the wells in the Upper Marcellus that we brought on, about 16 wells are in the Upper Marcellus. To date, don't have much color to provide, other than we -- everything we've seen so far has met our expectations, but very early time in our production curve fit. But yes, some of the 16 wells were in the Upper Marcellus.","Robert Morris","Okay. So we look forward to those results maybe next quarter. Second question is just now that you're doing the polythene gas to the 2 power plants, in all the moving parts in the U.S. natural gas market, is that something we may see more of in the future? And I know some of your peers have actually started talking about perhaps doing deals to sell gas directly to power plants and utilities. Is that -- how does this market look for that? Is that something you might do more of, going forward?","Dan Dinges","Yes, Bob. I'm going to pass that to Jeff.","Jeffrey Hutton","Okay, Bob. Yes, we've talked about this in the past. We are having ongoing program and discussions with power generators and developers throughout the Northeast part of the country. As we've talked about these two facilities located directly off our gathering system, so to speak. We're at home runs in terms of avoiding long-term firm transportation cost and obligations. We've looked at several other facilities in that region. We feel like that in the PJM vicinity, the power plant development is -- maybe hasn't peaked yet, but is getting mature on the development. So we're talking to 1 or 2 others about long-term gas supplies. But I think the market is getting close to being mature enough to where I doubt we see any additional facilities in that neck of the woods. But I do want to add though, not only are these 2 coming on, there was a facility came on last spring, and there's 2 others that Cabot is not serving that's coming on and that's again a 6-county area in Northeast Pennsylvania. So it's good overall, probably close to 1 Bcf a day of demand in Northeast PA from power generation.","Operator","And our next questioner today will be Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer","Your CapEx for the quarter was about $167 million on an annualized basis. That was well below the full year budget of $950 million. Obviously, there's some start-ups here gearing for here, going forward, and there weren't wells brought online in the first quarter. But can you add some color around the CapEx trajectory, going forward, and whether this represents any sign that there is greater efficiency relative to the budget that you put out?","Dan Dinges","Yes. Matt is here also, so he can fill in the blanks there, Brian.","Matthew Kerin","Yes, Brian. So you're right. Some of the reduction in capital for the quarter was timing driven. So we anticipate somewhat of a step-up in capital in Q2, not only driven by a higher completion cadence, but also the remaining capital commitments associated with the Atlantic Sunrise project that we have contributions for, and then I think you'll see it normalize a bit more in Q3 and Q4. We're so comfortable with that full year guide. You're right, we are seeing some efficiency gains. And so whether or not those could impact it later in the year, we'll see.","Brian Singer","Got it. And then my follow-up is with regards to the share repurchase. I appreciate the color on what's been bought back so far. Do you have a sense of should we -- or should we expect that you continue at the same pace that you've done over here in the first 4 months?","Dan Dinges","Well, Brian, yes. As I think I mentioned at the last conference call, our board was fairly clear on the approval of a repurchase program that the intent is -- particularly with our balance sheet strength, that if we do see that disconnect and intrinsic value that we'll be active in the market. We think this is a time that with the infrastructure projects, the ramp-up in production that Cabot is going to have, the ability to deliver significant free cash, and with that, we think we ought to get the confidence of investors that recognize that, yes, in fact, we are going to be able to generate the free cash. The negative sentiment around the natural gas macro environment, I think, has pushed us down to a level that I don't think is going to be sustainable in Cabot share price. So if, in fact, we continue to see this disconnect, our intent is to be fully active in our repurchase.","Operator","And the next question or two will be Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker","Dan, just something you've talked about once Atlantic Sunrise starts up, and just remind us how quickly you can fill that new capacity and whether or not that's new volumes or redirecting existing volumes?","Dan Dinges","Our plan is, initially, as it's commissioned again just several months from now, we're going to be doing a little bit of both. We're going to redirect existing volumes out of the -- and off of the three in-basin pipelines into Atlantic Sunrise, and would fulfill that volume with both currently producing gas and the incremental gas that we're going to be building up into with our second and third quarter completion well we plan on turning inline. We will continue, as we demonstrated in our guidance, that our ramp-up in production is going to be back half, obviously, with new infrastructure, back-half weighted. And that growth will obviously come from new production and maybe some incremental volumes that move because we -- in certain areas, we haven't moved all the gas on the existing wells. So we anticipate a fairly good ramp-up into Atlantic Sunrise. And as we move into '19, we've kind of given a little bit of book ends on year-end exit volumes. But as we get into '19, we'll continue to ramp-up into additional incremental volumes.","Andrew Venker","Thanks for the color, Dan. And just to clarify, so do you think you'd likely have your full capacity utilized on Atlantic Sunrise by the end of this year?","Dan Dinges","We will move all of -- we will fill the capacity of Atlantic Sunrise by the end of the year. Some of that volume that we fill is going to be our current producing gas that we off-take from the 3 in-basin pipes. And Jeff wants to add a little color.","Jeffrey Hutton","Drew, so the way we've got it planned out, and this a little bit of a moving target. But when Atlantic Sunrise is fully in-service and commissioned, we'll take title to the 850,000 a day of firm transportation capacity at that point, and we will immediately fill the pipe. And our obligation is with Sumitomo and with Washington Gas Light on day one of the commissioning. At that -- and back to your question, there will be a combination of flowing gas coming off some of the in-basin pipes, combined with the equity gas that we continue to develop between now and that in-service date. So just to kind of recap and make sure we're clear on this, Atlantic Sunrise will be full with Cabot equity gas on day one, but it will be a combination of existing gas with -- 850,000, excuse me, plus the additional capacity that we picked up in the interim.","Andrew Venker","Okay. That's all very clear. I appreciate the clarification, Jeff. And just one follow-up on differentials overall, if you guys have things changing quite a bit between now and next year. The differentials have widened quite a lot across a lot of the U.S. and would be interested to hear your take on whether that has any meaningful impact on what you would expect for differentials between now and 2019?","Dan Dinges","We're -- Drew, we're comfortable with the guidance and forecast that we've given on differentials. Just to the point of how Atlantic Sunrise is going to build some of the issues that we've had for now for several years has been a direct result of too much gas coming out of the 6-county area in Northeast PA and not having any other outlets. Atlantic Sunrise provides, and quite frankly, these in-basin power plants, provide a very good outlet to enhance the differentials out there. So our guidance that we've provided, we are comfortable with. And I think you will see a -- continuing to see a narrowing of the differentials.","Operator","And the next question or two will be David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc.","David Deckelbaum","Dan, I know in your prepared remarks you talked about the sort of peak. I bet you guys guide to right now of 3.5 Bcf a day gross out of the Marcellus. You talked that you can't really get into specifics right now on upside to that. But I guess are these things that you're actively working on now, is there a timeline that you could put around that as to when we might have visibility if these -- if additional capacity is going to be out there?","Dan Dinges","Okay. First, you mentioned 3.5. We're actually 3.75 is kind of work we have as capacity on the projects at this stage. And yes, we are actively working on those specific projects as addition to the 3.75. We're not going to give any specifics. I will let Jeff give a little bit of color and make sure he doesn't get too specific with what we are working on.","Jeffrey Hutton","David, I'm the last one to get too specific on projects that are up-and-coming. But we are out and about on a daily basis looking at projects, particularly the in-basin opportunities, where we can bring some local demand back into the picture and burn gas there in Susquehanna County and avoid some of the interstate pipeline wuss. At the same time, though, we're looking at a number of smaller scale projects and niche projects that will collectively add capacity that moves us up into the right on that 3.7 number. We would likely have more clarity on -- and announcements on smaller projects in 2019. But there's, as you can imagine, a very competitive landscape out there, and we're keeping a lot of the stuff close to the vest right now.","David Deckelbaum","I appreciate that, Jeff. I guess just as a brief follow-up to that, you've had some smaller projects like the gasification of some of the local towns. Outside of selling gas to power generators, how large is sort of like the addressable market for towns that could be gasified and receive gas directly from Cabot, and how competitive is that right now?","Jeffrey Hutton","Yes. So it is an opportunity. And as we go through the process of identifying in which we have some of the communities that can use natural gas, as you're probably aware, we operate in a rural area in Northeast Pennsylvania. So the larger communities that are south of us, like the Scranton and so forth, do have natural gas supply. So it is a smaller scale opportunity. But there are still a lot of opportunities as our pipelines stretch throughout the counties up there. I think there's probably more opportunities in the compressed natural gas area in the peaking services for power gen. There are some -- we've identified a number of large industrial sites that have water, power, rail maybe or -- and highway access that we're talking with various types of industries to relocate there. So I think, all in all, we're on the right track to build it and they will come kind of approach. But it's still early in some of those projects and negotiations.","Operator","And our next questioner today will be Leo Mariani with Nat Alliance Securities.","Leo Mariani","Again, I was just wondering, I know you guys didn't bring on any incremental wells during the quarter. But do you just have a general update on some of the Gen-5 well performance versus wells that may be brought on in the last couple of quarters?","Dan Dinges","Well, there is no concern with any of the production curves that we've seen with our Gen-5. We're comfortable with the information we provided so far, and our expectations are being met with the flow volumes that we see. Again, you have to keep in mind that to be too specific way early in a production -- in a curve fit is problematic and not as accurate of information as it would be if you'd have 1 year, 1.5 years or so of production. We bring our wells on slow up there. And so to be able to look at the curve fit out months and months is the appropriate way of evaluating it. But so far, we see no issues.","Leo Mariani","All right, that makes sense for sure. And I guess, can you maybe talk a little bit about sort of where the current well costs are there in the Marcellus? And kind of whether or not you're seeing any cost pressures that might move those around? And obviously, there may be some efficiency gains as well. Can you just kind of talk about the cost dynamics you're seeing up there in Appalachia?","Dan Dinges","Yes. We're completing these wells, plus or minus $1,000 a foot, lateral foot, and that's kind of the ZIP Code we're in right now.","Leo Mariani","All right. That's helpful. And I guess, how does that translate into sort of overall well cost as you all sort of look at that? And have you seen it changing [indiscernible]","Dan Dinges","I'll say, as an example, our average is around 8,000 foot lateral, a little bit more for our 18 wells, and our well cost is about $8 million.","Operator","And our next question or two will be Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers.","Jeffrey Campbell","Dan, the first thing I was wondering is have you -- you said it, and I'm sorry I missed it. But have you discussed any current plans for the proceeds from the Eagle Ford divestiture? And I ask because the debt EBITDAX already looks really low.","Dan Dinges","Yes. Right now, we have not had any specific design for the Eagle Ford. It's all in our balance sheet cash in the bank. Excuse me, Jeffrey. We have spent up to $240-plus million on share repurchases. As I referenced earlier, our plan and intent is if our share price stays in a spot where we think the value is lower than our intrinsic value, we will continue to be in the market. So you could say that the use of some of those proceeds, even though we had $0.5 billion of cash in the bank already, you could say that we're focused on this -- at the current time where the share price is, we're focused on a share repurchase program with authorization, having approximately 20 million shares remaining.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. My next one's a little different, but I mentioned it in your thoughts here. I realized it's not indicative of a 3-year plan. Nevertheless, the first quarter '18 free cash generation was remarkable. And it seems like some kind of potential lens, and to Cabot's cash generation power, if you ever decide to dial back on production growth, I'm just curious what your thoughts are with regard to that cash generation in the quarter?","Dan Dinges","Well, we do have a very strong cash flow machine. And we are ramping up to our volumes that we've addressed with the commissioning of these power plants in Atlantic Sunrise. It's our intent to stay prudent with our balance sheet. We're in pristine shape right now, and some might argue on a net basis certainly under leveraged. But one of the areas that we've discussed internally is how you manage the dividend policy, the dividend policy we've stated, and we've increased 150% last year, 20% this year already. We wanted to get to the commissioning of these infrastructure projects when we did additional dividend policy consideration. We did not want to find ourselves having to make a compromise on dividends because there's a slight loss of credibility when you have to peel back and rollback dividends if you do get into a low commodity price strip. So I would say that would be one area that our board will revisit consideration for our excess cash. And in the meantime, we think we have a substantial opportunity in front of us to bring back in shares. We will continue, though, to stay prudent with the excess cash and not do anything that would be out of character.","Jeffrey Campbell","No, that's a great answer. And I think you kind of [indiscernible] my thoughts, which is that this just look like, if it was a practice around it, having to be defensive. It looked really impressive. Congratulations on the quarter.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Jeffrey. Yes, thank you very much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our next questioner today will be Michael Hall with Heikkinen.","Michael Hall","I guess, as a bit of a follow-up to that last line of questioning, the exploration program wasn't really mentioned in the use of proceeds and\/or, meaning, use of excess cash flow. How do you think about that in a success case? Say, how many years or how much funding are you willing to kind of push towards moving an exploration program into development mode? How does that process look in your eyes? How quickly do you push it to something that's sustainable on its own? Just any commentary on that will be helpful.","Dan Dinges","Yes, I'll restate again what I've said in the past. Any investment we make has to have a return that we think is somewhat competitive with our Marcellus. We anticipate staying with our current strategy of delivering growth, both on production and reserve growth on debt-adjusted share basis. We're intent on delivering a return, increasing return on our capital employed. We like the idea of our yield model on increasing our yield on our free cash flow, and we're going to be focused on that also. So any project or allocation of capital is going to have a component that within a reasonable period of time, and as I've stated in the past, a reasonable period of time, would be a couple of years or so, that we would be able to identify assets that would deliver that type of return and also be able to fit within our overall strategy, and again, a reasonable period of time of delivering on all of those objectives.","Michael Hall","Okay, that's consistent, helpful. And I guess can you just remind us, what's the -- how much allocation to the Upper Marcellus is there within the 3-year outlook? And yes...","Jeffrey Hutton","Just nominal.","Michael Hall","Nominal? Okay.","Dan Dinges","Yes, very, very -- yes, right now from a -- we'll continue to drill in various different areas and in various different circumstances Upper Marcellus wells. But the percentage of allocation compared to the lower in the next -- in our 3-year plan is very low.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. So this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dan Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, William and thank you, all, for joining the conference call today. As you seen, we've been able to deliver on our solid program, cash flow, the growth, the return on the available cash, we'll continue to deliver on that program. Second quarter, we adjusted our volumes a little bit to get tie-ins in there. But we certainly have volumes that -- with 16 new wells and going up to a few more than that. We'll bring on another pad shortly. We will have more than adequate volumes to start filling up the Atlantic Sunrise, following its commissioning. So we're in good shape. Please join us for our next quarter's conference call, and we look forward to the visit. Thank you.","Operator","And the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"4289":["Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (NYSE:COG) Q1 2017 Earnings Call April 28, 2017  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Jeffrey W.

Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Karl J. Chalabala - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Chairman, President and CEO, Mr. Dan Dinges. Please go ahead.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thank you, Phil, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's first quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are several members of our executive team. On the call today, I will be referencing slides from the earnings presentation we've posted to our website this morning, which highlight our operational and financial results for the quarter.","Before we get started, I would like to move to slide 2 of the presentation, which addresses our forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning.","Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in both the earnings release and this presentation.","Now let's move to the highlights of the quarter on slide 3. Cabot grew daily production volumes by 7% relative to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by an increase in Marcellus volumes that benefited from a much improved natural gas price environment during the first quarter. Our production levels were right on top at the high end of our production range for the quarter, which resulted in 6% growth sequentially over the fourth quarter of last year.","The company pivoted from a net loss of $51 million in the first quarter of last year to a net income of $106 million during the first quarter of this year while increasing EBITDAX by over 200%. The improvements were primarily driven by 7% increase in daily production volumes; a 77% increase in natural gas price realizations; and 11% decrease in operating expense per unit.","Of the utmost importance, the company was able to grow production and cash flow, while generating positive free cash flow for the fourth consecutive quarter. Based on our strong performance during the first quarter coupled with the improved outlook for regional pricing for the remainder of the year, we have increased our full year 2017 production growth guidance range from 5% to 10% to 8% to 12% without increasing our drill and complete capital for the year.","Slide 4 illustrates the significant improvement we have seen in our pre-hedge price realizations over the last four quarters. Realizations for April and May will likely be about $0.25 lower than the first quarter average. However, this implies that our average natural gas price realizations for the first five months of the year will be about 70% higher than the same period in 2016, highlighting the significant improvement in cash margins we are realizing to-date.","Moving to slide 5, it speaks to the improvement we have seen in the outlook for regional differentials, which is driven in large part by the anticipation of significant regional takeaway capacity additions in the near future, including Rover, Atlantic Sunrise, and Leach XPress, coupled with a supply side that has not kept pace with recent takeaway capacity additions. This improving outlook for differentials has driven our decision to modestly increase our anticipated production levels for the year.","Now I'll move to slide 6 which illustrate our updated capital budget for 2017. As I mentioned previously, we are increasing our production guidance range for the year without increasing our drilling capital \u2013 drill and complete capital, which is largely driven by the outperformance we have witnessed in our recent Gen 4 Marcellus completions.","As we highlighted in the press release this morning, we have included up to $125 million of capital in this year's budget for exploratory lease acquisition and testing in new areas that have been analyzed. As we communicated on the year-end call in February, we have been evaluating new platforms for future growth that has the potential to generate competitive full-cycle returns and we have identified two new areas that we believe warrant further testing.","These are areas where we have direct line of sight towards building sizable contiguous acreage positions that allow for an efficient operations at, most importantly, a low-cost of entry. I will define a sizable position as one that has the potential to provide over a decade of high-quality drilling inventory. I would also highlight that the $66 million or over 50% of the spending occurred in the first quarter. So, these expenditures are front-end loaded this year and the first quarter capital outlay are not indicative of the quarterly run rate we anticipate going forward.","While these projects are in the early stage of evaluation and carry the risk that come along with exploration, based on the geo-modeling our team has performed to-date, we are cautiously optimistic about their potential. And that is why we moved forward with the leasing and will subsequently test our ideas later this year. We will keep you updated on these projects if and when there is something commercial to discuss. Keep in mind, even with the spending, we still forecast over $250 million of positive free cash flow based on recent strip prices.","Moving on to operations, slide 7 and 8 highlight the outperformance we're seeing in both the Marcellus and Eagle Ford for wells placed on production during the first quarter. While there is limited production data on these wells, the early results are very encouraging. In the Eagle Ford, we plan to place 14 enhanced completion wells on production this quarter and we'll continue to analyze the results over the coming months to determine the impact on estimated recoveries we are expecting as a result of the recent completion design enhancements. However, I am pleased with the results we have seen to-date.","Slide 9 illustrates the continued reduction in drilling costs we have experienced in both of our operating areas. While we are still forecasting some cost inflation throughout the year primarily on the pumping side of the component of our well cost, we only anticipate about a 5% increase in total cost in the Marcellus and possibly a 10% increase in our Eagle Ford well cost by year-end. However, in fact, our first quarter Marcellus and Eagle Ford well cost actually came in under budget.","Moving to slide 10, slide 10 demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet and highlights how our leverage metrics have been reduced to pre-downcycle levels. Based on our current three-year plan, we continue to see a material deleveraging as we grow EBITDA at a healthy rate without adding any incremental leverage to the balance sheet given our positive free cash flow outlook.","Now, let's move to slide 11 on which we have provided a brief update on the status of our upcoming takeaway projects. For purposes of this discussion, I will focus primarily on Atlantic Sunrise on the left-hand side of the slide. As most of you are aware, we received the FERC certificate approving the project back in early February. Since then, the Atlantic Sunrise team has been working on obtaining access to the remaining property in order to complete the surveys needed for final permit application with the Pennsylvania DEP.","I'm happy to report that we have now completed 100% of all cultural and environmental surveys required for the remaining permits in Pennsylvania. We expect to file the final permit application in early May and anticipate full approval and permits in early July.","Based on this timing, we anticipate that construction on the greenfield portion of the project will begin in early third quarter 2017. Based on the expectation of a 10-month construction period, we remain confident that the pipeline will be fully in-service by mid-2018.","We continue to hear from thousands of people who support the projects \u2013 individual, chambers, business groups, labor unions \u2013 who recognize the economic benefit of the project in addition to recognizing the important role it plays in supporting the tens of thousands of jobs tied to the State's natural gas industry.","As far as other projects on the right-hand side of the slide, all of these important capacity additions remain on schedule for our targeted in-service date with the exception of Constitution, the status of which is currently pending our appeal process. We are hoping for a positive outcome sometime in late second quarter based on the timing of appeals.","Slide 12 is a new slide that we rolled out at an investor conference last month, highlighting the capital efficiency and free cash flow potential of our Marcellus asset. For purposes of this analysis, we assume that we held production flat at 3.7 Bcf per day, which is our estimated productive capacity assuming we maintain our existing market share in-basin and, ultimately, fill the incremental capacity additions we have listed with new production. This also excludes Constitution capacity given the uncertainty around the project timing.","As you can see, this asset has the ability to generate significant amounts of annual free cash flow even in a lower natural gas price environment. Currently, we modeled a long-term weighted-average differential of approximately a negative $0.35 off NYMEX for the Marcellus asset, assuming no contribution from Constitution.","Given that assumption, we would only need to see a $2.35 to $3.35 NYMEX price annually to achieve the $900 million to $2 billion range of pre-tax free cash flow highlighted on the bottom of this slide. I think most would agree the range of NYMEX price is not a stretch especially in light of all the demand growth we are anticipating throughout the remainder of this decade.","The obvious follow-up question from this slide is, what are you going to do with all the free cash flow? We have attempted to address some of the possibilities on slide 13. Assuming the takeaway capacity is there and pricing is favorable, our first option would always be to reinvest it back into the Marcellus asset given that we believe this is one of the most economic assets in the country.","Assuming we cannot reinvest at all in the Marcellus, we will continue to look at allocating a small portion of the cash flow into the Eagle Ford assuming the returns justify it. I believe our increase in Eagle Ford capital earlier this year, coupled with our planned increase in Marcellus capital in 2018 to grow into a new takeaway capacity, highlights our commitment to this portion of the strategy.","The bottom left box is a current focus of discussion for our Management and the Board and one that we take very seriously. Obviously, we have been in a bit of a holding pattern over the last few years as we await clarity on the timing of infrastructure and what that ultimately meant for our capital requirements as we began to ramp activity levels and production into these projects.","As a result, even though we saw the likelihood of free cash flow on the horizon, we were hesitant to commit to any incremental return of cash to shareholders. However, as we get closer to having some of these projects in service and, therefore, have more confidence in the timing of being able to deliver free cash flow projects that our income model implies, we are more focused on this discussion.","I would highlight that in the past, we have demonstrated our commitment to returning cash to shareholders via our doubling of dividends in 2013 and the repurchase of shares in both 2013 and 2014, so, it is certainly a priority of ours.","For several years, I've been asked numerous times what Cabot plans to do with its anticipated cash flow outside of reinvesting in our current high level operating areas and returning cash to shareholders. As you may suspect, I have received a plethora of ideas from many different circles. The Cabot team has worked overtime evaluating many plausible uses of our anticipated free cash with the objective to create long term sustainable value for Cabot shareholders. I have never deviated from this objective. Having a world-class asset as the cornerstone only enhances the challenge, although I might add it is a high class challenge.","The search carries us to many areas including bolt-on acquisitions, joint ventures, acreage trades, and our internally generated greenfield ideas. In order for these greenfield ideas to warrant consideration, capital allocation, our team participates in an exhaustive evaluation process to determine if the idea meets our objectives.","Several examples of our objective include the cost of entry. Do we think the idea can potentially generate full-cycle returns and compete with our current portfolio? We also ask about high-quality drilling locations. Is the idea scalable and well positioned for efficient operations? What's the initial term from leasing to full-scale efficient development? When do we get positive free cash flow? Impacts on balance sheet? Potential growth?","So, as you can see, all of these ideas have gone through our decision that we've come up with. I'm confident that Cabot's process of evaluation, risk assessment, and methodology, and methodical capital allocation will result in enhanced long-term value for its shareholders.","As we highlighted earlier, there is a high degree of risk associated with a grassroots leasing exploration effort. However, compared to our evaluation of the acquisitions made in the M&A space and the implied first-cycle economics on those transactions, we are comfortable with the risk profile and the potential project returns of our ideas to support this grassroots effort. After all, approximately 10 years ago, we drilled our first well in our grassroots Marcellus play in Northeast Pennsylvania and we have certainly been pleased with those returns.","With that, Phil, I'll be happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Dan. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Okay. Our first question comes from Michael Glick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Just on the exploratory plays. I mean, recognizing you're probably hesitant to provide a ton of color given its early-stage nature. But just any high-level thoughts from the types of plays you're chasing in the competitive landscape within the plays? And then are hydrocarbon or geologic \u2013 geographic diversification some of the goals here?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah. Primary goal, really one, two and three, is could we find an area to allocate capital that would compete with the return profile we see in our existing portfolio. And therefore, deliver the returns to our shareholders that would exceed where we're investing capital right now.","So, we were indifferent regarding the commodity diversity and looking at the areas, potential competitive landscapes and a lot of areas that we're all aware of. Through an exploration effort, we evaluated every basin that is out there. We looked at, actually, areas that were not necessarily in traditional fairway of the key basins.","But all-in-all, and balling all of that up, also looking and evaluating all the M&A transactions that have transpired, we did go through some data rooms and get a good feel for valuations out there and that's based to be able to compare to not only did that meet our threshold of full-cycle returns, but also, did it allow for us to enhance our portfolio of projects on a go-forward spend.","And as we continue to do our exploration effort, our guys came up with good ideas that we felt justified further expenditure. And so, when you look at our cost of entry and you look at the possible returns that we see in these two projects and you look at the scale that we're comfortable with being able to develop, we are excited about where we've allocated the capital and we're also excited about moving forward with some incremental testing.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","But you're right. I don't want to be coy on the exploration ideas. But as you appreciate in your \u2013 the way you catch the question, we're just not going to talk in-depth about specifics of what we're doing. But I do appreciate the question regarding kind of our thought process on what we're trying to achieve.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. And then just jumping to the Marcellus, what do you think the drivers are of the outperformance of your Q1 wells versus your Gen 4 type curve?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Well, we've seen the enhanced cluster spacing. We've loaded a little bit more in the lateral foot basins. We have tweaked our pump pressures and our pump rates and we feel good about what we're seeing in the results and the early time curve. We are, in fact, have seen now a number of wells off of several different pads come online, short time, Michael, knowing that it is again, just kind of near-term cleanup production, 30, 40, 50 days, some of these. But it is exceeding our 4.4 type curve that we came out with at the beginning of the year. So, all those things are, I think, contributing to just our ability to maybe break a little bit more rock, a little bit more near-wellbore conductivity and we're seeing the results.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. And then if I could sneak one last quick one in. Just on Atlantic Sunrise, does FERC need a quorum to issue a Notice to Proceed?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","I will turn that to Jeff.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Michael, the simple answer is no.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So, basically, you get the other permits from the states and then the current situation, they could approve it?","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes. If you've been following the other projects in Southwest PA, in Ohio, West Virginia, et cetera, the Notices to Proceed are coming out on a regular basis from the staff. Additionally, we've got some partial Notices to Proceed on Atlantic Sunrise for the mainline construction and you see those pop up about every week and they range from compressor station work to looping and other projects on the mainline.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Well, thank you very much.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thank you Michael.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth from BMO. Please go ahead.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hey, Phillip.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Wondering if you could talk to the decision to budget $125 million this year for exploration and really just the need for a new core area when, I mean, on the surface, it's a little less obvious with 3,000 Marcellus locations remaining. And then also could you just update us on your view of incremental Marcellus production capacity beyond the 3.7 Bcf a day ex-Constitution?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Okay. I'll leave the second part of that question to Jeff. But in looking at our allocation of an additional $125 million, if you look historically at exploration budget and you assess the amount that we've allocated in the past, the $125 million is frankly right in line with where we've allocated in the past, less than except the last two years. So, there's nothing unique about that level of capital allocation.","When we began our effort of looking at our needs in the future to enhance shareholder value, we look at the Marcellus and the Marcellus is such a low capital intensity asset, i.e. the need for the number of drilling rigs and the need for a number of frac crews to grow our production that we knew we were going to generate a significant amount of free cash.","As I mentioned, even in the most punitive realizations Cabot has had in its corporate history, in 2016 we still generated free cash and grew that asset. With this infrastructure build-out that is occurring as we speak and looking at the amount of capital necessary to fulfill all of the capacity of those new projects, it again is not going to take near the amount of free cash \u2013 near the amount of capital that we're generating and we'll have the free cash. So, the need to do something with the free cash is an obvious question because we have it.","We put that slide together where we've tried to box out and include on slide 13 the number of different considerations that we will consider with our free cash. We will touch on a number of them. We'll touch on, I think, the distribution to shareholders with some of it. We'll also allocate the necessary amount to our Marcellus to grow every opportunity that we get but, again, it doesn't take much capital. And you could see by maintaining 3.7 Bcf flat for 25 years, we don't get much over $500 million, $600 million. So, the free cash is there. We could do all these things that we're talking about.","One of the ideas that every company that is in our space, the E&P space \u2013 every company out there, and you can look at the hierarchy of valuations and those that you, in your portfolio, you recognize as companies that have significant value and have the opportunity to grow, you give them better multiples and more consideration and valuations and future valuations than you do those that do not grow.","Again, we're not in the business to burn capital. We thought we could make a entry into new areas, take a cost-effective look at our opportunity to find new return projects that compete with or exceed what we're allocating capital to right now. And if we are successful in that endeavor, I think Cabot shareholders are going to be rewarded handsomely for the decision.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's really helpful. And there's also, I mean, as you mentioned, a lot of focus on free cash. Wondering if you would expect to be free cash positive in 2018 in a material way after considering the pipeline contributions, increased Marcellus activity, core growth in the second half. Or is 2019 really the inflection point for free cash where you get a full year's benefit of production and lower both pipeline and growth CapEx?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","I'll turn it to Scott for some, a little color. But the short answer is yes, we'll be free cash flow positive in 2018.","Scott C. Schroeder - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hi. And Philip, that is correct. And the magnitude at least right now with current strip pricing, it will be in the same zip code or fairway as what we're expecting around the $250 million, slightly more than the $250 million, even with the expanded program in 2018. So, if you think $250 million to $300 million is material, then the answer is a very definitive yes.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And then last question just in the new slide deck, you point out that Northeast PA indices have been trading at a slight discount to Dom South. I was curious if you have a view on whether this narrowing of price differentials between the two areas is sustainable as you look at pipeline capacity, expected to come on in the next year or two in both Southwest PA, Northeast PA. And if so, is hedging Dom South an option that you guys would consider in the future?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah. I'll make a quick comment, Phillip, but yes, we're extremely positive about the direction of the differentials, what we're seeing right now in the narrowing has taken place. We gave some brief reasons in the teleconference talk about the reasons why we think that phenomenon has taken place. And yes, we do think it is sustainable. And I think as the build-out occurs, I think we're going to see a better hedge market further out, but I'll let Jeff comment on some color.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah, Phillip. I'm probably even the most optimistic in the group. Not only do I think it's sustainable, I think it's encouraging how the market has reacted to the initial onslaught of overbuilt infrastructure in the Southwest part of the play.","To me, the best is yet to come on the \u2013 with the local demand. Back to your original question, with the local demand in Northeast PA picking up, I mean, who would have thought even a year ago that we'd be supplying two major power generation facilities in mid-2018.","So, we're really optimistic that a lot of flowing gas will reach Atlantic Sunrise as opposed to a lot of the development gas throughout the Northeast region, a lot of projects being kicked around on gas-to-liquids, on methanol to gasoline, the CNG with moving around the different utilities up there. So, very optimistic on the basis and how the optionality is going to be improved with all of the infrastructure.","Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks a lot.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Dan, and to the rest of your team there.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hi.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I apologize if I missed this in your prepared comments but did you give us a sense of the timeline for when you'd be able to give a verdict one way or another on these two exploratory areas?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","No, Charles. I hadn't given any timeline. But it is in our capital budget that we put out that we would be testing both of these ideas in 2017.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. And so, is it the right interpretation then, Dan, that you will be able to give a thumbs up or thumbs down in 2017?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","I think it's plausible that we'll have a lot of data that would give the likelihood that we could.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. And then if I could ask a question about your appetite to add in the Eagle Ford, it sounds like the way you describe your exploratory plays, that the Eagle Ford doesn't really fit as one of those because it's not greenfield leasing. But there seems like there's a lot of acreage that's coming up trading hands now. And how does that stack up in your capital allocation evaluation?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah. A couple of ways. One, our Eagle Ford has improved as you've seen with the deck we just went through, our efficiency, our cost of business, cost of operations, the return that we are able to deliver and the strip pricing that we have out there right now. We're getting good returns in our Eagle Ford operation. Now, those returns do not compete with our Marcellus operation.","So, what our objective in looking out ahead is not only did we evaluate some of the acreage in the Eagle Ford when we assessed where we might be allocating additional capital. But in the areas that we have gone to, we felt comfortable that we would be able to maybe even enhance our return profile in these new areas above what we are seeing in the Eagle Ford. And if, in fact, that is the case, we are going to certainly be pleased with those results.","When you look at the other assets that are in the Eagle Ford, that might be in play out there, you have to burden some of that with the full-cycle consideration that we have talked about in other basins where there was a lot of activity. And when you stack that on top, again, you have to measure the full-cycle returns to see if it's what we want on a go-forward basis or do we keep looking someplace else.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's helpful color. Thanks, Dan.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thank you, Charles.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning, and congratulations on all the fine results.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thank you, Jeffrey.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I wanted to ask a little bit different questions about the exploratory tests, if I could. I just want to kind of get an idea of what you're going to do, not trying to ferret out locations and whatnot. I was just wondering, are you going to shoot any seismic prior to drilling? Is there an existing well control in the plays that you're in? And will the first test be vertical or horizontal wells?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah. On all of that, we have seismic. We do plan on shooting additional seismic. We have control points, subsurface control points that we've incorporated into our interpretation. And the initial process would involve a combination of both verticals to gather core data. And then probably a short lateral to evaluate the section a little bit more thoroughly. So, yeah, and all of that is included within our capital program.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. Appreciate it. Your Eagle Ford results, I thought, actually, I mean, it has significantly improved. I was wondering, you've listed three variables \u2013 25% more sand, 58% reduced cluster spacing, and intra-stage diversion where you weren't doing that before. I was just curious, are any one of these variables any more important than the other or is it just sort of a fairly even and cumulative effect?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","I'm going to turn it to Steve Lindeman who runs our Eagle Ford operations. But there is a cumulative impact, but I'll let him articulate.","Steven W. Lindeman - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah. I agree with Dan's comment. It's cumulative in our opinion. We're studying each one of those components. Obviously, as we see sand costs increase in the area, we're looking at what gives us the biggest bank for the buck. And so, we're dissecting all of those components so that we spend the completion dollars as efficiently as possible.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And if I could just ask one more on that point. So far, how much is the increased completion design increase the completed cost of the wells?","Steven W. Lindeman - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","So far, it has been very nominal for us. Roughly, I don't want to get too granular, let's see, maybe less than $400,000 or so a well. As we go into the latter half of the year, we do and we have budgeted for an increased sand cost and that's where we're going to be further analyzing each one of these components.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Right. Understood. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Jeffrey.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hi, David.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just curious on the Marcellus completions now. Have you seen early data for outperformance relative to curve? And then I guess even with the Gen 4 curve, has the choke management philosophy changed at all over the last year or so with the new completions relative to your prior design?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","We are \u2013 well, from the last year, not really. We do kind of bring these things on slow. We are able to turn them in line fairly soon after initial completion and we do manage it, but it's not like you might think if it was a high over-pressured reservoir choke management, but we do manage it. And we've been doing that though for over a year.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then the last one for me, I think other people have asked plenty of questions, you've given good color on the exploration initiatives. But you mentioned also earlier that you were evaluating a lot of different opportunities including being in data rooms for valuation markers. And I guess, is it fair to say that for most bolt-on deals or deals that you were in data rooms for some larger packages out there that the full-cycle returns would have been sort of prohibitive to pursue that relative to some of the other assets that you have and that maybe the best course of action was to do more greenfield activity right now?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Absolutely. Yeah. When we first began well over a year ago, couple years ago, actually, and as the M&A market intensified and the number of deals increased, we were very proactive in trying to understand valuations and understand the dollars that were going into these projects and wanted to evaluate the full-cycle returns.","So, we did gather a significant amount of data to look at that, but we had to approach this in a little bit of a unique way because we did have and do have a company that has really good assets. We were growing this company and anticipate further growth, certainly, once the infrastructure gets in place. We were generating free cash even in the most punitive price realization environments that we have seen in years.","So, we didn't want to mess that aspect of what we can deliver to shareholders up and confuse the market on whether or not the investment of that any free cash going into another area for a large M&A transaction, what it would do to a full-cycle return profile once you melt it altogether. And we made the decision, actually fairly early on that, that did not return, again, full-cycle the values to the shareholder that we wanted to see. So, we began, continued in earnest, to look for ideas that we thought we could create as a grassroots effort and that's where we have gone.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Appreciate it all.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","And I'm pleased with a couple things. One, I'm pleased with, one, being able to find ideas in this competitive environment that would fit that portion of our evaluation. And again, with a company of Cabot's size, I'm also pleased that we're going to be able to get to the scale that we need to be able to move forward on these projects also.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Dan. And then just the last housekeeping one for me, the $60-some-million or $66 million spent in 1Q on these initiatives, does that largely reflect the cost of entry? Or I guess should we see that coming through \u2013 I guess if I was to split up the budget in half, is the remainder of it just for more well specific and planning evaluation-type work or is there still some entry costs coming in in the second quarter?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","The $66 million in the first quarter covers a large percentage of the lease acq [acquisition]. A very large percentage of the lease acquisition. We'll have a little bit more on top of that, but we feel very comfortable that the remaining amount, i.e. the $125 million total budgeted for this effort is going to be adequate to not only cover all of our anticipated lease acq, but also cover the testing phase.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Dan, and best of luck.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hello, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","You mentioned in one of your slides that you're still exploring other outlets for Marcellus gas and I wondered if you could give us an update on how that's looking beyond the projects that you've talked about that are going to be hitting the books in the next couple years? What some of those other outlets are and how significant they could be?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Brian. I will turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah, Brian. Thanks for the question. I think earlier, I touched on a few initiatives that we're looking at particularly local demand in the region that we operate. The projects that we're looking at are in a somewhat smaller scale attached to our gathering system. There's a lot of ideas floating around the CNG aspect, moving CNG gas to different markets. Also the small peaking power plants, we've added a couple of those just up here in the last few months. We're looking at several larger scale projects with ethanol developers and methane, the gasoline projects.","We're also looking at additional market share and teaming up partnership with market on a couple projects. We have not ruled out another pipeline although pipelines are challenging in this environment but we're continuing down that path with, again, a couple of markets. I think the PennEast project is going to allow for some additional development that we're, I would say, in the midst of finalizing negotiations on additional market share there.","So, it's exciting up there. There's still a lot going on, a lot of moving pieces and I still expect the landscape to be quite different a year from now in a positive way than even where we sit today.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. And one quick one and I apologize if you said this earlier. But with regards to the exploratory areas, can you say whether you are looking for or whether your expectations are for oil, dry gas or liquids-rich gas?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah. What I had indicated, Brian, was that our focus again, one, two, and three was just on a return, that we were indifferent on the commodity. At this stage, it's looking at, like, that our focus is going to be oil at this time though, where these ideas have floated to the top.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Karl Chalabala. Please go ahead.","Karl J. Chalabala - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Good morning, Karl. How are you?","Karl J. Chalabala - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'm well. Thank you. There's a view that NIPA growth is somewhat finite near term until these capacity expansions come on line but the guidance raise would indicate production, including Cabot's, can grow prior to that and local pricing likely remains supportive given the current bound storage levels and then, of course, the evacuation on the horizon.","Could you sort of discuss what this in-basin market share looks like, Cabot's market share potential near-term particularly next winter? And then how the company is thinking about potentially capturing local market share growth above FTE capacity when the basin debottlenecks?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah, I will \u2013 we do have a slide out there that has \u2013 I'm thinking we had a slide in one of our presentations that had the market share and our percentage contribution to each indices, but I'll let Jeff handle the other question.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Okay. So, it really follows along what we've talked about here on this call and a few areas on the local band (47:37). We've got a very active program on market development up there. We've explored a lot of opportunities. We continue to think that having dependable, reliable reserves and the optionality that we have with our infrastructure up there, our gathering infrastructure, gives us a lot of advantages in moving gas to different markets and during different time periods.","We went through a number of expansions on the gathering system with our partnership now with Williams and we've really created a unique opportunity for Cabot in allowing our gas to have access to multiple markets even on a daily basis. We've tested this concept. We're able to move gas between pipes to take advantage of pricing but also just to take advantage of capturing market share when a pipeline goes underutilized.","We do expect though longer term and even as we enter early 2018 to mid-2018, as our power plants get ready for service and the Atlantic Sunrise project and even further out a little bit, PennEast, we expect to see a lot of flowing gas that's currently on our three major pipelines to fill the capacity that some producer-shippers and market shippers have purchased on these new projects.","We think that's going to free up some capacity in the existing pipeline infrastructure and we'll be able to grow some market share, particularly on the pipes that we do business with our customers on a daily basis.","So, I guess we're teeing it up to take advantage of what we've participated in, in terms of commitments of FTE and the power generators. But we also think there's a unique opportunity to grow our market share based on what we see on the activity level with our peers and how we perceive the basins, fulfilling the new capacity in the next 18 to 24 months.","Karl J. Chalabala - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful color. And then I guess sort of subsequent to that, if you could discuss your \u2013 obviously, this production growth this year, the rates, just getting done with the one rig, one completion crew plan. Can you sort of discuss how the company plans to add either rigs or more completion crews into and through early 2018 as Sunrise and the rest of the power, Orion, and other projects come on line?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah. We do plan in 2018 that we'll most likely just be adding a rig and a frac rig. That's all that's going to be necessary to grow into the new capacity. And then the 2018 program, when you look at outside of the Marcellus, the 2018 program is going to take in consideration not only where we are with our Eagle Ford. And again, the gaining efficiencies in return that we see there, but it will certainly be augmented with new data coming from our couple of areas of testing that we're going to do during 2017.","Karl J. Chalabala - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you, guys. That's all I have for today.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Carl.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note, today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thank you, Rocco, and thank you all for joining this morning for Cabot's second quarter 2017 earnings call. I have Cabot's executive management team with me for the call this morning. Before we get started, I would first like to highlight that on this morning's call we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.","For the second quarter, Cabot delivered another successful report card highlighted by 14% year-over-year production growth, while generating positive free cash flow for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our production growth for the quarter was driven by 15% increase in net Marcellus volumes year-over-year. This production [technical difficulty] (1:29 \u2013 1:45)","Operator","Pardon the interruption, ladies and gentlemen. It appears we've lost the audio from the speaker's location.

Mr. Dinges, the floor is yours, sir.","And pardon me, it looks like we are having some difficulty with their location. Please, stand by.","Operator","Sorry for the interruption, everybody.

I'm not sure where I left the floor.","Operator","You disconnected right after the forward-looking statement, sir.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Okay, all right, we can retool. Would you check and see if we paid the phone bill, please?","For the second quarter, Cabot delivered another successful report card, highlighted by 14% year-over-year production growth, while generating positive free cash flow for the fifth consecutive quarter. Production growth for the quarter was driven by 15% increase in net Marcellus volumes year-over-year. This production growth coupled with an increase in Marcellus cash margins of almost 100% were the primary drivers for our strong cash flow growth year-over-year.","Our year-to-date results further highlight what our high-quality asset base is capable of delivering, including the generation of $123 million of positive free cash flow despite realizations of an average price of about $2.50 for natural gas and $45 for oil. This positive free cash flow is net of the capital we utilized during the first half of the year to invest in growing our year-to-date production volumes by 10% year-over-year, to contribute to our equity ownership interest in the Atlantic Sunrise and Constitution Pipeline projects and to fund our grassroots leasing efforts in our two exploratory ventures, all of which provide us with optionality to create value for our shareholders.","Of the $123 million of positive free cash flow, we have returned $100 million to the shareholders year-to-date via dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, during the second quarter, we increased our dividend by 150% and repurchased 3 million shares at an average share price of $22.41. As I've reiterated over the past few quarters, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders while generating double-digit returns focused growth for the foreseeable future and I believe our actions during the quarter demonstrate that commitment. We will continue to focus on increasing our return of capital to shareholders as we gain more conviction in the timing of our new infrastructure and power plant projects and our resultant ability to execute on our robust growth plans over the coming year.","I would highlight that when I mention robust growth in the future, I am referring not only to production growth, but also growth in free cash flow. While many of our industry peers are highlighting the ability to generate double-digit production growth within cash flow a few years from now at commodity price assumptions that are higher than the current strip, we are already delivering on this plan today.","Our balance sheet continues to improve as we exited the second quarter with a net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDAX ratio of 1.1 times which is in line with our long-term target as we continue to manage our business around maintaining an investment-grade-like balance sheet. We continue to maintain over $500 million of cash on hand and have approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments under our credit facility. This liquidity allows us flexibility in the volatile environment as we assess all opportunities to create value for our shareholders and manage risk.","In this morning's release, we also reaffirm our production growth, unit cost and capital guidance for the year, despite a small sequential decline implied by our third quarter guidance due primarily to mechanical issues at a third-party compressor that will likely continue until late August. We are very confident of being able to achieve our full year production targets. To illustrate this point, if you were to hold the midpoint of our third quarter guidance flat in the fourth quarter, we would hit the midpoint of our 8% to 12% full year production guidance range. However, our current intent is to grow our volumes sequentially in the fourth quarter based on our price expectations. Additionally, we are still targeting a 15% to 25% of returns focused growth in 2018 which will ultimately be dependent on the timing of infrastructure projects throughout the year.","Moving on to our operations for the quarter in the Marcellus, our volumes for the second quarter were essentially flat to our first quarter volumes, which was in line with our expectations and guidance. We brought online only six wells as we had planned to do. Our Marcellus price expectations and realizations remained strong during the second quarter, increasing approximately 50% year-over-year. While we are forecasting a slight widening of basis during the third quarter, based on the current strip, we anticipate that fourth quarter differentials will revert back to levels similar to the first quarter of this year before significantly improving in the first quarter of 2018. This anticipated improvement is driven by the potential for approximately 6 Bcf per day of new takeaway capacity to be placed in service throughout the basin between now and the end of the first quarter.","On the well productivity front, we continue to see positive momentum driven by the results of our Gen 4 wells year-to-date. We have placed 26 Gen 4 wells on production and the average production per lateral foot continues to outperform our 4.4 industry-leading Bcf per 1,000 feet type curve. We recently implemented a pilot program to test a new completion design that is focused on reducing our overall completion cost highlighting our ongoing effort to identify new efficiency gains and to mitigate potential well cost inflation in the future.","In the Eagle Ford, we grew our daily oil production by 9% sequentially during the quarter despite a few operational delays, most of which were outside of our control. Additionally, as we highlighted in the press release, our long lateral wells were taking a little longer to clean up and reach peak production levels which has caused us to adjust our timing of the estimated production profiles for these wells. However, the overall estimated recovery from these wells on a per lateral foot basis has not changed given that our longer lateral wells ultimately catch up to the type curve within a few months of production and have demonstrated a shallower decline.","On the cost front, we realized another 9% decrease in our Eagle Ford cost \u2013 drilling cost per foot relative to the first quarter, driven by faster drill times for which the cost savings has helped us offset the incremental completion cost associated with the higher density completions. We have obviously experienced a weakening in the outlook for oil prices since our first quarter call, which puts pressure on all oil projects, including returns in our Eagle Ford, despite continued improvements in our operating efficiencies.","Our current plan is to continue to execute on our program for the remainder of the year, given that most of the capital we are allocating in Eagle Ford during the second half of the year is committed to or related to leasehold maintenance obligations. However, as we begin formulating our plans for 2018, I want to reiterate that we plan to remain disciplined with our capital allocation. We evaluated all of our opportunities, and we continue to evaluate all our opportunities to create value for shareholders in a sub-$50 oil price environment. Allocating any incremental capital to the Eagle Ford above what is needed to hold production flat and to maintain leasehold likely falls behind our superior returns in the Marcellus acceleration program and returning cash to shareholders in the pecking order.","Infrastructure, Atlantic Sunrise remains on schedule for a potential construction start date beginning this quarter. As most of you are aware, we filed our final PA DEP and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit applications back in late May. We are now planning to receive both of these permits by late August, which will likely result in a mid to late September construction start.","I also want to highlight that the Chapter 102 and 105 permits from Pennsylvania and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 404 permits are unrelated and will not necessarily be issued in any particular order. Based on the expectation of a 10-month construction period, the expectation remains for the pipeline to be in full service by mid-2018. We feel very confident in the timing of our remaining projects given that the TGP Orion is now expected to be placed in service in December, which is significantly ahead of the original schedule, while our two power plant projects, Moxie Freedom and the Lackawanna Energy Center, are currently under construction and on schedule.","Also, a short update on Constitution, as there have been a few interesting Constitution-related data points regarding similar projects that have also been denied permits or delayed by the New York BEC. We continue to await the outcome from Constitution appeal in the Second Circuit Court, which will likely see some movement during the third quarter. In the meantime, the Constitution operator continues to assess various legal strategies in addition to our ongoing appeal. Williams has recently been vocal regarding their ongoing dialogue with the current administration surrounding our options on this project. We will continue to monitor this process, but we feel more optimistic about this project coming online in the next few years than we did say a year ago.","A brief comment on the exploration front, the exploration effort is on schedule with our program. We have amassed a similar level of net acreage as our Eagle Ford footprint in one of our prospects, which is located in Texas. We have also secured a significant amount of acreage on our second prospect. The plan is to drill and evaluate the prospects with five wells between now and the end of the year. Additionally, we plan to remain within our budget of $125 million for all of this effort. This effort does not deter in any way our laser focus on generating our superior returns from our Marcellus operation.","In summary, based on our increasing confidence in the timing of the infrastructure buildout in Appalachia coupled with our deep inventory of high-return drilling locations, we believe that we can execute on a program that will provide double-digit returns-focused production growth while generating free cash flow, further strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity position, improve our unit costs and margins, drive further improvements in capital efficiency, delivers an improving return on capital employed, and returns an increasing amount of cash to shareholders, all while assuming commodity prices that are no higher than today's strip. There are not many companies that can support a bullet point list similar to this.","With that, Rocco, I'll be happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Today's first question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","Good morning, Dan.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hey, Charles.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","I wanted to ask about your share buybacks. I think I understand what you're trying to indicate about the confidence in your cash flows from the midstream deals, but I'm wondering. Can you elaborate more on what are the other pieces of your thought process as you're going to evaluate your future stock buybacks?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes, I'll let Scott. Scott loves handling all the money and makes these money calls.","Scott C. Schroeder - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Charles. Again, when you look back at our history, even the last 10 years, we've been in and out of the market at various points based on our level of cash and things like that. At the end of the day, it is an opportunistic buyback. We've had authorization for a long period of time. Our authorization now is down to about 7 million shares when it was split adjusted. That means we've bought in about 13 million shares in our history in the last 10 years.","But again, it is simply the fact that when we internally see a disconnect with what we know what's going on versus the marketplace \u2013 and we have no delusions. We understand the market is efficient, but at times there is those disconnects, and we saw that in the second quarter. And we want to send a message, so we're using some of that free cash flow rather than just let it sit on our balance sheet to buy in the shares and again, right now we made a very economic decision with $22.41 versus the $25 we're trading at now. We'll continue to be opportunistic, and I don't want to leave the impression that it's got to get back to $22 before we will be active in the market. Again, when we see weakness, we'll be opportunistic.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Charles, I might add also. As we progress in our plan and we get the infrastructure approval that we anticipate, we start ramping our program into filling those lines in incremental production. We see the compression that we expect in the Marcellus of the differential up there, our realizations improve. We're going to be generating a significant amount of cash. So that also will be a strong influence and a dictator of how we allocate cash back to shareholders.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","Thanks, Dan and Scott. That's helpful insight in your thinking. And, Dan, I wanted to ask my second question about these Gen 4 completions. And I like the update that you gave us, I think it's on slide 10 of your new presentation. But I'm wondering if you can guide our interpretation a bit of that. When I look at it, I see that those two lines are separating in the early days, but then they seem like they're becoming more parallel on that cume versus time. So to me, I'm thinking maybe this Gen 4 has outperformance in the early days but then settles into similar to your past completions. But is that the right way to look at it?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","I agree that it may be running a parallel course which in my opinion is actually good. We see that it does go past the 4.4 Bcf type curve on the slide that you're referring to, but running parallel and above that 4.4 Bcf line is what we are seeing and what we're pleased with. So as you travel out if it continues running parallel it's obvious that we would be capturing maybe greater than the 4.4 Bcf per 1,000 foot of lateral.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company L.L.C.","Got it. Thanks for that, Dan.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hey, Doug.","John H. Abbott - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. This is John. Nope, this is not Doug. This is John Abbott calling in on behalf of Doug.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hey, John.","John H. Abbott - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","How are you doing? Just a couple of quick questions on our side. First, how are you thinking about the ramp, your ramp into Atlantic Sunrise? Are you thinking about growing aggressively into that or taking volumes potentially that are constrained elsewhere and moving it over? And second with regards to the Pennsylvania permits, what benchmark should we be looking there in order to see that if they get finished? I mean, you're expecting it here shortly, but what else needs to be done?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thank you. I'll give the second part of that to Jeff, but on the Atlantic Sunrise growth, we've kind of been clear on the ramp is not going to be instantaneously incremental. We are going to shift volumes out of the basin where we've had punitive differentials. We think with that shift that we should see as we expect a narrowing of that differential in basin, which would affect positively the gas that we do continue to produce in basin, and then we will continue to grow the volumes incrementally into the new capacity that Sunrise affords us.","So it won't be instantaneous, but we certainly are planning our 2018 program as we're preparing to present to our board in October an increased capital program for 2018 that would allow us to grow our production in the 15% to 25% range as we have outlined.","John H. Abbott - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate that. And then with regards to the Pennsylvania permits? What's left there for that to be done?","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Okay, John. Yes, we have two outstanding permits that are commonly known as the Section 102 and Section 105 permits. You're probably aware that the Pennsylvania DEP went out for public comments back in May on these two permits. That was closed late June. There were several thousand comments submitted and quite frankly a lot of them were positive. And right now the DEP is sorting through those comments, preparing answers and finalizing last-minute data request from questions that may have come up during that comment period. So we're expecting going forward that these permits are just getting the final touches to them, so to speak. And they'll be out the door here mid to late August.","John H. Abbott - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, John.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Dan, in the past you've indicated interest in maintaining some level of diversification in the portfolio even if modest with the Eagle Ford representing that place in the portfolio today. With the focus understandably on returning cash to shareholders even ahead of Eagle Ford drilling, are you now more comfortable with the asset base being even more levered to Northeast PA, and if so, are there changes that are increasing your long-term confidence in any growth from the region beyond a couple of pipelines and power plants that you've spoken about today?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Well, as we get closer to the realization that we will be able to start construction on infrastructure and move significant volumes, not only in the pipelines up there, but I think there's other projects that would be supportive of the differentials and realizations \u2013 and improve the realizations that we've seen in the past. As we go through that process and we get shovels in the ground, absolutely we're incrementally more comfortable about not only our growth horizon, but also our ability to return even more free cash to our coffer by virtue of the growth and improved differentials.","There's still a look at the two exploration programs that we feel like if successful could return significant value for our shareholders. And we're going to vet those through the data gathering process that I have outlined.","Going out and looking out in the Northeast and looking at the power plant projects, looking at the Atlantic Sunrise, yes, we have anticipation of Constitution also securing the approval later, whether it's 2019 or 2020, we think that could be an incremental gain. We do know that there is committed to firm capacity in the infrastructure up there that might not be filled by those holders of that firm that also provides an avenue for future growth up there also.","So between now and 2020 compared to where Cabot has been on the last three years just trying to battle the regulators and the anti-group trying to stop pipeline from being installed, I am extremely optimistic about the near-term for Cabot. And our concern about diversity or growth mitigates each day as we get closer to these infrastructure approvals.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. That's helpful. Small follow-up on exploration and I think in your comments you mentioned one of the two projects was in Texas. I think last quarter you said that at least one of the projects was seeking oil. Is that still the case? Can you give any color on the second project and when \u2013 on either one there'll be more color that you can share from a well performance perspective?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes, we are. With these two prospects, they are tied to a diversity if you will in the commodity mix. So yes, oil is the focus and as we gather additional information through between now and the end of the year, we would only be speculating in what we anticipate. We do continue to do our due diligence and looking at the data that we have in hand, looking at the reprocessed seismic that we continue to work and continue to gather more data. And some of it being subsurface data from the past in each of these prospect areas.","So, the data we gather continues to reinforce our concepts on both of these prospects. So from timing, Brian, on when we might have something solid, I really think it would be after the first of the year. Ideally, what I would love to see would be four or so wells in each prospect area tested, some flow back period and with those tests and flow back period we could give you cost examples. We could give you return profiles. We could even look at the quality of the fluid mix to talk a little bit more in depth about what it's going to take on the surface side of the business and the infrastructure side and give assurances that we've mitigated risk on program execution from logistics.","That's when I would feel great about talking about it. I'm sure we'll be asked about it and maybe we'll process out a little bit of information along the way, but that's kind of overall in a summary fashion how I look at releasing data on exploratory projects.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And are there any wells that are down today or is it just the five that are going to be drilled between now and the end of the year?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","The only wells that are down today are wells that have been drilled subsequent to us getting into the area, and that was typically wells drilled years and years and years ago.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bob Morris with Citi. Please go ahead.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hello, Bob. You must be on mute.","Operator","Hello, Mr. Morris? Okay, we will go to the next question, which is from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Good morning, Jeffrey.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I think my first question is probably a Jeff one. Recently, it looks like New Jersey is trying to imitate New York with the recent PennEast permit denial. I was just wondering if Jeff could give me his take on whether or not he thinks this is particularly significant at this point in the development of PennEast.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Sure, Jeffrey. So as a shipper on that project, we do communicate quite a bit with the operator and the other partners. The New Jersey denial was not unexpected. They realized that there was insufficient data that was necessary and required. And quite frankly they were moving toward that end when we lost the FERC quorum. As you know, PennEast is still pending their certificate. But in this law, I guess what I understand is they move more toward the complete application at this point, and it will get a second look.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great, thank you. And then just \u2013 I just want to make sure that I wasn't confused. Did you say that you're going to drill five total exploratory wells second half or is there going to be five in each one of these two exploratory areas that you've referred to?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Two different things. One we're going to plan within our $125 million budget to drill five exploratory wells in the second half. My comment on having five wells in each prospect was just an example that says that ideally I would like to have before we make full disclosure, full release, I would like to have that level of detail to be able to lay out and give the shareholder the confidence that we have really vetted these projects as opposed to coming out with just a little bit of information that would be maybe somewhat more speculative or not having any type of term to a test except for in one area or two areas or something like that.","I'd like to be able to see a little bit more information before we would make any release. I understand entirely though, as we get pushed to release information, that we'll do our best to accommodate those requests without giving away too much information and without speculating too much.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And with that color that you just provided, I'm just wondering. The five wells that you're going to drill, are you going to do some preliminary exploration in both of the plays or are you concentrating the five wells in one of them at this time?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","No, we are right now have \u2013 we have four wells in one area and the four wells that we have in the one area is the area that we had less subsurface control points to be able to mature our concept. And so we're gathering additional data there. One well in the other area, in this other area, we had and have more subsurface information and we have more information to mature our concept up front in that area, but the drilling of the well would assist us in proof of concept on some of our ideas.","Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you, I appreciate it.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Holly Stewart of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Holly Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, gentlemen.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hi, Holly.","Holly Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Maybe first one for Scott just on uses of capital. Just how are you thinking about f balancing the buyback versus the 2018 maturity?","Scott C. Schroeder - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","I think it's definitely not with our financial position an either\/or. As you know, we have a fully undrawn revolver of $1.7 billion. So worst case scenario, if we saw an opportunity to use a disproportionate share of the free cash plus what's on our balance sheet, being opportunistic, buying in shares, we would follow through on that opportunity and not worry about that we need to hold some of that in reserve for the 2018 maturity. The 2018 maturity does go current, so you'll see it as current actually this month. Most of it does, so you'll see it in current in the third quarter 10-Q.","As many of you know, Cabot is unrated by design over the years. One of the things we're going to explore is a refinancing strategy on that where we actually go to the public markets and get some indications from the agencies. We haven't been hurt by not being rated. At the same time, the size of the company we are and where we're at in our life cycle, it's probably time to explore that option. So that will also be taking place over the next probably six to eight to 10 months.","Holly Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, so help me with that. If you were not considered investment-grade, don't you have to post LCs for the pipes?","Scott C. Schroeder - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","No, because we have a longstanding track record and we are investment-grade in the private placement market, and we've worked through all those hurdles over the years.","Holly Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, great. And then maybe one just for Jeff on Constitution, given what we've seen with Millennium and Northern Access here as of late, any insights into the appeal or maybe how you're thinking about the future paths to take going forward?","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Sure, Holly. Of course, not just with Millennium and also with National Fuel, I hesitate to use the word the plot thickens, it may be appropriate. Regarding the Constitution and our appeal, we're on that tail end of the time period where we expect the Second Circuit to give us a ruling, so that's getting close. It is a complicated case, so it may not be right around the corner, but our expectations are that we'll see something out of the courts fairly soon.","I think the bottom line on the Millennium case was punting back authority levels to the FERC is obviously a very good thing, and we'll see how that plays out. It probably has a shorter duration to play out in the next few months as we see what the DEC actually does with that permit application here soon. And then National Fuel, of course, has such a similar set of facts that we have with Constitution and their plight with the sure pipeline and will be a New York-based company and the job creations and all of the good things that that new pipeline does is again very similar to Constitution, and we expect some clarity on just how we're going to be able to operate in New York.","Holly Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Great, thanks, guys.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Holly.","Operator","And our next question comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hey, Drew.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, Dan. I was hoping you'd speak to how this exploration program might play into your decisions around plans to accelerate return of cash to shareholders and how you envision the timing because obviously results are difficult to predict, as you had noted, and you might want to engage in a lot more testing before making a call to go to development mode or you might be disappointed and decide to cool down the program. So maybe can you just speak to that?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes, I can make it a short answer or a long answer. I'll try to get it in between. But our idea is to always improve our lie and to improve our capital efficiency. We believe that the best areas to allocate capital are in core areas. And I would define core areas as like our Marcellus. And there probably are several other maybe very core areas in the oil areas that would allow capital to be allocated, returns that would generate not only growth but also free cash.","Our objective is to try to improve our lie over any areas like our Eagle Ford that I do not \u2013 it's a good asset, certainly running even at these lower threshold commodity prices, our weighted average cost of capital. But I don't believe a company survives on just drilling areas that have a return profile based on the weighted cost of capital. So our objective would be to improve our lie and be able to do it in a way that would return not only significant returns-focused growth, but also free cash, which would in fact allow us to generate more free cash to give back to shareholders. So that's our objective.","If we were on your fail case or uncertain case, if we were to not be able to get to a core asset profile with our exploration program and then though we saw that our infrastructure projects were taking off in the Marcellus, we decided to go in that direction solely as an ongoing project, which by the way is a high-class problem to have with those assets, if we made that decision, I am confident with the subsurface data we have, with the concept design we've created that there is going to be incremental value in these assets in these two projects. And if in fact they were not core-type projects for us, I'd still think that with the dollars invested, entry level at a very, very low cost, that we would be able to generate significant returns for the shareholders if in fact we decided to monetize those assets.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's all very helpful color, Dan. And just on the timing of when you think you would be able to make a call or would like to make a call, is that in the next 12 months or is it end of 2018 or potentially beyond that before you decide this really does look like a core play or it doesn't?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes, Drew, I would think that \u2013 I would be surprised if it goes beyond 12 months that we would not be able to rationalize with a fairly high degree of confidence where in our return profile expectations that these two projects would fall.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, so envision that you did not have as much success as you wanted. Is that when you would try to accelerate that cash return to shareholders, let's say, in 12 months or something like that?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Well, we would make a decision at that time similar as we make decisions today with the facts and information in front of us.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's all very helpful color, Dan. Thank you.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Drew.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Deckelbaum of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Dan. Thanks for taking everyone's questions today.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","You bet, David.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Could you elaborate a little bit more on the pilot program that you have in the Eagle Ford to reduce well costs? Is that a function that you've tried some enhanced completions there and you're looking at some tweaks on just optimizing that cost down that perhaps you maybe use a bit too much services on these wells, or is it \u2013 how are you guys thinking about balancing that and what's that pilot program really looking at?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes, good question, David. I'll let Steve Lindeman field that question.","Steven W. Lindeman - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","David, throughout the year, we've done a number of things again as we released, we've been working to drive our drilling costs by drilling longer laterals. In this quarter, we completed lateral lengths up to 12,000 feet. And in addition to longer laterals, we've been doing some cluster spacing testing, some diverter testing. And those are the kind of results that we're digesting right now.","We've also upped our sand volume, which is one of the things of late that have increased completion costs. And so as we get more production data in on this population of wells, we're going to look at what combination or how we can optimize that to increase the return, whether we decrease sand, whether we adjust our clusters or look at what lateral lengths we might go to. So those are all the knobs that we're working out right now.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And is that just a function of the longer cleanup times just might cannibalize some of the returns there, just with the larger sand volumes?","Steven W. Lindeman - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes, clearly, what we're trying to do from a return perspective is up the initial rate, but obviously our long-term goal is to increase reserves from each well. And we're happy with what we're seeing in terms of the reserve profile, that we're seeing a flatter decline. But with the additional water that's being applied, and maybe it's a function of the additional clusters so that water is staying nearer to the well bore, it's just taking us longer to (48:25).","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","That's all helpful color. And the last one for me, Dan, is, I think recently you kind of discussed the sensitivity around the Eagle Ford program and sounds like the back half of the year, you said that capital is locked in for the leasehold. As you get into 2018, is the Eagle Ford program \u2013 are you at a decision point really that's sensitive to commodity price as to whether you want to sell this asset or sort of continue in a single rig sort of development mode? And is that price point closer to $50 or...","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes, at the level that we're in right now for oil commodity prices, what we've been doing with the capital allocation and the decision point to allocate capital to the Eagle Ford has been really based on lease obligations and maintaining our commitment and not losing any of the optionality that we would have in the future. And certainly in the event that we do get improvements in the commodity price that either way, whether we decide to allocate additional capital to it or if we decide to monetize, in either case, we want to maintain and keep all of our optionality. And so the pinch point is what kind of lease requirements that we need to complete to maintain that leasehold position.","So when you look at our entire program, we're running dual tracks here. We're looking at our return profile with every dollar we spend and I understand the angst with shareholders on why you're allocating money to a project that is not returning the superior returns that maybe a Marcellus would? But again there's a lot of capital in the industry being allocated, that don't return what the Marcellus does. And I think though that when we move forward with our exploratory projects, we do increase our optionality with infrastructure buildout. It gives us the ability to be a little bit more aggressive, if you will, in the decisions we make on where we want to allocate, how we want to allocate, what we want to monetize, and do we have some other options to maybe create additional new venture projects that meet a threshold definition as we would say as a core asset for us.","So we are really running some dual tracks right now and still trying to maintain our acreage position in the Eagle Ford. And the team has done a great job that has allowed us to again continue to get the returns we want, but everybody is wanting to have a program that would generate greater returns than the cost of capital.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Understood. Good luck with all the permits this summer. Thanks, Dan.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes, thanks, David.","Operator","And today's next question comes from Mike Kelly of Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning. Was hoping to just probe a little bit more into really the hurdle rate or threshold rate you're going to judge these new venture plays against. And if you could give us kind of a ballpark project return that really will improve your lie or generate growth in free cash flow. I know you've laid out the Eagle Ford as 45% project return at $50. The Marcellus is 120% at $2. I would imagine it's somewhere in between there. But what's kind of your ballpark rule of thumb or what's acceptable to you?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes, Mike, I'm not going to get down that granular. We have described exactly what you just laid out, that we're looking to improve our lie. We're looking to be able to find projects that would enhance the shareholders' value. And we think that from an Eagle Ford position-type asset, I don't consider that level of return as core. I do define our Marcellus that you laid out as core and we're just trying to again improve our efficiency and look at a project that would allow us to do what I've said in the past and that's be able to grow the asset and generate free cash. So you're going to be in a good return ZIP Code if you're able to accomplish that.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay, great, fair enough. And just a follow-up from me. Just wondering if I'm making the right read here, read between the lines with the share repurchase. There's really kind of a sign that your confidence in receiving the final permits in Atlantic Sunrise has really only increased over the last quarter and remains pretty high.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Well, it's two things. One, that we had available cash. It came out of the third quarter of 2016, fourth quarter of 2016. And then the first quarter of 2017, we saw how significantly the differentials narrowed. And we saw under a more normal condition what our project would generate in free cash with realizations in the range that we realized for the first half of this year. So a combination of again seeing good realizations that we hadn't seen in maybe three years come to fruition, but also to your point getting closer to the approval process and narrowing down on the commissioning of these infrastructures.","Both of those gave us the confidence to not only increase our dividend by 150% but also to do the share repurchases that we've made. And Scott's point was made about we have a reauthorization still of 7 million shares. And yes, we're going to be opportunistic, but we also feel very confident of our future generation of free cash. And that is instrumental in our decisions to move forward with the share repurchases.","Michael Dugan Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great, guys, appreciate it.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys. Just one last follow-up on the shareholder-friendly activities. With the high levels of expected free cash flow, if you don't deem the exploration program as a large use of capital, will the shareholder-friendly activities be all in the form of buybacks, a special dividend or yearly dividend increase? Trying to understand where the thought process is moving forward on that one?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Well, we have two of the three we've already implemented, and those two, one, increased dividend and, two, the buyback. Special dividends, you could look at special dividends, but what we like to see, we like to see every shareholder in our stock and we like to see every shareholder hold our stock for a period of time and enjoy the ride up. And by having a consistent dividend yield and increasing maybe dividend policy and also buybacks I think the higher priority focus is then trying to suggest that we would be issuing special dividends.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Fair enough. And then on the operational front, could you provide any additional color on the compressor downtime into 3Q, location or risks that it may extend into September? And then tangentially to that, any comments on either service cost inflation or availability within the Marcellus that you're seeing?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Okay. I'll let Jeff take care of the compressor comment first.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Sure, Paul. We got notified by DTE, who owns and operates Bluestone Pipeline, which cuts through the core of Susquehanna County in our area. We were making deliveries from a station there, and they had done an inspection on a compressor station that actually pumps gas in the Millennium Pipeline on the North end of their system. Long story short, they noticed some vibration, damage to the engines, and immediately shut it down, removed the engines, check out the foundation, and decided that in this particular case the best idea going forward was simply lease core new engines, rebuild the station as quickly as possible and get back online. The current in-service dates we're getting now are August 23, give or take a few days. And we think we'll be back in business around September 1.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","And do you have any follow-up on that?","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Oh I'm sorry.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","No, no, that's good amount. Just on the service costs and availability, any issues there?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","No, in the Marcellus right now it's basically been fairly flat, Paul, on the service cost side.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks, guys, I appreciate the time.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Karl Chalabala of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Karl J. Chalabala - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen. I just have one question. I was curious if you could \u2013 because Cove Point has been commissioned and looks to be taking some peak gas here. You guys obviously are a big supplier of that gas at Sumitomo. Are you going to be able to get physical down or through some other backhaul arrangement before Sunrise comes online and capture any margin there, or will that gas be coming from somewhere else?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Jeff can handle that one too.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes, Karl, thanks for the question. We talk about this quite a bit and preparing for a good little while now since we've known that Sunrise is going to be slightly delayed on what is the best path on getting Susquehanna County gas down to the Cove Point Pipeline. We currently own existing capacity to get some of that gas down to the Cove Point Pipeline. We're contracting with a few others that have paths leaving Susquehanna County to get additional volumes down to Cove Point. We have some other options with capacity holders that have valid paths, our gathering systems that run past the Cove Point Pipeline, so we're working out arrangements with them as we speak.","We're looking at this from a variety of angles. For example, we're still not entirely sure when Cove Point will be up and running. We're taking on the best case that they'll be up in January, which fits us rather nicely. And I don't think we'll have any problem contracting for various paths and cobble together enough transportation options to get our gas down to the pipeline.","Karl J. Chalabala - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for that, Jeff. And can you remind me, please, the agreement on price for that? Would that be a NYMEX Light deduct on the FT cost?","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes, so reaching way back to when we press released the deal, we let everyone know that it was a Henry Hub-based price that had other opportunities associated with it. Due to the confidentiality with Sumitomo, we've hesitated and not disclosed any particulars about the pricing.","Karl J. Chalabala - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it, okay. Thank you, gentlemen.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Karl.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bob Morris with Citi. Please go ahead.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. I think you called me earlier, Dan, I had to step away, so I apologize if you did call me earlier. But just looking at the Gen 4 completions, which you pointed out are outperforming the 4.4 Bcf per 1,000-foot type curve, I recall that in going to Gen 4 from Gen 3, it was a combination of enhanced cluster spacing, some higher sand loading, some tweaks to the pumping system there. But if you look at the economics of that and the higher cost to put in a higher sand in particular in the tighter cluster spacing, how much of an uplift are you seeing in the actual economics given that higher cost for what is now that higher type curve?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","As far as the 4.4 Bcf increase over the Gen 3 or even looking at now our current type curve, I'm going to do a SWAG here and I'll probably get slapped back, but I think it's about 10% to 15% is the uplift I think we're seeing.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then, I guess similarly in the Eagle Ford, I know you didn't put out the type curves because it's taken longer for the longer laterals to clean up, there you'd gone from 1,600 pounds per foot to 2,000 pounds per foot. Similarly, is that providing enhanced economics and you then go to even higher sand loadings, or what are you seeing as far as optimizing the sand loading into Eagle Ford?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","We've had a little bit of discussion, Bob, on additional loading, cluster spacing. Steve went over, and looking at our flow-back periods with the longer laterals, more water pump to carry extra load and more clusters, we're looking at the tweaks. And as Steve mentioned, if you have more water around near well bore, more loading you push back some of the volumes back until they work their way back to the well bore. Initially, certainly the rate it comes back does affect the rate of return, and so we're at early, early stage trying to evaluate just exactly what is going to be the best recipe to get the most return out of the project without compromising the EUR and cost.","So it's still early and it's work in progress and all the data gathering and database that we're building, trying to build our Big Data platform as others are. We are going to be looking at it and utilizing the data to make decisions in the future.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then just lastly real quick, back to the Gen 5 completion, is that strictly just reducing cost, or does Gen 5 in the Marcellus also entail some greater sand loading or even tighter cluster spacing?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","It's just different. And yes, we are trying to do a little bit of both. We're trying to see what cost can be taken out by different completion, and we're trying to make a determination, does it also affect initial rates and EURs on the completions. Too early time to speculate where we are with that.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great, thank you, Dan.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","And today's final question comes from Marshall Carver of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yes, I was just trying to connect the dots here. Your comments that you're looking for core rates of return with your exploration program similar to the Marcellus, that just seems like almost an impossibly high hurdle. If it doesn't compete, would you expect to sell it and therefore you probably would sell it because it's hard to find anything that could possibly compete, or am I thinking about that wrong? It just seems like 100% rates of return are a really, really tough bar to clear.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Marshall, I don't put the core definition as only what our return is in the Marcellus. There are some areas out there that I think have what I would define as core returns that might not be the returns of the Marcellus, but they're returns, if that was where you were strictly focused would allow for, even though less returns than the Marcellus, would still allow for growth and return of free cash, and that is somewhere in between, which I have not defined, between our Eagle Ford and our Marcellus.","So there is a swap in between there, obviously on the upper end, that says yes, these would be core projects, and you're right in your assessment. How you define a core and looking at the number of companies that are able to spend the money, drill the wells, complete them, put them in the pipeline, grow double digits, and generate free cash and give free cash back to shareholders, there's not many that fall in that definition, but that definition is I think somewhat below what our Marcellus return is, but it is a very, very high bar to get to, and that's what we're trying to do. We recognize that if you go, just like the comments we've made on the Eagle Ford. Some would say that why are you spending money in the Eagle Ford. Go spend it all on the Marcellus, because you're diluting your return profile. We get the map.","The difference is that that has not deterred from anything we've done in the Marcellus. We've been handicapped without infrastructure up there. We think we're getting close to that. We don't think anything we're doing in these two projects to try to determine can we find a really, really good another return project to get to some of our capital allocation. It will not impact one dollar that we plan to allocate to our Marcellus and our anticipation of filling all incrementally the infrastructure volumes that we're going to grow to in the Marcellus. But what we are \u2013 and to the point that maybe another question referred to, how do we balance giving back to shareholders as opposed to investing into an oil or gas well?","Well, we've decided to give some back to shareholders right now because we don't have a place that is going to allow us to meet our benchmark of growing and generating free cash after you do the full cycle return profile of our projects. And if we get to the point that we would hope to get and I might add that in our initial economics that we run to make the first decisions to spend capital to look for those type of ideas. we certainly have economics and a development plan in scope, though speculative, that would do what I'm talking about, and that is invest, have a development program, get to the point of growth where free cash, the program is supporting on its own cash generation and also generating free cash for other optionality. And as we have suggested and as we have done, that is to give back to shareholders.","Marshall Hampton Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final remarks.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Okay. Thank you, Rocco. I think with the questions that have been asked and the answers provided, you can see that we remain focused on returns. We are going to continue to focus on returns. And with the right projects where we allocate capital, we think we're going to be able to achieve exactly what we've been able to achieve in the second quarter. Thanks for your interest, and I look forward to discussion again on the third quarter call. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thank you, Drew, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are the members of the Cabot's executive team that are usually here.","Before we get started, I'd like to highlight that on this call we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may refer to non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements, and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.","For third quarter, Cabot demonstrated its continued focus on disciplined capital allocation by generating positive free cash flow for the sixth consecutive quarter, while delivering 12% equivalent production growth. Operating cash flow increased by 79% year-over-year, driven by our production growth, coupled with a 60% increase in cash margins. While natural gas price realizations increased 16% year-over-year, it should come as no surprise that the third quarter realizations were weaker sequentially due to lower NYMEX price and wider differentials. The widening of differentials in the third quarter has been seen in Appalachia over the last few years and highlights the need for the long-anticipated in-service of new long-haul infrastructure and in-basin demand projects. Our expectation is that our price realizations will only improve moving forward, giving the in-service of numerous infrastructure projects over the next few quarters.","Year-to-date, we have generated approximately $125 million of free cash flow and received over $30 million of proceeds from non-core asset sales, which have allowed us to return almost $125 million of capital to shareholders year-to-date via dividends and share repurchases, and to reduce our net debt position, further improving our strong balance sheet.","As it relates to share repurchases, while we did not buy back shares during the third quarter, I would highlight that we remain optimistic on this front and take advantage of disconnects in the market like the recent 9% selloff we experienced during our recent trading blackout period, which did begin after the end of the third quarter.","In this morning's release, we reaffirmed our capital guidance and tightened our production guidance range for the year, while leaving the midpoint unchanged. Where we ended up in the production \u2013 where we end up in the production guidance range will ultimately be dependent on in-basin pricing during the fourth quarter, as Cabot has recently been electing curtail a small portion of its production when pricing is value destructive. As we have reiterated many times before, while production is a byproduct of our capital allocation to high-return projects, we are not chasing top-line production growth for the sake of it and have absolutely no problem holding back volumes if the prices do not warrant moving additional gas at certain times. However, I'm not overly concerned about the recent price dynamics, given that over the last few years, we have seen some of the widest differentials during the month of October, which has subsequently been followed by a significant improvement in basis.","As most of you are aware, Atlantic Sunrise received its final Notice to Proceed during the quarter, with pipeline and compression station construction beginning in September. This is a milestone we've been waiting for since our first announcement and our involvement in the project back in February 2014 and represents a key inflection point for the northeast Pennsylvania natural gas market and for Cabot. We continue to target a mid-2018 in-service for this project, on which we will be selling approximately 1 Bcf of gas to new markets.","Tennessee Gas Pipeline recently reaffirmed that its Orion Project is ahead of schedule and is anticipated to be in-service as early as December 2017. Additionally, the two power plant projects that we are sole suppliers to, Moxie Freedom and Lackawanna Energy Center, are currently under construction and on schedule for their early September \u2013 excuse me, summer 2018 in-service.","As it relates to Constitution Pipeline, the partners of this project recently submitted a petition for a declaratory order with the FERC, demonstrating that the New York DEC exceeded its statutory timeframe to grant or deny the Section 401 certification for the project. The Clean Water Act specifies that if a state agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification under Section 401 within a reasonable period of time, the certification requirement shall be waived. It is our belief that the New York DEC clearly failed to act on Constitution's application for a Section 401 Water Quality Certification within a reasonable period of time. If the FERC grants Constitution's petition, Constitution will promptly seek a Clean Water Act Section 404 Permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. We continue to believe this is a project that New York needs to achieve its energy goal, which will require a mix of resources, including natural gas, in order to keep rates low and supply reliable for power generation for the state.","In line with state energy goals, Constitution will lower emissions by enabling customers switch from heating oil to cleaner burning natural gas. In line with our conservative forecast, we currently exclude the benefit of our capacity on Constitution from our five-year plan; however, I certainly would not count this project out.","In this morning's release, we initiated our official 2018 daily production growth guidance with a range at 15% to 20%, which implies a 17% to 22% pro forma for West Virginia divestiture. This production growth is based on capital budget range of $1.025 billion to $1.150 billion, consisting of $750 million to $850 million in the Marcellus, $125 million to $150 million in the Eagle Ford, $75 million in our exploration play, and $75 million for pipeline investments in the Atlantic Sunrise and other corporate capital expenditures. We plan to operate three rigs and utilize two completion crews in the Marcellus Shale during 2018.","Our pace of completion activity will ultimately dictate where we land within the Marcellus capital range and will be dependent upon market conditions during the year. While we could certainly grow faster than our current guidance, our focus is on maximizing margins, returns and free cash flow, and we firmly believe the flexibility in this current plan allows us to make the most prudent capital allocation decisions throughout the year in response to market dynamics.","Capital range for the Marcellus in 2018 will position Cabot for Marcellus production growth of 27% to 33% in 2019. Based on current market indications for natural gas prices, we expect our natural gas price realizations to average $0.45 to $0.50 below NYMEX for the full year of 2018, a significant improvement over 2017 levels. In the Eagle Ford, we plan to operate one rig for the full year and utilize one completion crew for a portion of the year. Our plan allows for us to maintain all core acreage, provide for single-digit growth in oil production, and generate positive free cash flow at the current strip.","Our capital range for the Eagle Ford will depend on our outlook for oil price with a focus on generating free cash flow from this asset as opposed of growth for the sake of growth. We plan to spend $75 million during the first half of 2018 continuing to test our two new exploratory areas to better understand if they have the attributes we are looking for in order to compete for our capital internally. We would like to be in a position by mid-2018 or sooner to make a decision on whether we move forward with continued activity on these areas, based on our results from the first half of the year.","As we have stated before, if we do ultimately have success in these areas, we will look to divest assets, to fund any near-term deficit spends in these areas that would need to occur before the assets become self-funding and free cash flow positive, similar to what we did in the Marcellus years ago. And for example, on the cash flow raise, while fairly small in nature, we are currently marketing our remaining Haynesville properties as we continue to high-grade our portfolio.","Based on current strip prices, our 2018 program would deliver the following highlights: double-digit corporate-wide returns, positive free cash flow of over $200 million at midpoint of the capital budget range, a deleveraging of the balance sheet to below 1 times debt to EBITDAX, production growth of 15% to 20%, and positions the company for significant growth in free cash flow and production in 2019 and 2020, as we highlighted in the three-year Marcellus outlook we included in this morning's release.","Further on our three-year outlook, the Marcellus is expected to deliver a three-year Marcellus production CAGR of 20-plus percent and a three-year Marcellus discretionary cash flow CAGR of 25-plus percent, assuming current strip prices. Based on this plan, Cabot's Marcellus asset would generate approximately $2.5 billion of cumulative pre-tax free cash flow from 2018 to 2020, while averaging between $750 million to $850 million of annual Marcellus capital expenditures over this period.","This program only assumes we have the benefit of the infrastructure that is currently under construction, including the Atlantic Sunrise and the other two power plant projects that we have mentioned. Obviously, any incremental capacity on long-term sales could provide additional upside.","Given its level of free cash flow generation, we expect our debt adjusted per share growth metric to look even better than our absolute growth numbers. I would also highlight that based on our internal estimates as well as consensus estimates for 2019, this plan would generate a best-in-class free cash flow yield compared to the rest of the E&P companies in the S&P 500. While it's premature at this point to outline a specific plan for allocation of free cash flow, we fully expect to return an increasing amount of capital to shareholders via dividend growth and share repurchases as well as evaluate the potential reduction of debt as near-term maturities come due.","Our longer-term capital allocation to assets outside of the Marcellus will ultimately be dependent on our outlook for oil prices and the outcome of our ongoing exploration testing. However, as I mentioned earlier, we are focused on delivering a self-funded program in the Eagle Ford and funding any initial deficit spends in our exploration areas with asset sales.","In summary, we have a three-year plan that provides double-digit returns-focused per share growth, while generating significant free cash flow at the current strip, and delivers double-digit corporate-wide returns that stand out not only among energy companies, but also across the broad market, which certainly makes Cabot an attractive investment, regardless of anybody's view on the energy space.","Drew, with that, I'll be happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Bob Morris of Citi. Please go ahead.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you, and nice quarter, Dan. My first question is...","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","...when you talk about the curtailments on an uneconomic basis, what net-back price becomes uneconomic? Is it $2.50, $2, or how do you think about that and how much could you curtail, that everything then is getting that price?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Well, we have an economic price that covers our cost of capital close to a $1. But we have seen, in some of the gas we move in the daily market, which is not a large percentage of our gas, but we move gas in the daily market, and that's some of the gas that we remove. And we saw gas that was below $1 on the realizations over several weekends and periods of time that were low-demand periods, and that is the gas volumes that we'd like to not move.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's good. And my second question, $2.5 billion is a lot of free cash flow. You've got options between, you can buy back up to 20% of your stock, you can pay a meaningful or S&P type dividend on the shares. How do you think about those two options in reallocating or returning that capital to the shareholder? And obviously, the share buybacks depend on the stock price, but at close to current levels, how do you think about the options between share buybacks and dividend increase?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Well, we recently, as you're aware, increased our dividend 150%. We also bought back a nice tranche of shares in the second quarter. We do have an authorization still on the shelf to buy back shares. When you compare those two, we will, I think, look at both of them as an avenue to give back money to shareholders.","On the dividend, we are moving towards a much more certainty attached to our free cash flow generation, now that we have the approval of infrastructure going in the ground. With that infrastructure in the ground and gas moving through additional outlets and also seeing the basis compress in the \u2013 and on the three pipes that we currently sell into, we're going to have a significant level of confidence of an ongoing continuous improvement in the realizations. And with that, that gives us a little bit more confidence on just the dividend side of our give-back.","In the meantime, however, though, we have had, as you are aware, $0.5 billion or so of cash on our balance sheet, and we have continued to rationalize our portfolio and we looked at the buybacks with some of that cash. So, to say it a little bit more succinctly, once we get the infrastructure in place, we know we're going to be generating a significant level of free cash. And with that, we'll then make decisions between the share buybacks and the dividends and look at that as prudently as we can.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right. Either way, it's an enviable position to be in. Congratulations. Thanks.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Glick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Not to beat a...","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hi, Michael.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...dead horse here, but just have one question really on the stock buyback. I mean, on our model, which appears to be in the right ZIP code, based on the outlook you provided, you're trading at a 7%, or actually probably 6% free cash flow yield after today's recent move. I mean, there seem few similar opportunities when we think about the broader non-E&P, of course, market. Just in that context, how do you think about buybacks?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Well \u2013 and I'd like to hear your comment also, Michael. We look at that as a unique position for an E&P company. Free cash flow yield of not only that, but we think we can increase that free cash flow yield. If you compare that free cash flow yield to other industries out there and you look at our multiples, I would like to see what the Street thinks the value is of an E&P company that does deliver that type of yield. And if we get the reaction from the Street and they value that free cash flow yield in a way that we think merits the valuation per share of Cabot stock, then buying back shares is not going to be as big of interest to us because we're going to see it in stock price appreciation. But to date, even though we think that is very visible on that yield and improving as we go forward, I haven't seen the comparison of the Street giving us the credit in our current share price.","Michael A. Glick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Gotcha. Thank you for those comments.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","The next question comes from David Deckelbaum of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Morning, Dan and everyone.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hey, David.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","You bet.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just looking at the program as a great multiyear outlook, it looks like approximately that you'll be filling the capacity so far that you've identified by about the fourth quarter of 2019. One, am I thinking about that correctly? And then two, I guess, as we think about filling visible capacity right now, you talked about being opportunistic. Do you view the communication today around the free cash at sort of $1 billion cumulative through the next three years as kind of the floor that you'd like to deliver to the market? And how do you square that with \u2013 once you start filling capacity and you witness potential improvements in local basis, how do you sort of blend the desire to deliver that free cash while also weighing potentially accelerating beyond the plan you laid out now?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","I'll just make a comment, then I'll turn it over to Scott, let him make a comment, also. But on the capacity side, we are entirely comfortable with the production growth that we've indicated. It is our plan, as we discussed in the past, David, to certainly fill the new infrastructure with some of the existing gas that we're producing today and also have incremental volumes that go into filling the Atlantic Sunrise and those two power plants. We do expect the uplift that you've referenced in the differential on the existing pipes.","However, if in fact the area rationalization by other operators out there would move into the space and try to backfill where Cabot has moved gas off of those three pipes and on to new \u2013 into new markets, if there's backfilling and rationalization by the \u2013 or the lack of rationalization by other operators out there, then Cabot is not going to give up a great deal of its market share. We will be there and us being the lowest-cost producer up there, we will certainly protect our market share.","I'll turn comment over to Scott also.","Scott C. Schroeder - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","David, the thing I would add is on your first comment. As we laid out in the text and in the press release, we have kind of a dual track going on for the Marcellus program, based on market conditions. You are factually correct in one of those scenarios that we could fill that new capacity by the end of the decade, end of December kind of 2019. The other bookend on that is kind of the end of December 2020. That's kind of the bookend timeframe that we're looking at in this plan that we laid out with the cash flow and things like that.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Scott. And then I guess, looking at the program right now, you have Eagle Ford volume growing with a pretty minimal amount of capital. It sounds like you've seen some improvements there on the operational side, maybe on the completion side as well. How do you view that asset now as a source of funds versus a development opportunity? And I guess, thinking about the life cycle of that asset, are we closer to perhaps pruning that now and looking at it as a source of funds or is that something that's years away?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Well, we've always looked at the Eagle Ford as a good alternative to allocating some of our capital. And we continue to improve our efficiencies and our completion results out there in the field. When you look at, though, the impact of the Eagle Ford on Cabot, as far as it being a use of proceeds, we don't look at that as a large use of proceeds with our plan of allocating the capital to the Marcellus, also with our plan of giving money back to the shareholder, and we do anticipate that with success in our two exploratory areas, that the Eagle Ford is \u2013 that fits into our capital allocation today. But if it does not rank within our hierarchy of where we like to allocate capital in the future, then the Eagle Ford, as we have said in the past, is an asset that we would look at to help fund our new ventures.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for color, Dan, Scott, and everyone. Appreciate it.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, David.","Operator","The next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Good morning, Dan, to you and your whole team there.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hey, Charles. How are you?","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","I'm doing well, thank you. I wanted to shift gears, perhaps, to the short-term and just touch on that. I know you spoke earlier about what's going on with local basis and about how it's not uncommon in 3Q, and we certainly see that with historical results that 3Q as the widest basis, but can you talk a bit about what dynamics you're seeing this year that may be different from years past? And do that with an eye of what we should expect for November and December?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Okay. I'll just make a brief comment and turn over to Jeff to comment on the market. What we've seen has been fairly consistent with what we've seen. Certainly, the timing of the disconnect, and we roll into this period of time, and what we've seen in the past certainly affects, Jeff, mitigation of some of the impact by us selling volumes through October on the summer months. So, Jeff, would you like to fill in some of the blanks?","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah. Charles, there's a lot of similarities between this summer and last summer in terms of mild summers and low demand, storage being at pretty much the same levels, and a lot of gas on the market. I think one unique characteristic this year is probably more pipeline maintenance than we've seen in years past, or at least it seems to me they've been lasting longer and going later into the year. So, that's probably the only unique thing. If you look back this time last year or quarter-over-quarter, really there's only been about $0.06 difference in basis differential between the two quarters. So, that's pretty consistent.","I'd say, on the cash side, where we've seen some very low prices in October as we get to the end of the injection season, we've actually had a pretty good year in cash market year-over-year. Year-to-date, I think cash is averaging about $2. This time last year, the same term, I think cash was around $1.45 for the year. So, we've seen some improvements. And a lot of that came from last winter, of course, but there's really not a lot of factors fundamental-wise that have changed.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you, Jeff. And then just one quick follow-up, if I could, Dan. The Haynesville package that you mentioned, can you give us an idea of the scale of that, whether in maybe proceeds you're looking for or acreage, current production, that sort of thing?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Well, we have less than 10,000 acres out there. We have HBP most of the properties \u2013 well, all of it's HBP. We have a minimal, since we haven't allocated capital out there for an extended period of time, we have about $3 million a day is all we'd be taking off from us. So, just one of those areas that, similar to West Virginia, we like portions of the asset and the West Virginia low-decline asset was nice to have, but it wasn't that impactful to us. And the same with this set of assets that we're not allocating capital to it. There has been some really good improvements made on completions out in the Haynesville, but as far as our footprint out there and what it would mean to Cabot in our program is not that impactful. So, we think that would be an asset that would be in the hands of those that might be out there and so we're prepared to transact and we'll see what we get.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC","Thanks for the detail, Dan.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Charles.","Operator","The next question comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hello, Drew.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, Dan. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the exploration plays, and if you have success there, how you think about that in terms of funding. You said, in your prepared remarks, that they would be absent (30:35) any cash flow at the asset level, but how do you think about at the corporate level? Would you still be generating free cash flow? Or any more color you can provide on how you guys would progress with that program would be helpful.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah. On the free cash flow, we do expect to generate \u2013 with the funding of our exploration effort, we do expect to generate free cash flow at the corporate level. When you look at our effort out there right now, we do have a drilling rig active on one of the areas, and we'll be moving to having a drilling rig on the other area. Characteristic of what we've done in the past on exploration plays, we're not going to comment on results at this point in time. Information that we have seen, we're encouraged to continue to move forward with collecting data and evaluating the area. And we have our fingers crossed and we're cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to demonstrate that the areas that we are focused in will compete for incremental capital. And we do fully intend to fund it and still, at the corporate level, be able to generate free cash flow.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for that, Dan. And can you just remind us how much of the acreage in your exploration areas is held and how much activity you think you would need to run if you wanted to hold on an acreage?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah, we have $75 million allocated for the exploration area in 2018. We have just a portion of our 2017 budget remaining that we had allocated and announced previously at the beginning of this year. That portion that we had identified at the beginning of this year was $125 million. We've spent the majority of that $125 million. We do expect to stay within that budget between now and year-end. And as I said, in 2018, we have $75 million that we've allocated to the two areas. We have a significant amount of acreage that we think would be impactful on Cabot if we have success.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Is any of that held at this point, Dan?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Is it held?","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, is any of it held?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Under lease terms.","Drew E. Venker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Dan.","Operator","The next question comes from Holly Stewart of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Good morning, gentlemen.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hello, Holly.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Dan, you touched on both your thoughts on the Eagle Ford and then kind of the Haynesville. I'm curious if you could remind us of your ownership percentage in Atlantic Sunrise and maybe thoughts around what to do with that asset since we have shovels in the ground at this point.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes, I'll let Jeff cover that infrastructure.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah. So, Holly, Atlantic Sunrise is the name of the project, okay? It's actually an extension of Transco's Pipeline System. So, from a project perspective, in other words, for the new greenfield pipeline, our equity investment there is approximately $150 million.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. And Jeff, any comments on keeping that in the portfolio?","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah, absolutely. Right now, we're keeping the equity investment in the project, but that's always a discussion item here at Cabot.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Holly, one of the things that we \u2013 the decision we made in having an equity piece to start out with as we wanted to be involved and be able to have a good understanding and seat at the table as we go through the permitting process, regulatory process, and a full understanding of any implications we have with delays, how we might be able to navigate the heightened enthusiasm by the activists to stop infrastructure. We just wanted to understand that process a little bit better, and so, that was the reason we're in the investment.","It obviously is an offset to our investment with our ability to secure some of the transportation charge back to us as an equity owner. But as far as it being a holding that we feel like that we need to have forever, we're not compelled for that. It goes back to our decision about use of proceeds and what we might do at any particular time with those proceeds if we wanted to monetize.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Sure. I'm sure it'd be an asset there'd be a lot of pipeline companies would like to have.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yes, I agree.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","And then maybe just one for Scott, with the, call it, $0.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, you got the maturity coming up in 2018. Any thoughts on how to proceed with that?","Scott C. Schroeder - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Right now, Holly, we're looking at all options. Obviously, we could refinance it. We do believe we're real close to being kind of BBB, BBB-plus in the marketplace. We're not rated at this point in time, so we're internally having that discussion. But keep in mind, with the $500 million, the maturity is $300 million, we can always simply just pay it off because we have a completely undrawn $1.8 billion revolver. So, it doesn't hurt any of our efforts either way we go.","Holly Barrett Stewart - Scotia Howard Weil","Yeah. Great. Thanks, guys.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Holly.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hello, Jeffrey.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","We've had a lot of big picture questions. So, I'm going to ask a couple of more narrow ones. In the last quarter press release, you guys said that the fourth gen well completions were exceeding 4.4 Bcf for 1,000-foot lateral. In this press release, you said that the additional wells are supporting 4.4 Bcf of 1,000-feet lateral. Sounds a little bit more equivocal. I just wondered if I'm parsing the language too finely.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","No, when we look at our production curves and we look at the modeling and the curve fits, Jeffrey, we like to see a longer term on the curve fits. And all we're saying with our statement is that everything we're seeing right now is consistent with our expectations. And if we do have improvements over and above that 4.4 Bcf fit \u2013 curve fit, we'll do what we've done in the past, and that is recognize that after we have more data and \u2013 in a longer term on the wells to be able to continue to support that. There was also a reference in one of the write-ups about our Gen 4 and Gen 5 and I'll take this time, if I could, Jeffrey, to just reference that. Our Gen 5 that we're trying to tweak out there is we have full expectations that we will equal and maybe, hopefully, exceed our production of 4.4 Bs per 1,000 foot of lateral with our Gen 5. And our comment was designed to indicate that we think we can maybe achieve that by our tweaking of the completion technique, but also maybe save a little bit of capital by how we're tweaking the completion technique without a compromise, whatsoever, to the production expectation that we have for Gen 5.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Now, well, you just proved that amongst your many other talents that you're psychic, because that was exactly the next question I was going to ask was what was color on that. So, basically, what you're saying, just if I can paraphrase it, is that the fifth gen stuff that you're working on now should not show any degradation in production, but you're hoping to be able to cut some costs and, therefore, improve the returns?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Exactly right.","Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you. I appreciate the color.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thank you, Jeffrey.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Hello, Brian.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","To follow up on the topic of the fifth generation wells, can you add a little bit more color on what you're doing on the completion tweaks to lower the costs? And then on a more bigger picture basis on the comment that fifth generation is more \u2013 or at least so far is more about cost reduction in terms of the drivers of efficiency gains than necessarily greater EURs per 1,000 feet, do you think we're in the later innings of productivity gains in terms of well productivity in Marcellus?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah. Good questions. On the last (40:34) comment, we've been asked that probably, so starting three or four years ago, and we continue to make \u2013 we, as an industry, continue to make strides to deliver improved results from our completion. So, we're going to continue to be able to try to improve our completions, and \u2013 excuse me, and in that regard, we in fact have a couple of beta tests going on right now for our Gen 6 completions. So, stand by on the results of that.","When you look at the difference between Gen 4 and Gen 5, one of the changes we made is that Gen 4 has got tighter on the stage spacing. In Gen 5, we went wider \u2013 back wider again on the stage spacing, but we had improved or increased the clusters in the Gen 5 from the 4. Additionally, the fluid pumped in the Gen 4 is a little bit less than the fluid pumped in the Gen 5 to move the volumes that we are moving in the Gen 5.","We are staying consistent with the amount of proppant per foot, but by widening the distance between stages, we are reducing the number of stages that we will have to pump and the drill-out time that we'll have on getting the well ready for completion. So, that's some of the tweaks \u2013 without the details, that's some of the tweaks that we have between Gen 4 and Gen 5.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then to follow up, back to the free cash flow you're planning for the next three years, can you talk a little bit about the range and risk around cash taxes? I think that $2.5 billion was a pre-tax number. And then, what your expectations are for the transportation \u2013 unit transportation costs and what we should expect to see when Atlantic Sunrise comes on?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Okay, and I'll turn it over to Scott first, Brian.","Scott C. Schroeder - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Brian, I'll handle the cash taxes and Jeff will handle the transportation. But cash taxes in our guidance for 2018 we're looking at about a 15% cash tax burden, deferring 85%. That goes to 35% cash taxes, 65% deferred in 2019; and roughly 50%-50% in 2020. If you take that, based on that number, you're looking at about $400 million \u2013 $400 million to $500 million in actual cash taxes in our plan, based on our assumptions. So, $2.5 billion would still have close to a $2 billion handle on it, taking \u2013 you still have some corporate G&A and some financing, of course, to factor into that because we don't allocate that out, but you still have a very robust three-year free cash flow model.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. On the transportation side?","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah, Brian, on the transportation, as we've talked about this in the past, the capacity we're taking on with Atlantic Sunrise will be released to our customers, and with that we'll see a revenue reduction instead of an expense increase. So, we're basically maintaining a flat transportation cost profile through this period.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Yeah. Thanks. I just want to follow on a little bit on the free cash flow. At the corporate level, kind of trying to make sure we're calibrating right. What would you say the drag is on free cash flow for other items outside of exploration at the corporate level for things like overhead? And you already hit on taxes \u2013 trying to zero in.","Scott C. Schroeder - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Michael, the easiest way is just look at the guidance for G&A and financing costs.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","And you've held those flat throughout the quarter?","Scott C. Schroeder - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Held those flat, because we are not people-heavy in this organization.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Sure. Okay. And then when do you think you might be willing to announce some sort of more formalized plan around what the path towards redistributing more of the cash to shareholders would be? Is that something by midyear next year you think you could be willing to do, or what's the thought process on that currently?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah, I think that would be a reasonable expectation, Michael, that as we get some clarity on a couple of our new initiatives that we have moving forward and then get our arms around how we would allocate cash to those areas. And also, if in fact we have a monetization in the mix, we would also have clarity on value created from that. So, I would think that would be a reasonable expectation.","Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC","Okay. Perfect. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Congrats.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Grigel of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Good morning. You noted in today's release the double-digit corporate returns into 2018, and you've noted in recent presentations the increased focus on ROCE as a metric for using or for evaluating the business. Is there thoughts on making that more of an explicit goal for management, given the rather unique position you are in relative to peers?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Well, I'll let Scott answer that in a second. Just for a specific goal for management, we have always had financial goals as part of management's effort to achieve. And I think you can see by the results and the decision we make on how we allocate capital, how we handle our growth profile versus value creation and getting margins and returns as being our primary focus versus growth, Paul, we've always had return on capital employed as our metric that management looks at. I'll let Scott make a comment.","Scott C. Schroeder - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah. So, the short answer is yes. It is becoming a \u2013 as Dan said, it has been a focus. We have not worn it on our sleeves. As we've watched this industry and been around this industry, Dan's been through six cycles, I've been through five, as have many in this table, we've watched this. Obviously, the returns focus is gaining more momentum now, as it should, and we fully embrace that. The key thing now in terms of we know how we calculate it internally, we just don't want to \u2013 we want to make sure there's no unintended consequences if you roll out specifics. Because, as you know, we are \u2013 this industry is a master of kind of single-well economics and kind of cherry-picking, and that's not Cabot's culture, that's not Cabot's philosophy.","So, while it is very in the forefront and was even a topic of conversation this past \u2013 earlier this week in our boardroom and will continue to be, as it has been in the past, it is trying to thread that needle on how best to communicate it.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Perfect. Understand on that. And then, I guess, as a follow-up, given the plan you guys have laid out, what are the latest thoughts \u2013 and, Scott, it's probably for you \u2013 on using hedges, either basis or versus NYMEX moving forward into 2018 and beyond?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","I'll make a comment, then I'll let Scott or Jeff weigh in. Paul, we like hedges as part of mitigation and add a level of consistency to our program. When we've had the lack of infrastructure in the basin, it has made it difficult to get any length to hedges because it's been so punitive \u2013 again, by the lack of transparency on infrastructure, it's been very punitive for us to be able to layer on hedges without upfront conceding to a very large differential. So, with that, it would be our expectation that with infrastructure, and now more clarity and a balancing of the market and not so much heavy-weighted gas-on-gas competition in the three pipes that we currently produce into, we would expect that market to become more available to us in a range that we would find acceptable.","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Yeah, Paul, and I'll just add a couple thoughts. One of the things that Atlantic Sunrise does for us is move our gas from a supply area to a market area. And the market area we're hitting with this gas is more stable, less volatile, also of course more hedgeable. So, you may see us step into the hedge market when opportunity allows us to take care of some of the volumes that are moving out of the supply area, as we get the projects done.","Paul Grigel - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. That's good color. Thanks so much.","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","The next question comes from Biju Perincheril of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks. Good morning. Dan, I was wondering on the Gen 5 completions in the Marcellus if you could give us an idea of the magnitude of savings you are targeting, and also if there's something \u2013 the approach you're taking here is something that's transferable to the Eagle Ford?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","We are, of course, gathering as we continue to get more completions with the Gen 5. We're hoping to get around and we have seen plus or minus 10% on the saving side with the Gen 5. And I think that would be a reasonable expectation, going forward. And what we do in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus \u2013 I have both guys at the table with me, Phil Stalnaker and Steve Lindeman, that are responsible for the operations in our two respective areas and they've been working with each other for, I don't know, 50 years, I think. But they communicate well on what their teams are doing to enhance efficiency. So, we do have cross polinization and data transfer to each group.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. I mean, I'm sure you guys are having those conversations on how to apply this. I was wondering from those conversations, do you think Eagle Ford, from a geologic perspective, this could be a transferable technology?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","Well, we have our own \u2013 it's hard to answer that, specifically. If you're asking that is the exact changes and exact spacing going from a Gen 4 in the Marcellus to a Gen 5 in the Marcellus, is that going to transfer to the Eagle Ford? And is the fluid pumped in a Gen 4 Marcellus to a Gen 5 Marcellus, is that the exact fluid that we pump going to transfer to the Eagle Ford? The answer to that is no. But the concept of being able to save money with the spacing changes in the Marcellus and the transfer of fluid pumped and the more clusters per stage by having a little wider spacing, we do take all of that in consideration in the tweaking that's going on in the Eagle Ford.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. That's helpful. And just to confirm the potential savings from Gen 5, none of those numbers are incorporated into the 2018, 2019 guidance you've provided, right?","Dan O. Dinges - Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.","We wanted to \u2013 we want to get the \u2013 we want to see the results before we do a lot of that incorporation.","Biju Perincheril - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges. Please go ahead.","Dan O. Dinges","Thank you, Emily. I appreciate everybody joining us this morning for this second quarter conference call. With me today is Scott Schroeder; Jeff Hutton, our VP of Marketing; Steve Lindeman, our VP of Engineering and Technology; Matt Reid, handles our South Region; and Todd Liebl, VP of Land and Business Development.","Before I start, as usual, the boilerplate standard language that we have is forward-looking statements included in the press release do apply to my comments today. Excuse me. At this time, we have many things to cover, and I'm going to expand on the press releases that were issued last night. I'll briefly cover the financials in the second quarter. We'll update the '12 guidance, including a capital discussion, as well as a preliminary review of our 2013 plan, and the recent successes that we had with drill bit, and I'll follow that with a discussion of our operations.","Before I go into the details on these topics, I'd like to start with just a brief list of the highlights that we've seen in this last quarter. Cabot grew production 40% over the comparable quarter of last year, including 37% growth in natural gas and a 96% growth in liquids. Second quarter production was up 5% quarter-over-quarter, and this is even after the impact of unscheduled maintenance and the delays we've talked about as attached to our Marcellus gathering lines. We have brought online a 2-well pad that together the wells have produced 2 Bcf in 39 days, and they are still producing right at 59, 60 million cubic foot a day. The initial down space test in our Buckhorn area in the Eagle Ford and the zipper fracs, which were the first we'd tried out there, have proven to be successful. Along with our down space initiatives in the Marcellus. Also, the cash proceeds and the increase in capital, the cash proceeds from our JV fully fund drilling in 2 new plays, the Purcell and the Utica. And we have only very minimal production forecasts due to the nature of these 2 areas. We've also had acreage acquisition in several new areas. All of this is going to enhance the 2013 production growth expectations.","Now let me roll into the financial results. The company reported clean earnings of approximately $10 million or $0.05 per share. That was driven by our significant production increases that more than offset weaker natural gas prices. Cash flow from operations and discretionary cash flow for the second quarter were $159 million and $142 million, respectively. The Marcellus continues to be the driving force behind our production growth, while the Eagle Ford and Marmaton continue to add significant liquids production to our profile as illustrated by our 96% increase. When you adjust for the 2.8 Bcf of production from the second quarter of 2011 that was associated with last year's Rocky Mountain sale, our equivalent production growth for the quarter was 49% greater than last year's second quarter. Guidance, we continue to reaffirm our equivalent production growth for 2012, 35% to 50%, and liquids production growth of 55% to 65%. We updated the full year cost guidance by decreasing DD&A and taxes other than income on a per share per unit basis to reflect our updated views for the remainder of the year. We also provided third quarter guidance for absolute G&A and exploration expenses. In the second quarter, G&A increased primarily due to a higher pension expense as a result of the termination of our qualified pension plan that was completed in the second quarter of 2012, additionally, which was not normalized and included in the second quarter G&A figure are an assessment from the Office of Natural Resources Revenue for certain matters in the Rocky Mountains, which we are currently disputing, and was also increased in legal fees associated with preparation for the Fiorentino lawsuit in PA. However, in regard to that case, Cabot has reached verbal settlement agreement with 32 out of 36 households. Negotiations will continue with the remaining households. The aggregate value of the settlements are not a material item with respect to Cabot's financial statements. Resolution of this litigation will have a very positive impact on G&A going forward due to the reduction in cost of defense. The combination of these items had a $0.03 per share impact to the quarter. Exploration expenses also increased during the quarter due to the expensing of our initial Brown Dense exploratory well in Arkansas.","Now let's move to some of the discussion on our 2012 plans as a result of the recent joint venture with Osaka. And we're very pleased to have Osaka as a partner in our Purcell area. We have restructured our operational plans for the remainder of 2012. We plan to keep 4 rigs running in the Marcellus for the remainder of the year instead of dropping down to 3 rigs. We also plan to run 2 rigs in the Purcell associated with the Osaka joint venture, 2 rigs in the Marmaton due to the improved results that we have seen out there, and 1 rig in the Eagle Ford for a total of 9 operated rigs company-wide by year end. Plus, we will have some other non-operated efforts, for example, in the Utica and Marmaton. The additional drilling activity will primarily be funded through the upfront cash proceeds and future drilling carry from the JV. At the same time, our lease acquisition efforts have doubled from $45 million to $90 million in acquisitions of acreage in existing areas, filling in some holes and new plays. In a couple of new areas, we have accumulated over 25,000 acres in each of a couple of areas. All of these operational changes will have limited impact on 2012 production, but will certainly enhance our production expectations for 2013.","In 2013, this a little bit early for us to put some numbers out there, but we thought we would with the additional capital that we have placed in front of you that would affect our '13 plans. We expect to grow production by minimum of 30% to 50%, with a capital program between $900 million and $1 billion. The planned program will again target being cash flow neutral at today's strip pricing. Clearly, these are wide parameters. We'll try to refine these numbers as we approach next year.","We've had some questions in regard to hedging. The company added 17 new hedges since our first quarter call in April, of which 16 are related to 2013. The company has 32 contracts for 2012 production, excluding the 5 basis [ph] only hedges. 27 are for gas at $5.22, 4 oil contracts at $99.30 and an additional contract at $105 -- $105. Approximately 40%, the midpoint of our production guidance for 2012, is currently hedged. We also have, now, 23 contracts for our 2013, 20 for gas which are collars, and 3 swaps for oil. We continue to monitor the natural gas market due to the recent strength to consider additional hedging. You can find our hedging on our website.","Now let's move into the operations in the North region. We continue to have outstanding results in the Marcellus and Susquehanna County. Since the end of the first quarter, we have brought on line 5 wells with IPs exceeding 20 million per day. At the top of the list is a 2-well pad that has been on line only 39 days. We got very few days in the second quarter. But they've been on line for 39 days and has produced over 2 Bcf and is currently producing, as I mentioned, between 59 and 60 million cubic foot per day. Also, we have continued to collect data on our 500-foot spaced lateral initiative that we're using to determine optimal spacing out in the Marcellus. If you recall, we completed 2 500-foot laterally spaced wells located between 2 existing wells that had cumulatively produced 10 Bcf already. The Upper Marcellus infill well IP-ed for 8 million cubic foot per day and the Lower Marcellus infill well IP-ed for 16 million cubic foot per day. Both wells production was constrained slightly, and both wells were completed with 15-stage fracs. The result of these wells are exceeding our expected EURs based on the early production data, and our expected EURs were the 7.5 Bcf and 11 Bcf, respectively. Also last quarter, we announced a 5-well pad that was a 7-mile step-out to the east from any previous production. These wells continue to perform very well and equally as good as the central portion of our acreage. The 5-well pad has produced over 6.5 Bs in about 3.5 months and is producing over 55 million cubic foot per day at this time. Additionally, we have flow tested 2 wells at 2 different sites located approximately 4 miles to the northeast and a similar distance to the east northeast from the Zick pad site. That's the 5-well pad site I just mentioned. These wells tested at similar rates as the Zick pad wells. We are currently waiting on gathering lines to be hooked up to these new wells that we just tested. Again, all these wells continue to de-risk our acreage in Susquehanna County. We're very comfortable with our acreage position. In addition, we have just completed shooting a 50-square-mile 3D seismic survey on the eastern portion of our acreage, with the addition of this data, which will be processed by the fourth quarter, we have 3D seismic coverage over approximately 95% of our acreage in Susquehanna County. On the operations side, we are currently operating 5 drilling rigs in the Marcellus, and we plan to go down to 4 rigs in August. Through the first half of this year, we have completed 520 stages, and we currently have 368 stages that have been completed and waiting to turn in line or they're currently cleaning up or we're currently completing. And additionally, we have 374 stages drilled and waiting to be completed. Regard to the infrastructure comments, we continue to make progress despite minor regulatory and governmental slowdowns on pipeline permits. Specifically, the backlog on obtaining pipeline permits has been the cause of the delays that we've talked about and has certainly affected our second quarter production. I've read this morning that Corbett has made some comments in regard to setting up some permit approval expectations for the PADEP. We're gaining ground in regard to all of these and do not expect the slow down to affect our 2012 guidance or our maximum takeaway capacity goal of approximately 1.5 Bcf per day by the end of the year. We have, with the help of Williams, accelerated our permit applications for 2013 and our 2014 program, and at this time, do not expect any delays.","A brief comment on the Constitution Pipeline, just a note that the joint venture Constitution Pipeline with Transco, where we have a 25% interest, the initial pre-filing at FERC was completed, as well as all stakeholder notifications. We are currently in the community outreach phase with everything going as planned and continues on schedule for a March 2015 startup. Another comment on pricing. We continue to receive comments on the pricing in the northeast, and the update regarding pricing is that -- and everybody is aware that the weak commodity prices our entire industry has seen and experienced lately has certainly -- we've seen it up in the Marcellus. All producers have experienced some discounting to the historic Appalachia price index. However, with the flexibility of our Springville line to Transco and the Laser system to Millenium, our discount to traditional Appalachia pricing is only around $0.03 to $0.05. We expect the trend to continue in this range. However, again, due to all the questions we get regarding our Marcellus pricing in general, we want to reiterate again that daily spot pricing, which can drop significantly below daily NYMEX pricing during the month, is not applicable to Cabot. And as for the overall macro gas outlook, we're certainly encouraged and enthusiastic that the commodities market has recently turned and improved and has some strong fundamentals behind it with some increased demand and the storage numbers certainly heading in the right direction.","A brief comment on the Utica. The company's Utica test with Range Resources, Cabot and Range are 50-50 in this effort. It's drilling ahead in the Northwest Pennsylvania. The future releases that we would make, we will be following the operator's lead. A brief comment also in regard to water extractions up there. There has been some drought conditions in Pennsylvania, and I just wanted to fill everybody in on where Cabot is in this particular effort. By the end of July, we have and do anticipate having to have completed 60% of our planned fracking program. With the possibility of drought conditions up there, Cabot has firm ability to complete at least 2\/3 of the remaining planned completions for 2012 with the existing capacity, and that's in the event that drought conditions would continue unabated. However, we are securing access to additional sites as we speak, which will more than make up for our water requirements. Lastly, as a backup, Cabot engineering is adding additional storage capacity at its major withdrawal sites. Again, we did not expect to have any problems with fracking.","Moving to the South region and I'll start off with the comments in the Eagle Ford. We have drilled 33 wells with 2 wells currently drilling in our Eagle Ford play. The average IP has continued to increase. In regard to the 400-foot down spacing project, we are drilling our second set of wells designed to test the down space concept again at about 400-foot apart. These wells will also utilize the zipper frac that we did on our first couple of wells. We then plan to zipper frac our new down space test in early August. During the second quarter, our oil pipeline that connects the majority of our Eagle Ford oil wells was connected -- it was connected and put into service. This allows our crude to be delivered to a central storage facility and dramatically reduce the truck hauling fees, plus reduce our truck traffic.","During July, we connected our storage facilities to an existing crude pipeline that will further reduce our trucking costs, plus add price upside by marketing our production at the Gulf Coast refineries in lieu of at the least. In the Purcell, our first well is drilling with the second well scheduled to spud sometime in late August. Plans are to drill at least 5 Purcell wells in 2012. With success, that number would triple in 2013. Moving up to the Marmaton in the Panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas, last night's press release highlighted the Marmaton continues to produce excellent results. The program has grown to about 20 operated wells planned in '12, plus participation with a non-operator in several more wells -- as a non-operator in several more wells. Our team is doing an excellent job picking their locations and drilling these wells, which is why a portion of the proceeds from our recent joint venture are being allocated to this area. Additionally, we wanted to move into the southern area of our acreage, the Panhandle of Texas to look at and evaluate that acreage. Our average IP for the last 5 operated wells is over 1,100 barrels of oil plus associated gas, with our drilling costs between $2.9 million and $3.4 million. What this quarter highlights is our drilling activity. Besides remaining highly economic in this price environment, it continues to be very robust. When the infrastructure permits up in the Marcellus catches up with our productive capacity up there, we will certainly see our volumes to expand, and we have already seen that as we have brought on additional wells in July. Additionally, once again, extracted dollars from our assets in a value creating way that opens many doors. We're going to keep the one well in the Marcellus. We've added a well in the Marmaton and certainly, we had new Utica and new Purcell drilling. This is a continued, consistent application of what we've done in the past as part of our strategy. With that, Emily, I'll be more than happy to answer any of the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Pearce Hammond of Simmons.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","I know it's early, and I appreciate the look at the '13 guidance, but was curious for that '13 capital guidance. What is the rig forecast by region behind that guidance?","Dan O. Dinges","We're going to be in 5 or 6 rigs in the Marmaton and we're going to -- I mean -- excuse me, in the Marcellus. And we're going to have a couple of rigs in the Eagle Ford, and we'll probably have 3 rigs in the Purcell, and we'll have the 2 rigs in the Marmaton.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Perfect. And then in the new guidance slide you state it's been...","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, let me just also mention, there might be 1 or 2 more wells drilled in areas that we'll talk about once we get better definition of those.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And then in the new guidance slide, you state that the new 2012 CapEx guidance is $775 million to $825 million, and that's net of proceeds from asset sales in the Purcell JV. What is the CapEx if you include the proceeds from the Purcell JV and any asset sales? So we just add the $125 million from the first Purcell JV on top of that?","Scott C. Schroeder","Yes, Pierce, that's exactly right. So it'd be $900 million to $950 million.","Operator","Our next question comes Biju Perincheril of Jefferies.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, looking at the '13 guidance. Can you -- is there any contribution -- or how much contribution have you baked in from Utica and Purcell in those numbers?","Dan O. Dinges","In the '13 guidance?","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Dan O. Dinges","We're not breaking out the '13 guidance. We have a significant risk profile attached. In fact, we had 0 production contributing from the Utica in our forecast for '12. And we have a very minimal amount forecast right now because of its exploratory nature in the Purcell. So until we see the -- with the well results, drilling results, we're not forecasting that production.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned the drought conditions in Pennsylvania and some of the various conditions don't improve. Is any of that also baked into the '13 guidance? Or are you assuming the conditions do improve?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, the -- I can't predict the weather, but I can say currently, there is even-- since they had the restrictions, the restrictions have been lifted in our withdrawal sites. And we will start sometime today withdrawing water again up there as a normal course of business. So you're going to have these -- you're going to have the periods where you have some flood restrictions. It's dependent upon certainly rain, but we also are enhancing our storage capacity to allow us to frac through any extended drought periods. So to answer your question more succinctly, we have not forecast in our '13 guidance any risk profile attached to obtaining water for fracking. So we're comfortable with what we're building out in form of frac tanks, in the form of additional take points and in the form of accumulation areas to keep our frac crews busy.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And you mentioned the additional storage. Can you tell us what your current capacity is and how much you are adding?","Dan O. Dinges","Our current capacity will allow us to frac at least 2 stages per day and that is just as what we hold on the ground right now. That does not include where we are currently securing additional sites for take point, and it does not include any type of impoundments. So I would say we have plus or minus 500 frac stages -- frac tanks, excuse me, frac tanks available for fracking.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Plus or minus 500 available today and can you say how many you're adding?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, once we have -- it's not going to be where we're adding the frac tanks, it's going to be where we're adding additional capacity to existing sites and a couple of additional new sites for water withdrawal and the engineering of impoundment.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then one more question related to that. I think you only had 2 or 3 locations that was impacted by the restrictions. How many withdrawal locations do you have in Susquehanna?","Dan O. Dinges","We have -- I'll let Steve Lindeman answer that.","Steven W. Lindeman","Yes, there were 2 that were impacted. We have 5 total.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you talk to what you're seeing or expecting in terms of IP per stage from your Marcellus wells now versus what's historically been I think about 1 million cubic feet a day per stage I believe? And to what degree that your wells in the Marcellus that are currently online are being restrained if at all because of midstream constraint versus what you would want them to optimally produce?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we have for example, the 2 wells that we've just announced on a per stage basis, these couple of new wells-- they're obviously very good wells, and they are above our average IP. We continue to see a fairly consistent level of production on a per stage basis. We are trying to extend our laterals and we're trying to add additional stages, but we do continuously or negated from as longer laterals as we'd like to drill out there on a consistent basis by virtue of the Pennsylvania not having any pooling provisions available to us. So in regard to our EURs and what we anticipate in the future, we'll look at that at year-end and make that kind of a determination once we get to the end to look at what the average stages of our 2012 program has been.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And are your existing wells that are producing in the Marcellus, are they producing at the levels that you would optimally want them to produce, or are they being restrained by midstream?","Dan O. Dinges","No. We have seen little restraints because some of the production we have or capacity -- production capacity we have in some areas is being affected by the unscheduled maintenance that we've seen and some downtime we've seen on various compressions. So that does affect our production profile. If you look at and you cobble together the unexpected downtime and some of the issues we've seen out there, which we are -- we along with Williams continue to work through, it has affected probably year-to-date, somewhere north of 5 Bcf of production.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And that's essentially incremental production from here that might not be included in the 368 stages that are behind pipe or completing?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, we're risking some of that production that's behind pipe or waiting on pipeline when it comes on, and we also put an element of risk in on the wells we drill with the anticipated number of stages that we have forecast. And we do that in case we lose a plug in the hole. We have mechanical issues periodically out there that we can't get to the end of the, say, the toe of the well, back to the toe of the well. And instead of wasting the time right now, we'll bring on a well and then we'll clean out at a later day once production gets worked down.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's great. And lastly, just going back to the water constraints topic. In some downside scenario where you would face greater constraints, do the planned infrastructure additions that you see coming give you the ability to bring on the 368 stages that have already been completed or are completing? And I guess on the earlier question, just to make sure we understood, what does pure water storage give you in terms of how many incremental wells or stages you could frac overall?","Dan O. Dinges","Well-- and I'll let Steve answer the latter part of that. But in regard to the 374 stages that we have waiting on completion, we feel very comfortable that we're going to be able to get all those stages fracked.","Steven W. Lindeman","Right. And just in terms of our storage, what we're looking to do is to double our storage capacity at the withdrawal sites. So we'll have a significant amount of surplus of fluid available to us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Aydin of KeyBanc.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","What is your production today from Marcellus?","Dan O. Dinges","Let's see. I think it is -- it varies everyday, but it's plus or minus 650.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. The second question, the lateral on those 2 wells, the 8 million IP and the 16 million, what was the lateral on those wells in each?","Dan O. Dinges","They were both 15-stage frac wells.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And how -- what was the cost running on those wells?","Dan O. Dinges","The cost was right at $6 million.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Now of the -- you had about 368 stages completed waiting and about 374 to be drilled, completed. How many of those do you think you might do this year?","Dan O. Dinges","We think we'll do all of the 300 and -- well, we'll turn in line all of the 368 stages and we will frac all of the 374 stages. All those are part of our expected stages that we'll turn in line and bar [ph] '12, we're estimating that we would be plus or minus 1,100 stages total.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Now with your takeaway capacity or takeaway of that coming about 1.5 Bs by year end, some operators are reducing activities in the Marcellus. Do you think you will have some access to additional takeaway capacity this year and next year because of other operator's decision to cut -- to reduce activities in the play?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we're going to still see -- I'm going to turn that over to Jeff in a second. But we're going to still see, as we continue to build the infrastructure out, we're going to still see areas that we are infrastructure-constrained just by nature of where the drilling and completing is going to be. We'll be able to bring some on, but we might not be able to bring them on at full volumes. And I'll let Jeff make a comment also.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Jack, you're exactly right to a certain degree that the reduction in activity is going to open up some capacity on the pipelines. But I think the bigger factor that we're experiencing right now is, with Cabot taking more gas, additional gas down to Transco and companies like Talisman moving a lot of their production off the Tennessee line up to Empire [ph], and you've got some other producers Range, and there's probably 6 or 7 other producers that are moving gas in different directions because of recent pipeline completions and enter service this fall. That's what really relieving the pressure and the capacity constraints on Tennessee 300 line right now.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Dan, one more question, and you might not answer it. But when are you going to talk about the new venture, if you add it in a couple of plays, your 25,000 acres or so and you're spending money. When we might know which -- where you are being active?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, Jack, I'd be disappointed if you didn't ask a question that I couldn't answer. We have -- one of the areas I think we will have data on this year that we will probably discuss, and another area maybe both those areas we would discuss, but it's not a guarantee.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Is it gassy, oily play?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That does it, okay. Now final questions. Do you do a mid-year reserve report or you don't?","Dan O. Dinges","No, we do not do a mid-year reserve report. Steve Lindeman is one who shepherds that, and he will start working on that til probably November, October time period to be prepared for year-end numbers.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just based on the result of those wells, the EURs and everything, I mean it looks like 7.5, 11. Could you guess how high we could go in the EUR by year end?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, again, our data based on the Lower Marcellus is certainly adequate, and we're comfortable with the numbers that we have even all the way down to -- like Brian's question on the IP and booking per stage. But in regard to the Upper Marcellus, our data set is limited in the Upper Marcellus, and we'll continue to be cautious on our bookings in the Upper Marcellus until we see further data, but the data that we have seen, we're very comfortable with.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Hall of Robert W. Baird.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just wanted to, I guess, dive into the 2012 CapEx increment with a little more granularity. On that increase, can you kind of outline what the specific drivers of it were. It seems like some of it's clearly leasing, but just wondering if you could walk through some of the moving pieces there?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, on the 2 new wells that we're adding in the Purcell JV, we're adding also a rig in the Marmaton, and that is a rig that we placed into the -- in the Panhandle of Texas that we're currently drilling. We have the Utica well that we're drilling with Range and Range is also permitting a second well up there in the Utica, which we've included in our numbers. And we have a -- with the success up in the Marmaton, our operator where we're not operator, they continue to have a fairly robust program up there. Those are the primary areas that we're allocating the additional capital. And we're keeping the 1 rig in the Marcellus that either way that was not going to affect our production. It was just going to be reducing our cash if we went down to 3 rigs, but we're going to keep a rig running from August to the end of the year that we had originally had planned on setting on the sidelines til January.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then I guess on the outlook for 2013, maybe could you just provide a little bit of a road map around the infrastructure and then given -- like you said, we continue to have, kind of, pockets of tightness. And how should we think about that for '13 relative to '12? Are the majority of those expected to be, let's say, debottlenecked by mid-year? Just some additional color there?","Dan O. Dinges","Okay, yes, now Jeff lives and and breathes this 24\/7, so I'll let him answer that.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Michael, obviously, this is a process, and it doesn't stop at quarters and year ends. And we have permitted pipes out through '14 and '15 to try to design an infrastructure system out there that not only is safe and dependable, but also gives us flexibility and also increases our capacities to all the pipelines. So it is a work in progress. We do have some major compressor stations going to be completed early in the mid-year of '13. That's going to help us out quite a bit. Again, adding additional units to make sure that we have some backups, some spare capacity, that's obviously the goal. We also want to concentrate on lowering the fuel pressure throughout the system. And so as we grow the infrastructure, we will concentrate on trying to paint ideal conditions where wells have a better opportunity to produce at a 100% than they are at currently.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Will there be any sort of, let's say, lumpiness that you would highlight as we look at '13 on maybe a quarterly basis?","Dan O. Dinges","No, my expectation, Michael, as we've relayed to you that '13, we expect things to be -- to getting smoother in regard to what we can comfortably expect versus what we'll actually realize. The permits for our '13 program have been -- and all our location discussions with Williams has gone very well. Williams had submitted permits for the 2013 program, and we're 95% complete with that permit application for our '13 program. We'll have a little bit more spread and a little bit more capacity in not only existing areas, but we'll have some -- also some additional areas that we'll be able to move our gas through the existing pipe. So expectation is, it's not going to be lumpy. It would just be in the beginning of the year, we might hedge our bet a little bit like we have been this year. And the example would be -- a good example would be just the couple of wells that we brought on that were -- granted, very, very good wells. But if we would have brought the 2 wells at a -- each cumed over 1 Bcf, if we would have brought those on a month earlier as anticipated, along with some of the other wells that we brought on in July, it would've made a lot of difference in just what people look at as our second quarter numbers. So like Jeff said, it's not a quarter-to-quarter game with us right now. It's just a fluid, dynamic process that we are getting ahead of, and we're at the tail end of coordinating the passing the baton from Cabot to Williams on getting all these gathering lines in sync with where we have drilling rigs.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. That all makes sense. Appreciate the color. Just a couple more as you look to the end of '12, would you care to put any sort of exit rate assumption out there and then kind of what you feel like the backlog in terms of uncompleted and are waiting on something, let's say, looks like as you head into '13 in the Marcellus?","Dan O. Dinges","We're still going to stick with our -- just our pretty wide range guidance right now on the exit rates. Certainly, as you can see with the number of stages that we had already completed, waiting to be turned in line and the activity that we have ongoing, it's fairly safe to say that we're going to have a robust exit volume, but we're not prepared to lay it out there.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of backlog, I mean, relative to the current backlog, waiting on pipeline and\/or completion, do you think it will be pretty similar as you head into '13 or do you expect to work that down materially?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, I would expect with us keeping that. As we mentioned before, we were going to get down to 3 rigs and going into January, we were still going to have a backlog of stages that rolled into '13. Now keeping that rig, our backlog is going to increase, and I would think that backlog will probably be between 350 and 400 stages.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just 2 more housekeeping ones on my end. Well costs, let's say, per area in the 2013 outlook, would you care to provide those? Give us the rig counts. Just curious what you're seeing on a well cost per area?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we're in the $6 million plus or minus range in the Marcellus. We're in the -- as we've mentioned, the $2.4 million -- or $2.9 million to $3.4 million in the Marmaton. We're in the $6.5 million to $7.2 million in the Eagle Ford. The Purcell wells are going to be right now because we're going to have some evaluation process going on. We're going to be $9.5 million to $10 million -- $10.2 million somewhere in that regard. The Utica well -- somebody help me with the -- the Utica well is going to be $7.5 million to $8 million, something of that nature. And that has science attached to it also with us coring and things like that.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then on the 2 wells that have cumed over 1 Bcf each, what would be the cume during the roughly 39-day or whatever, call it a 30-day period on your 11 Bcf type well?","Dan O. Dinges","Less than that. I don't have that number. Yes, I'm sorry, Michael. I don't have that number handy with me right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Portillo of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question to clarify on the CapEx side. I'm just working through the implied run rate into the back half of the year. And to get to the midpoint of the guidance range I'm seeing something around $250 million to $275 million per quarter. If I was to annualize that number into 2013 and then looking at the rig count allocation that you guys have, it would put me at something probably above the $1 billion in CapEx guidance. Can you just provide, I guess, any color around that and maybe what you may be spending incremental capital in the next 2 quarters that may not be there in 2013?","Scott C. Schroeder","Matt, this is Scott Schroeder. One of the things that Dan highlighted as part of the capital increase is a doubling of the lease ac. And the lease ac run rate for '12 is higher than the run rate has been. So that would contribute part of it. Again, what it's all going to boil down to for '13 is what we think the underlying commodity prices are for both commodities. We've given you a kind of a wide production range, but if you kind of look at the midpoint of that, what's your cash flow? We're going to target the cash flow. And if it ends up -- cash flow ends up being a little above $1 billion, we'll probably be a little above $1 billion, if it's below, we'll be below.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And just on that leasing side, is there a rough number you guys can provide us on the leasing for the full year?","Scott C. Schroeder","For '13, I would say it's probably back to the $50 million or less range for next year.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just, I wanted to clarify on the July production number, I think you said roughly 650 million a day, is that a gross number?","Scott C. Schroeder","That's a gross Marcellus number.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And how does that compare to June?","Scott C. Schroeder","That's probably about 30 million a day to 35 million, to 40 million a day higher than the June average. Actually than the second quarter average. Second quarter average is right around 615 gross for Marcellus.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just the final question for me. I just wanted to clarify on the production guidance for 2012. You are baking in some risked volumes given the issues around the drought or you're not baking in anything at this point?","Dan O. Dinges","No, we're -- the risked volumes that we bake in -- one, we have not included anything in the Utica. Two, we have very, very little production attached to our Purcell right now, and we feel fully comfortable that with the -- our plan in place and the securing of additional sites, we feel fully comfortable about getting our production volumes with the -- not only what we've already done, the wells we've already completed waiting on infrastructure, but also the amount of capacity we have to frac between now and the end of the year. Even if you had some drought conditions, we feel fully comfortable about being able -- matching our guidance. And we have not put -- added any risk profile to that because of those comments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Let's see, a couple of quick questions. First, on the Marmaton. Those look like-- at least the one well you guys talking about is really encouraging, and I'm curious what -- do you guys have a view on what drives the divergence between your wells that are really good and wells that are not as good? And do you think -- what are you doing to advance the ability to figure that out pre-drill?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, the biggest factor geologically is the extent of fracturing in and around the well bore. And that is contributing to the differential and the delta. We are doing some things out there, for example, we're going to be drilling our first operated stand up 640, which will have longer laterals and more stages and certainly, we think, the possibility of intersecting additional fractures, but that's the overriding royalty why you have more delta in this particular area that you might in the other areas. And I'll let Matt make a brief comment attached to what he's seeing out there also.","James M. Reid","I think also with our longing programs that we have now, we are better able to identify our fracture systems and also a real key to our completions now are pack replacements. We identify fracture forms and are able to place our packers in more ideal position and better place our fracs.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","So you're just -- you're interpreting the open hole log on the whole horizontal section and deciding-- kind of just deciding where you're frac is going to be more closely spaced or something.","James M. Reid","Yes, that's part of it and also we've done some things to better isolate the individual stages between -- during the frac. And also, I think we've been able to identify some better areas where these individual fractures have formed and areas are.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then one follow-up question, Dan, thanks for addressing that pricing issue in the Marcellus head on. But as far as what we should look to, am I right in thinking that it's really the Dominion Basis Swap that we should be paying attention to for your -- for the pricing that you're going to realize up there?","Dan O. Dinges","I'll let Jeff, fill that.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","No, not necessarily. Demand is kind of a weird situation. The Dominion index and Columbia Gas Transmission index, both very traditional Appalachian-type indexes. When we first got started up there, pretty much a lot of people traded off that Columbian index, that's no longer very applicable and so a lot of people turn to Dominion. But mostly people have turned to just plain old NYMEX-type pricing. And so on the fiscal side, we have, too. And so -- but when you take our existing term business and you look at the 3 different pipes that we're on, all 3 pipes trade different indexes. So what we've tried to do is just put them all in a bucket and kind of throw it out on a weighted-average basis. We're pretty darn close to last day NYMEX.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Stewart of Citi.","Joseph Stewart - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A follow-up question on the Marmaton there. So you're mentioning that the results are largely driven by the naturally occurring fractures. How many drilling locations have you currently identified there?","Dan O. Dinges","I'm going to let Matt fill that, and again, that was part of the reason why we added the extra rig in there is to identify a larger swath of our acreage and so the assumptions that you roll into that, if you had all of it available--  Matt, I'll let you fill in.","James M. Reid","If you look at these individual fracture forms and look at our positions on mid-quarter, as Dan said, we're down in Texas now and starting to look at a new area and also looking at some other areas as well. But I would say the locations are going to vary from between 400 and 500 gross locations.","Joseph Stewart - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So are those locations which appear to have the naturally occurring fractures?","James M. Reid","Well, as we say, we're investigating and looking at new areas down in Texas and some other areas in Oklahoma. But in the areas that we're in now, yes, they would have the natural occurring fractures, that's correct.","Dan O. Dinges","And Joe, just to comment on that, we have a lot of -- again because of our leasing, we have a lot of vertical wells and areas that have shown fractures in the past, but we have not done extensive -- nobody's done extensive horizontal drilling in some these new areas to determine the full extent of the fracturing. So that would be the risk profile you would assess against it.","Joseph Stewart - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then I apologize if I missed this, but given the 1.5 Bs per day that you're expecting to have by year end and then also just kind of looking at your Q2 volumes, if you held Q2 flat, you'd basically be at the low end of your guidance for the year. So should we maybe expect kind of an updated range or maybe even an increased range on the guidance by Q3? Or would you prefer to just kind of wait and maybe just hit the high end or beat it?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we've had discussion about our guidance and the width of the guidance that we have, 35% to 50% and we realize a fairly large truck can drive through that. But we felt that right now, staying consistent, not have a whole lot of moving parts in our guidance and just to continue to work through the delays that we've seen in the gathering lines. We thought that's prudent, and if we are successful in topping out our guidance, then that's great. But we certainly feel very comfortable that we're going to be within guidance.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bob Brackett of Bernstein.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can you talk about what you learned from the Brown Dense well, and what it cost you to learn that?","Dan O. Dinges","The cost was the acreage cost of the 13,000-plus acres and the cost of the drilling, which we wrote-off as our dry hole cost, which was around $10 million. And right now, we're still, again, have learned that it's productive, continued capital being spent in the area by different operators and making an effort to determine how to make it economic up there and compete with the other plays that companies have to allocate capital on. So we're not -- again, because we write-off the well, we're not saying we're condemning the play.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And do you think the poor results, I guess, implied in the write-off-- are they the result of a completion, or do you think it's the geology or some combination?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, I think it's just the early stage of going into a virgin area to drill well when you have decisions on where you're going to place the well in the zone and what type of fracs you're going to place on it, how you're going to space those fracs and the well we drill, exploratory, again, in nature. We only had 10 stages applied to that. And it's gathering information that's going on not only in the Brown Dense, continuing gathering information in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale. We did the same thing as we gathered information in every other play, the Eagle Ford, we're doing that now, in the Purcell. We did that in the Marcellus, and it's just a very early entry. Some play, some areas, the key to success is very obvious and upfront. In other plays, the key to success takes a whole lot more study and evaluation and technology to get there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Christensen of Buckingham Research Group.","Robert L. Christensen - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","On the ops report, my one question relates to the Eagle Ford. You say it's very early results in your down spacing program. When will we be more down spacing and when will we start to establish that the down spacing is working or not working on a very broad area of your acreage? When will we know some of that?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, that's a good question, Robert. And with -- obviously, we all need to be cautious without a big sample pool. But with that said, we are -- we have drilled 2 additional wells that are spaced 400 feet apart. And we have-- Matt's group has scheduled the frac to occur in the middle of August. So we will -- will do that and get another data point, but from the information we've seen on the 2 wells as we mentioned, the 30-day average is greater. In fact, one of the wells had been on about 110 days and one of the wells is still producing at 400 or so barrels a day. So that is pretty good data that says that-- a couple of things. One, that the spacing was not a big issue; and two, that the zipper frac we think, which was -- these were the first 2 wells we did the zipper frac, we think it probably had a positive effect overall on the proximity of each frac that we did and the results that we're seeing.","Robert L. Christensen - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","But my point is, I guess how many more down spacing tests will you run this year and next year? When will we start to be able to put a big circle around this and say it's broad, broad in nature, the success of down spacing as opposed to in a select area.","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we can extrapolate a little bit now by the other wells we've drilled and the geology we've seen and consistency in the geology that we've seen in the other areas we've drilled. So we can extrapolate a little bit, but to specifically have a full-blown development program out there right now, we're not implementing a full-blown development program out there right now until we continue to see how the wells performed, all the wells perform, long-term. But again, in '13, I would expect towards the end of '13 that we would have a couple of more pad sites that would give as additional data points in additional areas that would continue to enhance our evaluation.","Robert L. Christensen - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So perhaps by '14, we could rule it in on a broad-based basis or not? I mean, we just need more time, I understand.","Dan O. Dinges","No, I think that's very realistic.","Operator","The next question is a follow up from Biju Perincheril of Jefferies.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Going back to the discussion on price realization. Gas that you're flowing on the Tennessee line. Is that subject to the TGP zone 4 pricing? Or are you getting some other index on that?","Jeffrey W. Hutton","The answer is no. It's not -- we do not sell off that index.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if you -- if you wanted to flow additional gas on Tennessee today, would that then be subject to zone 4 pricing or...","Jeffrey W. Hutton","No, no, it would not.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the Springville expansion, is that still on target for August completion?","Steven W. Lindeman","Springville has a couple of phases to it. There are some units being commissioned as we speak. And so we don't have an exact date, but certainly, in the next short term.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And for that next phase coming on, how much capacity would that add?","Steven W. Lindeman","The next compressor will add approximately 100,000 a day of capacity and then the second phase of that will add approximately 200,000 a day of capacity.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And do you have timing for that 200 million (sic) [200,000] a day?","Steven W. Lindeman","We expect that kind of early fourth quarter.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then lastly, the 2 wells that you highlighted that produced over 1 Bcf a day, what was the lateral length and stages on that, and also the cost?","Dan O. Dinges","Let me grab that. The costs were, I think-- let me see what's the -- Steve, what do you have there...","Steven W. Lindeman","17 stages.","Dan O. Dinges","Both of them?","Steven W. Lindeman","Yes.","Dan O. Dinges","Both of them are 17 stages. So the cost is probably about $6.5 million, something like that.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And those were in the central area?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is a follow up from Michael Hall of Robert W. Baird.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just one quick one on the -- more of the macro environment. Just curious if you had any sense of industry backlog as it relates to kind of wells waiting on completion and\/or pipeline in Northeastern PA?","Dan O. Dinges","No, Michael, I don't have a -- exact numbers or any better intelligence than some of what we all read out there. I know there's some wells that are drilled waiting on capacity buildout and that capacity buildout is down the road, but I do not have the exact count on those -- the number of wells.","Operator","Our next question is from John [indiscernible]  Capital Partners.","Unknown Analyst","The early results in the Upper Marcellus look good but the lower is, obviously, still better. Kind of, how do you see that playing out once -- are you going to do enough that you've increased your knowledge and the certainty of that and then continue to drill the lower? How does that look going into 2013?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, the drilling we're doing right now is predominantly in the lower. We plan on continuing drilling predominantly in the lower as we continue to gather data points, which we will drill some additional data points between now and through our '13 program in the Upper Marcellus. The plan would be to gather information, have the confidence, and then once we get to a more intense pad drilling, that we would augment some of that drilling with the reduced spacing that we've implemented in this particular area, similar to that pattern.","Unknown Analyst","Got it. So I guess the lower recoveries you would more than make up in the synergies of drilling from the pads?","Dan O. Dinges","Absolutely. We expect to have increased synergies in our pad drilling process. We just did not -- we're just not doing that right now.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. I appreciate it, Emily, and thanks for the attention for this quarter. As you can see, the program that we've laid out, we'll continue to follow it within what we think is a fairly robust production guidance process. There was comments in regard to our reserve bookings and at the end of the year, once we do that, we think we are also going to have a very robust reserve recognition at the end of the year. That's going to translate into, I think, a top-tier finding cost and certainly a very nice portfolio on the books by the end of the year. Stay tuned. We have more to come, and I look forward to visiting with you all through the third quarter. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Dinges, Chairman, CEO and President. Please go ahead. ","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Gary and good morning. Thanks for joining us today for Cabot's third quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are several members of Cabot's Executive Management Team. ","I trust that everyone has had the opportunity to review our press release from this morning. Additionally, we have posted a presentation to our website, something new, that I will directly reference on the call this morning. This presentation highlights our financial and operational results from the quarter, as well as provides an updated outlook on the Company's plans for 2017 and beyond. ","However, before we get started, I would first like to move to slide 2 of the presentation which addresses our forward-looking statements. Please note that we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations this morning. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in both the earnings release and this presentation. ","Moving on to the third quarter financial highlights on page 3, Cabot once again generated positive free cash flow for the quarter, while growing equivalent production 6% year over year despite our production being impacted by downstream maintenance projects and unplanned upstream gathering down time during the quarter. We remain committed to generating return-focused, measured growth within cash flow and this quarter we successfully executed on this plan. ","While much has been made recently about a widening of regional differentials, with actually recorded our best pre-hedge natural gas realization since the first quarter of 2015 when the average NYMEX price was $0.17 higher than this past quarter. Our pre-hedge realization of $1.80 per Mcf were 7% better than the comparable quarter last year and 16% higher sequentially relative to the second quarter. ","Our cost structure continued to improve during the quarter, with cash costs, operating cost, declining 13% year over year. We expect this trend to continue over the next few years, as we leverage our operational scale to further improve our cost structure. ","Our financial position remains strong, with over $500 million of cash on hand, approximately $1.7 billion of available commitments on our undrawn credit facility and a net debt to EBITDAX ratio at 1.9 times at quarter end. ","Moving on to slide 4, where we have outlined a significant decline in our drilling and completion cost and our LOE which is a direct impact of efficiency gains our operational teams have accomplished over the past few years. They have done an outstanding job with this. While it is possible that we could see some upward pressure on service cost, I anticipate that we will continue to see a downward trend in our overall cost structure as we become even more efficient in our operations. ","On slide 5, we have outlined the results of a few reduced space pilots that we have been testing in our Marcellus operating area. This is an interesting area for us. The graphs on this slide represent four different pads where we completed one well with our Gen 3 completion design and one offset well with our Gen 4 completion design. We have experienced overall a 20% uplift in cumulative production from the Gen 4 wells. ","As a result, we have decided to implement this completion design for all of our wells going forward, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. As we typically do each year, we will wait until our year-end reserve audit before making any changes to our EUR; however, as you can see by the numbers, we're very excited about what this could mean for our industry-leading well productivity going forward. ","On slide 6, we have laid out our capital program for 2017 which includes the program-wide implementation of the Gen 4 completion design in the Marcellus. As we alluded to on the second quarter call, we're targeting 5% to 10% production growth in 2017. This is based on total program spending of $625 million which includes $575 million of E&P capital and another $50 million for our equity investments in the Atlantic sunrise and constitution pipelines. ","$535 million or 93% of the MP capital, is earmarked for drilling and completion activity associated with the 70 net wells we plan to drill and the 75 net wells we plan to complete next year. 79% of the drill and complete capital will be directed to the Marcellus and the remaining 21% will be directed to the Eagle Ford, where the program is focused on maintaining lease hold, holding oil volumes flat and generating a cash-flow-neutral operating program. We have allocated $225 million for maintenance capital in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford which is the amount of capital needed to hold our anticipated 2016 exit production flat throughout 2017 and also allows us to meet all our obligatory operating commitments to maintain our lease hold. ","This flat production profile for the year would imply growth at the low end of our production growth guidance range. The remaining capital for the year provides the productive capacity needed to meet or exceed the high end of our 2017 guidance range, assuming price realizations are at levels that generate strong returns for Cabot, while also allowing us to build the backlog necessary to meet our production targets in 2018, when we anticipate a significant amount of new takeaway capacity being placed in service. ","Slide 7 highlights the well-level economics on the average well we plan to drill in 2017. Even in a low-price environment, both our assets generate strong returns. However, from a capital allocation perspective, you can see why the Marcellus continues to receive the lion's share of the capital. At a $2 realized price, our wells generate a rate of return over 100%, highlighting the world-class asset we have in northeast Pennsylvania. I would also highlight that the well cost on this slide includes facility costs and also reflects our current view of the service cost environment for 2017. Additionally, the Marcellus well costs include the incremental stages and the corresponding increase in well costs for the Gen 4 completion design. ","Moving to slide 8, we have highlighted our natural gas price exposure by index for 2017. While it is no surprise that we have a significant amount of exposure to in-basin pricing during 2017 as we await the addition of new takeaway projects in 2018, we have taken numerous steps to mitigate the potential for down-side pricing risk next year. We have about 12% of our natural gas production tied to NYMEX and we have hedged the majority of that exposure at an average floor price of approximately $3.10 per Mcf. We have also locked in another 21% of our volumes with fixed-price contracts at an average price of $2.15. ","The majority of these volumes would typically be tied to the northeast PA index that have seen significantly worse pricing over the last few years. As a result, we believe fixing these volumes at prices that generate the high returns we highlighted on the previous slide is a prudent decision. ","Regarding our balance sheet, as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have an extremely strong financial position, with a significant amount of flexibility given our cash-on-cash and availability under our credit facility. You will notice that our highest cost debt matures in 2018, leaving us with a much lower weighted average interest rate subsequent to those maturities. ","Moving to slide 9, in light of all of the recent news flow regarding Atlantic Sunrise and other infrastructure projects in Appalachia, on slide 9 we have provided a brief update on all the projects that we're participating in over the next few years. For today's call, I plan to only specifically address a few of the projects. However, all of these projects are important steps towards realizing our long term initiatives and value creation from our Marcellus asset. ","Our two infrastructure projects in the power market, the Moxie Freedom power plant and the Lackawanna Energy Center power plant are currently under full-scale construction. Both facilities are on track to be completed by June 2018, with the Lackawanna project phasing in between June and December 2018. I remind everyone that this new local demand of approximately 400 million cubic feet per day is essentially tied to our gathering system and eliminates the need to commit to expensive long term firm transportation agreements. ","Overall, we anticipate the net backs on these volumes to be some of the best in our portfolio. Tennessee Orion project, in which we're sole supplier, recently received a favorable environmental assessment from the FERC and is slated to begin construction in January 2017. We have approximately $135 million per day on this project and anticipate the net backs will be accretive to end basin net backs. ","Moving often to Atlanta Sunrise, as you are aware, we recently had a slight setback, with the FERC moving the timing of the issuance of the final Environmental Impact Statement from October to December, in order to accommodate comments from land owners regarding two minor route alternatives totalling 1.4 miles. While disappointed that this decision has resulted in a delay of in-service date to mid-2018, we believe the decision was prudent in that the end of the day, the Atlantic Sunrise route will ultimately be ensured of a full and complete record. And, as you are all aware, in this environment we simply want to get it done right, particularly concerning the route. ","You will notice that all these projects have the potential to be placed in service during 2018, highlighting what an inflection year 2018 can be for Cabot. Not only do we believe that 2018 is going to be a strong year for us, but also additional infrastructure is needed for PA and the nation. I would refer you to the Pennsylvania Governor Wolf's support of that position referenced in William's press release this morning. ","Moving to slide 10 highlights the cumulative impact of all the projects we have highlighted on the previous slide, allowing us to potentially double our gross production out of the Marcellus to four Bcf per day. Clearly there has been a lot of questions around Constitution given the ongoing appeal process, but even if you exclude Constitution from the conversation, we would be able to produce 3.5 Bcf per day with these existing projects that are on the slate, once all the new projects are online. We remain optimistic that Constitution will be built and that we will continue to assess new outlets that enable us to grow our production higher than the levels outlined on this slide. ","However, even if we were able to hold the production flat at 3.5 Bcf per day, we believe a highly capital-efficient asset base provides a unique value proposition via the cash flow yield. At a range of realized prices between $2.50 and $3 per Mcf, our stand-alone Marcellus asset generates between $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion pre-tax free cash flow. We will have the inventory to hold production flat at those levels until 2037. ","Slide 11 illustrates the change in how our market -- Marcellus production between now and 4Q 2018 which is when we expect to have the majority of this new infrastructure online. As you can see that our exposure in the northeast PA price points -- Lydee, Tennessee, Millennium -- reduces significantly, while our exposure to NYMEX, the DC market area and the new-build power generation facilities increases significantly. ","While we fully believe that in-basin pricing will improve dramatically during this period as major projects like Atlantic Sunrise and Penn East are built, even if you assume there are no changes in NYMEX or regional basis differentials between Q4 2016 and Q4 2018, the addition of our new take-away capacity would improve realized prices by greater than $0.50 per Mcf on all of our volumes. Based on the mid-point of our expectation of Q4 2018 production range, a $0.50 uplift in realized prices would represent over $450 million uplift in cash flows on an annualized basis. ","Moving to slide 12, slide 12 highlights our planned production growth through 2018 and some of the anticipated by-products of this plan based on current strip pricing. As I already highlighted earlier in the call, we plan to generate 5% to 10% production growth in 2017. Based on today's strip, we will generate a meaningful amount of free cash flow, even after accounting for pipeline investments and dividends. You can also see that we expect to de-lever by one turn, resulting in year-end 2017 target leverage ratio of one time. ","We also highlighted a preliminary 2018 production growth range of 15% to 25%, based on a program that also generates positive free cash flow at today's strip. Ultimately, where we land within that range will be a function of the timing of the in-service for these take-away projects we highlighted previously and what the expectations are for end-basin prices during this period of time. ","However, based on the target in-service dates we laid out on slide 9 and our current expectations of where local prices will be in 2018, we feel very comfortable that we will be able to deliver on production growth within the range, while generating free cash flow, de-levering, reducing cash cost and increasing cash margins. ","While we have not included 2019 growth expectations at this time, given the line-up of new take-away projects slated for mid-to-late 2018 in-service date, it is reasonable to assume 2019 will be another year of robust growth for Cabot Oil & Gas. ","Gary, with that I will now open the lines up for Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Drew Venker","I was hoping you could talk about your basis expectations for Q4 and 2017? The exposure you gave us is very helpful color. I thought maybe you can give some more detail? ","Dan Dinges","I'm sorry. I didn't hear the first part. Our base what? ","Drew Venker","Your basis expectations for Q4 in 2017? ","Dan Dinges","Okay. Jeff is an expert in this marketing area and he sits poised beside me on each of these calls to answer all of the questions that we have in regard to marketing. As you know, I will preface this by saying that basis has been extremely volatile from the first Q, second Q and then rolling into Q3 of 2017. We see a lot of volatility and we anticipate that volatility to continue into the future to have a fair way of where we think the differentials are going to be is not easy, but we have given it a shot. ","Jeff Hutton","Okay, Drew. This is Jeff. Obviously we didn't get off to a good start with October basis, but what we've tried to do is highlight in the guidance and in the slides exactly what our exposures are to each particular index. Based on the pie chart you see and on the guidance, you get a pretty good idea of where the exposure lies.","It's been up and down all year long. We had a very bad first quarter because of weather. It tightened up considerable in Q2. We had another semi-blowout I would say in Q3. Basically, it's strengthening on the cash market. We had a very good year on cash in terms of -- I wouldn't say a very good year, I'd say better than what we expected with the weather and the storage conditions. If you review the pie chart closely, you'll see the exposures. ","Drew Venker","Just on a relative basis, Jeff, is it fair to assume that this strip is right for 2017. Absolute price should be better, but maybe differentials a little wider relative to NYMEX? ","Jeff Hutton","Yes. ","Drew Venker","Okay. Dan, if we go back to the completions, you talked about the Gen 4 design. It looks like you have a lot of history on these. If you talk about how much you have been using this Gen 4 within your total program, are we looking at four pads and that's the extent of what you have tested or has this been more common in your program in 2016? ","Dan Dinges","No, we certainly have tested more than four pads. On the four pads we illustrated, it was we thought the best apples-and-apples comparison, where we had side by side heading in the same direction spaced accordingly and going through the same geology, the Gen 3 and Gen 4. But we have, in addition to these, we have approximately 20 other wells that we have history with the Gen 4 completions. ","What we don't have, we can extrapolate on those with the results, but we don't have on all of those the exact side-by-side, apple-and apples comparison. We did see positive results in the majority of the Gen 4 completions that we have implemented. ","Drew Venker","One last one, maybe for Jeff on Atlantic Sunrise, this mid-2018 start-up seems, to me at least, that it's been a risked somewhat expectation. Do you know or have a sense of when you need to get the notice to proceed in order to hit that mid-2018 start-up date? Is that a fair amount of protection baked in? ","Jeff Hutton","Yes, there's a lot of issues to be resolved over the next few weeks in terms of the fine-tuning in the schedule, per se. Giving you an exact date on those to proceed, not able to do that. That's probably a good question Monday on the Williams call. As far as mid-2018, looking at all the different accomplishments that need to take place between now and then, it certainly is doable. I wouldn't say there's some fluff in there, but certain events have to take place. But we're comfortable on the mid-2018 date from where we're right now. ","Operator","The next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please go ahead. ","Neal Dingmann","Dan, a follow-up to that question about the fourth gen, is that plans going forward will use that larger completion design, it sounds like on most, given the positive results you are seeing? ","Dan Dinges","We will -- not only on most, but on all. We plan on, with the completions that we have going on out in front of us in the fourth quarter and the completions that we have scheduled for 2017, we will implement this Gen 4 completion design. ","Neal Dingmann","Then Dan, I know some others have mentioned about -- at least when it comes to sand and some call it pushing the limits on some of these completions, some are seeing what they would call diminishing returns. Are you near that or do you think we will see a Gen 5 or a Gen 6? How do you guys think about pushing the envelope on these completion designs? ","Dan Dinges","I will let Phil Stalnaker, who runs our Marcellus, answer that briefly. But I would first say that we still, even within Gen 4, we're still doing some tweaking. I would anticipate there might be modifications and maybe something -- either a Gen 4-A or a Gen 5. I'll let Phil give us a range of some of the things we're tweaking. ","Phil Stalnaker","Like Dan said, we're looking at multiple things -- the number of clusters, the rate that we're pumping, different concentrations of the sand. We're constantly trying to tweak this program and get the best value for it. Again, it's still a work in progress. ","Neal Dingmann","Dan, lastly, we've seen the M&A activity pick up, both in the Marcellus and in the Eagle Ford. Your thoughts? Are you all just looking at bolt-on or are you always looking at deals in both? You definitely alluded to that slide 7, certainly a large bit of returns over the Marcellus for you all. When you look at M&A activity, how do you think about both areas? ","Dan Dinges","We look at value. Blind on commodity, though we have expertise in both oil and gas by virtue of our two regions. We're looking at the value proposition, looking at what can compete for our capital and provide what our strategy is. That is to deliver a growth with a high-return profile to it. ","I think the activity and in the Eagle Ford, I think the activity in the Marcellus, could be a reflection of maybe how the activity in the Permian back scoop has gone with the valuations in those particular basins. But when you look at our ongoing line of business, we're not that acquisitive. However, we're informed with the transactions that have taken place by either being in data rooms or doing our own evaluation of the transactions that have taken place. But our primary consideration on our evaluation is value. ","Operator","The next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead. ","Jeffrey Campbell","I wanted to ask you on slide 5, is it correct that you had better than two years of Fortune data, as the slide implies or is that a shorter data set and it's been extrapolated out? ","Dan Dinges","No, back to the comment I've made about different tweaks and trying different things that make a lot of sense, we have a significant term on these -- the definition of our Gen 4. We also, though, through our Gen 1 through Gen 4, have different modifications within that definition of each one of those that we have employed. ","In this particular case, we wanted to make sure that we felt good about the long term profile that we didn't get the near-well bore spike on high IPs and then have a fall-off later that yielded a reduction in the return. Keep in mind, earlier on when we were doing these completions, the cost of completion was higher early on. You had to be certain early on that you were getting an efficiency uplift in the completions before you were going to spend the money to go forward. ","A couple of things have happened now. Not only has the cost gone down on the completions which yields even better return profile, but as you can see on these slides, that as you're going out into deeper into the amount of days on production, you're actually seeing a widening in the type curve that we have for Gen 3 and the type curve we're realizing on the Gen 4 wells which is a very good positive. ","Jeffrey Campbell","I wanted to ask you, superficially it appears you can maintain flat production in 2017 for a lower cost than it took to reach those levels in 2016, but can you identify what portion of the 2017 spend is not going to produce until 2017? ","Dan Dinges","What part of the 2016 is not going to produce until 2017? ","Jeffrey Campbell","Correct. ","Dan Dinges","Basically going to be our wells that we have scheduled to complete late in the fourth quarter. ","Jeffrey Campbell","The $35 million additional CapEx is basically it? ","Dan Dinges","Right. ","Jeffrey Campbell","Or that portion of it that's going to be for-- ","Dan Dinges","That's allocated to the completions in the fourth quarter. ","Jeffrey Campbell","Finally, if I could ask a higher-level question. Regarding Constitution, you actually have two actions going. You've got the appeal on the second circuit and then you've got a separate action in the northern district. I was curious, are you any more confident in one approach than the other? Ultimately -- and I know this is a tough question, but it's germane, seemingly to every pipeline resistance that we're getting these days. Ultimately, if the actions are somehow unsuccessful, is there any indication that FERC is going to step up and finally exercise its regulatory authority? ","Dan Dinges","Well, great question. I can make a macro comment in regard to the latter part, Jeffrey or that comment. Then I'll turn it to Jeff to get some color on the Constitution in the two courts. ","We're faced with a challenge on the energy space -- not just Atlantic Sunrise, Constitution, but Access and other pipelines and infrastructure that are going to be challenged by activists that quite frankly don't want hydrocarbon in the energy mix. I think it's clear that hydrocarbons are going to be part of the energy mix, without a solution for many decades to come. The argument and the fight today is real to those activists, but from a practicality standpoint, we're going to need the infrastructure to service the demand needs and the demand growth that is perceived in all of these communities. ","FERC is certainly challenged with the regulatory side and the legal battles that are in front of it on a regular basis. We have seen in their decision process additional caution that they have implemented in their review process. I think it's prudent for that review process, but to your point about moving forward and moving the country forward with a need and the public need is also part of their fiduciary role, also. I think they take that very seriously. ","We're getting better as an industry to be able to answer in advance all the challenges that are being placed before us by the antis and those that want to stop the pipelines and infrastructures. We'll continue to get better on the front end to answer all the questions. Hopefully, answering those questions on the front end will mitigate some of the delays we have seen in some of these projects as we move forward. ","I will, just before I turn it to Jeff, I will make one distinction. When you look at Access pipeline and some of the protests that are going on up there, it challenges the local authorities. It challenges the rule of law on what is being implemented and what is being actually allowed to take place up there. ","In looking at Atlantic Sunrise, Atlantic Sunrise is a Pennsylvania pipeline. Atlantic Sunrise is a pipeline that for particularly Cabot's position, we see a need on the other end of Atlantic Sunrise once it is constructed. More importantly, there are areas in northeast Pennsylvania that royalty owners in northeast Pennsylvania are getting virtually no return for their royalties, because the differentials have been so punitive up there in that particular part of the area. When that happens, the state of Pennsylvania certainly does not see any return to the coffers in the form of revenue and taxes, because of the significant impunities that have been in that area because of the gas-on-gas competition. ","In referencing Governor Wolf's letter, I think he recognizes that getting an infrastructure, in particular something as near term and as impactful as Atlantic Sunrise, has a significant value to Pennsylvania and its constituents, to be able to help its shortfall in its budget process. We think all of that is part of the equation and another reason why Constitution -- excuse me, Atlantic Sunrise should move forward. Long-winded, Jeffrey, but I'll turn it to Jeff to make a comment on Constitution. ","Jeff Hutton","Okay, well, we certainly do like the Second Circuit action. The appeal is very simple. If you read the briefs at all, you'll see the case that we laid out is in our opinion very strong, very clear. Even the affidavits and testimonials at the end on the conversations between the DEC and our environmental folks is very clear. ","We read the respondents brief, as well. It was again, in our opinion, not very strong. Of course we filed a reply to that brief. Now it's in the hands of the court. Quite frankly, the schedule is I think very favorable. We'll have the oral arguments in November and then we hope to get a reply by the court in the spring. ","All that said, we still like the action in the northern district, as well. We think it's a very strong case. It's a little more complicated. If it wasn't for the duration of that particular action, we would like it probably equally with the appeal. We're going down two paths. We think they're both very strong and we'll see what happens. ","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Brian Singer ","Going back to the earlier question with regards to slide 5 and the fourth-generation completions, how much actual data do you have for the pads that you mentioned, A? Then B, when you look at the out-performance that you are seeing slash expect, do you view this as an increase in recovery rate or are you simply recovering the same hydrocarbon overall, but doing it more efficiently with fewer wells? ","Dan Dinges","All right. I'm going to answer first, then I'm going to turn it to Phil. On the latter part, do I think this is incremental reserves or acceleration, we think this is all incremental reserves. Keep in mind that the spacing on these are the spacing that we have a significant amount of data on through all of our drilling up there. The spacing on these and where we blade the laterals, we think it's all incremental reserves. We're comfortable with that. I'll let Phil answer the rest of it. ","Phil Stalnaker","As far as the amount of data here, this is pretty much all the data that we have on these wells. I think that was your first question there. You're seeing pretty much everything we have on these different pads. ","Dan Dinges","We obviously have, Brian, we obviously have purposely left off specifics. The specifics we left off was to mitigate the street getting out ahead of us on trying to pre-empt our year-end reserve review. Our year-end reserve review and audit is we go into excruciating detail. We do 100% audit. We'll come out with that after the end of the year. ","But in our comment made to talk about the 20%-plus efficiency gain was designed to give a little bit of color, but we have left off some of the details just to allow us to do the year-end reserves without setting expectations that would get out in front of the actual. ","Brian Singer","And then I guess shifting to the free cash flow that you're expecting beginning next year and continuing. This is not a new question, but you talked about M&A a little bit earlier. I wonder if you give us your latest thoughts on how that free cash flow gets allocated and whether you use that for debt pay-down, whether you use that for returning to shareholders or whether that goes into a coffer for potential M&A? ","Dan Dinges","All the above is still consideration at this point in time, Brian. We have and will have conversations in the Boardroom about dividend policy. We certainly have a good balance sheet at this stage. I know Scott gets a little concerned about too low of debt levels. ","When you look at the value consideration on either looking at other projects to allocate capital, that's part of our internal effort to continue to evaluate all of the opportunities that are out there today; but we again look at that with value consideration as priority one, two and three. Knowing that we have such a world-class return profile for our Marcellus, we want to make sure if we do have projects outside, that it's going to be somewhat competitive with where we might allocate that free cash and to convene favorably with our Marcellus allocation. ","In this low-commodity price environment, still having efficiency gains in a lot of areas, including our Marcellus, we're penalized by the northeast differentials that we experience up there. We think we have a fix that has been slit out from what we originally had anticipated -- extremely frustrating from our perspective that we're moving gas in the range that we're moving it in. But we do think we have some daylight coming down the road. With that daylight, I don't think we will be able to find a project that is better than the Marcellus. We're just looking for one that will compete favorably, if in fact with go that route. ","Operator","The next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead. ","Charles Meade","I wanted to ask another question about that slide on the Gen 4 completions. I appreciate your comments about trying to withhold some information. I recognize we can create a lot of mischief with partial information, but-- ","Dan Dinges","No. ","Charles Meade","Yes. I wonder if you could perhaps offer what's driving some of that variance from one well pad to the other? Is this -- and whether that variance that you are observing across these floor pads is within the range of what you would expect once you used it in your whole development program? ","Dan Dinges","Well, I think the tweaks from Gen 3 to Gen 4 and looking at what Phil referenced earlier, whether it's the cluster spacing, the number of clusters, the pumping volumes and the loading, are all having an effect on the near-well bore dynamics that we're seeing and the amount of rock that we're breaking up. I think the conductivity that we're creating near-well boar with the Gen 4 completion scheme is yielding the results that we're seeing. ","Charles Meade","Got it. Maybe that variance that you see, within the variations of -- within Gen 4, that explains the way some pads are responding better than others, if I'm understanding correctly? ","Dan Dinges","Well, obviously we tried to mitigate the sample pool's variability by what we illustrated on this slide by having the laterals placed in what we thought were going to be positions with extremely similar geology, whether it was the smaller faults or the fractured areas that we have out there. Again, this is as close to variability as we can create without a larger sample pool, if you will. In some of the variability -- and are you talking about when you go out to the 750 to 1,000 days, are you talking about the delta between the two Gen 3 and Gen 4 curves? ","Charles Meade","It was less about the delta on any one given curve. It was more the comparison from pad A to pad B to pad C. When I eyeballed it, it looked like 10 to 20 -- it was helpful that you quantified in at 20 -- but I was wondering why you thought some pads it was on the lower end and why on some pads it was at the higher end? ","Phil Stalnaker","Even on this page there's difference in the concentration between maybe pad A and pad B. That could also be some of the difference you're seeing. Again, we're tweaking the Gen 4 and still working with how much profit we're pumping per foot and there are some differences between those pads. ","Charles Meade","If I could sneak in one last one on the well cost. Perhaps I'm missing something, but when I look at your new well cost of $7.9 million, I noticed you guys said that includes some kind of service cost inflation and it's also an 8,000-foot lateral. When I compare that to your $8.14 per lateral food, from mid-2016, it looks like there's a -- on a lateral adjusted basis, it looks like there's an uplift of about $1.5 million a well. I'm wondering, am I missing something there? Assuming I'm not, how does that $1.5 million break up to -- what portion is service cost inflation and then what part is perhaps additional cost from this Gen 4? ","Dan Dinges","Well, Charles, let me give maybe a little bit more color. What lateral length and how many stages are you -- well are you comparing to? ","Charles Meade","That would be normalized at the 8000 feet. ","Matt Kerin","Charles, this is Matt Kerin. You're talking about an extra 13 to 14 stages on a like-for-like basis for an 8,000-foot lateral between Gen 4 and Gen 3. If you take that extra 13 to 14 stages and adjust a little bit for inflationary costs, you'll probably get there. ","Operator","The next question comes from Pearce Hammond with Simmons Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ","Pearce Hammond","Dan, when we look at the 2018 growth that you provided, the 15% to 25%, does that reflect fully filling Atlantic Sunrise with knew volumes or would Atlantic Sunrise have some redirected volumes from other places within your -- within northeast PA? ","Dan Dinges","That reflects volumes that would be redirected and does not reflect full volumes on Atlantic Sunrise -- full new volumes on Atlantic Sunrise. ","Phil Stalnaker","A combination of old and new. ","Pearce Hammond","Then my two quick follow-ups, more housekeeping. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned at $2.50 to $3 realized pricing, you could generate between $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion pre-tax free cash flow. Over what time period was that? ","Dan Dinges","We could do that between the end of 2018, with the infrastructures in place through 2037. Then we would have a blow-down case beyond that. ","Pearce Hammond","Then final one, what's your rig count that you're targeting next year for Marcellus and then Eagle Ford? ","Dan Dinges","Two in the Marcellus and one -- 50% of a rig to 75% of a rig in the Eagle Ford. ","Operator","The next question comes from David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","David Deckelbaum","Curious, I guess, since the last update. I think the last time you gave color on achieving mid-single-digit growth in 2017 it was a $6.75 swag number. Should we assume that most of the adjustments are basically that capital efficiency improvement from Gen 4 completions? ","Dan Dinges","Yes, that's correct, David. ","David Deckelbaum","Curious as I look at the allocation, Jeff, in 2017 for your basis impact. Is there any reflection when you guys are operating at 2 Bcf a day gross or so, have you picked up any capacity on existing lines within basin from some of the competitors that gave up some of their space? ","Jeff Hutton","Yes. To be perfectly frank, it's very small scale and it's been month to month. There really hasn't been any impactful available capacity in the marketplace. There's been a lot out there, but when we look at the net-backs for that capacity, it's basically red ink. ","What we have seen is a lot of the locations with capacity that's available to us is reaching -- there's some basis poison in those markets, as well and spreading. We're optimistic that we'll find some additional capacity as the growth up there slows down and the capacity exists; but right now there really hasn't been anything meaningful to latch on to. ","David Deckelbaum","Is it possible for you to loosely quantify the gross volumes available in poisons basis impacts markets right now? ","Jeff Hutton","Well, let me rephrase the answer, then. Just to be clear, the available capacity reaches the point that our production can access. The pricing is just not what it used to be, so we're seeing a deterioration of prices at MALWA [ph], Arapahoe and to the west, as well. In that respect, it's just not worth spending the money to get additional capacity in this market place until we see some strengthening of basis in other areas. ","Operator","The next question comes from Marshall Carver with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead. ","Marshall Carver","Yes, the $225 million in maintenance capital for 2017, does that assume completing ducts in 2017 or is that a number you could do year after year after year, if you wanted to keep it at the 2016 exit rate level? ","Dan Dinges","That includes completion of some ducts, also. ","Marshall Carver","For future years, it would probably be a bit higher than that if you wanted it for a run rate, maintenance capital? ","Jeff Hutton","That's correct. ","Dan Dinges","Yes, the future would be a little bit higher, assuming we don't have any additional efficiency gains. I would say that increase might be $275 million to $300 million -- not increase, but total of $275 million to $300 million. ","Marshall Carver","What percentage of your 2015 and 2016 wells were completed with the Gen 4 completions? ","Dan Dinges","2015, none -- well, besides the 20 or so wells that you see right here on page 5, slide 5 and the other wells that are scattered that did not have a direct analogy. Probably 10% to 15% would be the number, Marshall. ","Marshall Carver","For 2015 and 2016. ","Dan Dinges","2015 and 2016 combined. ","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dan Dinges for any closing remarks. ","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Gary and thank you all for the questions. We remain very excited about the Company's future and the opportunity set that lies ahead of us for generating long term shareholder value. While the last few years have been extremely frustrating, not being able to get infrastructure in the ground. We continue to work through ongoing delays in the infrastructure build-out in Appalachia and we do remain confident that better days are ahead of us, particularly in 2018 and certainly beyond. ","Despite the low commodity price environment and the forecast that we've given, we think we will manage through the differentials and we think that we will continue to be able to generate strong returns, grow production, while maintaining our balance sheet, grow proved reserves at an all-time-low finding cost and certainly significantly reduce our cost structure through the efficiency gains. ","Thank you to all the shareholders we have out there, particularly to our long term shareholders, for their continued patience. I look forward to speaking with the group again in February. With that, Gary, that concludes my remarks. ","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today\u2019s event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Dinges, Chairman, CEO and President. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Rocco, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me are several members of the executive team. I would first like to remind everyone that on this morning's call we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.","Additionally, some of our comments would reference non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements and other disclaimers as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release. Cabot shareholders have enjoyed a solid start to 2019.","During the first quarter, we delivered record levels of operating cash flow, free cash flow, adjusted net income and production underpinned by the continued success from our operations in the Marcellus and our unwavering commitment to disciplined capital allocation and cost control.","The first quarter net income was $263 million or $0.62 per share and adjusted net income, excluding selected items was $308 million or $0.73 per share. This represents a 161% increase in adjusted earnings per share relative to the prior-year comparable quarter. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $308 million, which was approximately 3.5x the amount from the prior-year comparable quarter and greater than our free cash flow generated for the full-year in 2018.","For the trailing 12 months, we generated a return on average capital employed of 20.4% compared to 8.3% for the trailing 12 months as of the end of the prior comparable quarter, representing an increase of over 1,200 basis points. This ROCE of over 20% exceeds the current ROCE for the S&P 500, highlighting Cabot's competitive positioning relative to the broader equity markets.","Our success for the quarter was driven by higher production levels, improved realized prices and lower operating expenses. Production for the quarter of 2.28 billion cubic foot per day was above the high end of our guidance range and represented an increase of 21% relative to the prior-year comparable quarter.","Natural gas price realizations were $3.35 per Mcf, an increase of 37% when compared to the first quarter of 2018. Our price realizations before hedges were $0.06 below NYMEX, which was our best corporate-wide differential since the second quarter of 2013. Operating expenses decreased to $1.48 per Mcf, a 6% improvement relative to the prior-year comparable quarter, primarily driven by lower direct operating expenses, DD&A and interest expense.","Given our strong free cash flow generation during the quarter, we ended the period with over $300 million of cash on the balance sheet and a net debt to EBITDAX ratio of 0.6x highlighting significant financial flexibility for continued return of capital to shareholders throughout the year.","On the return of capital front, we announced a 29% increase in our dividend to $0.36 per share on an annualized basis, representing a 1.4% yield. This is our fourth dividend increase in the last 24 months. We expect to continue to increase our dividend methodically with an intent to grow our dividend over time to a yield that is competitive with the broader markets.","A free cash flow generation over the coming years, we'll certainly be able to support this dividend growth even under significantly lower natural gas assumptions should the lower prices occur. We remain fully committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders this year through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.","Given it is still early in the calendar year and we have been in blackout period for the majority of the first four months of the year, we have not executed on any material share repurchases year-to-date. However, we fully expect to continue to reduce our shares outstanding throughout the year and have significant financial flexibility to be much more active on that front, especially if we see a continued weakening in natural gas prices that have negatively impacted our share price.","Moving onto our operations for the quarter. Our Marcellus production increased 25% compared to the prior-year comparable quarter. During the quarter, we placed 13 wells on production, all of which were in March, including 7 of the 13 wells that were turned in line the last week of the month.","We expect to place an additional 18 wells on production during the second quarter, resulting in a production guidance range for the quarter of 2.3 Bcf to 2.35 Bcf per day or a 2% sequential increase relative to the first quarter at the midpoint of our guidance range.","On the pricing front, we have experienced some weakness in the natural gas forward curve as weather-related demand has dissipated in April, which is expected during the spring shoulder season. However, we believe there may be upside to the current price levels driven by weather-related demand this summer that would also coincide with the potential increases in exports to Mexico and continued strength in the demand for feed gas from LNG export facilities.","Lastly, on the production front, we are expecting a slowing of growth in the Northeast and Haynesville, which should be supportive for prices from a supply standpoint. The current strip including actual NYMEX settlement through April implies a $2.75 average price for the year, which is directly in line with our budgeted price.","Based on these prices, we expect to generate over $50 million of hedging revenue for the last three quarters of the year. Through a combination of hedges and fixed price deals, we have approximately 46% of our volumes locked in from second quarter to fourth quarter, providing some mitigation of potential downside price risk.","For the full-year, we have reaffirmed our 2019 capital budget of $800 million and our production growth guidance of 20% or 27% on a debt-adjusted per share basis. At our $2.75 NYMEX budget price for the year, we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share growth of 45% to 55%, return on capital employed of 22% to 23% and free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million, implying a 6% free cash flow yield at the midpoint of the range.","In closing, I'm proud to report one of the best quarters in Cabot's history, which is a direct result of continued operational accents in the field, which has driven improved capital efficiency year-after-year, a marketing strategy that has allowed us to access new markets and significantly improve our differentials without increasing our gathering and transportation costs. They continued commitment to cost controls, including divesting higher cost properties and maintaining low overhead costs and interest expense, the latter of which is supported by one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.","And lastly, as I stated many times before, but truly feel is paramount to our entire strategic plan, discipline capital allocation focused on delivering strong returns on and of capital and a competitive growth in the per share metrics.","Rocco, with that, I'm more than happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani","Hey guys, just a quick question on your second quarter production growth, it looks like you're bringing on more wells in 2Q versus 1Q. Additionally, a lot of the 1Q wells kind of came on late in the quarter. I guess, given that I would thought maybe the growth would be a little bit higher in 2Q. Are you seeing a lot of those 2Q well tie-ins also come on late? Just any color you have around that will be helpful.","Dan Dinges","Well, we'll have a number of those wells that are scheduled for May and that's kind of the middle May. So that's pushed out towards the latter part of the quarter. As we bring on these wells and we bring them on systematically, we don't bring on plus production out of the \u2013 as we unload the wells. So even though we bring them in say the middle of the quarter or the latter part of the quarter, we'll still bring them on and we'll see the majority of that increase probably towards the third quarter.","Leo Mariani","Okay, very helpful color for sure. Any further update in terms of the Upper Marcellus well performance now that you've had a couple more months to kind of view those wells?","Dan Dinges","No, it be a similar comment that I've made previously. We have not seen anything to deter our expectations that the production curve, the decline curve, if you will would be above what we have out there currently as our 2.9 EUR for the Upper Marcellus. That is holding true with the early time production curve and quite frankly, we do expect that, but as prudency would necessitate we're going to get more production before we make a firm statement on that. But we're pleased with what we're seeing and we're continuing to drill representative wells in that section throughout this year.","Leo Mariani","All right, very helpful. I guess, just lastly on your stock buyback, obviously, a little bit less robust this quarter. It sounds like just on your comments, it was really just due to the blackouts that you guys had in some of the restrictions there. Clearly, more of a focus on maybe kind of ramping the dividend. I guess, to kind of get to that S&P competitive yield that you're sort of talking about, do you think that's something that could kind of happen by the end of the year? Is that kind of a realistic expectation when you talked about some of the measured dividend growth?","Dan Dinges","Yes. We look at in whole when you think about our buybacks. We had the first quarter and coming into the first quarter, as we're all aware had and strong pricing in December and into the early part of the first quarter, a lot of noise, you had some early warming in coming into the shoulder months and also during the blackout period, we thought it was prudent to just let all that settle in. We were focused on the dividend increase.","We had a discussion with our Board that this is directionally where we want to go. So we felt comfortable with our position on buybacks for the first quarter and laying out this dividend increase. And as we go through the year, we'll continue to have Board discussions on how we want to allocate our capital in the form of dividend increases and buybacks. But our comment and our objective of giving back a minimum 50% of our free cash flow is \u2013 I feel certain is going to occur before year-end.","Leo Mariani","Okay. Thank you for the color.","Dan Dinges","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Mike Kelly of Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Michael Kelly","Great, thanks. Dan, industry consolidation has obviously been the hot topic in space right now and as has been a leading question, but if I look at Cabot, you guys are really kind of a one commodity, and really is a one county levered operator, and I'd love your thoughts on adding diversification to the portfolio and just kind of get your general take on what Cabot's role if any is likely to be kind of a period of increased consolidation. Thanks.","Dan Dinges","Thanks, Mike. It's going to be, I think you'll continue to hear a lot of the chatter and expectations on the M&A side. When we look at our assets and where \u2013 how we're located to your point of a single commodity, single basin, single regulatory environment, it's two edge sword. We're there, but we're there with the \u2013 what I think is probably the best natural gas assets in North America. I think our numbers and financials do reflect that.","So looking at what we can deliver with just those assets, manage the risk profile of it being same commodity or same jurisdiction, we're comfortable with that. We're comfortable with how we've been able to manage it and we're comfortable with working through both the regulatory environment and the commodity price expectations that we can still deliver financial results.","And when you look at long-term and assess from a Board level, strategic level, Cabot has always made decisions that are I think beneficial to shareholders to deliver the maximum value and any strategic decision we would make would also take that in consideration. So if it's good for the shareholder, my job one, two and three is to deliver value to the shareholder and if it's good for the shareholder, my job is to evaluate it.","So if it's a strategic, it's strategic. If it's doing what we're doing and that's organic growth, delivering value through dividend increases and buybacks and organic growth with a very clean balance sheet, I think we have one of the best looking companies on a macro level and delivery to shareholders that you can find out there with a high degree and level of consistency on delivery. So we're happy with the cards we have and again, if there is significant value enhancement in any other direction, then I'm paid to look at it.","Michael Kelly","Great. Appreciate the color. Shifting gears a little bit. Q1, the differential, it's great to see that narrow fairly significantly. Just wanted to get your thoughts on how you see that differential trending throughout the rest of 2019 and say maybe even color on the differentials as you head into 2020 and beyond? Thanks.","Dan Dinges","Yes. Thanks Mike. And I'll let Jeff handle that.","Jeffrey Hutton","Good morning, Mike. Yes, the differentials were what we expected in Q1 after Atlantic Sunrise ramped up [indiscernible] basin demand projects came on, so we certainly enjoyed a good Q1. Looking out at Q2 and more short-term maybe the balance of the year, basis has widened a little bit. We did expect a little more volatility in the shoulder months and we're seeing it right now. I think the same volatility applies in the NYMEX world as well. So we do expect some ups and downs.","Looking out beyond that, it's still encouraging. They're way better and way tighter than what we experienced in 2016, 2017 and 2018. So we're pleased with the trend and I think it's here to stay. And quite frankly, as we build more in-basin demand projects and others do as well. And we see the production not necessarily decline, but certainly the growth moderate, our expectations are, we're here to stay with these type differentials.","Michael Kelly","Great to hear. Appreciate the color guys.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade","Good morning, Dan to you and your whole team there. I wonder if you could give us a little bit more insight or detail, it makes sense to me on your blackout periods, it makes sense that with year-end reporting that a lot of the early part of the year is going be blacked out, but what's it look like, or I guess, 2Q, the four-part, 2Q for you?","Dan Dinges","As far as blackouts concerned?","Charles Meade","Right.","Dan Dinges","Well, we have a consistent parameters leading up into our year-end numbers and our quarterly release and as we gather the numbers, we provide notice to all of the, as you put it insider personnel, including the Board, a bandwidth that's conservative early and we allow for a few days for dissemination of the data post release to \u2013 in the blackout. So second quarter is going to be open next week some time and will be free to do what we want to do at that period of time.","Charles Meade","Got it. So I guess where I'm going is the majority of this three-month window is going to be open to you, which is different from 1Q and that's the message you were trying to give us?","Dan Dinges","Yes, exactly.","Charles Meade","Got it. And then a second question, you and this thing, just go back to the comment you made in your prepared comments about what you're seeing, or what your expectations are from Marcellus for kind of play-wide growth and ditto in the Haynesville, so it seems from my point of view that most operators up in the Marcellus, are I guess holding rank in the sense that they're not seeing a breakout in activity and people going back to tout spending, but could you confirm if you're \u2013 what you're seeing if that's similar and maybe elaborate on how you expect that to progress through the year?","Dan Dinges","We have \u2013 our group up there monitors the equipment activity, rigs, frac crews and we get a fairly good feel for, and particularly in the six county area that we focus in, like fairly good level of expectation, the number of completions that would be coming on.","So our comments are with the benefit of that information and we certainly feel comfortable and agree with your comment that there is some rationalization going on by the industry. And I think that is prudent and I think it will continue. Particularly when you look at the shoulder months that we see, you've seen a fairly good and quick fall off because of the early weather conditions and that certainly has a bearing on capital allocation and intensity of capital allocated.","We also come into this period of the season with maintenance that affects production profiles and forecast, which certainly affects our second quarter numbers a little bit also. So I don't, we're just \u2013 we think there will be that rationalization and some of the equipment count indicates that also.","Charles Meade","Thanks for that added color Dan.","Dan Dinges","Yes. Thanks, Charles.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","Thank you. Good morning.","Dan Dinges","Hello, Brian. ","Brian Singer","Can you or Jeff give us the latest update on the midstream chalkboard, any local demand projects or pipelines out of the region that are moving earlier, later added or subtracted from the schedule?","Dan Dinges","Yes. I\u2019ll turn that to Jeff.","Jeffrey Hutton","Hi. Good morning, Brian. I guess, two areas on in-basin demand. Obviously, it's key on our radar. We were out there looking very, very hard at a number of different things. Nothing to announce today of course, but I would add that we were also being very maybe selective in our approach. We want to find the right project, the right scale, timing. We also want to find the right project for the community, and there is a lot of factors going into it, but we are looking around. We have a lot of leads and lot of prospects. I'll kind of leave it at that.","But I might add that others are going at it as well and in the six-county area up there, I think there's been something like 1.4 Bcf of in-basin demand added in the last year and a half, of course, a lot of that was power growth and we are continuing to get calls about additional projects up there, but on the power side, but we'll see how those play out.","In terms of infrastructure, I'll just talk about why these staff to begin with. Publicly you all will see a filing notice a FERC problem in June on the project, we've completed pre-filing, completed open houses to the projects moving along and see nothing at this point to move us away from November 20, 21 in-service on that project.","Talk a little bit about PennEast, I think publicly they have said that they will submit their DEP permit to New Jersey sometime in June. I think they also have said administratively they are complete in Pennsylvania. So that's good. So we'll see how the DEP and their 401 is treated once it's submitted. Also it could be anywhere from six months to a year and I believe they've stated they'll start construction as soon as they get that final permit. That's about it on the projects out at this point.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you. And my follow-up Dan is that the dividend increase is certainly notable here, what are the key areas of focus for you, management and the Board, as you try to go through the year and figure out how much more relative to the 50% minimum you would expect to return cash to shareholders. What do you see as the potential range and then the key other areas of competition for cash?","Dan Dinges","Well, the biggest competition for cash is Scott. He wants to maybe keep that payoff all that debt.","Scott Schroeder","Yes.","Dan Dinges","But kidding aside, we evaluate the different process that can be employed in dividend management. There are \u2013 and buybacks. There are some that says go ahead and get it ratchet up to the level that you would want it to be. And from a council standpoint, our third-party perspective, it seems to be a 2% yield on dividend seems to be the floor when it comes to evaluating the broader market and on the buybacks there is the back and forth between opportunistic and just putting in a consistent program of buybacks and what is the most effective process to employ in doing that.","So when we have that discussion at our Board at this point in time and again it \u2013 we've had free cash flow the last three years. We are now moving into a clearer picture with just Marcellus as our asset, our predictability with again was just last October with the commissioning of the Atlantic Sunrise, the certainty of the commodity space and where we think the landing point is going to be, the differences and differential in the Northeast area, we wanted to measure out.","And so with that comfort and a clear path for a over a decade of being able to deliver free cash flow, I just think and the Board thinks at this point in time though maybe conservative that representing delivery of 50% of our cash flow in broad terms, including dividends and share buybacks is a messaging to the street that we're going to do it, but we also say that we will give back possibly more than that.","And we're comfortable right now taking a gradual step up in the dividend increase. And we're comfortable right now just having a opportunistic messaging on buybacks. Could that change in the future? Sure, it could, because we talk about it every Board meeting. A little bit long-winded Brian, I don't know if that answers you specifically, but we do consider all aspects of how we give back capital.","Brian Singer","That is helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Holly Stewart of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Holly Stewart","Good morning, gentlemen.","Dan Dinges","Hi, Holly.","Holly Stewart","Dan, maybe the first one just, I know you've provided your kind of key forecasted financial metrics at different pricing, but any updated thoughts around your activity levels, should strip move substantially below this kind of $2.75 level and obviously recognizing different tools are substantially better than they have been when we were at sort of similarly depressed NYMEX prices?","Dan Dinges","Yes. We have bandwidth of $2.50 to $3.00 and if it moves substantially below our bandwidth as an average for the year at any point during the year, we're not going to have a knee-jerk reaction to our capital allocation, we'll continue to look at the macro and make some projections on where we think the strip is going to go, but you need to keep in mind that we deliver significant amount of earnings and return to the shareholders even below our $2.50 low end that we've used for 2019.","I understand the metrics and I understand the cost and I understand the return from our peer group out there and I know that if Cabot gets stressed in any particular way, I think there's going to be a self-correcting mechanism because Cabot can make money below $2, but I'm fairly confident with my knowledge that there is not going to be a lot of money made below $2 and I think it's going to have an impact on the macro environment.","Holly Stewart","Yes, understood. And then maybe just one for Jeff on Atlantic Sunrise. I mean, Jeff, I know we've talked about your equity investment there and you'd previously mentioned looking to see that final project kind of move forward on Atlantic Sunrise. So maybe any updated thoughts on you're divesting of that equity investment?","Scott Schroeder","Holly, this is Scott. As we said when we invested both in Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise, our motivation was to have a seat at the table as part of the decision-making process and that served us well, obviously, with one very positive result and one still yet to be determined, but long-term for the Company, they're not going to be either pipeline or it's going to be part of our assets going forward.","Look we continue to kind of monitor the marketplace and when we feel it's right, we'll explore the opportunity to sell that asset. So right now, more to come. We're just kind of assessing that at this time.","Holly Stewart","Great. Thanks Scott.","Operator","And our next today comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning. Congratulations on the strong quarter.","Dan Dinges","Thank you.","Jeffrey Campbell","My first question was just, it looked like that the first quarter 2019 free cash generation was greater than would have been expected just looking at the nat gas price relationships that you've got on Slide 10. I was wondering if it was that extra boost from the very narrow differentials that you enjoyed in the quarter or was this something else?","Dan Dinges","It was a combination of both, it ceded our realized price expectations and we did see the significant narrowing in the differential, it was combo.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. Thanks. And another kind of higher level question. When Cabot is asked about M&A or exploration, it seems like the assumption is always that it would be about oil and be in other basins. I was just wondering if you ever look for other dry gas opportunities within Appalachia and I realize your Lower Marcellus acreage is clearly at best, but there are some other dry gas areas in Northeast PA that are starting to show dramatic improvements. So I wondered if that's something you keep an eye on.","Dan Dinges","Yes, we monitor all the activity up there and we do keep an eye on it. If from a decision standpoint and how we monitor or consider capital allocation or strategic opportunity, we look at what the financial returns would be of any investment we've made at agnostic, quite frankly, to the commodity. If we feel like we can deliver significantly more of the same then if it comes through natural gas asset or oil asset, we're indifferent.","The benefit, if you do get out of basins it mitigates the single commodity. If you do also get out of a basin it would probably be an oil consideration also which also is not only the commodity differential, but it is also out of the jurisdictional confines of PA. So we look at both, but one, two and three is what deliveries of the financial metrics would occur if we did anything.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Hall","Thanks. Good morning. Solid quarter.","Dan Dinges","Hey, Michael.","Michael Hall","I was just curious maybe if you could talk a little bit about hedging philosophy and just kind of how you guys are thinking about that as you keep progressing forward on the payout strategy and the path you've laid out? How you guys thinking about hedging and how might that evolve over time?","Dan Dinges","So we went into the 2019 with virtually no hedges and we ramped up as we have currently in where we stand. We felt like that was inflection point. The market responded to some of the weather that we had and we took advantage of some of that. Obviously, prefer offensive hedges prior to the defensive hedges.","We will be opportunistic, and we will lock in what deliverables that we have \u2013 have promised if in fact the market would provide that to us. The runway on some of the hedge is somewhat limited by just the depth of it. You can go out there a good ways, but it's not necessarily always at the price point that we would like to see.","So if there is not a lot of depth and then it limits our participation, but if we do see numbers that we appreciate and it helps where we think the macro market will go, and it improves our line in that regard, then we continue to layer in that opportunity to mitigate.","Michael Hall","Okay. That makes sense. I mean is there a kind of minimum level of hedge that you guys are targeting over time in these kind of bias towards hedging on a differential versus at NYMEX or any additional thoughts on that?","Dan Dinges","Well, we look at it every way, Michael, on how we might place those hedges and where we think the opportunities would come and certainly now with a little bit different index points that we reach today then we have that added flexibility. There's no minimum position that we try to get to. If the market is low and we haven't achieved a level of hedging on our books, we're not going to, because we set a minimum. We're not going to try to achieve a minimum.","If in fact though back to my point, if it looks like that we can improve our lot from our forecast and the market would give that to us, then we are going to be active in the hedge market and the same holds true, we really have no minimum that we'd like to get to and we have no maximum that we would be prepared to get to also. If we see an opportunity to lock in the majority of our volumes under hedge we would do that.","Michael Hall","That makes sense. And then I was also curious just on the operational side, as you kind of look at the asset quarter-to-quarter, across the year. How do you think about downtime relative to like well maybe like maximum potential productive capacity of the completed wells that would look like?","What's that that kind of running on average, as you think about things like offset, well shut-ins, you mentioned maintenance on pipelines, things along those lines, how should we think about kind of downtime assumptions as we build things out?","Dan Dinges","Well, we build into our forecast a percentage of downtime and as a roundabout number, say 10% and that downtime though does include some of the known maintenance scheduling that Jeff provides through the pipelines that will be incurred and dates are set for preventive maintenance and pegging operations or whatever the case might be. So we incorporate that into our sales forecast, if that answers your question.","Michael Hall","Yes, that does and I'm assuming that also if things like offset, well shut-ins, I mean if it's 10% overall, how much is like known scheduled maintenance versus just kind of a buffer for potential operational deltas, that make sense?","Dan Dinges","Yes. We have \u2013 our historic look of the offsets and effects on offset wells are the timing that we might shut-in an offset well during a fracking operations, we take that into consideration.","Michael Hall","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Dan Dinges","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from David Deckelbaum of Cowen. Please go ahead.","David Deckelbaum","Good morning, Dan, Scott, and Matt. Thanks for taking my questions.","Dan Dinges","Hi, David. Thanks.","David Deckelbaum","Just that, I mean maybe a little bit more in the minutia, but in prior plans you did allow for some well cost inflation over time. How do you see that progressing now through the balance of this year going into next year? And I guess, as you think about your footage costs on just a \u2013 even benefiting from longer laterals. How long do you see that progressing for and where you could keep that footage costs sort of flattish here?","Dan Dinges","Yes. We anticipate between now and the end of the year, a relatively flat service cost. Majority of our costs as we mentioned before David are tied up in annual contracts. Well, both the biggest components rig and pumping services. So we expect fairly flattish cost.","We continue to try to increase our lateral lengths based on the geology, geography out there and we'll continue to do that. We kind of like the zipcode we're at from an efficiency standpoint and \u2013 but we do continue to try to squeeze out everything we can, if it feels the guys up there in the North region feel like that their process and all the different, not only the operational progress that we've made in the past and learning we've had in the past. But any new ideas that they have out there, which we do, and our trying several right now that's not ready for prime time. We'll implement and hopefully, we can continue to gain the efficiencies that we've been successful in doing in the past.","David Deckelbaum","I appreciate that. And you guys sort of reaffirms the differential guidance for the year. Do you still sort of see that or use that as your base case going into 2020 or as you look at some of the in-basin demand projects or other efforts to kind of reduce some of the \u2013 or relieve some of the impact around Leidy, how you see that differential shaping up for you at the corporate level going into 2020?","Dan Dinges","Yes. We have given our guidance and feel like going into 2020, we were going to be in a similar area at least with our expectations today in the similar area and it ties back to Jeff's comment about some of the conversations that we have and are having on in-basin demand projects, it also ties into what we think others are having in-basin demand projects and the overall macro position on equipment and what we anticipate will be strong rationalization by the operators up in that neck of the woods. We do anticipate the differentials to stay in the same range that we are today.","David Deckelbaum","Appreciate the responses, Dan. Best of luck.","Dan Dinges","Thanks, David.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Kashy Harrison of Simmons Energy. Please go ahead.","Kashy Harrison","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking my question.","Dan Dinges","You bet.","Kashy Harrison","So just one, quick one for me, Dan, earlier you highlighted your expectation for a slowdown in both Pennsylvania and the Haynesville and you talked about what gives you confidence that Appalachia is slowing down, but I was just wondering if you share some more color on what gives you confidence that the Haynesville might be slowing down as well.","Dan Dinges","Well, when you look at it at approximately 10.5 or so 10 Bcf a day at this point in time and in PA, we look at the level of equipment activity out there and the Haynesville area as you're well aware that the majority of the operators there right now are private operators and the activity driven through the private sector.","And I think the idea of continued allocation and particularly if you get a soft spot into the strip and you get reduction in the natural gas price as we're seeing right now, it would be my bet and our bet that from a private operator allocation perspective that a continued ongoing contribution at the levels that they had seen going into the end of 2018 and ramping up with several objectives in mind whether it would be to increase production because of anticipation of higher commodity price or increasing production with the idea of IPOs opening up.","I think that was an activity driver and could still be an activity driver. But in that combination, I do think there is a likelihood that there will be a little bit less activity as we move forward at the levels that it's at right now.","Kashy Harrison","That makes sense. That was it from me. Congrats on a solid quarter.","Dan Dinges","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Jane Trotsenko of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jane Trotsenko","Good morning. I have a question for Jeff. Atlantic Sunrise is obviously running full. I'm curious how much spare capacity do you see available on Millennium and Tennessee pipelines?","Jeffrey Hutton","Okay. Well, it obviously it varies quite a bit and \u2013 but from a high level, we added the in-basin demand kind of offset any kind of production growth over the last couple of years in Northeast PA and you take a look at some of the Southwest PA volumes that are now headed out on Rover and Nexus and some of the Columbia XPress projects and other new projects and you take a look at Sunrise and the 1.7 Bcf, that was probably removed the majority from Transco and from Tennessee and a little bit from Millennium.","And then look at some of the new demand that Millennium added new competitive power plant in New York. It all adds up to spare capacity on the interstates, putting a definitive number on it is difficult because we believe there were spare capacity in these pipes before anything I just mentioned. So it is a moving number, but 2 Bcf to 3 Bcf a day of spare capacity is, is not out of the ballpark.","Jane Trotsenko","That's exceptionally helpful. I'm curious how much appetite does Cabot have to grow production in basin, given the numbers that you have just mentioned?","Jeffrey Hutton","While, we're all looking at each other who is going to answer that, but I think one of the things that when you look back even six months ago, right at the time of Atlantic Sunrise coming on and you picked up on the fact that a lot of capacity was vacated to fill that obligation and rightfully so for better price points.","We, Cabot did in February come out with a little bit lower of guidance both on the capital side and on the production side because our motivation is simply not \u2013 and the market's motivation is not to chase growth. It's more of a moderated growth. Obviously in 2019, Cabot has outsized growth just because of the timing of that sale of those new projects, but a more moderate growth profile going into the future is what \u2013 is Cabot's plan at this point in time.","We will defend market shares. We've said before, if we see the industry starting to backfill those in any great way. But right now as an earlier question indicated everybody's kind of sitting, has a very disciplined growth plan in front of them either to hold certain volumes flat and grow other places. There is no macro push or push from the peers for us to change our growth profile in any way at this point in time and it reinforces our discipline in our capital allocation at this point.","Jane Trotsenko","This is very good answer. The reason why I'm asking is, we obviously have backwardation in the forward curve pricing, right. And then we have production growth that needs to offset that backwardation. In the forward curve pricing very often what we see is that the earnings trajectory is a kind of flattish as a result of this backwardation and forward curve pricing.","I'm just curious if you guys are thinking in terms of growing earnings trajectory over the following years, or maybe just keeping production more moderate and offsetting the backwardation in the forward curve pricing?","Dan Dinges","We plan on, as Scott said, we plan on having a measured growth on organic basis. We plan on augmenting growth on a per share basis with our return of capital to shareholders and from a program perspective and confidence level what we deliver, we feel like that measured growth and a capital allocation program that allows for one that particular growth and the amount of cash flow generation to that yield perspective, which is in 2019, we anticipate around 6%.","We think that is a good landing point at this stage and with the additional give back to shareholders, we think that we will be able to attract incremental dollars from outside of a traditional energy investor and compete with the broader market. So from a design standpoint without having issues with our \u2013 and uncertainty attached to our program.","Keep in mind. We're doing this with three rigs and two frac crews. So the complications, the operation is very, very low and our results are very consistent. So we feel good about that. How we manage this financial side is along the lines that we've discussed and we'll continue to be able to do that again into the next decade.","Jane Trotsenko","Got it. That's it from me. Thank you so much.","Dan Dinges","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dinges for any final remarks.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Rocco, and thank you for your interest in Cabot this morning and as a closing comment. The good news, assuming you like disciplined capital allocation, earnings and production growth, free cash flow, share buyback, increased dividends, if you like all that, the good news is that you can expect more of the same from Cabot in the future. So thanks again and look forward to the visit next quarter.","Operator","And thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded. We thank you all for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note, today\u2019s event is being recorded.","And at this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO. Sir, please go ahead.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Jamie, and good morning to all. Appreciate you joining us for Cabot's fourth quarter full year 2017 call. With me today are the members of the executive management. I would first like to highlight that on this mornings call we will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Also, some of our comments may reference non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements, and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.","On this call, this morning our plan is to discuss the highlights from our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results, followed by an update on our 2018 budget as well as an update on the company\u2019s current three-year plan. For the fourth quarter, Cabot generated adjusted net income of $59 million or $0.13 per share, an increase of over 10 times relative to the fourth quarter of 2016.","Daily equivalent production increased by 5% relative to the prior year comparable quarter on a divestiture adjusted basis, which reflects the impact of the West Virginia divestiture that closed during the third quarter. Production increased 8% over the prior year comparable quarter. I would also highlight that the fourth quarter represents the seventh consecutive quarter in which Cabot has generated positive free cash flow.","For the full-year 2017, Cabot generated adjusted net income of $245 million or $0.53 per share, compared to a $0.97 million adjusted net loss in 2016. The significant increase in earnings was primarily driven by a 10% year-over-year increase in daily equivalent production, a 36% and 29% year-over-year increase in realized natural gas and crude oil prices, respectively; and a 7% year-over-year improvement in operating expenses per unit of production.","In addition to delivering another year-over-year improvement in our unit cost we also demonstrated our continued focus on cost control in our capital program, highlighted by our capital expenditures for the year coming in 3% below our full year guidance.","During the year, Cabot generated $155 million of free cash flow marking the second consecutive year of positive free cash flow generation. Keeping with our commitment to return an increasing amount of capital to shareholders the company repurchased 5 million shares during the year for a total of 124 million and paid out 79 million in dividends for a total return of capital of 203 million or 21% of our discretionary cash flow.","Our return on capital employed for the year, it increased by over 800 basis points to 7.3%, which is in-line with our weighted average cost of capital. If you were to calculate capital employed net of cash as many of our peers do ROCE increases another 100 basis points to 8.3% for the year. This morning we also announced our year-end proved reserves, which increased by 13% year-over-year.","Our total company all-sources finding and development costs were $0.35 per Mcfe, which included the impact of the soon to be divested Eagle Ford assets. Assuming the sale of the Eagle Ford closes as expected next week, our forward - our go forward finding cost will be primarily related to our Marcellus asset, which recorded all-sources finding and development cost of $0.22 per Mcfe in 2017, as well as an FNB cost associated with our ongoing exploration program.","On the strategic front, during the year, we announced the divestiture of our lower return non-core assets as mentioned West Virginia, and also East Texas and the Eagle Ford for a combined proceeds of approximately $840 million positioning us as a pure-play Marcellus company that offers pure leading production and reserve growth for debt-adjusted share, return on capital employed, free cash flow generation, return of capital, and one of the strongest balance sheet in the industry with a net debt-to-EBITDAX ratio of one-time and approximately $2.2 billion of liquidity, which will be further enhanced upon closing of the Eagle Ford transaction. This strong financial position provides us financial flexibility to reinvest in the business and increase our return of cash to shareholders throughout the natural gas price cycle.","Now on the distribution outlook, as it relates to increasing our return of capital to shareholders, this morning, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to 30 million shares or 6.5% of our current outstanding shares. At yesterday's closing price, this would imply the potential to return approximately $720 million of capital through repurchases.","As we have stated in the past, we plan to be opportunistic in our share repurchase activity as we look to exploit any material disconnect between our market valuation in our view of the company's intrinsic value. We have been in and earnings-related blackout period since year-end. However, our year-to-date decline in share price represents one of the aforementioned disconnects giving that our fundamental view of Cabot's intrinsic value has not changed.","On the dividend front, we know that Cabot has increased its dividend twice in the last 10 months. Our run rate dividend payments for 2018 are expected to be 40% higher than 2017. We will remain fully committed to delivering sustained dividend growth over the upcoming years as this is one of our top priorities for capital allocation.","Now moving a couple of comments on our operating plan, this morning's release we reaffirmed our 2018 daily production growth guidance at a range of 10% to 15% or 18% to 23% on a divestiture adjusted basis. We also refine our capital budget guidance to $950 million consisting of $800 million in the Marcellus, 75 million in our exploration plays, and 75 million for pipeline investments in Atlantic Sunrise, and other corporate capital expenditures.","We plan to operate three rigs and utilize two completion crews in the Marcellus during 2018. Our Marcellus program in 2018 not only generates strong double-digit growth in 2018, but also positions Cabot for an even higher growth in 2019, given our production growth in 2018 is waited towards the second half of the year, due to the mid-year in service stage for our three primary infrastructure projects.","In the presentation posted to the website this morning, we provided our expectations for sequential quarterly production growth throughout the year highlighting the robust growth in our exit to exit production rate. On the exploration front, we are still targeting 75 million of capital to initially test these areas this year. However, given that one of the areas is further behind in testing than the other, we will likely not have an incremental update to share until the third quarter call, and I will be able to fully update hopefully at that time.","I stand by that we will remain disciplined with our capital allocation to exploration and methodically in our being methodical in our testing these concepts to determine if they have the attributes that can create long-term value for our shareholders, which is no easy task given that we have set high hurdles internally for these projects in this effort. Based on a $2.75 NYMEX assumption for the year, which is below the current strip, we expect to execute on a program that would deliver the following highlights.","Double-digit return on capital employed, double-digit growth in production, and reserves per debt adjusted share, positive free cash flow of approximately $180 million, a delivering of the balance sheet to below a one-time net debt-to-EBITDA, and a s significant expansion of available cash on hand, which provides us flexibility to reinvest in returns focused growth and increase return of cash to shareholders.","Not many companies can deliver at this level, and our commitment to delivering on these metrics is further highlighted by the board's decision to incorporate debt adjusted per share growth and ROCE metrics to our 2018 incentive compensation plan. Common on the infrastructure of critical importance as many are aware, is to deliver on our growth targets for the year is the timing of our upcoming infrastructure projects which we have several significant updates to provide.","First and foremost, our Atlantic Sunrise project continues to make significant progress on all fronts despite a challenging winter in the Northeast, pipeline work including stringing and welding, ditching and backfill, and tie-ins are in full swing as multiple construction crews continued to work extended hours. Last week, Williams reported that they are over 30% complete with the pipeline segment of the project, and over 40% complete with the compressor stations. We continue to target a mid-2018 in-service for the project and look forward to serving our new markets this summer.","Also, of note, the new PennEast project received its FERC certificate approving the pipeline during January of this year. This 1.1 Bcf per day project delivering Northeast Marcellus production to the East Coast is a big part of our future growth and important for Cabot diversity of market and price realizations. We are currently preparing for increased activity around this project, this PennEast, receives its final approval to move forward.","Currently, PennEast is scheduled to begin construction during 2018, and expects to be in-service approximately seven months after construction begins. As most of you are aware, Cabot has been active with two significant in basin projects, the Moxie Freedom power plant, and the Lackawanna Energy Center. Combined these two-state-of-the-art natural gas fire generating facilities will add approximately 400 million cubic foot per day of demand exclusively for Cabot. The Moxie Freedom plant remains on track for June 1, 2018 start-up date, and we will be burning approximately 160 million cubic foot per day.","Regarding the Lackawanna facility, its first train capable of burning 80 million per day, also remains on track for June 2018 in-service with trains two and three scheduled for October 1 and December 1, respectively. These two high-profile local demand projects will provide opportunities for growth and improved price realizations to Cabot's overall portfolio. One additional comment regarding constitution pipeline, after recently receiving an unfavorable ruling from the FERC regarding the New York DEC\u2019s authority under the Clean Water Act, last Monday we filed a request to the FERC to reconsider its decision.","Additionally, last month we petitioned the US Supreme Court to review the judgement of the US Court of Appeals for the second circuit. We believe these latest filings will shed additional light on New York's failure to appropriately act on our Section 401 water quality certification. We will continue to update you on our progress. However, our three-year plan does remain intact regardless of the timing of this pipeline.","Our current three-year plan is predicated on the company reaching the 3.7 Bcf per day of gross Marcellus production target that we have outlined in the past in 2020, which is based on our current market share in basin and incremental growth into our new infrastructure projects. In addition, we expect to be able to grow our production base above this level through one or more of the following happenings. Additional sales on currently approved takeaway projects, including Atlantic Sunrise and PennEast, incremental sales of potential future expansion projects, increasing our work in-basin market share, new in-basin demand projects, and future Greenfield takeaway projects.","On a three-year outlook, in-light of our announced divestiture, the Eagle Ford and the recent change to the US tax code we have updated our total company three-year plan through 2020. In the presentation, posted to our website this morning, we have highlighted expected growth in production, earnings, cash flow, and ROCE that Cabot can generate during this three-year period assuming a range of NYMEX prices of 275 to 325. We believe these are reasonable through cycle price assumptions giving our view of supplier demand fundamentals during this period, and also collaborated by the strip and consensus estimate.","Of particular note, is a 20% to 24% divestiture adjusted production CAGR. A range of cumulative after-tax and I might make that note after-tax, companywide free cash flow of 1.6 billion to 2.5 billion, and a range of ROCE that increases to the high teens to low 20% level by 2020. We believe this level of growth, free cash flow and corporate returns are not only best-in-class in the E&P sector, but are also extremely competitive across the broad S&P 500 index, which currently and historically trades at premium valuations to the energy sector.","I would highlight that this plan assumes no contributions from our exploration program in 2019 and 2020, as it remains uncertain as to whether we will allocate any incremental capital to those areas beyond 2018. However, as I mentioned on our third quarter call, if we incurred by initial results in those areas and made the decision to allocate incremental capital beyond this year, we would utilize a portion of cash proceeds from our recent divestitures to fund that incremental spend. However, that also allows us to ploy our current cash on the balance sheet and future operating free cash flow for incremental returns of capital to our shareholders.","Jamie, with that, I\u2019d be happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Michael Glick from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Glick","Hi guys, good morning. Just on the buyback, do you think the program ultimately transitioning from being opportunistic in nature to more of a systematic program? And if so, how would you expect to execute that mechanically?","Dan Dinges","Couple of things on the buyback. We\u2019ve had some questions on timing and keep in mind our evolution in where we are right now. In the past, we\u2019ve had authorizations and the execution of that authorization was constrained if you will, but just available cash and the plough back into our operations side of the business. In-light where we are right now with the growth of our free cash flow estimates and our program is still growing in production and generating the levels of free cash.","We do anticipate and I'm not going to give you a sideboard on the time consideration, but we do anticipate fully executing on this authorization that we have in a timely fashion. But when you look at the buyback program and it being opportunistic today, it\u2019s opportunistic today, but as we get further into our growth mode of three, seven, or in greater production, and looking at the entire macro market it could go into a combination with continuing our efforts on any projects that would be operational in nature to create value, it certainly could be in conjunction with more of a systematic buyback program also, because we are going to generate a significant amount of free cash.","Michael Glick","Got it. And then I noticed you guys put some basic hedges on, could you talk about liquidity in those markets and how that\u2019s changed of late, and maybe how you're thinking about hedging basis strategically going forward?","Dan Dinges","I would pass the baton to Jeff.","Jeffrey Hutton","Michael as you know in December and in early January we had a good strong rally for dominion sale of Leidy, Tennessee, Millennium and also down in non-New York areas. So, we took advantage of that to layer in about 100,000 a day of early strong basis differentials for Leidy. And we're going to continue to look at that. We're looking at summer only and winter is at 18, 19 right now, but again it is when opportunity knocks what would be - we had to do the basis up there.","Michael Glick","Got it. Okay, thank you, guys.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Michael, and I might add that we are in the - about 34% range of 18 hedged at approximately $2.80.","Michael Glick","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead with your question.","Jeffrey Campbell","Good morning and congratulations on the seemingly inexecrable COG machine, I was going to ask two questions, one, the press release said that Gen 5 Completions are going to be on the majority of 2018 wells, why not make it on all of them? What are the considerations?","Dan Dinges","Yes. It\u2019s a good question. Excuse me, in fact when Phil made the presentation to the board the other day, I asked a similar question, but when you look at the Gen 5 and longer laterals that we drill, we are drilling some of these wells out beyond 10,000 feet and with this type of completion in getting out beyond 10,000 feet due to some of the friction issues that raises the risk profile a little bit beyond 10,000 feet for Gen 5 Completion, those levels that are the completions and back stages that out beyond 10,000 feet. We are actually going to our Gen 4 Completion and then once we bring in the same well bore it will come back to the Frac stages inside of 10,000 feet, we go to the Gen 5.","Jeffrey Campbell","That\u2019s interesting color, and I assume this is all generated by lease geometry and trying to capture the most resources that you can from the longest well alright?","Dan Dinges","Absolutely. We know the efficiency, the long laterals, but we do have some constraints on the geometry of some of the units out there due to geographies and we do our best to be able to continue with the lateral length extensions.","Jeffrey Campbell","All right. My other question is likely for Jeff. Although, it\u2019s a smaller portion of the growth PennEast, it is part of the growth to 3.7 Bcf per day and it\u2019s getting a lot of resistance in New Jersey, I read recently it is now resorting to eminent domain to conduct surveys there. With all this going on, do you still see 2019 as a realistic and service year for the pipeline?","Dan Dinges","And I\u2019ll pass that to Jeff in one second, I just want to make a comment on the eminent domain. Every pipeline that we have laid out there for the most part and in other places has a component of eminent domain to be able to steer the last few sites that have holdouts. Holdouts are either those that resist or holdout are those that are just looking for a better deal, but I\u2019ll let Jeff talk about his expectations for commissioning.","Jeffrey Hutton","Yes Jeffrey. We watch it very closely of course and as an active shipper and supplier on that pipe, we have been in discussion with the owners and the shippers on the markets associated with pennies PennEast trying to understand the timeline and the - more importantly the timing of when those utilities will be out searching for new supplies and obviously it will be closer to when there is more clarity on the in-service, but Dan is correct, the last remaining land issues are generally solved after the FERK certificate has been issued and that\u2019s what has happened in January. ","I'm sure PennEast is looking forward to wrapping up the surveys on the last few tracks and getting that survey information to New Jersey and Pennsylvania for the remaining permits. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s going on right now. There has been some news and some resistance by the - some of the environmental groups and there has been some information request by the New Jersey DET as of last week with FERC, but a lot of that is work in progress and yes it slows down the pace, but as a kind of an outsider on this project, but close to it, we are still expecting construction to be 2018, and - but yes it could be later in the year rather than sooner.","Jeffrey Campbell","Okay, thanks for the color. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Venker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Drew Venker","Good morning everyone. I was hoping if you could talk about your approach for the exploration programs if you do conclude there weren't continued spending about how you might approach the next phase of development in 2019 and 2020 whether that would be more delineation drilling in 2019 before you sort of move into development mode or any color you can provide there would be helpful.","Dan Dinges","Our approach at this stage is data gathering to be able to have enough information to determine whether or not the development mode, if we were so inclined to move into development, if in fact that development mode would yield the - and beat our returns that we had laid out with our expectation, and those - that hurdle is not only looking at the per well yields and returns, but certainly looks at the infrastructure necessary to get to that type of full cycle returns and as it also fit, our model and design of continuing with a higher return program that not only has growth, but also would allow for incremental capital to be created through this effort to return cash to shareholders.","So. we're not going to - when we get the adequate data to be able to make that call, I think it\u2019s going to come down to a fairly bright line on, do we move forward with the project or do we monetize what we have and go about our business. I don't think and I would be shocked and I would hope that majority of the shareholders that know Cabot now we make decisions that they would be equally surprised if in fact we let this thing drag on and leak out to a large capital outlay with uncertainty on what our plans are moving forward.","So, I don't anticipate that happening, I do anticipate being able to get the data with the outlays that we\u2019re making and again for a couple of exploratory areas making in an outlay for the multibillion dollar company and $75 million for the opportunity to achieve what we have in mind as success, I think is a reasonable risk profile.","Drew Venker","Okay, thanks for the color Dan and still think you will be on track to make call on whether you should move forward or not later this year?","Dan Dinges","Yes, I do Drew.","Drew Venker","Okay. That's all I have. Thanks guys.","Dan Dinges","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Holly Stewart from Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead with your question.","Holly Stewart","Good morning gentlemen.","Dan Dinges","Hi Holly.","Holly Stewart","How's it going. Maybe the first one I think probably for Scott, just trying to think through reconciling the cumulative free cash flow until maybe specifically the question is what were the taxes assumed in the previous kind of cumulative free cash flow guidance that you were going to pay?","Scott Schroeder","Holly I'm going to let Matt handle that because he has walked in it.","Matt Kerin","Hi, Holly it is Matt Kerin. I think the biggest thing to highlight on that front is when we provided that three-year cumulative outlook in October. We were showing that on a pre-tax basis because we weren't really sure on what was going on with Eagle Ford at the time, as well as with tax reform, now that we have been able to sharpen the pencil a bit more, I think what has been really encouraging as a result of the tax rate coming down, as well as AMT going away whereas the October forecast would have assumed about 450 million cumulative current tax leakage during the three-year plan.","We are now talking about maybe only 50 million of current taxes during that period and that\u2019s net of obvious refunds that we will get during the period. So, that\u2019s an incremental call it 400 million of after-tax free cash flow, relative to what we were looking at back in October.","Holly Stewart","Got it, perfect. And that AMT is it refundable for 2018 or are you all expecting that in 2018?","Matt Kerin","No. The reality is that we won't get until we file our cash return in the subsequent year.","Holly Stewart","Okay. And then maybe just as my follow-up, you know Dan it seems activity levels are pretty much locked in just kind of given all the infrastructure additions that are coming online, but how do you think about that just kind of given normal moment in commodity prices that we see throughout the year?","Dan Dinges","I mean from a program consideration and allocation of capital in 2018?","Holly Stewart","Yes, sir.","Dan Dinges","We feel very good about our budget. I think you saw in 2017, how close we were to our expected expenditures and I feel equally confident in 2018 about our program. The Marcellus is a consistent consolidated block up there. We use the service providers of drill side and the completion side that we have had in the recent past. And with our annual contract in locked in for the most part we\u2019re 85% to 90% locked in on service cost that - and that is off of that understanding that is how we build this 2018 program.","So, the additional 10% to 15% that did lock in annually is not that big cost, it\u2019s the ancillary providers that we haven't locked in annual contracts, but we think with our not only our component of that being GDS, our wholly-owned subsidiary that manages a lot of our business up there. We think also the other providers will be within the range that we budgeted.","Holly Stewart","That's great. Thanks guys.","Dan Dinges","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Singer","Thank you, good morning.","Dan Dinges","Hi, Brian.","Brian Singer","I wanted to follow-up on the comments that you made on potential upside to your guidance or at least extension of growth longer term, you highlighted for opportunities future expansion projects in-basin market share, I think new basin demand and some greenfield takeaway, maybe we could start with the in-basin market share, can you just talk to how you make your decision on whether you would want to increase in-basin market share and any rate of return or local price hurdles that that would entail?","Dan Dinges","Yes. I will just pass it over to Jeff. He does this day-in and day-out and that additional capacity that goes beyond the power plants and the PennEast and the Atlantic sunrise has been on Jeff's radar for over a year. So, he's working diligently every day to accomplish the future.","Jeffrey Hutton","Okay, Brian. So, the first part of your question really has to do with in-basin pipe that exists today. Our expectations here in the next six months is we are going to see quite a bit of falling gas leave some of the existing pipes, particularly Tennessee and Transco as some of the producer shippers up there get ready for Atlantic Sunrise and also as we look down the road with PennEast. So, there is going to be some freed-up capacity on space on the existing pipes going forward, and quite frankly we\u2019re going to be a big part of that initially. So, market share in the basin up there, near term and long term it certainly is a growth wagon for us.","Brian Singer","Got it. So, should we expect if local prices do improve or differentials narrow that you would take that opportunity to potentially become more active in your activity and ultimately in your production?","Jeffrey Hutton","Well Brian it goes hand-in-hand. So, we will watch the regional prices up there and we will look at our opportunities with Sunrise and PennEast and given that we are also looking at additional opportunities on Atlantic Sunrise and we are comparing those with how we see the market shaping up in-basin and we\u2019re also looking at the opportunities we have off the gathering system with new businesses and the industry and the opportunities there. So, it all goes hand-in-hand, but I think as you see differentials have tightened in Northeast PA that we will take advantage of that.","Brian Singer","And as a little bit of my follow-up as well, the latter two points on the new in-basin demand in the future Greenfield takeaway projects, we are within the basin, are you seeing the greatest opportunity for new demand projects is it more power plants in Pennsylvania or is it somewhere else regionally? And then where geographically do you think the next Greenfield takeaway goes?","Jeffrey Hutton","Both of those questions have to do with ongoing projects that we are looking at and being in a very competitive market we\u2019re not quite there on disclosing where we think the next Greenfield ought to go, and exactly whom we are talking with and what type of industry that we are talking with on connecting the new industry to the gathering system, but I will say, I don't think it\u2019s going to be power generation in that three, four accounting area. I think we\u2019ve reached a good solid level of new power growth there. ","I think the power generation will continue to be a good demand component, may be more in the mid-Atlantic states and maybe along the coast, but in-basin there is, we're talking to, and I think we\u2019ve talked about this on the call, previously a number of different opportunities and we\u2019re getting closer on some and they are not big scale, but they are additive in nature.","Dan Dinges","One of the real unique ideas that we have and hadn't got a lot of traction is to lay a pipeline right across the offense line from Pennsylvania into New York and source all those fuel oil heating facilities that are up there in that part of the country with cleaner burning natural gas.","Brian Singer","Great, thank you. I would ask a fifth question and on what the interest level is on the other side of the board room, maybe I will take that one off-line.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Kistler from Piper Jaffray. Please get our head with your question.","Dave Kistler","Good morning guys, thank you. Real quickly, and not to understate the success that you have seen from the Gen 5 Completions you guys have consistently been improving the rate of returns on these wells through better completions et cetera, can you talk about kind of what you're thinking about as far as potentially Gen 6, what you can tweak or we kind of - at a maximum level of kind of IRR per well at this juncture?","Dan Dinges","Well, each call I think Dave we\u2019ve had a question about where do you reach maximum efficiencies and you are going to look historic and see the progress that\u2019s been made and Gen 5, Gen 6 is one of those efforts that we are trying to create incremental gains and efficiency. And that gain and efficiency comes really in two ways. One, it\u2019s in cost, you can gain a better return profile or you can gain a better profile in more gas coming out of the ground at a quicker rate, or you can do both. Right now, the balance between our decision in Gen 5 and Gen 6 was that in looking at now the cost side, and keeping in mind we have a very small sample pool for our Gen 6. We only have a few wells that were measuring in reading and trying to determine the level of efficiencies for Gen 6. With that being said, we will continue to monitor what we have done in Gen 6, but right now with the ability to implement Gen 5 we see in the early stage no big difference in Gen 5, Gen 6, but the cost of Gen 5 is, plus or minus 20% more effective than the Gen 6. So, with that and looking at our desire to return cash back to the shareholder we have decided to conserve the cash, allocate into a Gen 5 Completion where we can and deliver superior returns.","Dave Kistler","Makes sense. Appreciate that color. And then maybe switching over to something you talked about last call, where you had mentioned the possibility of curtailing gas in a weaker commodity price environment, can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that, this year given hedges have increased basis hedges are in place et cetera, is that something that\u2019s still on the table and what would be kind of threshold prices realizing that you recover your cost of capital at north of a dollar now [ph]?","Dan Dinges","Well, we\u2019ve always been prudent in rationalizing how we deliver gas into the system and we will continue to be rational about our decision process, I'm not going to set a benchmark of when we think we ought to move gas of the market and keep it in the shareholder's pocket as opposed to giving it away, but if in fact there is such a tentative market out there, we would consider a curtailment and by doing that proportionately across the field respond to the punitive market.","Yes, we can, with our cost structure now, what our finding cost is, what our cost to capital is, we still would receive a return, but I think it\u2019s also important that the rationalization of the market in the form of managing expectations on financial metrics for our shareholder is important to consider also.","Dave Kistler","Great. I appreciate that color and certainly applaud you guys on the capital stewardship, phenomenal.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Dave.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Hall","Thanks, good morning.","Dan Dinges","Hi Michael.","Michael Hall","Hi. I guess maybe just on the topic of allocating capital, can you just discuss a little bit how you evaluate, I guess returning cash to shareholders and or building cash balances relative to potentially consolidating your corner of the Marcellus and what your appetite is there and what sort of opportunities you today?","Dan Dinges","Across the whole spectrum you just mentioned Michael, you know we want to return our cash that we generate back to shareholders and we\u2019re going to continue to do that as I mentioned in my remarks, prioritizing dividends and buy backs. We also think the shareholder appreciates allocation of capital through our operations program assuming it meets the hurdles that allow us to continue delivering cash back and when we evaluate consolidation or the basin impacts or quite frankly anything out there, we\u2019ve always participated in understanding the space whether it\u2019s in a basin that we are in or a basin that we are not.","Looking at all the pitch books that are solid across our desk, we scroll we look at, we understand, and we measure how we perform compared to how our peers perform with those assets that we become more familiar with when we look at all these books. So, to determine whether or not it fits in our portfolio though is still an extremely conservative process and the history that Cabot has displayed in the decisions that we\u2019ve made on being acquisitive has - is all I can say is, that\u2019s the way I am, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve done it now for years and years and years, and even though there is assets out there in the street that many have thought and we were rumored many times for example when the Permian was faulty [ph] that we would be out there buying those assets. ","We didn\u2019t make that decision because I could never get our arms around a full cycle returns for those assets. So, we will continue to look at the future that way. If there is an opportunity that presents itself and the value proposition and consideration is good and it meets with our long-term strategy of delivering cash back with growth to our shareholders we will take a look at it.","Michael Hall","Okay. Understood, yes it seems like there is potential willing sellers in your direct neighborhood there. So, I guess [indiscernible] we will keep an eye on. To take a second on continuing on the inventory team, you guys provided a 35-year inventory life based on 2018 activity in the deck, I'm just curious how that looks on the just lower Marcellus only in-light of to break that out.","Dan Dinges","The lower Marcellus, we go out to almost 20 - pushing latter part of 2020, is where we go out on our decade - the latter part of the decade. Scott has always been there to protect me. Almost to 2030, about we are comfortable with our lower Marcellus position and I might add, and looking at the upper Marcellus we have test scheduled this year for the upper Marcellus with the expectation that we will be completing those upper Marcellus wells with the newer technology, newer unloading, cluster spacing, the whole gambit of our completion recipe that we have been so effective with in the lower Marcellus. We are going to move from the Gen 1, 2 and just a couple of 3\u2019s that we had in the upper Marcellus in the past. We have not had any Gen 4\u2019s, 5\u2019s or 6\u2019s in the upper Marcellus. So, I\u2019m anxious to see what the upper Marcellus will do with the new Completion.","So, and keep in mind even on the older Gen completions, the delivery that we had on a 1000 foot was better than the majority of the Marcellus that we see out there. So, I expect an uptick from what we historically have seen in the upper Marcellus to where we are going.","Michael Hall","Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess, can you just remind us like what the cost savings are in Gen 5 versus Gen 4, you said 20% cost effective versus 6, I am just curious Gen 5 versus 4.","Dan Dinges","Years 5 versus 4, we are in fact about 10% more cost effective on the Gen 5 then we will with Gen 4.","Michael Hall","Great. That's all I have. Thanks guys.","Dan Dinges","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Kelly from Seaport Global. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Kelly","Hi guys, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on Brian Singer's question about the firm sales, firm transport opportunities, and really just wanted to get a sense on the timing and scale of some of these if you could get into it, just also get a sense of we're talking a year from now in the Q4 2018 call for looking at Slide 12 where you lay out all these future opportunities, if that could look significantly different, I guess more advanced where it is now? Thanks.","Dan Dinges","Mike, and I will let Jeff answer that. I will make a comment that - and Jeff can maybe give additional color on the firm transportation side, keep in mind that we did not jump on that firm commitment side as many, many companies did and commit to that structure. We\u2019ve worked around it by advance sales on like Atlantic Sunrise and having a complete tie down of the volumes from delivery into the pipe all the way into the sales point. So, that was one thing we did different and a lot of our gas moves third party firm as opposed to Cabot dedicated firms. So, we\u2019re not in a situation where we have to move gas under firm contracts, but I\u2019ll pass it on to Jeff.","Jeffrey Hutton","Sure, Mike. Maybe just to elaborate on the few answers that we have for Brian. I think you will see some not necessarily announcements of some progress with the Atlantic Sunrise project says we get closer to end service and other producer shippers evaluate their positions and we see a reaction in the marketplace on basis differentials and we get closer to partial and services summer and then full in servers, I think you will see progress buyers around that time period. And actually, the same thing goes for PennEast. The market is there, they are ready, we have got multiple discussions, again getting clarity is important for a gas buyer and certainly important for us to plan our business.","So, I think you will see again progress as we are closer to in-service may be around the time that PennEast gets it's and others perceive with construction, I think that will concept the bar on where we expect to plan in terms of winter sales to these utilities. The end base in activities are ongoing, we\u2019re close on a couple of smaller projects that I can't elaborate on, but as we build that end base in activity it\u2019s going to add up.","I mean, we are currently outside the power plants for probably in the 50,000, 60,000 a day range currently. We are getting ready to gasify small - excuse me up there in Pennsylvania called [indiscernible] and not a big load, but we continue to add customers up there. So, it is going to all add up, I think 2018 will see a lot of progress and towards year-end it could be that we are able to finally get some progress on another niche project with the Greenfield pipe. So, more on that to come. We are still a long way off, but we never stopped looking.","Mike Kelly","Great color, appreciate that. Maybe just, out of curiosity, how big of a project could that pipe to ultimately displays the fuel oil in New York, could you help get a sense of that size?","Dan Dinges","Well since I have put the corn out there, I will let Jeff take it.","Jeffrey Hutton","[Indiscernible] answers.","Dan Dinges","There is a significant amount of fuel oil being used up there though. There is not the ability for that part of the country to utilize natural gas in a dependable manner and they are, from my understanding is certainly from our feet on the ground, a lot of disappointment, not being able to take advantage of something that is right across fence line from a - it is just one of those unfortunate circumstances that we are living with today, but I can tell you this, we're going to continue to fight it, and we\u2019re going to prevail at some point in time.","Mike Kelly","Good deal, appreciate it.","Dan Dinges","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from Keybanc. Please go ahead with your question.","David Deckelbaum","Good morning Dan, Jeff, Scott everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. My question is really Gen 5 or I guess any of the Marcellus type curve, right now you're getting the 4.4 Bcf 2000. I guess in 2018 when more capacity comes online or any point I guess in your long-term plan, it doesn't sound like you are baking in any performance improvement and is it fair to say that we haven't necessarily got the full look at the productivity of these completions, just given a constrained environment and should we expect this expect to see kind of accelerating type curves with more capacity coming online to perhaps show a better productivity uplift and would that begin 2018?","Dan Dinges","Well, again, I kind of made the comment earlier. Historically, we\u2019ve been able to ramp up our expected EUR per thousand, the rates that in the way we bring on the wells Phil and his guys are committed to maximize the EURs in these wells and yes we have been somewhat constrained by how we bring these wells online, but we have worked with Williams extensively to put together what we think is a world-class gathering system and ahead our system out there that gives us the optionality and also allows us to reduce pressures in different parts of the field, and move gas around when need be to take advantage of any disconnect in the market.","So, I think we will see things once we are able to take advantage more proactively of a more versatile market, I think we will be able to see things and measure performance of wells in certain areas of the field differently, then we measure them today, but I just don't have an answer on what the results might be with that additional data. But we are certainly encouraged with the flexibility that water - our gathering system provides us, but also the additional flexibility of moving gas in and out of the basin. And then moving out of the basin cannot be over emphasized on what I think it will do to the, some of the end base and differential issues that we have had in the past.","David Deckelbaum","Okay, certainly, I understand it on the pricing side, but it sounds like testing at least pressure management would be more of like a later 2018 thing, so if there was a change to design that wouldn't really start coming through until 2019 or 2020, I guess is that fair?","Dan Dinges","Yes, and if you look at it little bit differently. You can look at it for example, in the first quarter of 2018, we didn\u2019t quite - we had a little bit of, we haven't have had the volumes in the first half so far or the first quarter of 2018, yet because we have had a couple of large pads that we have been on for a long time. And I'm talking about 10 well type pads. And when you look at that completion of those 10 well type pads we had the cold weather up there in normal winter stuff that slows down, but because we had such a large pad, a lot of Frac stages on that pad, we didn\u2019t turn in line one well so far this quarter. ","And by that measure we still are moving the gas that we need to move and all of that, but in the beginning of the second quarter we\u2019re going to bring on the - in fact two large pads, 15, 20 type of wells in the first, second quarter in April that with the volumes coming out of a geographic area so small, again a couple of 810 well pads, we're not going to bring those wells on full tilt because we adjust, you cannot move them on, but they showed management to your point that Bill and his group deals with is built-in at this point in time.","But I think even the future that is going to be the case because there is a lot of gas coming into our gathering system in one area of one pad site and that has to be managed through the gathering system and that\u2019s some of the effort that\u2019s ongoing by Williams and our gas controllers on how we can manage that and having the additional flexibility how we can know that gas is going to help as we bring on these large volumes. So, it\u2019s the nature of the base and I don't have an exact on the impact, but that is just a definition of what we deal with out there, it\u2019s a high-class problem by the way I think, but nevertheless we deal with it and it does affect us on any short-term snapshot.","David Deckelbaum","All right. Appreciate the responses Dan.","Dan Dinges","Thanks David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Doug Leggate","Well thanks for squeezing me in guys. Just got two quick follow-ups. It may be for Matt first of all on tax, you have given us that 20% to 50% - 25% to 50% deferred type tax assumption in 2020, should we think of that as kind of a normalized range on a maintenance sustaining capital type of number or does it change further beyond on your expectations and I have got a quick follow-up please.","Matt Kerin","Thanks for the question. It\u2019s ultimately going to be depending on realized price and level of capital spending, and a lot of other variables. It\u2019s really depending on what you\u2019re assuming, but I would call it $3 natural gas price holding 3.7 flat, you will actually probably be closer to 75% to call it 85% current. So, it does widen out a little bit. In 2020, you still in some cases depending on the price tag have some benefits of either AMT or NOLs, so 2021 the assumption would be that we've utilized all of our NOLs and monetize all of our AMT.","Doug Leggate","That was pretty clear Matt. Thanks. And I guess my final one is, Dan it is probably for you, but as you step up the buyback and obviously you have laid out the free cash flow for the next several years. You are kind of transitioning to something kind of an immunity you would guess, your free cash flow type of investment case. In that scenario what is the right volume balance between dividends and buybacks on a go forward basis?","Dan Dinges","I have a hard time Doug being specific with that. We don't have a defined formula on how we might allocate between those two. I will say as part of the consideration. One of the things we don't want to do is, with a little bit of cyclical nature to a commodity we don't want to get so far dedicated to a dividend policy that we will retract at some point in time with the draconian period and the commodity space. But I do think that with the production level that we will be at, the low-cost structure of our program, I do think we medicate that somewhat just simply buy those two metrics.","I would look at our buybacks and look at the authorization and assume if you will that again within a reasonable time we will be buying back and making every effort to get back to the shareholder, but we are also going to keep some dry powder in the sack to be able to take advantage of opportunities and operational ideas that we have that we think made our internal thresholds. So, I\u2019m sorry I don't have a formula to give you, but I can tell you both our priorities along with us being able to be prudent with our capital allocation.","Doug Leggate","Appreciate the answers guys. Thanks again.","Dan Dinges","Thanks Doug.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bob Morris from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Bob Morris","Thanks. Dan, just really quickly here on the 75 million you\u2019ve allocated this year to your exploration projects, how much is in there for leasehold acquisitions and how many drill and complete wells does that entail?","Dan Dinges","It\u2019s just a very small amount and there might be $1000, that\u2019s how small it might be because we kind of have the acreage that we want to work with, and the number of wells is a little bit dependent upon the timing of the area that\u2019s kind of a little bit behind, it\u2019s a little bit dependent upon some of the timing considerations that we have ongoing in that area, but I think it\u2019s about five or six wells and from a science perspective, we would anticipate those wells to gather a great deal of science.","Bob Morris","Okay, great. Thank you, nice quarter.","Dan Dinges","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we\u2019ve reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Dan Dinges","Thanks Jamie and thanks for all of the questions, and now I can assure you as a shareholder, I appreciate the consistency in Cabot's ability to deliver on its forecast and quite frankly, additionally I really appreciate the fact that it\u2019s forecast program is top tier, if not industry-leading metrics that I think will deliver future value creation. And I assume the job of continuing to deliver on the stellar results. So, thank you again for the interest and I look forward to our call in the latter part of April.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star then one on a touchtone phone. To withdraw your question, please press star and then two. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Emily, and good morning to all. Appreciate you joining us for this call. I do have several of the Cabot executive team members with me today. Before we start, let me say the standard boilerplate language on the forward-looking statements included in the press release does apply to my comments today.","To begin, I\u2019d like to first touch on a few of the financial and operating highlights from the first quarter that were outlined in this morning\u2019s press release, and those are that production during the first quarter averaged 1,332 million cubic foot per day, an increase of 34% over the first quarter of 2013. As we guided on the year-end call in February, this volume is relatively flat to our fourth quarter production levels, which was primarily a result of compressor station downtime in the Marcellus due to the severe weather we had, and the number of wells we had scheduled to turn in line. When adjusting for our mid-cont and West Texas asset sales in the fourth quarter of last year, we grew the daily production by a few percentage sequentially.","Discretionary cash flow for the quarter was approximately $320 million, an increase of 36% compared to the first quarter of \u201913 and a 12% increase over the fourth quarter. Net income excluding select items was approximately $110 million, an increase of over 100% compared to the first quarter of \u201913 and a 47% increase over the fourth quarter. These record-setting metrics were further enhanced on a per-share basis due to our reduction in shares outstanding resulting from our repurchase of 4.8 million shares in the fourth quarter of last year. ","Of significant note, and I do think worth repeating, during the first week of this month we reached a milestone in the field of 1Bcf of cumulative gross production for these assets, which is particularly impressive given we began flowing production from our first Marcellus well less than six years ago and we have never operated more than six rigs or produced from more than 290 horizontal wells in the play during this time \u2013 certainly a milestone that recognizes the productivity of these unique assets. There\u2019s not going to be many assets out there that can boast those numbers.","Operationally, we do continue to demonstrate best-in-class execution across both our areas we\u2019re allocating capital, and that\u2019s in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford program. In the Marcellus, we averaged slightly over 1.2Bcf per day of net production during the first quarter in spite of the previously mentioned midstream challenges during the quarter, including a slow-down in infrastructure build-out affecting our ability to connect new wells. As a result, we turned in line only eight wells during the quarter, which included a three-well pad that was turned in line at the end of the quarter which is producing over 50 million cubic foot per day. ","As discussed on the year-end call, our production growth for 2014 is weighted more to the second half of the year; however, we do expect higher sequential growth in the second quarter versus the flattish production profile we had discussed on the year-end call. The second quarter has started off stronger with Cabot averaging approximately 1.48Bcf per day of gross production in the Marcellus, an increase of about 5% over the first quarter average. We plan to place approximately 15 wells on production during the second quarter, all of which will commence in either May or June.","Moving to the Eagle Ford, we also have good news to report in that area. We completed our first six-well pad at the beginning of this month and have been very impressed with the results. The six wells had an average completed lateral link of about 6,700 feet and were completed with an average of 25 stages. The wells achieved an average peak 24-hour IP rate of 1,045 Boe per day per well with an 89% oil cut. As a result of the continued drilling and completion efficiencies associated with our pad drilling efforts, we realized approximately $600,000 of cost savings per well. ","As a result of the improvements our team has made both on the production side as well as the cost side, we have decided to add a third rig beginning in the third quarter. The implied returns on our recent wells exceed 60% at $90, which we believe warrants the additional capital allocation. A typical well in the Eagle Ford has an EUR of approximately 500,000 Boe with a completed well cost of less than $7 million, based on approximately a 7,000 foot completed lateral. While still early, the wells that we had just announced in the six-well pad are outperforming this type curve. The addition of a third rig is accretive to our company\u2019s net asset value and will add high-margin growth to our production profile; however, since the additional rig will be focused on multi-pads and we\u2019ll be bringing it in in the third quarter, it is expected to have minimal impact on 2014 production but should have meaningful add to our estimated oil production volumes in 2015. We recently added about 4,000 net acres to our Eagle Ford position through our organic leasing efforts, and we will continue to actively lease in the area.","Now let me move to pricing. It\u2019s a mainstay now on our Cabot teleconference. In the press release, we mentioned and indicated the Marcellus differential of $0.60 to $0.65 for January and February, and those levels held for the remainder of the first quarter. As we anticipated and which had been outlined in our recent investor presentations, the spread widened in April as certain winter contracts rolled off. For the month of April, we have seen realized prices in the Marcellus before the impact of hedges of about $0.75 to $0.80 below the NYMEX. Much of that was driven by winder first of month index prices on Tennessee and lighty (ph); however, the daily cash price for those pipes have improved during April compared to the last six months. We believe the stronger cash price can be possibly attributed to the increased demand from storage refill, which in turn may be the reason we are seeing bids for term gas become more attractive. It\u2019s still early in the injection season, so we will continue to monitor this dynamic as we move into the summer months. For any additional information on pricing points and our firm capacity and firm sales, please see our current investor presentation on our website.","I would also be remiss if I failed to mention how the pricing dynamic should improve once Constitution pipeline is in service and we are able to deliver 500 million per day of our production to premium markets via the Iroquois system that will head both north and south, and into the Tennessee 200 line which will move to Boston. This outlook continues to improve with the Atlantic Sunrise project scheduled for the second half of \u201917. You may recall this new pipeline will deliver 850 million cubic foot per day of our previously sold gas to multiple new markets, including new pricing locations. ","On the Constitution update, we continue to see additional progress as we work towards final approval. You will recall that FERC issued a very favorable draft environment impact statement back on February 12. A public comment period deadline was also established for April 7, and despite several parties\u2019 requests for extensions, none were authorized by FERC. The FERC has established June 13 as the date for its planned issuance of the final environment impact statement for the project. The subsequent 90-day federal authorization decision deadline is set for September 11 with the final FERC order as early as mid-October of this year.","In conjunction with the FERC process, Constitution filed for its New York DEC permit back in August of 2013. Constitution continues to fulfill its obligation to answer the data request by the New York DEC as they process the application and work towards the issue of a final permit. ","On the financial side and subsequent to the quarter-end, our lenders under the credit facility approved an increase in the company\u2019s borrowing base from $2.3 billion to $3.1 billion as part of an annual redetermination process. While commitments currently remain unchanged at $1.4 billion, the increase allows for increased flexibility for share repurchases which will continue as an opportunistic decision based on relative valuations between the market and the internal view on intrinsic value. We have not to date this year made any share repurchases.","The guidance as it relates to our capital guidance, we have increased our capital program slightly to accommodate the third rig in the Eagle Ford to $1.375 billion to $1.475 billion. We also have tightened our production guidance range for the year to 530 to 585 Bcfe, and that does translate and still implies a 35% production growth at midpoint. We remain confident that we will be able to continue to grow our volumes throughout the year and into next year. ","In the Marcellus, we are currently producing about 1.5Bcf per day of gross volumes. Last month, we added 70 million per day of additional Millennium capacity, and we will add an incremental 150 million per day of additional firm capacity on Millennium in September. In addition to those volumes, we will be connecting our infrastructure directly to the largest LDC in the area beginning in the fourth quarter, which will allow for an additional 200 million cubic foot per day of new capacity. Based on this incremental capacity and addition to what we know about expansion projects like the Tennessee Rose Lake project, which will add about 250 million per day to the system, the recently announced open season on Millennium for about 120 million per day and the opportunity to increase our market share on three major pipes in the area, we do remain confident that we can continue to grow our Marcellus production levels in \u201914 and beyond. Concurrently, we will be growing our high margin oil production in the Eagle Ford also. ","As a result of our confidence, we are providing initial 2015 production guidance of 20 to 30%. This guidance is predicated on an average of 2Bcf of daily gross Marcellus volumes through \u201915, a level we are very comfortable with and which may ultimately prove to be conservative. Additionally, this program would generate free cash flow in 2015 even if you do assume an all-in natural gas price realization of 350 and an oil price realization of $90. ","As for \u201916, assuming a Constitution in-service date of late \u201915 or early \u201916, we expect another year of top tier growth for Cabot as we begin delivering 500 million cubic foot a day to new markets. In addition to the incremental volumes on Constitution, we will also be adding 125 million per day of new long-term firm sales associated with Transco\u2019s southeast expansion project and 50 million cubic foot per day of new capacity on Columbia\u2019s east side expansion, all of which are expected to be in service during the fourth quarter of next year.","In summary, while we\u2019ve been very clear that 2014 and 2015 will be somewhat challenged as it relates to the pricing dynamics in the Marcellus, we are more confident than ever that the quality of our assets and the long-term value proposition for shareholders is very strong. Even with these near term challenges, we will still provide top tier production and reserve growth while spending within cash flow \u2013 again, not many companies can make that statement. With over 20 years of inventory remaining in the best natural gas assets in the U.S., a sizeable portfolio of new firm becoming available to us over the next couple of years, and an improving position in the Eagle Ford, we believe the future of Cabot is as bright as it\u2019s ever been.","Emily, with that, I\u2019ll be able to answer any questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Good morning. Dan, can you walk us through kind of the puts and takes that you go through when considering whether to enter into a long-term takeaway agreement out of the Marcellus? For example, kind of weighing the cost of a new greenfield pipeline and the optical advantage now for investors as seeing firm takeaway capacity versus, say, locking the company into a disadvantageous pricing arrangement longer term, especially if there might be excess takeaway capacity out of the Marcellus later in the decade.","Dan Dinges","Well, I\u2019ll let Jeff kind of cover some of that, Pearce.","Jeffrey Hutton","Okay Pearce, as we\u2019ve talked before, our valuation and whether to enter into long-term firm sales versus long-term transport contracts versus participating in a pipeline for new takeaway \u2013 I mean, all those factors are evaluated with each decision. I think early on, we made a lot of good decisions on our long-term sales contracts, got way ahead of the game because the pricing was very favorable. I think in the last six months or so, we have slowed down considerably on entering into anything long-term that\u2019s a price disadvantage, as you called it. ","As you know, we opted for a new pipeline expansion coming out of Susquehanna County, thus the new 30 (indiscernible) that will go down to the DC area and on to Cove Point, and as it worked out for us, from a netback perspective that was a very, very favorable deal, so each deal stands on its own merits. ","The new transport we picked up on Millennium does a lot of good things for us, gets us to places that previously we had been unable to move our gas towards at higher pricing points. So each case is different, but for the most part it\u2019s evaluated along with all of our other options.","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Thank you for that. My follow-up is Dan, do you see any new horizontal potential on any of your legacy West Virginia acreage that traditionally was targeting the Devonian Shale or the Big Lime with the brea formations, and then how much acreage do you have there?","Dan Dinges","Well in West Virginia, we have still approximately a million acres in West Virginia, and that\u2019s held by production we had previously in some of those shallow zones, Pearce, before we started developing the Marcellus. We had drilled several horizontal wells, and that opportunity still remains in West Virginia.","We have an evaluation process ongoing with our assets in West Virginia. We had recently permitted a well in the West Virginia area and we will continue to look at enhancement opportunities on that acreage. So to answer your question just succinctly, yes, we do think there are opportunities to drill horizontal wells in some of the areas in West Virginia.","Pearce Hammond \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Thank you very much.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Pearce.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you, good morning. You talked to a number of the opportunities outside of Constitution where you\u2019re adding capacity, having signed some midstream agreements \u2013 the Tennessee Rose Lake, the open season on Millennium, and then the increase in market shares on three major pipes among them. Can you provide a little bit more color on what the expected realized pricing is and transport costs associated with those non-Constitution related opportunities, and how widespread do you see additional opportunity from here?","Dan Dinges","I\u2019ll let Jeff make the overall comment, Brian, but I will say that our price points are tied to different indices and those indices are variable, if you will, out there on what the future realizations are going to be. But I\u2019ll let Jeff answer.","Jeffrey Hutton","Okay, Brian. To begin with, the comment that we made in the speech on Rose Lake was just another example of how there\u2019s new capacity opening up on Tennessee that allows for additional volumes to flow on that particular pipeline, so we didn\u2019t participate as a shipper but we are selling gas to people who will participate as a shipper.","Number two, I guess, is the other ancillary contracts that we have picked up in order to move gas from one basin to another. The pricing points all vary, transport costs all vary. For us, it\u2019s all about netback \u2013 it\u2019s about assumptions that we make on the pricing locations and how that works to our best interest in getting the highest price for product. ","So each case is different. The Millennium capacity is fairly cheap as existing capacity. As you know, expansion capacity up there in new pipe is generally in the $0.50 to $0.60 range, but new pipe gets you a big advantage as another straw out of Susquehanna County. So we look at all those factors when making those decisions.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","This is probably a follow-up for Jeff \u2013 as you look at future opportunities for signing midstream agreements, are you\u2014where do you see those opportunities regionally? Do you see them and are you more\u2014do you see more opportunities to stick within the northeast and get it to the markets that Constitution is tapping into, like New England, or do you see more opportunities emerging to go to the Gulf Coast and the southeast or Midwest? It\u2019s really more a question on are there still incremental opportunities in the northeast, or are you really being forced to look more at the Gulf Coast?","Jeffrey Hutton","No, I think there are still additional opportunities in the northeast. As you know and if you look at our slide on the routes that Cabot Gas can reach and the markets that it can reach, we intend to be very, very active in Canada, at Waddington \u2013 it\u2019s in the far north part of the eastern part of the United States. We expect to supply a lot of gas into the Boston area, and then coming south New York, Jersey, Connecticut \u2013 all those areas. Mid-Atlantic, the DC area, we\u2019ve been very active down in the Carolinas into the Piedmont market, very active. That\u2019s a huge market \u2013 that\u2019s a third of the country\u2019s population, and we think we can reach out to all those areas.","And you know, of course, we do have backhaul transport that takes us back in the Appalachian area into the Columbia pricing locations, so that\u2019s a lot of market. We think we have access\u2014better access than most producers in northeast PA. Geographically, we\u2019re situated very well. I think the southwest PA producers have opportunity in the Gulf Coast. We have not ruled out, though, and are talking with markets in the Gulf Coast about transportation paths and how our Marcellus gas can fit in with their plans.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks. And Dan, a very quick last question \u2013 can you comment on share repurchase?","Dan Dinges","For share repurchase, we have not been in the market yet, Brian. We have\u2014as we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve evaluated the noise in this very short period of time from our last conference call. We\u2019ve been active in preparing a rather lengthy internal look at the future on all of our projects, opportunities and sensitivities, on accelerated projects, on price point sensitivities, on the macro market. We\u2019ve spent a great deal of internal time focused on that. We have our board meeting coming up. It\u2019s our intent to have some of this played out at our board meeting. But in the meantime, looking at the market and looking at the swings in the market, as I\u2019d said earlier, the volatility is going to dissipate a little bit before we get into the market, but it is my expectation still that we will be in the market at some point.","Brian Singer \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Good morning gentlemen, and thanks for taking my questions. Dan, I was wondering if we could go back a bit to some of your prepared remarks, your comments about the assumptions you were making for the 2015 growth. I believe I heard you say that the 20 to 30% growth rate is predicated on 2Bcf gross a day in \u201915. When I look at your growth, it seems that you probably hit that in 1Q \u201915 or maybe 2Q \u201915. Is that a fair guess, or are you thinking that you\u2019re going to be 2Bcf flat?","Dan Dinges","Well no, that\u2019s a fair guess; and again, it\u2019s an early guidance. We typically put our guidance out later in the year. We\u2019ve had enough questions and concern attached with what our confidence level is in our growth profile. We wanted to get it out there, and as I mentioned in my comments, Charles, that we are entirely comfortable at this level of growth. If you just look at our exit rate that we anticipate in \u201914 and you carry that forward into \u201915, you can get within that fairway of 20 to 30% growth in \u201915, and that\u2019s why I added to the comments that it may prove to be conservative at that level.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Right, right. And also as you noted, you\u2019d have free cash even at a 350 realized, and I think with all the\u2014maybe another cut at Brian Singer\u2019s question, you\u2019ve talked a bit about what your posture is \u2013 and this may be too far down the road \u2013 but you\u2019ve talked a bit about what your posture is right now. But as you go into a year from now or even nine months from now when Constitution\u2014you know, the pipe\u2019s in the ground and you get more confidence about what your \u201916 growth is going to look like, that\u2019s where you\u2019re really going to have\u2014","Dan Dinges","Some opportunities.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Yeah, yeah. So is that the time frame when you think that when you\u2019re doing all this internal work right now, is it really the time to pounce is going to be about 12 months from now?","Dan Dinges","Well we\u2014and the reason for the extended look and being more granular at our extended look was to stack up all of the opportunities that we had in front of us and that we have in front of us, and to look at the planning that we want to do right now in moving forward to, one, be able to have the right staffing; two, to be able to plan for the right services and personnel to be able to assure program execution to be able to achieve those levels. We know the assets can deliver; we\u2019re entirely comfortable with our asset pool and the results of our wells and our consistency of cost in drilling wells, but we do want to put together the whole program in a\u2014let\u2019s say a more detailed fashion than we have in the past. We\u2019re excited about when we stack up all these opportunities and it looks at the new markets that we\u2019re going to be able to access and making some of the assumptions that you do on price points that we\u2019re getting to with our new gas, it\u2019s a robust program.","Charles Meade \u2013 Johnson Rice","Thanks for those added comments, Dan.","Dan Dinges","Thanks Charles.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Allman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Joe Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Thank you, good morning everybody. So Dan, are you expecting in 2015 that you will have quarterly growth through 2015, or you\u2019re not expecting it at this point? And if that is your expectation, give us what gives you the confidence in terms of aren\u2019t the pipes full? You know, how can you actually move the gas?","Dan Dinges","Well, I think you\u2019ve seen each\u2014and I\u2019ll pitch it to Jeff after I make a comment, but I think you\u2019ve seen in just about each quarterly conference call, we come out and announce some type of capacity additions that we\u2019ve added to the plan. We think we\u2019ll be able to continue to do that.","In regard to just keeping the production flat and what it is quarterly, right now, Joe, our expectation is 2Bcf and whether we go from a 1.8, 1.9Bcf a day to a 2.1Bcf a day to the end of the year, I\u2019m comfortable at saying the average is going to be 2Bcf-plus, and how it rolls through the year is going to be sequential growth but I don\u2019t have it that granular at this time.","And Jeff, you want to make\u2014","Jeffrey Hutton","Yes. Joe, this is Jeff. I think two parts to your question \u2013 one, if I understood correctly, shorter term versus longer term. In shorter term, we tried to lay out in the speech that we have picked up additional capacity that was existing capacity on Millennium \u2013 70,000 last month and an incremental 150 coming up. We laid out a plan that actually connects our infrastructure in Pennsylvania to the state\u2019s largest utility up there, and we have already entered into sales agreements with them. There\u2019s additional capacity coming up on all the pipes that we operate on, so shorter term when I say next 18 months, we\u2019re not in the same camp as what you refer to as aren\u2019t all the pipes full. We are not in that camp.","Longer term is definitely Constitution, a big 30-inch pipe that is going to take us to two new markets\u2014or three new markets, two new interstates, and the central Penn part of Atlantic Sunrise, and those big 30-inch pipes are coming out of operating area so we feel real good about Years 3, 4 and 5 from now that we\u2019ll be able to grow.","Joe Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Have you guys put in some cushion for any shut-ins or any downtime? I think last year, you had some shut-ins.","Dan Dinges","Yeah, we typically always risk our production profile, as we do with our EURs and as we also put in a little bit of contingency in our AFEs. ","Joe Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Got you. Hey Scott, also\u2014I mean, a separate question, this might be for Scott. The DD&A showed a nice drop from the fourth quarter to the first quarter on a Mcfe basis. What should we read from that nice drop in DD&A?","Scott Schroeder","Well, that\u2019s the year-end true-up, Joe, from all the final year-end reserve reports and when our property accountants go through and repopulate the database, and that\u2019s the rate going forward now; and that\u2019s why we also adjusted the top end of the guidance down.","Joe Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay great, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I was wondering if I could change topics just a wee bit, Dan, onto the Eagle Ford. Obviously you\u2019re adding a rig there now, but I\u2019m just curious as to how you\u2019re seeing the backlog, the location count, and ultimately how more aggressive do you think you can be over time in terms of acreage opportunities and ultimately continuing to shift the balance of your spending towards that area. And I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up on the Marcellus, please.","Dan Dinges","Okay, Doug. Yeah, again, as you saw the numbers and as we reported, they\u2019re good numbers. They are meeting or exceeding our expectations to continue to allocate capital. We feel comfortable allocating the third rig. We feel comfortable being able to acquire additional acreage to bolt on. Our location count in the Eagle Ford is probably 500, 600 locations or so, and that certainly includes our Presidio area also. So once we get our arms around this third rig, I think it\u2019s intuitive to think that we would also look at an expanded program and possibly to a fourth rig also in the Eagle Ford, particularly as we continue to acquire acreage. ","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So how should we think about the priority for allocating cash, thinking Marcellus, Eagle Ford and buybacks, if you could deal with those three in some kind of order, and maybe acreage acquisitions added in there as well.","Dan Dinges","Well, on the capital allocation to the Marcellus, we have put together a six-rig program and basically a two-rig or two-crew completion pumping services, and we\u2019re rolling that forward with that program. So from a bottoms-up build, that gives us a pretty good handle in our cost consistency there, it gives us a good handle on the amount of capital necessary to allocate to achieve that program. When you look at the Eagle Ford and we go to a three-well program, that\u2019s a fairly easy number to get to also on what we\u2019d be allocating. From a priority standpoint, our operations program is where we\u2019re going to be allocating a program as opposed to a share buyback. But when you look at going to a split, we\u2019ll probably be, again, 65% plus or minus to the Marcellus in \u201814 as a year-end guesstimate, and the rest will be allocated to the Eagle Ford and some of the other projects that we have on the slate that are more exploratory in nature.","Going into our \u201915 program, again, we haven\u2019t put the capital allocation out there right yet, but going into the \u201915 program I would think that our capital allocation would go into a 55% plus or minus, 60% plus or minus in the Marcellus and the remainder going towards the Eagle Ford and the additional exploratory projects or exploitation projects that we\u2019re working on.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I don\u2019t suppose that you\u2019d like to elaborate on any of those additional projects at this point, Dan?","Dan Dinges","Nice try, Doug.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from Gil Yang of Discern. Please go ahead.","Gil Yang \u2013 Discern","Good morning. I was just wondering in terms of the visibility for capacity additions to get to that 2Bcf, how far along are you in negotiations or what\u2019s the visibility on those specific projects? Do you have them in mind, they\u2019re on a checklist, or is it more advanced than that or less advanced than that in terms of your targeting for those incremental adds?","Jeffrey Hutton","Sure, Gil. I think for the most part we\u2019re close, and we\u2019ll take a few pieces of capacity we\u2019re working with other shippers on to\u2014you know, just to make sure in getting to that comfort zone that we have exactly what we need. Going forward, it looks very favorable. We\u2019re not concerned about not flowing that amount of gas.","Gil Yang \u2013 Discern","Great, okay. And then a second question on the Eagle Ford \u2013 the counties that the six-well pad was on and\u2014can you comment on that? Those are some of the best wells you\u2019ve drilled, at least on a test basis. Would you assign that to the pad drilling and pad fracking, or is there something different going on in either the geology or the completion design that\u2019s helping?","Dan Dinges","Yeah, the majority of our acreage is in Frio County. We have the extended lateral\u2014as far as a pad, one, it was the largest number of wells we\u2019ve drilled from one pad on average for wells located in close proximity. It is certainly the longest laterals that we have used. The density or spacing of the frack stages came down a little bit also from our average of our prior wells, and in fact we will probably have a little bit further reduction in our frack stage spacing as we roll forward to evaluate the efficiency gains that we might be able to derive from that.","Gil Yang \u2013 Discern","What was the stage spacing that you\u2014I think I can figure it out, because you use 25 stages, so that\u2019s\u2014","Dan Dinges","Yeah, so it\u2019s a little over 250.","Gil Yang \u2013 Discern","And what was it prior to that?","Dan Dinges","We were probably closer to 275 to 300.","Gil Yang \u2013 Discern","Okay, great. Thank you very much, Dan.","Operator","Our next question is from Subash Chandra of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Subash Chandra \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks, good morning. I was trying to understand the size of the term market that was in your initial discussion that might be reflecting storage refill demand, and how predictable that term market might be, how it fits into your growth profile, if at all.","Jeffrey Hutton","This is Jeff again. I think the comment we made about the storage refill was just to indicate how strong daily cash prices have been up in the northeast part of the Marcellus. Comparatively speaking, cash has been very strong for the last month or so, and we\u2019re expecting the cash market to stay strong throughout the storage refill period. That has led to an improvement in the term market, being the summer market, maybe the one-year market, maybe going out the next couple years for basis differentials in finite term contracts. As little as six weeks, eight weeks ago, the summer on certain price was trading $1.75 under NYMEX, for example. Today, that\u2019s probably $1 under NYMEX, so there has been strength in the marketplace for the term business aspect, and it looks like it\u2019s going to continue.","Subash Chandra \u2013 Jefferies","I guess to put it another way, the spot market\/interruptibles, how big is that, and how can you take advantage of that on a sort of ongoing basis \u2013 for instance, these cash sales, can you grow above and beyond the firm? I think everyone looks at the presentation, they see the firm, and they just sort of expect that you can\u2019t produce a single molecule over on top of that. There was a company yesterday whose strategy is not to tie up firm because they believe\u2014they're in a different part of the play, but they believe that the Marcellus will be over-infrastructured within 18 months. They don\u2019t want to lock up that way.","So how do we sort of get that confidence that there is that\u2014you know, a cash market or some sort of interruptible market beyond the firm on Page 5 of your presentation?","Jeffrey Hutton","Okay, a couple points on that. I think there is a chance that infrastructure could be over-built in 18 months or two years \u2013 I would agree with that in both southwest PA and northeast PA. We have taken an approach where we have tied up certain volumes of our gas \u2013 and this is, again, on the website presentation \u2013 certain volumes of our gas into long-term contracts, and those long-term contracts, those customers are using their firm transport, their firm takeaway to take that gas to their city gates. ","The second approach was to purchase firm transport, and again those numbers are available to you on the presentation. Those volumes are\u2014we control, and we move those molecules to certain locations for better pricing, of course. And then the third aspect of our marketing approach has been to enter into spot sales \u2013 those are typically 30-day sales, summer sales April through October, winter period sales November through March, (indiscernible) gas cash sales. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re unlike a lot of producers \u2013 we have a portfolio of options, and that\u2019s our approach to marketing each month.","The producer that you mentioned, or I\u2019ve heard that producers are\u2014or some producers say simply, we will produce our gas to the amount of firm we own. We\u2019ve taken a little different approach to that. We\u2019re looking at all aspects of the market opportunities that are sitting there in front of us, and I think for the most part, we have a little advantage in that we\u2019re delivering gas to three major interstate pipelines. We\u2019re not married to one, and the infrastructure that we\u2019ve designed gives us flexibility to move gas between those pipelines based on pricing and pipeline pressures. And with the addition of Constitution, it\u2019s going to take us, of course, to Interstates No. 4 and 5 and then Atlantic Sunrise to Interstate 6 and 7. So having seven interstate markets and again attached to one of the largest utilities, or the largest utility in the state, gives us a lot more options and opportunities.","Subash Chandra \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. If I could ask one last question on the matter, and I\u2019ll promise to jump off, so the three paths there\u2014you know, long-term contracts to those with firm, purchase your own firm, and spot, is there a way to quantify perhaps on an annual basis how big that spot market is for you specifically, or for the sector?","Jeffrey Hutton","That would be difficult, and I\u2019ll explain why. I think the buyers of gas, both industrials and utilities, they\u2019re all different. They all take different approaches and they all have different buying habits, purchasing habits. When you throw in the mix of power plants, then it really gets confusing as to who\u2019s using what capacity on what day to get to what market. For the most part, we have very consistent day sales. We know\u2014we have markets that count on us for gas, and I think other producers take the same approach; but to quantify who is using what on what day during what period of time during the year would be difficult.","Subash Chandra \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers Investments. Please go ahead. ","","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investments ","Good morning. Dan, it appears it\u2019s taking at least three months to get a new rig running in the Eagle Ford. Is that based on internal capital logistics or is that based on rig availability?","Dan Dinges","No, it\u2019s based on us just getting the locations in order, the permits squared, and our services all lined up, but it\u2019s not because of rig availability.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investments","Okay. And kind of thinking forward on that locations point, with the addition of the third rig, is the strategy to execute the longer lateral, closer spacing method throughout the aerial extent of your acreage, or are you concentrating on a core area?","Dan Dinges","No, our wells are fairly scattered throughout our area, so the intent is to continue to try to capture the efficiencies by multi-pad, longer laterals, frack stage density. We think that we\u2019re gaining\u2014making progress on that, and that will be throughout our acreage.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investments","Okay. Yeah, that was what I wanted to hear. My last question is assuming you\u2019ve reached free cash flow in 2015, will you seek to maintain free cash flow going forward from that point?","Dan Dinges","Well, I think by virtue of our growth expectations, I definitely think that we will.","Jeffrey Campbell \u2013 Tuohy Brothers Investments","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Bob Brackett \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good morning. A quick question about Marcellus inventory. Can you give us an idea of how many wells you have drilled uncompleted, how many wells completed waiting tie-in, and maybe even if you didn\u2019t have midstream constraints, what your flows could look like?","Dan Dinges","Okay. On the well side, we have about 22 wells that are waiting on pipeline. We have five wells that we are currently completing, and we have 24 wells that are waiting on completion. So we have a pretty good backlog right now; and again, we knew that we would be building up quite a backlog at this period of time, and from this point forward we\u2019re going to be moving through those and working those numbers down.","Bob Brackett \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","And what could your system run if there wasn\u2019t a midstream constraint?","Dan Dinges","I don\u2019t know. We have\u2014I can\u2019t think of a day when I look at my daily drilling report, I can\u2019t think of a day that we have not seen a compressor down or a dehy down, or something like that. That\u2019s just the nature of the beast, and there\u2019s just a lot of moving parts and a large gathering infrastructure system like that. So it\u2019d be rate speculation, but I\u2019m sure it would be\u2014you know, we\u2019ve hit over 1.5Bcf. I think the record was 1.538 or something close to that. I\u2019m sure if we had things just humming along and we had the compressors tuned up the way we want them, we\u2019d be well over 1.6Bcf a day.","Bob Brackett \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jack Aydin of Keybanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jack Aydin \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","Hey Dan, hi group. How are you guys?","Dan Dinges","Good.","Jack Aydin \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","How many frack stages do you have waiting? And then I\u2019m looking\u2014you know, you\u2019re going to drill about 155 to 170 wells, and lots of those coming maybe in the second half of the year. So I run the numbers in a way, your 2015 guidance granted has some upside, but it looks like quite conservative maybe. Could you\u2014","Dan Dinges","Yeah. Well, we have\u2014again, we have\u2014as I mentioned, the number of wells that we are either completing, waiting on pipeline, or waiting on completion, it\u2019s 51 wells and that\u2019s probably over 1,400 stages, Jack, right now that we have in the queue. So the good news is that we\u2019ve been able to continue our production profile, we\u2019ve been able to sequentially grow, though slightly. We\u2019ve been able to sequentially grow our production from last quarter, and we did it with only bringing on\u2014with eight wells that we brought on for the quarter. We\u2019re going to double the amount of wells that we bring on in the second quarter, and we will continue to increase the number of wells that we plan on bringing on in the third quarter and fourth quarter from what we realized in the first and second quarter.","So we are going to go into \u201915 in very good shape as far as what we think our production profile will be, and what we plan on still having remaining in inventory. We are in good shape. I feel very good about it, and because of our efficiencies that we\u2019ve been able to gain with the drill time and continue doing good along those lines, that\u2019s why we made the decision to only have six rigs versus having to increase the number of rigs there.","Jack Aydin \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets","Second question \u2013 you have the permit in West Virginia in Wood County. What are you really looking for there? Are you looking for the Point Pleasant in that test, potential test, or what other things you feel that you have there?","Dan Dinges","Oh, bottom line Jack, we\u2019re looking for oil and gas. We are extending a look at the play south where the drilling has been, and we think our fairway is in the volatile window and we think that we have an opportunity there.

Could you give us a sense in your 2015 production guidance what your assumptions are for transportation, or maybe just in general what you\u2019re thinking about the differentials as we roll through next year? ","Dan Dinges","Well, the differentials are a hard number to get. We think that the differential is going to be somewhat similar to what we\u2019re experiencing today. On our production guidance, we\u2019ve had some discussion on the capacity that we now maintain firm, transportation, firm sales and the additional capacity that we expect to add to our inventory. As Jeff mentioned, to get to the 2Bcf level, it\u2019s probably 100 million, 150 million of additional work or capacity or sales that we would realize in addition to our firm that would get us to the 2Bcf mark.","David Beard \u2013 Iberia","All right, great.

We have a lot of deals that we\u2019re working on that we\u2019re close to racking up. We have some opportunities that we know that are out there that we\u2019re close to racking up. Probably the biggest number add to the slide is our new capacity into the utility there in northeast PA, and now that will be added to that chart at some point.","Matt Portillo \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt","Great. And then as we think about kind of your 2015 guidance, could you give us some rough color on how you guys think about\u2014I know you\u2019ve laid out lighty and Zone 4 previously, and it\u2019s about 45% or so of your \u201914 production in terms of exposure there. How does that look kind of currently in 2015, just from a rough estimate perspective?","Dan Dinges","I haven\u2019t broken that out. We can get back to you on that on an exact percentage, but we\u2019re going to be growing the production so that number will probably increase slightly. I\u2019ll have to get back, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see it, Matt, in one of our future presentations once we get more granular on our \u201915 guidance.","Matt Portillo \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt","Perfect. And then just last question for me \u2013 was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the organic leasing opportunity you see today within the Eagle Ford, and then any appetite in regards to M&A in the basin. Thank you.","Dan Dinges","Okay, Matt. Organic leasing \u2013 it is what it is. We continue to talk to owners of the unleased acreage out there, and we think there\u2019s an opportunity to pick up additional acreage. As far as M&A activity in the basin, I think there are some opportunities to pick up some small professionals that own acreage out there, and if the opportunity arises we\u2019d look at it. Some of the pricing that we\u2019ve seen in the M&A side of the business has been fairly robust, and we think the capital efficiency of our organic approach is more prudent for us at this stage.","Matt Portillo \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Wayne Cooperman of Cobalt Capital. Please go ahead.","Wayne Cooperman \u2013 Cobalt Capital","I\u2019m sure that this has been asked 100 ways, but I\u2019m just wondering\u2014you know, people are really worried about pricing. I wonder what price do you see where you cut back production and just wait until you get better pricing with better takeaway? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m phrasing that question in a way that I can get an answer.","Dan Dinges","Well Wayne, it is hard to pick a price that you say that you\u2019re going to just shut in production, particularly with the yield that we get from a fairly low price point. But\u2014so I\u2019m not going to state just a price that we\u2019re going to shut in, but if the market looks like it\u2019s behaving in a way that it would be prudent for us to shut in gas today and sell it near term, then we look at that. But we don\u2019t have any plans right now to shut in any large volumes of gas with the market that we see out in front of us.","Wayne Cooperman \u2013 Cobalt Capital","Let me just try to rephrase that a little bit differently, then. We all know the gas is there \u2013 I mean, you have the best rock in the country, probably, and you\u2019ve got a takeaway capacity right now that\u2019s going to get alleviated, and therefore the differentials that you\u2019re seeing now should dissipate over time. Isn\u2019t there\u2014don\u2019t you earn more money by producing less gas now, selling at a low price, and just producing more gas in two years? I mean, you\u2019re going to get much closer to Henry hub.","Dan Dinges","Well, I think there is an equation you can run, Wayne, that would get you to that point; but at this stage, again, our realization was 374 for this last quarter, and we are delivering a good return. We\u2019re putting that capital to use that\u2019s delivering, again, a return profile, for example adding the third rig in the Eagle Ford, that is generating a nice return with those invested dollars. But I do understand your question and certainly it\u2019s an equation that we can run; for example, if we were getting close to flipping the switch on Constitution and it was just a significant blowout and somebody wanted us to move gas for a buck, we\u2019re not going to move it for a buck. We\u2019ll wait to open the capacity of Constitution and start selling our gas into a different market that would not be realizing those prices.","So I understand your question and there\u2019s merit to it, it\u2019s just right now\u2014","Wayne Cooperman \u2013 Cobalt Capital","And is there some\u2014is there some price-limiting factor to how low a price can go in your market, or you\u2019re kind of\u2014I mean, there\u2019s really nothing to stop it from trading at a dollar or two in a bad part of the market.","Dan Dinges","Well, I think if you look at all of the producers out there, we\u2019re not the only one selling into these markets. When you look at the amount of gas that\u2019s going into Tennessee or going into lighty, there\u2019s gasses from a lot of different price points, not just up in the box up in northeast PA but there\u2019s other gas flowing into those pipes to saturate the market. So I think there is a price out there that the industry would say, we\u2019re just not going to move our gas for that. It\u2019s more valuable than that and we\u2019re just not going to move it. So there is that price point. What it is exactly, $1 or $1.50, I don\u2019t know where it might be - $2? But there is certainly a price point that I think a number of producers would say, we\u2019re just not going to move our gas at that price.","Wayne Cooperman \u2013 Cobalt Capital","All right, thanks a lot. I\u2019m sure everybody has got the same basic question.","Dan Dinges","Yeah. Thank you, Wayne.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Joe Allman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Joe Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Yeah, thanks again. So just Dan, in thinking about your ability to take on some extra capacity, if there is extra capacity in the system, why are the differentials around negative $0.70? I\u2019m just trying to get my head around that.","Dan Dinges","I try to get my head around it also, and one of the things that we\u2019re looking at, and I\u2019ll pitch this to Jeff that digs deeper than I, but when you look at some of the differentials and you see how the indices are established, you have really very few contracts that are capturing volumes out there that are setting the index and what supposedly two parties, a buyer and seller, are willing to move gas for. I question the differentials and particularly the number of contracts that are steering a large volume of gas, and we\u2019re looking into the transparency of all of the transactions, though right now being able to have access to a buyer and a seller, from my understanding at this stage of my look, is that those are confidential parties. But I\u2019m looking at it to try to understand it a little bit more in detail also.","Jeffrey Hutton","Yeah Joe, I think the improvement we\u2019ve seen in pricing has a couple factors that have influenced it. One has been the winter. There is good price realization going on in the cash market, as we mentioned before. I think the demand and the actual people who burn the gas, at some point they come into the equation. Yes, there is excess capacity up there, but just how much more incremental demand is there at certain parts of the year? So I would\u2014I realize that we expected improvement in the differentials when we had a good winter, and they did improve. They didn\u2019t improve all the way up to a flat Henry hub-type number. I think we\u2019re struggling to understand completely the dynamics of that. ","One of the approaches for us has been to make sure that not only do we have firm transport but the firm sales, and particularly our last deal with Cove Point and Washington Gas to make sure that we actually had someone that burns the gas. I mean, having an 850 million a day, 15, 20-year contract for people that do burn it was very important to us. So yeah, I agree with you. I don\u2019t understand exactly the dynamics that would cause a $0.70 differential at this point, but it has been a big improvement over the last 60 days.","Joe Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","So how much of the incremental capacity that you expect to take over the next several months, how much of that is actually new capacity and how much of it is you actually just taking someone else\u2019s capacity? So for example, that 150 million a day from Millennium in September, that\u2019s new capacity?","Jeffrey Hutton","No, that was existing capacity, just hadn\u2019t been sold yet, or\u2014excuse me, just hadn\u2019t been bought yet, and we bought it. The utility sales are new, incremental to us. I think there is existing capacity and there is pipe, and the way we work the system and the way the system works is the capacity that we pick up could be one-year in duration, two years, five years in duration. It could be 15 years with evergreen provisions. It could come from someone who bought it and it\u2019s just red ink to them, or it could be expansion capacity. There\u2019s a lot of deals and transactions made in the secondary capacity release market, and we continually work that. We do take capacity in short-term releases as well when they net us back our prices.","So again, there\u2019s a lot of capacity in those pipes. Sometimes it takes you to places you don\u2019t want to go. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t start where you want it to start. So for all the producers in the Marcellus as a whole, there\u2019s a constant jockeying around of positions on capacities to make sure that gas flows every day and netbacks are as high as they can be. ","Joe Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","So is the only new capacity that you mention of all the different agreements that you\u2019re entering into, is the only new one the 120 million a day open season that\u2019s Millennium\u2019s having?","Jeffrey Hutton","Okay, so that capacity\u2014you say it\u2019s new. It\u2019s new the marketplace; it\u2019s existing in the pipe. I mean, it\u2019s confusing terms. We\u2019re out there. We\u2019ve put a bid in to take some of that capacity. We didn\u2019t want it all because some of it doesn\u2019t do us any good. And likewise when Transco went out last month with 200,000 a day of capacity for a shorter term \u2013 I think it was a nine-month term \u2013 we took part of that capacity. It\u2019s an ongoing process, and I think all the pipes use their resources to try to increase their throughput. They\u2019re constantly looking at ways to add capacity to the system, and as contracts get taken, it actually opens up\u2014it could open up space for paths to move in different directions. So it\u2019s something that all producers and shippers and markets face on a day-to-day basis.","Joe Allman \u2013 JP Morgan","Got you, okay. Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question and answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan Dinges","Well, I appreciate everybody\u2019s interest. Obviously the conversations regarding the movement of gas and our ability to grow is on everybody\u2019s mind. I can assure you we\u2019re confident that we will be able to deliver within our guidance point; otherwise, we would not put those guidance points out. But when you look at what we have to be able to deliver in the future, we\u2019re going to, I think, comfortably deliver top tier production growth, not only in the next few years but moving out. We\u2019ll also have reserve growth that will be very robust. We\u2019ll do it in a free cash flow environment, and that gives us certainly confidence that we\u2019re going to be able to continue to enhance shareholder value on out into the future, and it certainly should give the shareholders confidence that the asset package we have will be able to deliver that value.","So again, thanks for the questions and we will see you next quarter. Thank you, Emily.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","Dan O. Dinges","Thank you, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us on this call. I have our executive team gathered here in the room with me, and they'll be prepared to answer any questions the group might have.","Before we get started, let me say that the standard boilerplate language and forward-looking statements included in the press release do apply to my comments today. I plan to be brief with my comments regarding our operations discussion. However, in light of the many questions that we have received and the many media articles and speculative comments over regional basis differentials, we're going to change our typical approach to this call in order to discuss our marketing efforts in the Marcellus. We have posted a presentation titled Marcellus Marketing Supplementary Materials to our website, which can be found under the Presentations section of our website. We plan on talking about this material later in the call, and it will frame the majority of the discussion today.","However, before we jump into that discussion, let me first discuss a few of the highlights of this past quarter, which happens to be the best quarter in Cabot's history, both operationally and financially.","For the quarter, we grew production 52% over the second quarter of last year to a record 95.2 Bcfe, which equates to 1.046 Bcf per day of total company net production. Most of that growth was driven by our operations in the Marcellus, where the current gross production rate is approximately 1.2 Bcf per day.","The recent jump in gross Marcellus production to over the 1.2 Bcf per day is a result of several new wells turned in line in addition to the commissioning of the Central compressor station in late June. The commissioning of Central had a very minimal impact on our second quarter results as it was not fully operational. We have witnessed a production gain of approximately 100 million to 150 million per day of gross production from existing wells as the station is served to lower line pressure in the western side of our acreage position.","As I mentioned earlier, this was also Cabot's best quarter financially. We booked record net income and discretionary cash flows during the second quarter, which represented an increases of 148% and 109%, respectively, relative to the comparable quarter last year.","As we announced in the press release last night, we have made the decision to add a sixth rig in the Marcellus, which will spud its first well next month. As a result of bringing in this sixth rig and the efficiency gains in our program, we have increased our total capital spending guidance range for the year to $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We also tightened the range on our 2013 production growth guidance and increased both the bottom end and top end of the range, going from a 35% to 50% range to a 44% to 54% range.","However, I would like to remind everyone that the addition of the sixth rig will have no impact on 2013 production as these wells would not be turned in line until next year. However, it certainly will give us a jump start for 2014.","With that, I would like to move into our discussion on the marketing efforts in the Marcellus. Our marketing efforts and the regional basis differential have been the primary source of questions since our last call. I'll use the supplementary slides that I've referred to and that we've posted to the website as a framework for my next comments.","On Slide 1 of the posted handout is our overall strategy for marketing our Marcellus gas. Our original objective was to diversify with multiple pipeline outlets to enhance our ability to move gas out of the basin to multiple markets while also mitigating our exposure to price volatility in regional differentials through our hedging program. To accomplish this, we have pursued many different avenues, including: diversifying all multiple pipelines; firm transportation agreements; long-term sales agreements, that's our firm sales; investing in new projects like the Constitution Pipeline; and opportunistically hedging a portion of our production. All of this provides us diverse opportunities to maximize the value of this tremendous resource.","Slide 2 is a map of the interstate pipeline markets where we currently deliver our gas, which is into 3 different pipelines: the Tennessee 300 line, the Transco line and the Millennium line. With the addition of the Constitution Pipeline in March of '15, we will be adding the Iroquois line, the Tennessee 200 line and the TransCanada pipeline via the Iroquois line to the list as well, which would give us a total of 6. At this time, we certainly are fortunate to have access to 3 large interstate pipeline systems that all serve different market areas. It should also be noted that all 3 of the pipelines we currently deliver our gas to recently completed expansion projects and publicly announced expansion plans in the future, further expanding our marketing opportunities.","I would also like to point out that, as most of you are already aware, the FERC application for Constitution Pipeline was filed during the second quarter and in-service is scheduled for March 31 of 2015. We continue to feel extremely confident about the project getting completed on time.","Now let's move to Slide 3, which addresses our current and forecasted volumes of firm transportation contracts and long-term sales contracts. The terms of these agreements are bound by confidentiality agreements. Also note that these volumes are as of today, will change going forward as our marketing group continues to analyze future opportunities for Cabot. As a quick refresher on this topic, contracted sales volume under our firm transportation agreements are the quantities we have reserved space bar on a given interstate pipeline and allows us to ship gas without interruption. Contrary, our long-term contracted sales volumes are the volumes we have secured under a long-term sales agreement, ranging from 8-to-15 years in length. Keep in mind, though, we also have shorter-term deals, which when combined with these long-term arrangements, cover over 80% of our anticipated gas volumes for 2013.","For all these volumes, the gas is shipped under our -- for the long-term contracted sales volumes, the gas is shipped under our customers' firm transportation agreements since many of our customers have owned the firm capacity on these pipelines since their inception. With regard to Cabot's firm transportation agreements, we currently hold 325 million per day of firm transportation and will add an additional 500 million per day of Cabot's firm transportation in early 2015 with the Constitution Pipeline. We also have an additional 50 million per day beginning in late '15 for a total of 875 million per day by the end of 2015.","Additionally, we are in the process of negotiating select long-term firm transportation agreements that would begin late this year and would essentially increase our total firm transportation to 1 Bcf per day by the end of '15.","Just to reiterate, in addition to our short-term sales agreements, we also currently have in place fully executed long-term sales agreements for over 600 million cubic foot per day of firm sales that range from, as I mentioned, a minimum of 8 years to 15 years in duration. All of these short-term and long-term sales volumes will utilize customers' firm transportation agreements and are mutually exclusive from the firm transportation volumes mentioned previously that rely on Cabot's firm transportation agreements.","These agreements significantly reduce our exposure to basis differentials. We are very excited that these long-term contracts will complement Cabot's firm transportation strategy in the years to come, and we continue to look to grow these volumes over time. We believe our marketing team, with the relationships they have developed in the Appalachia region, coupled with being the first mover in the Northeast Pennsylvania area, has positioned us well as we continue to grow our production at record rates. Also, our continued commitment to growing production in the region due to the quality of our assets and our ability to recognize -- realize high rate of return even in low natural gas price environment, has provided a surety of supply that many of our customers require.","As a result between our firm transportation contracts and our short-term and long-term sales contracts, the future demand requirements that we see and our relationships in the region, we are very confident and comfortable about our ability to market our growing production as we move forward.","Moving to Slide 4, which lays out our interstate delivery capacity, including compression and dehydration infrastructure. We are on pace to reach 2.2 Bcf per day of gross interstate delivery capacity by the end of this year, up from our previously announced 2 Bcf per day. We have increased our 2014 total capacity from 2.9 Bcf per day to 3.4 Bcf per day.","By the end of 2015, we expect to reach 3.7 Bcf per day of capacity. I would like to remind everyone that these are gross capacity volumes and are not indicative of anticipated production volumes, as we continue to focus our drilling program on the near term by capturing acreage, and we will certainly be drilling in areas where there is a lack of infrastructure at this current time.","Slide 5 focuses on our unhedged realized pricing for natural gas in the Marcellus. There have been a lot of questions recently relating to basis differentials in the region and what the corresponding pricing is, so we have laid out the percentage splits of how we currently market our gas and price our gas. As we -- as you can see, the majority of our gas, about 2\/3, is priced off the last day settle of NYMEX contract. The remaining production is primarily split between Columbia and Dominion indices. The Columbia indices has remained relatively strong and basically flat with NYMEX, while the Dominion has shown some weakness over the past month or so.","Of the 19% we index off of Dominion, approximately 70% of those volumes are hedged through the remainder of 2013. As a result, we feel we have limited exposure in the near term if basis continues to remain soft for this index. For first quarter, one, second quarter -- for first quarter and second quarter in aggregate, we sold our Marcellus gas approximately flat to NYMEX on an Mcf pre-hedged basis. The concern has been over recent pricing, so we have also laid out our July realizations. You will notice that July was, in fact, relatively softer as we realized $0.15 per Mcf less than NYMEX for the month on a pre-hedged basis, which is lower than our year-to-date spread. For the remainder of the year, we are forecasting a differential of approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per Mcf less than NYMEX. However, as pipeline additions come online in the back half of the year and winter weather materializes, these numbers could easily revert to what we had historically realized.","I would also like to point out that even assuming a 10% to 15% differential at current prices, our typical Marcellus well, defined as a 14 Bcf average, provides a 120% return.","Slide 6 is a recap of our current hedge position. We have about 750 million per day hedged for the remainder of the year at a floor of $3.75, and approximately 450 million a day hedged for '14 at a floor of $4.10, all aligned with Marcellus gas production. We will continue to opportunistically add hedges for '14. These slides should fully explain our marketing efforts and hopefully have answered all or the majority of the questions anybody may have. We believe that our current marketing strategy, including our hedging program, has us well positioned for continued success, even in the face of commodity price and basis volatility.","Now let's move on to some of the operational highlights for the quarter. In the Marcellus, we continue to see stellar well results across our acreage position. As I mentioned earlier, we are currently producing about 1.2 Bcf per day gross from only 226 horizontal wells. During the quarter, we turned in line 23 wells and currently have a backlog of 37 wells, or 781 stages, either waiting on completion -- completing or waiting on pipeline. As for individual wells, in last night's release, we highlighted step-outs from our Zick area, including a 2-well pad to the Northeast with 27 stages and had an IP of 34.8 million a day and a 30-day average of 28.1 million a day. We had another 2-well pad to the north of the Zick area. That was completed with 37 stages and had an IP of 51 million per day and an average of 30 -- a 30-day average of 43.6 million a day.","During the quarter, we also achieved and saw our fastest well to 5 Bcf of accumulative production, and that happened in 157 days. We also realized our fastest well to 7 Bcf of accumulative production, and that happened in less than a year at 358 days.","Our team in Pennsylvania continues to drive the efficiency gains in our Marcellus program, which is further evidenced by a reduction in average drilling days, and that is spud to total depth from 16 days in '12 to 14 days in the second quarter of '13. And that's despite drilling longer laterals in the second quarter of '13. We also achieved a new record on the completion side by completing 9 stages in a 24-hour period with 1 frac crew. They're doing a very good job.","Additionally, we have previously announced we ran our first-ever frac pump off line gas directly from the field and continue to implement the use of CNG in our operations, which we think will further drive down drilling and completion costs as we move forward.","Now let me move to a brief comment in the south and in our operations in the Eagle Ford. We currently have 1 rig operating in the play. We will drop a Pearsall rig and add a rig to the Eagle Ford at the end of this month, which is the level we expect to maintain for the remainder of the year. The second rig will be a walking rig and will focus solely on pad drilling efforts, which will consist of 4-to-6 wells per pad.","As a reminder, we currently have 50 wells producing in our Buckhorn area and have approximately 500 net identified locations remaining in that area, which implies over a decade's worth of drilling opportunities, assuming a 2-rig drilling program.","As far as the Pearsall, in the third quarter, we will end the drilling at -- in the Pearsall for our 2013 time period. As planned and discussed in the previous call, we will monitor the production from these wells, continue to watch industry activity for the end of the year.","A brief comment in the Marmaton, that we will be slowing down our operations there with us moving the rig to the Eagle Ford. And we will also go -- continue to maintain our acreage position up there if it in fact entails additional drilling or extensions.","Our team in the south region continues to focus their efforts on improving our well performance in the Eagle Ford and driving down well cost further. As the release highlighted -- and it's worth repeating -- our last 6 producing wells in the Eagle Ford had averaged a 24-hour peak rate of 900 barrels BOE per day, and our Eagle Ford area is about 90% oil. And that well -- those 6 wells had a 30-day average rate of approximately 570 BOE per day, which is outperforming our average type curve. In terms of size, we also released information on our first extended lateral well in the Eagle Ford, which had a lateral length of 8,000 feet and a 24-hour peak rate of approximately 1,130 BOE per day, again, 90% oil. Equally impressive, however, is the fact that the well held up well and is currently producing about 1,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day after 120 days. We have also made significant steps in our operational efficiencies in the play by reducing average drilling days in the Eagle Ford from 15 days in '12 to approximately 9 days in the second quarter in '13. We continue to work on driving well costs and anticipate the move to pad drilling will reduce Eagle Ford well costs by $500,000 to $600,000 per well, all very positive news for our Eagle Ford program as we continue to focus on accelerating value in this play going forward through operational efficiencies. However, I would like to point out that as a result of our pad drilling initiatives in the Eagle Ford and the associated increase in the spud-to-sale timing, because we're drilling pad wells -- they'll sit there longer -- we are slightly lowering our liquids production growth guidance for the year.","So in summary, we continue to be very pleased with our progress, operations progress, the growth generated from our assets, the efficiency gains, et cetera. These results delivered the best quarter in Cabot's history, and we feel like the best is yet to come. Our confidence in the future is evidenced by the announced stock split and the 100% increase in dividends.","Andrew, with those brief comments, I'll be happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Appreciate the color with regards to the basis differentials in your comments and the -- in your contracts. When you put your firm transport and your long-term sales contracts together and look at it in 2015, how, if at all, would your exposure to the 65% NYMEX, 30% local hubs that we see in 2013 -- you detail on Slide 5 -- change? Do you expect a meaningful shift in that split?","Dan O. Dinges","No.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And so then, I guess the question -- the follow-up question then would be, what is the current market like to sign NYMEX-linked agreements? Because the worry by others -- or the worry by some would be that for incremental contract signs, that would have to be or will stay at a discount to NYMEX.","Dan O. Dinges","Okay, I will pass that baton to Jeff Hutton.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","You're exactly right, in today's environment would not be ideal to be signing long-term agreements. We expect that environment to obviously improve. We think this it is just a temporary glitch. The majority of our contracts were signed -- I'm not going to disclose weeks, months, years, whatever -- a while back. We've only had one small long-term contract we've entered into recently, and it was one that was negotiated for a number of months. And the pricing never changed on it.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, as you've seen your production grow since Central compression has come on, or since the end of the quarter, can you just talk about how recent growth in the Marcellus -- how much of that has been because of favorable line pressures that have come as a result to bringing Central compression on, the tying in of new wells or just better well performance and really trying to isolate whether you've seen an improvement in well performance or whether the recent increase in -- the very recent increase in production is more to just the timing of some of these midstream and completion factors?","Dan O. Dinges","So we have felt good about the -- what we've seen on Central. Keep in mind, Central is still in the start-up phase. In my opinion, we have -- we've done a great job. And certainly, Williams has done a great job in getting a very complicated infrastructure system up, running and in place. But as any big operational project, we have ups and downs and starting at different times -- starting and stopping at different times. And we also have -- as part of the turbine process at Central, we have 3 re-sips at Central also. So when you look at the area of our current production, let's take the gross 1.2 Bcf, Central does not touch all of that. But when you look at the impact, we think we have seen early stage and the results of just Central and not of new production, we think it has been a plus or minus 15% positive effect on existing wells.","Operator","The next question comes from Abhi Sinha of Bank of America.","Abhishek Sinha - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm standing here for Doug Leggate. Just want to -- a quick one. So now you have added a sixth rig early on in the Marcellus. So we wanted to see like what stack really actually looks like in 2014 or in the outer years. And the follow-up will be like, where do we see the activity levels ultimately going up, given you have step-up in the cash flow?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, as far as the rig count is concerned, we haven't given any guidance out beyond '13 at this time. We'll get more color at our next conference call in October. But our tentative plan at this stage would be to add another rig to have 7 rigs running in the field in '14. And certainly, with the growth that we see out in front of us right now, we are quite optimistic and positive about continuing our story out in front of us.","Abhishek Sinha - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. And just again, in the Marcellus, how far you think you're away from being in full pad development mode? And would you have, like, 500 feet spacing and all developing forward?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, as we were still moving the rigs around in the field, capturing primary term acreage, so we have not gotten to the stage yet where we have gone and can go into full development mode. We do anticipate in '14 to have some rig activity on pads to implement pad development. But some of our rigs, also in '14, will continue to capture acreage. Full pad development will move out towards '15 when we can start talking about maybe all of our activity being on pad drilling. And as far as the spacing is concerned, we will continue to evaluate the most efficient spacing on our wells. Some of that work will be -- began in earnest once we are able to do some pad drilling.","Operator","The next question comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Dan, what are current well costs right now in the Marcellus for Cabot? And how do you see them changing when you do start drilling some of those very large pads that you were just referring to?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we've seen efficiencies. And looking at our typical -- again, back to our typical type 14 Bcf well, we're in the, say, upper-$5 million to mid-$6 million range, depending on effects on roads and locations and whatnot. And we have -- as you're aware, we have in our presentation, our media presentation, we have a slide that depicts some of the savings that we think we're going to realize comparing a 10-well pad versus a 2-well pad. And we think that, that savings -- from what we drill right now, we think that savings would be greater than $500,000 per well once we are able to move to pad drilling.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then one follow-up. Any updated thoughts on the potential divestiture of the Marmaton?","Dan O. Dinges","No. We continue to have our same mentality about the Marmaton and the other areas that we are not allocating a great deal of capital to. And if we find the right opportunity, and it looks like we could find a win-win deal out there, then we would consider divesting the Marmaton or saving the Marmaton.","Operator","The next question comes from Marshall Carver of Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Marshall Carver","A couple of questions. You talked about the Central compression still being in the start-up phase. How do you see the growth from Q2 to Q3 and from Q3 to Q4 for the overall production for the company this year?","Dan O. Dinges","Oh, I don't have that in my fingertips. We did revise the overall guidance from the 35% to 50% to the 44% to 54%. I -- Marshall, I'm sorry, but I don't have just right at my fingertips the progression through third and fourth quarter. But we are -- and we do anticipate that the Central compressor, as we continue to work it, the fuel guys continue to manage the fuel directionality of our gas based on the areas of lower pressure on the gathering system. We do expect it will be a learning curve from our guys in the field, and we do expect to see efficiency gains by virtue of this reduced line pressure.","Marshall Carver","And one -- switching modes to the Eagle Ford. The longer lateral was significantly better. Do you think the -- you're going to plan on drilling mostly longer laterals heading forward? And what would you say your overall Eagle Ford EURs are now, based on the better results?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, certainly, we're very pleased with the longer laterals and are -- the longer lateral. And by virtue of those results, our guys are evaluating the layout in the field and will make an effort to drill the longer laterals than what we have been drilling in the past. I don't have and have not seen a well count yet on how many we'll be able to get out to 7,000 or 8,000 feet, but I know that they are working on that. And with the assumption and continued good curve bits over and above our typical wells, we think we could move our EUR up in the Eagle Ford, but we're not prepared to do that at this stage.","Operator","The next question comes from Louis Baltimore of Macquarie.","Louis Baltimore - Macquarie Research","In the Eagle Ford, while the first extended lateral have a very strong IP rate, after 120 days of production, it was producing essentially right in line with that 24-hour IP. Can you comment on basically what was done in this well to keep production essentially flat for an entire 4 months?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, I'll make a brief comment then I'll throw it to Matt. Certainly pleased and knew -- when we look at the flowback profile and it had a lot of stages in there, and I don't know, as it flowed back, it's made a difference or -- if we're in fractures or what. But I'll let Matt make a brief comment.","James M. Reid","As Dan said, we frac-ed 30 stages in that well, and that well came on and was relatively flat, decreased slightly in its performance. But I think what we -- what happened was we continued to get contribution from additional stages as we went on. I think we got contribution early along from the field. And later on, we started to get contribution from the other stages. And as a matter of fact, it just continues to get stronger. We've been seeing that well continue to improve in performance even today. So I think what's happened is we're getting additional contribution from additional stages. We also have done a few things differently in our completion techniques, and I think that's helped as well.","Louis Baltimore - Macquarie Research","And then I just have one follow-up question related to the Marmaton. Initially, it looked like the returns in the Marmaton were as good, if not better, than those in the Eagle Ford. And so I was wondering what drove the move of that one rig from the Marmaton to the Eagle Ford? Is it the increased efficiencies you're seeing in the Eagle Ford now?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we have the increased efficiencies that we are realizing in the Eagle Ford. We have higher cost acreage in the Eagle Ford. We have more of a maintenance -- my primary term, maintenance issue in the Eagle Ford that we need to focus on. And then that is the motivation to focus 2 rigs down there versus 1. We are very pleased with the Marmaton, and your numbers are accurate and consistent with ours on the good returns we get from the Marmaton. We think for '13 that our primary term acreage position up in the Marmaton is in pretty good shape. So that -- all of that has influenced our decision on how to allocate our capital.","Operator","The next question comes from Amir Arif of Stifel.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. On the step-out well to the north, the production for frac stage was even better. Are you moving to higher frac stages out there? Or is this just something specific to that one area that you needed to do?","Dan O. Dinges","No. We see variability in the wells. And no, it was not more frac stages. We see variability in some of the wells -- not a great delta. But we do see some in some areas. We have a better, maybe fracture system that we're connected to and can fracture into, but -- we have seen those type of performances not only in the wells you are talking about, but we've seen those type of performances on a per-stage basis on some of the wells also in our areas we've done majority of our drilling.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So there's no real meaningful change happening in the number of frac stages you're doing per well? [indiscernible] own program?","Dan O. Dinges","That's correct. Correct.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then just a -- and then a follow-up quick question on the Eagle Ford. Is -- or are you holding that well back? Is that well being choked back? Or is there surface constraints? Or is that [indiscernible] what you talked about in terms of other stages slowly coming on?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. No, we don't have it -- we don't have it choked back or held back at this stage. I think along the lines, what Matt indicated, it's seeing -- as we go and as we produce, think additional contributions from additional stages.","Operator","The next question comes from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Question on new venture strategy. Are you guys going to be doing anything along that for the next year or so?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we have talked about new ventures in the form of portfolio management. And the Marmaton has been an area that we've discussed on maybe new venture opportunity. We have also looked at some of our legacy conventional assets in the Gulf Coast, and we also look at some of our East Texas properties as far as maybe an opportunity that we would create for Cabot.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Portillo of Tudor, Pickering, and Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions from me in regards to the Eagle Ford. First, I was just hoping if we could get a little bit of color on the date to drill at this point?","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. As far as the reduction in days to drill from down to approximately 9 from spud to TD?","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Correct.","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. Matt? I'm...","James M. Reid","Sure. We've done several things. It's not just one. We've changed our bottom hole assembly so that we don't trip as many times for our directional assemblies. We've cut that trip time basically almost to one trip. That's been a big, big plus. We've pushed our motors to differentials such that we're -- our P rates are much higher -- penetration rates are much higher than they were. And also, we've changed the way that we check our directional surveys such that we don't have to [indiscernible] the way we used to. We take regular signals, so we cut that time drastically in half. It just [indiscernible] from other rig efficiencies as well.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Perfect. And then as we think about the 2 rigs you're running in the play today, could you give us a little bit of color on how many wells that would be per year in terms of drilling completion? And I guess, as you mentioned, the 500 net wells in the play kind of -- it looks like there could be some potential for acceleration as you move out into '14 and '15, given the free cash flow generation, but just trying to get a little bit better understanding of how you think about capital allocation to the Eagle Ford.","Dan O. Dinges","All right. On the rig efficiency, we're probably looking at 20 to 25, plus or minus, as far as moving forward.","James M. Reid","Yes. I could speak a little bit. Just -- you can look at it this way: we -- on our pad drilling on our first well and our rig move, it's about an 18 day from move to rig release to the next well. And then on every additional well, it's additional 13 days. So roughly, you can take that on a 4-well pad, I think that's roughly 57 days, and you can do the math on the 6-well pad. So you can do the math as far as that goes on a [indiscernible] basis.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Perfect. And I guess just in regards to the 500 net wells, do you think you're kind of optimally completing or allocating capital to the play with the 2 rigs running? Or is there the potential to accelerate it as you move into '14 and '15, given the corporate free cash flow generation?","Dan O. Dinges","Certainly. Certainly, there's the opportunity to improve that. And my reference to an extended 500-well program and how long that would last -- I would just reference to 2-well program because that's where we're going to drill right now. But when you look at the efficiency gains that we anticipate making on pad drilling and you then roll back, and once we are able to justify and realize consistent efficiency gains, get the well costs down, show the improvement hopefully that we plan on seeing in the IPs and 30-day average in the IRR, then we will make a decision on how much of our free cash we will continue to allocate to the Eagle Ford, which, certainly, if Matt and his guys can do this pad drilling, they can drive the costs down and continue to deliver and we can get the returns up into the 60%, 70%, 80% range, there's a lot of justification on allocating CAPEX to those type of projects.","Operator","The next question comes from Drew Venker of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm assuming you could talk about the Marcellus infrastructure capacity in the second half of the year and into 2014. I guess are you -- your facility is constrained now at that 1.2 Bcf a day?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, I don't think we're facility constrained per se. Where our gas is producing, though, into a high line pressure, I think we have seen that by adding additional facilities in the form of the Central compression station, that by reducing those line pressures, I think -- well, we think we have seen a plus or minus 15% improvement from the existing wells. So if by definition that is part of facility constraints, maybe so.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So I guess you have -- it's sounds like you have a number of projects underway to help I guess reduce line pressure and allow you to continue to grow throughout the year. So we have to bring those additional projects online to increase production in the back half of the year? Or is the -- I guess is the Central Station going to help you increase production in the back half?","Dan O. Dinges","We plan on producing production in the back half, and I'll let Jeff make some comments.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Drew, I think you hit the nail on the head. There's multiple, multiple projects that are going on. Some happened leading up to Central. Central obviously was a major milestone, and a lot will happen between now the end of the year. And these projects include additional horsepower throughout the system, bridge lines, larger diameter pipes, additional section lines. I mean, the list goes on and on. The idea is to build a system that will -- that can enhance our production with lower line pressure, and we've got a ways to go. But these facilities are on schedule, and it's very dynamic, very fluid. So there's always something going on as we build this out.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the downspacing tests you've already drilled, can you talk about the performance so far?","Dan O. Dinges","I'm sorry, on which one?","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On the downsizing test. You guys drilled upper and lower Marcellus, I believe?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. Well, we -- yes, we have very few examples on the -- with the upper Marcellus, and we've been pleased with those results. And what we've indicated in the past is what we see as far as the curved pit is kind of an A+ Bcf type run on the upper.","Operator","The next question comes from Gil Yang of DISCERN.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Following up on Brian's question from early on, you outlined nicely how the firm transportation grows and -- but your exposure to NYMEX doesn't really change with those new contracts. But does the differential change with the increase in firm transportation versus the long-term contracts?","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Okay, Gil, I think I got your question, but we'll try this. The trades -- or excuse me, the FT, the transportation contracts, as they increase, we expect to have less exposure to basis differentials. Our long-term contracts are -- I mean, we've kind of outlined here very specifically just how they play out and what we're currently experiencing on basis. Is that helpful?","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","I think so. But I -- yes. So your exposure to NYMEX doesn't change as you've said, but at the same time, you're long-term contracts that are -- but because you're more firm transportation, you also have less exposure to long-term contracts overall. So I would expect that the differentials improved.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Well, if -- in a perfect world, if differentials didn't move around like we all know they do, then the firm transportation contracts do take us places that have higher and better basis differentials in today's world.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Okay, got you. And then with the Eagle Ford well, I was just curious -- very strong well obviously, and you've commented why it's got a good decline rate. But why -- is there something different about this well that allows those extra stages to come online, whereas other wells don't do that as consistently?","Jeffrey W. Hutton","I just think it's a longer lateral. I mean, it's just basically just friction. It think you tend to produce the heel stages first and then you get contribution from the tow stages as you draw down the pressure in the heel stages.","Gilbert K. Yang - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Okay. So you're just saying that, that dynamic is just more pronounced with the longer lateral?","Jeffrey W. Hutton","It's just a limit capacity.","Operator","The next question comes from Ray Deacon of Brean Capital.","Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Dan, I was wondering if you could comment on your EURs per 1,000 foot of lateral drilled. It seems like a couple of your competitors have increased their numbers, and your number is still around 2.3 Bcf. I guess, have you seen any data that would back up an increase in that?","Dan O. Dinges","Which ones?","Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Well, basically, EURs in the Marcellus per 1,000 foot of lateral drilled, I guess the 14 Bcf EURs.","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we're not -- we're looking at our curved pits, Ray, and we have a 14 Bcf-type of well that we've assigned and identified as our typical well because there's always variability in the number of stages and the lateral lengths. But on a per thousand foot of lateral length, we're comfortable with where we are. And if down the road we can see some improvements, then we'll recognize those. But we're comfortable where we are right now and don't feel like we need to push it.","Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. And just to follow up on your earlier comments about interstate pipeline capacity additions, I guess do you have an estimate of how much capacity will be added in terms of total takeaway on big trunk lines over the next year or 2 in Northeast Pennsylvania?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, I'll let Jeff handle it, Ray.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Ray, I've got some numbers. They're more fun facts that -- like a bentex [ph] where someone would publish. But essentially, Northeast -- there's probably 1.5 Bcf of new capacity coming on by year end as a number of new projects. Again, it's very dynamic. There's just a ton of projects that are proposed. And just like any other, about half of these projects will get built. But we look at it 2 ways because you look at pipelines that are normal expansions, like the Texas [indiscernible] that we do not have capacity on, we don't produce into. It does regionally influence where gas flows and what happens to pricing. And then we look more specifically at the pipelines we're connected to and will be connected to and the expansion projects that those pipes have. Over the next few years -- it's a big number. And some of those projects won't get built, and some will get built and then expanded upon. So it's a moving target, but we feel good about the expansions that have just happened in the last 12 months, for example. And so the ones going forward will only enhance what our opportunities are.","Operator","The next question comes from Biju Perincheril of Jefferies.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","One more marketing-related question. So it looks like you're probably moving about 500 to maybe plus million cubic feet of gas on short-term contracts. Can you talk about, say, in the next couple of years, how many of those contracts or maybe aggregate volumes that are falling over or expiring?","Jeffrey W. Hutton","No, we're not going to get that detail. But just for an example, this year, we're probably 80% of our production is sold under contracts that are existing. That number moves around. We have -- the market is quite dynamic in how it purchases gas. There's still a lot of buyers out there for 1-year deals and a lot of buyers for April, October deals and November, March deals and 1-month deals. I mean, it's all over the place. But if it helps, we're about 80% sold for this year currently.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then -- so then, is the remaining 20% then moving on interruptible capacity? Or...","Jeffrey W. Hutton","No. It's moving under firm capacity. It's just sold in the month-to-month market.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then Central compressor station. Is there still a phase 2 expansion there this year? And how do we think about -- is that the same sort of impact to lower field-wide pressures?","Jeffrey W. Hutton","There is a phase 2 to Central. It is not this year. It's at the end of 2014.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And when that comes on, it'll have a similar impact? Or is that more at that point, a discharge point for Constitution?","Jeffrey W. Hutton","It'll do both, and there will be -- there's a lot of projects between now and then, so we have no idea of the effect, but we know that it's from the hydraulics perspective, from our planning teams. It's going to be very helpful.","Operator","The next question comes from Jack Aydin of KeyBanc.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Most of the questions were asked, but I've got 3 to follow up. A, when you did last year's reserve, what -- is it pad? What kind of booking did you book those wells? At PUD -- PDP or PUD -- on a PUD basis?","Dan O. Dinges","Zick?","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Dan O. Dinges","Zick was on a PDP basis for the majority of that.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it's fair to assume that the performance of those wells that you just announced 2 miles and 5 miles away, you were looking at the same type of reserve kind of booking?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we're pleased with those wells out there. The early curved pit is good, and the consistency we see from -- Halliwell [ph] has come on and how they continue to pit the curve is consistent, I should say. And so we're very pleased with what we're seeing out there.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Good. Now, Dan, what do you think -- what percentage of your acreage now in Susquehanna have been de-risked in your mind?","Dan O. Dinges","80%.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","80%? Okay. Next question I have for you is this: in the Marcellus over there in Susquehanna, you've got different formations. Are you doing any different -- drilling different pilot projects to test the other formation beside the Marcellus? Or that -- or you don't need to do it now?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we don't -- one, we don't need to do it now. And right now, we are focused on the lower Marcellus at this stage. We have -- in the past, to gather data, we have drilled deeper than the Marcellus. And certainly, we've looked at sections shallower than the Marcellus. But that's just data in the bank right now.","Operator","The next question comes from Gordon Douthat of Wells Fargo.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Have you -- I know you've been asked this question before, but given kind of the dividend increase and the increase in production, how do you -- going forward, how do you look at balancing acceleration versus returning cash to shareholders as you've kind of looked at this free cash flow profile going forward?","Scott C. Schroeder","Gordon, this is Scott. Clearly, the -- what we have said throughout the second quarter and throughout the first half of this year when we've been asked the question, based on the parameters, the number one thing to do is to accelerate the Marcellus and that we made an initial attempt to do that with the sixth rig. Clearly, the horizon for the free cash flow and the level of free cash flow, while we haven't given guidance to '14, we're very comfortable with that concept for '14. And so we did take the opportunity, as we have done every time we've split the stock before, to make some move on the dividend. Dividend, this is not a final step with the dividend, but at the same time, we're not going to guarantee we're going to move it again in '14, but it is going to continue both the Marcellus and with the latest kind of results from the Eagle Ford, will become part of the operational acceleration discussion, as Dan said, depending on what kind of returns we can affect in the Eagle Ford. But dividend will still be a close kind of second to that operational discussion as we talk in the future.","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Do you have a longer-term growth target for the company? Or...","Scott C. Schroeder","In terms of dividend or just growth from the...","Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","For production growth?","Scott C. Schroeder","We are working on a model out through '17 that we'll finalize in the next month. But historically, we've kind of done it 1 year at a time simply because there is a lot of noise.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dan Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan O. Dinges","Thank you, Andrew. I appreciate everybody's diligence and the questions that were asked. Again, a lot of questions on clarity from the marketing side of it. I think the takeaway is that we are very comfortable where we sit today and our marketing and its impact on realized pricing for Cabot in spite of the volatility we see out there. And I think you've also seen some very good results in the eastern portion, again, supporting our thesis all along, the de-risking of acreage out that way. And I think -- and I was pleased to see a number of new questions regarding our Eagle Ford operation as we are now starting to show some efficiency capture and some gains in that particular operation. So I'm pleased with where we are. Thanks for the interest, and we will continue to perform. Thanks. And that concludes my remarks.","Operator","Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Dinges, Chairman, President, and CEO. Please go ahead.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Carrie, and good morning to all. I appreciate you joining us on this third quarter earnings call. I do have the management team gathered with me. And also, as usual, the forward-looking statements included in this morning's release do apply to my comments today.","We would like to touch upon a couple of financial and operating highlights from the third quarter that were outlined in the release this morning. First, the equivalent net production for the third quarter was 1.544 Bcf billion cubic foot equivalent per day, an increase of 7% as compared to the third quarter of 2014. Year-to-date, our production volumes have increased 19% relative to the first nine months of 2014. Operating cash flow, discretionary cash flow, and EBITDAX were $146 million, $150 million and $168 million respectively. All of these financial metrics were lower relative to the third quarter of 2014 primarily as a result of a 34% decline in realized natural gas prices and a 54% decline in realized oil prices which also resulted in a slight loss for the quarter.","Operationally, I'll move to the Marcellus first. Similar to our discussion in the second quarter, we continue to curtail production in the Marcellus during the third quarter due to the weak pricing throughout Appalachia. There are two takeaway projects coming online during the fourth quarter that will be beneficial to Cabot, one of which comes online in November and one that will be in service beginning in December. Our new capacity and long term sales on these projects will allow Cabot to accelerate production sequentially in the fourth quarter at better price realizations than we are expecting in the local market today.","We're cautiously optimistic for an improvement in price realizations in 2016 due to the impact of new takeaway capacity coming online over the next few quarters on the demand side, and the impact of significant reduction in industry activity on the supply side. Currently, there are only nine rigs operating in Northeast Pennsylvania compared to 25 rigs this time last year, that's a 64% decline. On the completion front, there are less than a handful of frac crews working at any point in time, and those crews have moved primarily to daylight operations which certainly translates into less frac stages being completed per crew.","While our price realizations continue to be challenged as we await new infrastructure, our operations continued to exceed expectations with a focus on continuously improving our capital efficiency. On the drilling side, our team continues to set new records.","In the Marcellus, our average spud-to-spud cycle time during the third quarter was 14 days as compared to 18 days in the third quarter of 2014. That's a 22% improvement, despite our average total measured depth increasing by almost 10%. This has resulted in roughly a 25% decrease in drilling cost per lateral foot. Most of these savings are sticky, which means that they're not tied to the current cyclical reduction in service cost.","We have two rig contracts in the Marcellus expiring at year-end. And we anticipate a significant reduction in day rates going forward, further reducing our drilling cost as we move into 2016.","On the completion side, we have continued to see downward pressure on pumping costs in our operations. While we are not currently forecasting another meaningful downward step change in frac cost in 2016, I do believe we will see further declines across various service lines given the current and the anticipated activity levels across Appalachia next year.","We're currently operating three rigs in the Marcellus. However, we will drop to two rigs by the end of this year with the intention of accelerating our activity levels in the third quarter of 2016 in anticipation of the in-service of Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise pipelines. More on those pipelines later.","In the Eagle Ford, we experienced an 8% sequential decline in liquid volumes, which reflects the impact of our natural declines as we have reduced the amount of activity in the play due to lower oil prices. To provide context, during the quarter, we completed only seven wells in the Eagle Ford and only placed six wells on production. Our activity \u2013 the current activity levels are driven by obligatory lease and operational commitments. We also anticipate a further reduction in activity in the fourth quarter, which will result in a slight sequential decline in liquid volumes for the third to fourth quarter.","On the positive side, operationally, we have continued to see improvements, especially in our drilling operation. This quarter, we experienced another 15% to 20% reduction in drilling cost per lateral foot as compared to the second quarter, which were driven primarily by improving the operational efficiencies. Currently, we're drilling our Eagle Ford wells at 30% to 40% faster than our 2014 average. Quite an impressive job by the team.","We are currently operating one rig in the Eagle Ford, and we plan to drop that rig by the end of the second quarter of 2016 when the contract expires unless we see a significant uplift in oil prices during the first half of this next year. Based on this level of activity in 2016, we should be able to maintain all of our leasehold, while averaging full-year liquids production volumes that are flat to our fourth quarter liquid volumes this year.","On Constitution update, since Constitution's status is likely on everybody's mind, I would like to provide that update as we highlight some of the significant benefits of this project that I personally believe do not get enough attention and are not fully understood.","On the second quarter call, you might recall in July, we outlined the progress Constitution Pipeline had achieved to-date including the filing of the FERC implementation plan, finalizing the reroute variance and finalizing all the outstanding issues with the New York DEC. We also reported that we were optimistic to begin construction in the fall and we're still planning on an in-service date in the second half to meet the heating season demand for New York and New England next winter.","To be blunt and to the point, we have not received the 401 water quality permit from New York, which is necessary for the mainline construction of the pipeline. There remains a few other outstanding approvals as well, but these issue should fall into place very quickly once New York issues the 401 certificate. Given the continued delay in the issuance of this permit from New York, I do want to take this opportunity to highlight a number of very important and significant benefits that the Constitution Pipeline will provide both during construction and after in-service.","First and foremost, job creation and retention. Construction of the project is estimated to directly and indirectly create 2,400 jobs and generate about $130 million in labor income to the region. These jobs are high-paying and will utilize the excellent skills of the local unionized labor force. In fact, Constitution, in conjunction with Leatherstocking Gas Company will directly provide natural gas to one of the largest employers in the area, the Amphenol Aerospace plant in Sidney, New York which employs more than 1,000 unionized employees.","In 2011, the state administration committed to Amphenol that the plant would have access to natural gas and company leaders are on record as stating that access to Constitution Pipeline is a key reason why the plant has chosen to remain in Sidney, New York. Amphenol was awarded a $750,000 grant by the Delaware County Industrial Development Agency in New York for the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Constitution to their facility.","On tax revenues, another significant benefit on the project, once operational Constitution economic impact is anticipated to result in more than $13 million in annual tax property revenue. This project is privately financed with no government subsidies, tax breaks, or incentives. Project will pay millions in annual property tax payments to localities and school districts. Approximately 60% of taxes paid by this project will directly benefit local school districts along the pipeline route.","Third, Constitution Pipeline will link New York State with lower cost energy. New York is the fourth largest natural gas consuming state in our country, and their consumers currently experienced some of the highest rates for natural gas in the United States. Once complete, the pipeline will provide consumers reliable supplies of low-cost energy, addressing one of the key challenges of State New York faces in remaining competitive with other manufacturing regions. The pipeline will transport enough gas \u2013 natural gas each day to serve about 3 million homes, many of which will be located in New York.","Plans are already under way to provide new natural gas services in parts of Broome, Chenango, and Delaware Counties, which have never before enjoy natural gas access. Further delays in issuing the final permit risks the project's 2016 in-service date which means that New York energy consumers will have to wait another full year to receive the relief from the extraordinarily high energy prices experienced during the winter\/heating season.","Lastly, this pipeline is consistent with the New York State Energy Plan. Due to ongoing issues with the Indian Point nuclear facility, New York needs an alternative fuel source for power generation in the Long Island area. Constitution will connect to Iroquois gas pipeline which currently serves natural gas electric generation plants in the same area as Indian Point.","Constitution brings additional capacity for new or expanded gas use for power generation in the state. In fact, Constitution Pipeline was specifically highlighted in the New York State Energy Plan as critical gas transmission infrastructure needed to meet New York's expanding energy needs. The state currently utilizes natural gas for over 36% of its electric generation, and the New York State Energy Plan calls for a 32% increase in natural gas usage which can help reduce emissions as the state transitions away from the usage of coal and heating oil to cleaner fuels like natural gas.","I think you can see how New York State will benefit greatly from Constitution Pipeline. The projects is supported by legislators, local officials, unions, business, trade groups both in New York and throughout New England, as well as several New England governors. We look forward to beginning construction of this project as soon as possible. Assuming that Constitution team can begin construction activities in the next few months, we are optimistic that the project can be placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2016 in order to help meet the growing natural gas demands in New York.","In the morning's press release, we provided an update of our 2015 guidance, as well as initiated preliminary guidance for 2016. Based on our anticipated production levels for the fourth quarter, we have adjusted our full-year 2015 production guidance to a range of 12% to 14%. This adjustment reflects our price outlook for the fourth quarter and our corresponding decision to continue curtailments on a portion of our production for the remainder of the year.","While fourth quarter volumes are expected to increase 5% sequentially at the midpoint relative to the third quarter, this does imply a slight year-over-year decline of the fourth quarter driven by our strategy to curtail volumes in light of the current price environment. We have also reduced our 2015 capital program to $850 million. The reduced capital program is the result of a reduction in our planned level of activity in the fourth quarter as well as the impact of further cost reductions from improving efficiencies and lower service costs.","In addition, we anticipate approximately $35 million of commitments this year associated with the equity ownership in Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise pipelines. Our preliminary 2016 budget was built from the bottom up with focus on spending within cash flow at recent strip prices, while still providing measured growth in 2016 and still investing the appropriate amount of growth capital for 2017 that allows us to accelerate our production growth into better price points upon in-service of Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise.","Our focus on maximizing efficiencies throughout the program results in a plan that provides economic wellhead returns even at our conservative low price assumptions, and results in a continued reduction in our unit cost. I will emphasize, however, that this is a preliminary budget based on our current expectations over the next year, and we certainly reserve the right to call an audible on this plan as we monitor the commodity price environment and the approval process of the key takeaway projects we are participating in.","We have initiated our preliminary 2016 production growth guidance in the range at 2% to 10%. Low end to midpoint assumes that the headwinds on price realizations we're experiencing today persists throughout 2016. And we continue to curtail a modest portion of our production, while the high end assumes an improvement in price realizations and reflects an uncurtailed production profile without spending any additional capital.","This production growth range is based on E&P capital budget of $615 million. Additionally, we have approximately $150 million of equity investment in Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise planned for next year. Depending on the timing of construction of both these projects, that number could change throughout the year, but currently assumes a fourth quarter 2016 in-service date for our Constitution and a third quarter 2017 in-service date for Atlantic Sunrise.","Drilling, completion and facility capital will account for approximately 93% of the capital budget, with approximately 74% allocated to the Marcellus Shale and 26% allocated to the Eagle Ford Shale. In total, we plan to drill approximately 60 net wells in 2016 and complete approximately 90 net wells. This level of activity will allow us to meet all of our obligatory drilling and operating commitments, maintain operating efficiencies throughout the program, and sets us up for acceleration of growth into 2017.","While we'd be able to hold our Marcellus production volumes flat this next year by only spending approximately $175 million in drilling, completion capital, and we have allocated capital in next year's program that will provide for expanded growth in 2017 assuming Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise remain on the schedule we've outlined, all while generating free cash flow under our conservative price assumptions.","As we continue to focus on improving capital efficiencies, our average planned lateral length in our 2016 program are approximately 25% longer than the 2015 program at 6,700 feet in the Marcellus and 9,500 feet in the Eagle Ford. The average drilling and completion cost for Cabot's 2016 program of longer laterals and more stages per well as compared to 2015 are $6.6 million and $6.3 million for the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, respectively.","This represents a drilling and completion cost decrease of over 15% on a per-lateral-foot basis relative to our 2015 budgeted cost. Based on our budgeted price assumptions, 2016 program generates free cash flow before taking in consideration our pipeline commitments. This assumes a slight improvement year-over-year in the local basis differentials; however, we will be closely monitoring the impact of the following items on local pricing over the next quarters; new takeaway capacity in Appalachia, a supply side rationalization from reduced activity levels, and the winter demand.","The good news is that we have plenty of flexibility in our plan to adopt our program throughout the year as the market warrants. While 2016 will be a challenged year, our ability to generate free cash flow from our drilling program at these low commodity prices, while also providing production growth and investing a significant amount of growth capital for 2017, speaks to the quality of our assets, our highly efficient operating plan, and our historically low-cost structure.","With that, Carrie, I'll be more than happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. At this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Dan.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So I wonder if you could help us with the shut-in volumes and how we should think about how you're prioritizing the next moves with your slowdown in activity. What I mean is, do you \u2013 does the volume come back before you add more rigs? And if you could quantify for me, and I've got a follow-up, please.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Doug. We have curtailed volumes right now. We have volumes that were not moving that do not require any additional capital to move those incremental volumes. And keep in mind that in regard to curtailed volumes, we might get the question in regard to how much you shut-in and what ability you have to be able to move incremental volumes. But we have adjusted our capital program as we've gone through 2015 to take in consideration curtailments. And so, that tweaking of our capital allocation has certainly delayed some of our originally scheduled and budgeted frac stage completions. And we've also amended our directives to the frac crew to initiate only during daylight hours.","So, we're sliding out some of that activity. So, as we roll through the year and the amount of activity we're conducting right now, and the various swings that we have through our marketing group on a month-to-month on what we're moving, that curtailed volume is a variable number, if you will.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I'll maybe follow up offline. My follow-up, Dan, is really more I guess on the assumptions for the spending next year. Are you looking to spend within cash flow including the pipeline affiliate CapEx? And if so, can you give us some idea \u2013 I know it's a really tough question to answer, but what are your thoughts on the differential in your plan for 2016?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the capital allocation, the $615 million, is to the drilling completion program where 93% of that is directed to that. The additional $150 million is allocated to the Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise. And that's making the assumption if some of those expenditures fall in line as we have currently predicted which would have an in-service date of Constitution of the end of 2016 and the September in-service date of Atlantic Sunrise.","And the total expenditure, if the $150 million of equity investments and pipeline is made, there will be a slight overspend of cash flow at these conservative prices that we've used. And as far as the differential is concerned, we have forecast a slight compression of the differentials into 2016, and the assumption we're making there is that some of these takeaway items that we've referenced in November of this year and in December of this year along with the expectation of Constitution coming online, we think on a weighted average basis that our differentials would compact a little bit.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'll leave it there. Thanks, Dan.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth of BMO. Please go ahead.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets","Hey. Good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets","When you referenced accelerating Marcellus activity in the third quarter in anticipation of Constitution coming online, does this imply that you'll increase the rig count from the two rigs or would you primarily be looking to increase completions? And is three rigs still a good estimate of maintenance activity or what needs to hold 2 Bcf a day of gross production flat?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Phillip, on both those questions you're accurate, we would be around the three rig count in the Marcellus. And we feel like we'll be able to maintain our production flat with the capital program that we've outlined, if that's what we choose to do.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And then most of your or many of the Appalachian producers are hedged in 2016, and in some cases well beyond that. Could you update us on your latest thoughts around hedging in 2015 or 2017 both your NYMEX and local pricing exposure?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're unhedged in 2016 and 2017. And I think the industry as a whole is probably less than 20% hedged in 2016 and certainly lower percentage hedged in 2017. Our desire would be to hedge volumes and protect some of the space. It's been a difficult market to hedge. If you look at it, it has not been a real liquid market. And the discount that we've been able to realize when we've gotten quotes has not been attractive but enough for us to place the hedges.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets","And then of the $150 million in JV contributions planned for 2016, could you break that out by Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise? And then, would this be all of the required CapEx for Constitution or would you still have some spending that could fill in to 2017?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, we have $100 million allocated to Constitution and $50 million allocated to Atlantic Sunrise for 2016.","Phillip Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets","Great. Thanks a lot.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Morris of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Dan, I think in the past, you've indicated that essentially, the drop dead date for beginning construction on Constitution in order to get it completed in on line or in-service next year is early January and that assumes everything went smoothly. Is that still the case?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Bob. The window is certainly still open for us. We do need the New York approval. And your timing is accurate on being able to commence construction sometime in the mid or latter part of January to be able to move forward and meet our commissioning on the fourth quarter of 2016. That's correct.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then my second question is, once you drop the rig in the Eagle Ford, what is the oil price you need in order to put a rig back to work there and pick activity back up in Eagle Ford?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's not a specific number we're looking at Bob. It's going to be a function of several things. One, how efficient we've been able to execute the program based on the assumptions that we've made. And also, certainly, looking at the dynamics of the \u2013 macro dynamics of the natural gas market and looking at what commodity price differentials we've been able to realize throughout the first part of 2016. Those things will play into our decision about the allocation of additional capital, obviously, along with the cost of a barrel and what, frankly, what service cost do, in fact, if you do see a increase in the value per barrel.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And on the service cost, you don't expect any reduction in completion cost next year in the Marcellus, why is that?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We do expect a little bit of reduction in the completion cost in 2016.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. All right, I must have misheard you. Thank you.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. We expect the drilling completion cost to be over 15% per lateral foot less than what we saw in 2015.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Right. But I thought it was just on the completion side.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. That's both drilling and complete \u2013 yeah.","Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Good morning, Dan. Thanks for taking my questions.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Pearce.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","My first question is on the 2016 production guidance, can you provide any kind of mix or liquids production growth?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, our liquids is going to be consistent with what we exit our fourth quarter of 2015 average. And that's going to be our liquids number. And we were thinking anywhere between 14,000 to 15,500 barrels is the fourth quarter guidance. Natural gas, we're going to be at 1.475 to 1.6 as our fourth quarter guidance.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Great. Thank you. And then how many drilled uncompleted wells do you think you'll have at year end 2015 based on your guidance for 2016? It looks like that's coming down by about 30 wells. I had in my notes previously that you are talking about having about 70 wells in backlog at year-end 2015, about 50 in the Marcellus and about 20 in the Eagle Ford. I'm just curious if that was still the same.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. We're going to have 55 or so in the Marcellus and we'll have, Steve, 22 wells in the Eagle Ford that are in backlog going into 2016.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","And then at year-end 2016, that's going to be reduced by approximately 30 based on your guidance?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We have 39 wells in the Marcellus, and we have about seven wells in the Eagle Ford.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Thank you. And then one last from me, just a clarification, in the prepared remarks, did you say that it will take about $175 million of CapEx to hold your production flat in the Marcellus?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. If you wanted to hold it flat...","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","For maintenance...","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That's what it would take.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","And so, does that imply that there's about $250 million, $280 million of growth CapEx for the Marcellus for this next year?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Okay. All right. Thank you very much, Dan.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And some of that obviously is directed towards 2017 also.","Pearce Wheless Hammond - Simmons & Company International","Great. Thank you, Dan.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks, guys, for the color on your curtailed production and kind of wells in backlog. What do you see your competitors in Northeast, PA having in terms of those two curtailed production and wells in backlog?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Bob, that's hard to get our arms around. We think there are curtailed volumes up there. There certainly has been a reduction in the level of activity as we referenced nine rigs and only a handful of rigs and, I mean, completion crews. And we think there will be, from this point forward, we think there'll be less than 700 or so stages completed between now and year-end up in the Northeast, PA. So, to be able to say how much is curtailed and how much is being worked off, it's a hard number to come up with.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And a quick question, going from 24-hour to 12-hour completion crews, is there a cost related to that or loss of efficiency?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think, we probably \u2013 I think, it's safe to say you have a little bit loss of efficiency by not doing 24\/7 operations. But overall, when we reference our decrease in cost from 2015 to our anticipated cost in 2016, we certainly have taken that ineffective part of our program into consideration.","Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Brian.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","If we take your 2016 CapEx guidance together with your backlog and curtailments, what production capacity should we expect you to have at the end of 2016? And really trying to think about the upside case in which Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise come on by 2017, what additional drilling you'll need to meet those obligations?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hard number to come up with, specifically, on what we have. I'm kind of looking around the table and nobody's raised their hand yet on that, Brian. But let me say it this way that as we put together our program for 2016, we felt and certainly feel very comfortable about what we're able to deliver in volumes for 2016. Highlighting that point is the amount of capital necessary to just keep us flat is \u2013 it's not inconsequential but it's not a very, very high number at all.","But looking at 2016 was not really the target of what we tried to accomplish with our program. We approach it in a conservative manner, trying to stay within cash flow, using a conservative commodity price. And, frankly, in our range that we used, again, risking our number, though our expectation is Constitution will be a 2016 event, we have actually not included any volumes in our 2% to 10% range on the production range that we provided in our guidance.","So, in looking at what we're able to have rolling out of 2016 with our current capital program, and looking at our ability to ramp up in a fairly short fashion, if we wanted to add some incremental capital, we have no question rolling into the end of 2016 and the beginning of 2017 that we're going to be able to fill not only Constitution but also Atlantic Sunrise which gets us to the 1.35 additional incremental \u2013 1.35 Bcf a day that we expect to be moving in 2017.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks. I mean, that kind of dovetails to the usual question of when Constitution comes online and frankly when Atlantic Sunrise comes online, assuming they do, is that your intention to grow incrementally by that 1.35 Bcf a day or would you take some of your production currently oversupply in the local market and divert it on to those pipelines?","My sense here is you're more willing to guide to\/consider the latter, but maybe you could expand on that and then further follow-up that if you did want to grow by 1.35 Bcf a day from here, would you need a big ramp up in the rig counts?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yes. We're going to need to grow \u2013 the total volume to be incremental, we would have to move the rig count up a little bit and we would complete additional stages then we have forecast for, probably the latter part of 2016. But, I still feel like, and if Phil was sitting here, that if we see that everything is staying online in the latter part of 2016 that everything, or Atlantic Sunrise is in queue moving towards the September commissioning that we would be able to meet those volumes, 850 million a day as incremental volumes with our anticipated 2017 program.","Certainly, we haven't made the guidance in release of what our capital program and activity level would be in 2017. But we would be able to meet the September commissioning of Atlantic Sunrise with incremental volumes to where we stand today.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Assuming some normal but not \u2013 assuming some ramp-up in the rig count, as you mentioned.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's right.","Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Beard of Coker Palmer. Please go ahead.","David E. Beard - Coker and Palmer Investment Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Dan. Most of my questions have been asked. But I wonder if you could give us a little color on the service costs that you outlined. Is that a 15% decline from average of this year or from this point going forward? And could you give us any color of that number between efficiencies and actually price cuts?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Okay. The cost \u2013 the 15% drilling completion cost \u2013 total well cost reduction is from our average of 2015 costs. And I'm sorry, David, I didn't get the second part of your question.","David E. Beard - Coker and Palmer Investment Securities, Inc.","And just of that 15% decline per lateral foot, how much of that comes from efficiencies versus price declines from vendors?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We had a slide in our most recent investor presentation. And on the completion side, the majority of the cost is from cost reductions. On the drilling side, the majority of the cost is from efficiencies. And we have a slightly higher cost on the total well cost, drilling and complete, completion costs represent a little bit higher percentage of total well cost than the drilling side.","David E.

Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Dan. Thanks for all the color and everything.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, David.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just as a point of clarification, with Atlantic Sunrise, obviously, being larger volumetrically coming on in second half of 2017, is it fair to say that the 2016 program that you have lined out right now, even if Constitution gets delayed even further that this is sort of like the minimal amount of activity that you would have going on in the Marcellus because there's obviously not a whole lot of capital required to keep the production flat. But as you're looking at this multi-year progression ramping into what would be required for Atlantic Sunrise as well, if by some measure we end up thinking that Constitution is going to come on line materially later than anticipated, is there some downside to that 2016 CapEx number?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Downside in the sense that we would reduce our capital program.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You'll be spending less than \u2013 yeah.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We would manage that, yes. We would manage that allocation of capital, and we certainly do not want to have capital sitting out in the field that we can't monetize. So, we would probably reduce our exposure, reduce our capital until the appropriate time that we could plan for the commissioning of the pipeline if we were to see a significant delay in the commissioning. But I wouldn't have expected the approval to occur on Constitution prior to this time. However, I'm not disillusioned to the extent that we don't expect it to come in a timely manner for 2016's estimated commissioning.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I appreciate that. And just a last one for me, Dan or Jeff. Could you contrast, I mean, qualitatively from an operator perspective the differences of the risk in your mind of waiting on Constitution relative to waiting on Atlantic Sunrise and how those two processes \u2013 as investors wait for Constitution to come on here and the process is quite delayed? Can you contrast the experience so far with Atlantic Sunrise and maybe the difference in that risk of delay?","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Atlantic Sunrise is making \u2013 I'll let Jeff weigh in in a second to make kind of editorial comment. But on Constitution, we have been years in discussions, preparation and have fulfilled all of the requests, all the mitigating factors, all of the hurdles that have been brought by the interested parties, including the New York DEC. We have added certainly some of the mitigating factors, added incremental cost to the project. We had a major reroute of the \u2013 that was fine with Constitution to mitigate any watershed issues. And in fact, by that reroute, we improved what we think was any impact. And we have again on stream crossings have extensive plan in place that mitigates any of the concerns about stream crossings. And that has been well documented by the DEC and now has been prepared into a final document. So, I think everybody's pleased with that effort.","Atlantic Sunrise is in that same process now in having discussions for the mitigation factors and looking at the right of ways to be able to mitigate any concerns that any stakeholders might have at that stage. I feel comfortable that the outline and the timing of commissioning that we've laid out is going to be met.","Jeff, you can weigh in on...","Jeffrey W. Hutton - Senior Vice President-Marketing","Yeah. David, probably the biggest difference on the two projects besides just the learning curve aspect of the second project is the route on the Greenfield portion of Atlantic Sunrise is totally in the State of Pennsylvania, where we have a long history of working with the DEP and with the FERC.","And so, I think from a simpler project aspect, it's gone smoothly so far. I mean, the community outreach portion of the project's been very successful. The survey permissions and the right of way acquisitions been very successful to-date. Project is on schedule. And we're \u2013 at this point in time, we look very good in terms of hitting the in-service date.","David A. Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","That's helpful, guys. Thank you.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, David.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dan Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan O. Dinges - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I appreciate the interest in Cabot. I know there are some frustration by all of us on our ability to be able to get the infrastructure in place and commissioned and to be able to move the natural gas in support of all those that are looking forward to having it. I do hope that the takeaway this morning is that Cabot does remain focused in all the right areas, and that is a disciplined focus on the efficiencies and returns while managing our business for the long-term success of the organization.","Additionally, we remain committed to effectively managing those controllable variables that we have in our program and also mitigate the uncontrollables the best as we possibly can. So, again, thank you. And certainly, I think Cabot has some brighter days out in front of it. Thank you, Carrie.","Operator","Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, that this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","Dan Dinges","Thank you, Chuck, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us today for Cabot's second quarter 2019 earnings call. As usual, joining me today on the call are several members of Cabot's management team, I'd first like to remind everyone that this - on this call this morning, we will make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.","Additionally, some of our comments will reflect and refer to non-GAAP financial measures, forward-looking statements and other disclaimers, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in this morning's earnings release.","During the second quarter, we continue to successfully execute on our strategic goals and I'll list them generating positive free cash flow, returning capital to shareholders, improving return on capital employed, delivering growth per debt adjusted share, and maintaining low leverage. All of this was achieved despite lower NYMEX prices during the quarter which retreated to levels the industry has not experienced since the second quarter of 2016.","Second quarter net income was $181 million or $0.43 per share, and adjusted net income excluding selected items was $151 million or $0.36 per share; this represents a 177% increase on adjusted earnings per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter.","Free cash flow for the second quarter was $73 million compared to a free cash flow deficit of $62 million in the prior year comparable quarter. We have now delivered positive free cash flow for 12 of the last 13 quarters.","Year-to-date, we have generated $381 million of positive free cash flow and we are on-track to deliver between $500 million and $625 million of positive free cash flow for the full year based on an average NYMEX price assumption range of $2.60 to $2.80.","For their trailing 12 months, we generated a return on average capital employed of 23.5% compared to 8.5% for the 12 months as of the end of prior year comparable quarter, representing an increase of approximately 1,500 basis points.","The improvement in our financial metrics relative to the prior year comparable quarter was driven by higher production levels, improved realized prices, and lower operating expenses. Production for the quarter of 2.35 Bcf per day was at the high-end of our guidance range and represented an increase of 24% relative to the prior year comparable quarter.","Natural gas price realizations were $2.27 per Mcf, an increase of 6% when compared to the second quarter of 2018. Price realizations before hedges were $0.44 below NYMEX, an improvement of $0.24 compared to the prior year comparable quarter.","Operating expenses decreased to $1.41 per Mcf, a 24% improvement relative to the second quarter of 2018 which was primarily driven by lower exploration expenses resulting from our decision to cease capital allocation to exploration projects at the end of 2018.","As of the end of the second quarter. Our balance sheet remained one of the best in the industry with over $241 million of cash on-hand and a net debt to EBITDAX ratio of 0.6 times.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares at a weighted average share price of $24.63 reducing our shares outstanding to $418.4 million; this represents a 10% reduction in shares outstanding since we reactivated our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2017.","This morning we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the shares repurchase program by 25 million shares, bringing the current remaining authorization to 31.5 million shares or approximately 8% of our outstanding shares. Our year-to-date share repurchases coupled with our anticipated dividend payments for the full year already implies a return of 50% of our anticipated free cash flow for the year at the midpoint of our NYMEX price assumption range.","However, given the continued share price weakness we experienced during the second quarter trading blackout period, we expect to continue to be active on opportunistic share repurchases in the second half of the year while still preserving some cash on the balance sheet to support future return of capital to shareholders.","For the full year, we have adjusted our 2019 production growth guidance to a range of 16% to 18% or 24% to 26% growth on a debt adjusted per share basis. For the most part, the small guidance adjustment is simply a change in our operating plan that will increase the average lateral length on an 8-well pad we began drilling in the second quarter from 8,950 feet laterals to 12,450 feet resulting in an additional 140 completed stages for the year.","Frankly, this decision was not too difficult. I was asked, and you can put yourself in my shoes; do you want to purchase this offset acreage? Slightly delay, our turned in-line date and add over 100 Bcf plus to these eight wells or do we remain on our schedule.","I took the slight delay in the 100 Bcf. Our update - actually additionally, as it relates to absolute third quarter growth figures, we further risk these volumes for potential market conditions. Specifically, the last couple of years the third quarter has been softest period of realizations and it could happen again. So we have decided to maintain maximum flexibility to manage the pace and cadence of our turned in-line.","On our 2019 capital program, the range of $800 million to $820 million reflects the incremental drilling and completion activity from the long laterals of this 8-well pad. In addition, we plan to drill an additional 4 net wells resulting from continued efficiency gains that are generating faster drilling times year-to-date than originally forecasted.","We are firmly committed to disciplined capital spending. However, our rigs are fully contracted through the end of the year, so we made the decision to drill 4 additional wells as opposed to incurring day rates on idle rigs at the end of the year. Given we now have 7 months of actual NYMEX settlements, year-to-date, we tightened our NYMEX price assumption range for the full year to $2.60 to $2.80.","Based on this range of NYMEX prices, we expect to deliver $500 million to $625 million of positive free cash flow, 20% to 24% return on capital employed, and a 38% to 56% growth in adjusted earnings per share.","Given the amount of questions we have received over the past few months regarding our plans for 2020, we decided to issue preliminary 2020 guidance earlier than usual. There are still a number of variables that will become better understood as we get closer to year-end and may impact our 2020 plans including storage levels, NYMEX futures at year-end, and the results of our annual service cost negotiations.","However, based on our current outlook for the year. We believe this preliminary plan provides the best combination of free cash flow, return on capital employed, and growth per share metrics in a lower natural gas price environment.","Our 2020 operating plan is expected to deliver 5% production growth or 7% to 8% growth on a debt-adjusted per share basis from a preliminary capital budget range of $7.20 to $7.25. This does include a 5% exit-to-exit growth rate in 2020 at our budgeted NYMEX price of $2.50. This program is expected to deliver $375 million to $400 million of free cash flow, a return on capital employed of approximately 15%.","At $2.75 NYMEX these metrics increased to $525 million to $550 million of free cash flow and gross fee of approximately 20%. Under both NYMEX price assumptions, we expect to continue to deliver annual dividend growth and opportunistic buyback stock, while maintaining a debt to EBITDA ratio below one-turn.","Not only do we believe this more moderate growth program is the appropriate strategy for maximizing shareholder value in 2020 but we also believe this is the best strategy for the company longer term, given your current outlook for supply growth over the coming years.","Our plan for single - mid-single-digit growth of topline production can result in high single-digit growth in metrics per debt adjusted share as a result of improving cost structure, a reduction in shares outstanding resulting from an active share repurchase program, and a reduction in our absolute debt levels as maturities come due over the next couple of years.","At the risk of stating the obvious, we are all aware of the materials and presentation opining on the state of the macro environment across the sector. We believe that investors, industry analyst are correct, and that we need to continue to be laser focused on free cash flow generation rather than production growth for it's own sake. Particularly given the outlook for future supply growth for both oil and gas.","Going forward, we see absolutely no rationale for continuing to chase double-digit production growth when supply growth could outpace expected demand growth at this time. We can guarantee that Cabot will continue to deliver on it's track record of disciplined capital allocation focused on generating positive free cash flow, improving results on and of capital, delivering economic per share growth and maintaining an iron-clad balance sheet.","Chuck, with that I'll be more than happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Leo Mariani","I was hoping you could provide maybe a little bit more color on 2020, I know it's a preliminary budget but just kind of based on the CapEx levels could you maybe talk a little about some of the changes in activity? Would you guys expect to potentially drop a rig at some point next year; all those rigs under contract; potentially next year would you be kind of fracking fewer wells just trying to get my arms around the reduction in CapEx there.","Dan Dinges","Well, on the '20 CapEx as we've referenced, it's a little bit early and the guidance released earlier than we normally lay it out. I would like to get more granular not trying to dance your question. I'd like to get more granular on our October call as we usually do.","The market is dynamic at best, we saw this morning near three months on the strip price is below $2.20, a lot of moving parts; we're trying to find the best solution to continue what we do and that's deliver free cash flow, an efficient program. So as far as being granular on the 2020 program at this time, I think it's a little premature because it's been really moving a lot as you can appreciate.","Leo Mariani","Yes, that certainly makes sense. Well, perhaps maybe you could just give us an update on sort of what you're seeing out there and in basin, demand projects, and kind of maybe a little bit more specific commentary, just around how you see supply-demand dynamics unfolding in specific Northeast PA market over the next couple of years?","Dan Dinges","And we had our Board meeting yesterday, we had discussions of our in basin demand process, and I'll let Jeff hop on a little bit on it.","Jeffrey Hutton","Yes, the in-basin demand is higher priority here. We've had been successful in the few smaller projects since the last call, they are smaller projects but in the aggregate they are starting to add up. I think currently we have low over 0.5 Bcf of gas that does not get into the interstate markets, a really good thing. We continue to evaluate projects, we're being somewhat selective in that arena, it's also a very competitive market, there is a lot of producers that would like to have good demand projects tied to the gathering system.","So we're being a little bit quiet on how we explain our business model up there. I will say that we're also evaluating a number of opportunities in the interstate capacity markets, we've gotten - it's getting better and better from that regard.","We're still not where we want to be to take over some positions on the long haul side, we think the market will continue to improve but we're definitely seeing opportunities out there that we can pick up some capacity no sooner rather than later, and we're watch that very closely.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Singer","The opportunity that you guys had here to add acreage that would support longer laterals. Can you talk about whether that you see that as a one-off or whether that is something that you could do more of? And then, following up on that if we think about more in or out of basin consolidation what is your latest on the - on your outlook for the Royal Cabot should or could play?","Dan Dinges","On the additional acreage in wherever we might have a pad, offset to either open or others acreage. It's a little bit unique Brian but certainly we have continue to start our beginning expectations of our program with shorter laterals than we actually end up at the end of the year; and that process has been ongoing each of the last handful of years.","We anticipate shorter laterals, we through Phil and his team up there in Pittsburgh are able to extend laterals as we're discussing in various different way, some of it's other acreage, some of it's our own acreage, and some of it's on leased acreage.","So I would say there is the occasion in the future and we would expect to continue to do some of that your other question, Brian. I'm sorry.","Brian Singer","It was more of a larger in-basin or out-of-basin consolidation and your latest thoughts on the role Cabot should or should not play?","Dan Dinges","Consolidation is - it's got to be real unique, to be able to fit a long-term strategy and we continue to evaluate opportunities as we mentioned in the past, and you look at where our acreage lies and the offset acreage that would be available; and you look at the - say the six-county area up in the Northeast. There is a few areas that we have and would have an interest in, there is other areas that we would not have an interest in.","So should the industry as a whole, it's back up a little bit as a whole consolidate just - it should - it should consolidate in a lot of ways to be able to rationalize some of the return profiles that or being experienced it particularly in this low commodity strip.","This commodity strip, if it's persistent is going to be a challenge for a number of companies we have. And we are the lowest cost producer across the space in the natural gas, we've given our numbers at $2.50 NYMEX price and what we can deliver with that; free cash flow, buying back shares, good double-digit return on capital employed, dividend.","So we're in good shape, but overall, the industry is not healthy right now in this space, and this price projections on the strip; and something is going to have to change.","Brian Singer","And if I could just ask one other follow-up. As it relates to the 2020 preliminary guidance, it seems like there is a lot of moving pieces there. Could you talk a little bit about what you see your maintenance capital and underlying corporate decline rate? And then, how that kind of juxtaposes with your expectations for well performance; upper Eagle Ford versus lower Eagle Ford etcetera.","Dan Dinges","Eagle Ford?","Brian Singer","I'm sorry - the Eagle Ford, my gosh, upper Marcellus versus lower Marcellus, not well, that's the second time I have used that one.","Dan Dinges","That's a blast from the past.","Jeffrey Hutton","You're on the wrong call.","Brian Singer","Yes, exactly. Upper Marcellus versus lower Marcellus; sorry about that.","Dan Dinges","Well, you know, our --our current decline you know is the mid to upper 20% decline and a maintenance capital with that assumption is $550 million to $575 million. And as we balance in our upper wells with the drilling of our lower wells you might see a slight tweak in the difference. As we represented the difference is between the upper and the lower wells, but we don't see any dramatic changes from what that maintenance capital is on a go-forward basis.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Campbell","Even though the free cash was modest this quarter, it still provided approximately 1.9 times dividend coverage. I was wondering if, and how you factor in dividend coverage from cash when you contemplate any dividend increases?","Dan Dinges","Well, you know, we look at the entire macro-environment, Jeffrey and look at what our best guess, our crystal ball is, the price and realization environment and also with the strip - actual strip is doing.","We also look at the hedge that - that we have and just see what kind of protection that we might have there. We - you know, we're not looking at the dividend coverage specifically as you've addressed, but we are committed to delivering that dividend where it exists today. And I do think with our ongoing expectations of continuing to push our cost structure down, gaining efficiencies in our operation that we will have the opportunity to manage an increase in the dividend at the appropriate time.","We haven't outlined a specific timetable to do that but it is our intent to continue to manage the dividend in a way that delivers more back to the shareholders. Keep in mind, our balance sheet is really clean. We - maturities are not or are entirely manageable over the next few years. So it kind of depends on what our anticipation is of the near-term realizations that we will see.","Jeffrey Campbell","And I guess to ask another balance sheet question. Is there a minimum amount of cash that you want to leave on the balance sheet or do you intend to use most or all of it for the share buybacks or acquisitions or whatever else you might use it for?","Dan Dinges","Yes. You know our leverage position. We are - we don't take on a lot of risks. We manage that way for - always manage that way quite frankly. Looking at a one-turn is we are entirely comfortable in that range. How much we want to leave there, we're $0.6 at this stage.","We have $241 million of cash there now undrawn, $1.7 billion facility, and so we're comfortable in this range and I don't - yes, I don't anticipate us to deviate a great deal. And quite frankly as we move forward, we'll probably work that down a little bit, but we like the range we're in.","Jeffrey Campbell","I appreciate the color. We look forward to seeing you in New York in a couple of weeks.","Dan Dinges","Right, Jeffrey. Thank you. Look forward to seeing you also.","Operator","The next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Please go ahead.","Charles Meade","Dan to you and your team there. I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail, perhaps on the scale of that - of that acquisition that you - that you did, that extended the laterals? I think you gave us some parameters about how much you extended laterals but how many acres are we talking? Is it - is it something where it's meaningful? You can talk about the - the acquisition price that you put out there for it.","Dan Dinges","It was just like - I don't have an exact. It's $2.5 million plus or minus is what there, it was enough acreage to be able to extend the laterals. We can develop most of that acreage with this extension, and it was just a opportune time to be able to create a win-win. And that win-win allowed the acreage to be developed and - but also allowed a more timely cash return to the owners that might have been developed further out in their program. So it was just a good win-win circumstance.","Charles Meade","And then if I could go back to and I think you - Brian Singer was kind of touching on some of these same points but can you - as far as - you know I recognized it's early to talk about what's baked in the 2020 plan. But can you talk about what kind of assumptions you're using both for the service cost environment that you will be living in 2020? And then maybe also you're well productivity because I think one of the things that people might see from the outside looking in, is it looks like you might be getting less bank for your buck in 2020 than you have in the past. And so...","Dan Dinges","Yes. It's a great question and you know we're probably get beat up because we added a little bit of capital. We moved these turn in line wells out and production might not be where it is on a near-term basis, but it's difficult particularly on a company that is producing - approaching three Bcf a day and we're managing that cadence if you will, that growth with three rigs and two frac crews. So as you bring on a pad or two, you look at the lumpiness that might occur on any given quarter, any two quarters for that matter.","You add into that a soft price out there that we're seeing and the timing of bringing on a pad is a conscious decision for us, and also the cadence of how we would bring on a pad, i.e., do we bring it on as we typically mind with more flush production or do we just slowly - much, much slowly - slower bring it on? And that has an effect, particularly if you have a pad, that you may be forecast that win and that pad was forecast to be 200 million to 250 million cubics feet a day.","You know it didn't take a lot of days or a slide in the schedule to affect how it affects your program, as an example. So we decided to delay this program, bringing on a pad that had that expectation in our forecast for four days.","All right, well that don't seem like a lot, but that's a Bcf of production. So it shows up, particularly if you look at it so granularly in a quarterly perspective. So the numbers that are out there right now, I would caution that you got up and our program -- with a grain of salt, we are very comfortable with the efficiency of our program, the results are wells.","We haven't seen fall-off on any of our averages that we anticipate. So we're comfortable there. As far as a budgeting process. we always add a expectation service cost increases into our projections. We always do that. Just as a matter of course and that gives us a little bit of room. And this is no exception. If, and that's what you see.","However, I would make this statement that in light of where the current strip prices the macro environment is, I would be -- we are going to be looking at that service costs very diligently to see what it's going to take for annual service providers to join Cabot's team.","We are -- and I'll add that we're very pleased with every provider we have out there today, efficient operations and they are part of the team, but we have again arrived as I mentioned, into a pricing environment on prices that we haven't seen and going back to 2016. So it's a difficult, pricing environment and we're going to have those negotiations ongoing here between now and the end of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. Please go ahead.","David Deckelbaum","I was just curious as you think about managing your production in the back half of this year. Just given where the curve is, are you leaving in some ability there. I guess to, would you be curtailing production like the curve is certainly was $2 here?","Dan Dinges","No, we have curtailed in the past our production back- in 2015, 2016. I know we, and that was kind of the second quarter of 2016 for a period of time, we took a half, curtailed half of Bcf a day for a period of time because of the realizations. We're not afraid to do it again, when we forecast that we make projections we do have, and particularly in this environment.","We do lean towards the conservative side of our forecast. We do look at the timing of bringing our wells and managing our production between now and the end of the year. I'll look at the screen this morning, I can say the first three months, the next three months are below $2.20.","Well, if it directionally keeps going that way. We will have a response and how you balance our response operationally what we think our product is worth and trying to stay within the fair of way of guidance is always a balancing act, but we're in difficult times, and we're going to do what's right for the long term and we will take the hits on the short term, but we're going to do what's right on the long-term.","David Deckelbaum","I appreciate that. If I could just ask on the free cash outlook for next year at 250 gas, what are you assuming in terms of I guess unit cash cost savings next year either on just like a, total percentage basis and where this most of the stuff coming from?","Dan Dinges","Yes, we are -- we look at 2019, a little over a $40 as our cash cost which includes financing and so DD&A and all. The 2020 forecast has a kind of right, it's a reduction, but kind of right at $40 is where we are and we expect in rolling forward that will continue to reduce the numbers from there.","David Deckelbaum","And if I could just allowed one more, just you talked about I think the maintenance capital assumption of 550 to 575 is that D&C or is that total corporate level. And I guess, do you see that improving going into 2021, just given the slowdown in 2020?","Dan Dinges","That's a good question. And Matt has been granular in this. So, Matt, you want to?","Matt Kerin","Yes, David, this is Matt. That does include about $50 million of annual non D&C capital. But I think that's something that everyone needs to take into consideration when they're looking at our $725 million guide for next year that was about $50 million there that goes into certain projects we're working on whether is some compression, whether it's buying new water trucks for our service subsidiary, whether it's some lease acquisition as we start having some land exploration.","So obviously the D&C capital is going to be significantly lower than that 7 to 725 that we've talked about and yes, I do expect to see a moderation in base declines as we move into 2020 and 2021 which would presumably result in lower maintenance capital in the out years.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please go ahead.","Michael Hall","A lot have of been addressed on the maintenance capital front, just to follow up there on that question, I think you previously disclosed around $500 million of maintenance capital versus the 550 to 575. I was just curious as to kind of what changed or is it accounted for in that $50 million of annual non D&C?","Scott Schroeder","Yes. So, Michael, that number that we put out there that was really from two or three years ago and we were assuming at the time 2016 service cost prices which obviously we've seen a little bit of upward pressure since the troughs of the service price environment since then.","Additionally, we do have some incremental non D&C capital like I alluded to, I mean we're spending $10 million this year on water trucks for our service subsidiary. We're looking at some pad level, well level of compression projects that ultimately are 100% plus type IRR projects because they allow us to see production uplifts, but ultimately 11 years into the program when you're producing at a $650 million and $700 million wells, 650 to 700 producing wells you just going to have ongoing capital that's outside of your drilling and completion program. So it's a little bit different as it's really an apples and oranges relative to that number from 2016.","Michael Hall","Okay, understood. And then\u2026","Scott Schroeder","Let me be really clear, we're not seeing any type of degradation and well productivity or capital efficiency or anything. This is just the nature of running a program that's close to 3 Bcf a day of production now and so this is just the reality of having this between operation.","Michael Hall","Yes, I hear you. And then I guess you alluded to the changing service cost environment versus that last disclosure, what is the latest kind of well cost for a given lateral length for you guys and how do you guys play that through in that 2020 guide?","Dan Dinges","Well, we have -- it\u2019s kind of referenced on the 2020. I mean, this year's guide on the capital with his eight well program was an example of the incremental 140 stages, but we are seeing an efficiencies in our drilling and completion program and have captured, if you will, time enough through those efficiencies to add four incremental wells to our program at the end of the year. So you can kind of measure the efficiency gains in that way.","Michael Hall","Yes, I guess specifically, I was just curious on like cost per well for given lateral length. Do you have that?","Scott Schroeder","The odd read against costs right now about $1,000 per lateral foot. That's generally been the average for this year. Again, we're assuming a little bit of cost inflation, as we go into 2020. But we have the next few quarters to figure out and frankly some of the softness we see in the market, we wouldn't be surprised to see those numbers go down, but as Dan alluded to in the prepared remarks, we're just assuming that for the time being and a lock-in transpire between now and year-end, as we start to ramp-up those negotiations.","Michael Hall","Okay.","Dan Dinges","And I'll add to that on the lateral length there is some material out there regarding lateral lengths and efficiencies and gains out there. I have all the confidence in the world and our team to be able to work with the technologies that are available and efficiencies that are available on completions to see the efficiency gains that maybe out there. So, we look forward to continue to monitor any new technologies or efficiency gains that might be out there in the industry.","Michael Hall","You kind of, you're hinting that toward what I was kind of getting at, that 1,000 per foot is a good higher laying some of the peers down in the Southwest. Is there anything structural that would drive that higher level meaning like, is it depths or is there some apples and oranges involved here, do you think?","Matt Kerin","I think you're hitting on that it's apples and oranges. I mean I think what and where, as Matt alluded to in the next six months, because we did see those presentations. We're doing a deeper dive, but as you know from Cabot D&A and where we've been forever, ours is all in. We are not cherry picking and excluding some aspects of what's going on the pad ours has everything in it and that's probably the biggest difference if you broke out every single piece. You will find things - missing in other areas by some and Cabot's we'll have everything in it.","Michael Hall","All right.","Dan Dinges","Michael there will be. We don't see numbers out there, and I don't think that I don't react when I see numbers out there","Michael Hall","Sure.","Dan Dinges","That would be different in Cabot, so I can assure you with the detail of the spreadsheet I will receive that has every single item and every nut and bolt in a number will be furnished to mix and we will be able to manage.","Scott Schroeder","And at the end of the day, the report card is in the 10-K the total cost incurred. And what the ultimate finding cost is for what they booked that regardless of what the headline IR deck number is, there it is.","Michael Hall","Yes and you recycle ratio is quite a bit better as well as you point out in your deck, so that's clear enough guys, I appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Grigel with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Paul Grigel","Following up on the maintenance CapEx items there was the comment that as the organization grows maintenance CapEx may go up over time. Just as well as age if growth were to continue at some nominal rate should we expect the maintenance CapEx is relatively flat to that, is that offset by the kind of declines within the underlying corporate decline rate. Just trying to understand, maybe on a time plus two or three years out where we should be thinking maintenance CapEx heads?","Dan Dinges","Yes Paul again Matt, digs in these numbers, regularly and I'll let him give you the color.","Matt Kerin","Yes so perhaps I misspoke, or maybe it was just a misunderstanding. But what I was trying to say is that if we wanted to hold the Q4 exit rate from 19 flat into 2020, that was the 550 to 575 Dan kind of alluded to. If we wanted to continue to hold that level flat going into 2021, our expectation would be that maintenance capital would probably be 40 million to 50 million even lighter than the 2020 levels because you are going to have a more moderated base decline.","Now, obviously our plan would hopefully be, if we can get a little bit support from the macro environment to not just hold levels flat and obviously our plan for the year already assumes a 5% exit-to-exit growth rate. And so presumably, if you are growing over time to 3 Bcf, 3.5 Bcf, whatever the number is ultimately at that level. Yeah, we'll have a higher maintenance capital amount, but it will be of a much higher base of production and obviously we will result in much higher free cash flow levels.","Paul Grigel","And then I guess maybe one for Dan here at a high level if you guys are, I think you maintenance CapEx is in that 550 to 575 range and doing a back of the envelope kind of exit-to-exit rate growth it looks like it's low single digits. Just as you kind of lap, some of the growth from this year a trade-off of 125 million to 150 million for some nominal growth.","I guess how did you arrive - at this kind of current one realizing its initial as opposed to maybe even a lower growth or true absolute maintenance CapEx program and another 100\/125 plus to buy back stock or other uses for free cash flow?","Dan Dinges","Yes Paul, it sounds like you are sitting in our room talking about it. We have many sensitivities on how we would guide on our group, the supply side has grown rapidly. There is all kinds of discussions every single day out there about what the industry ought to do in regard to the supply demand match. And as I have stated in my notes, I fully support the comments that I'm hearing out there that we have enough supply today.","And that Cabot is going to do what is necessary to deliver the best return to its shareholders. And part of that equation is to land in a production spot, whether it's just flat production or if it is a small growth with the commodity price. We're using in 2020 case that\u2019s 250. We're trying to thread the needle on what is the best landing spot in this environment. We think it is absolutely wrong for Cabot to go out and be double-digits or grow into this market.","And with the three rigs and two frac crews, we're kind of throttled back about as far as we can get. And it's kind of that 5% number. If we go to straight maintenance then maybe we don't have three-frac crew - I mean three rigs, the entire year. Maybe the two frac crews are too many for the entire year, but that's the balance and the tweaking that we tried to try and to manage. And the reset for Cabot and what we look at what's good for our shareholders. Is that we're not going to grow as much as we could.","Paul Grigel","No that's right maybe one just real fast follow-up. Was there any discussion within that idea of, if you went to a true maintenance CapEx that it preserves inventory at kind of sub 250 prices and save that for a better day?","Dan Dinges","Yes, there is that discussion and we're again. I don't know exactly what's right or what's wrong, but as we sat around the table and putting a reduced production profile out and kind of looking at our numbers prudently and trying to layer in into our budget. A little bit of cost inflation and being conservative like we do, the over and under for what the reaction was going to be was, yeah, we\u2019re probably - see the under. But for the long-term we think what we're doing is right for our long-term shareholders.","Matt Kerin","Yes and Paul, this is Matt. I'd add I understand your logic, but we're really only talking about 15 to 20 extra wells off of an inventory base of 2,900 locations. So we're not really - we're splitting hairs over that type of number. I think when we're looking at thread the needle here we have the luxury of doing both, we can invest in the long-term value creation of the business by continuing to grow production in a modest way and especially on a per share basis in a responsible way.","But still generate free cash flow at 250 which obviously most others cannot do. So we think it's about balancing both long-term value creation through continuing to invest in the business, but also making sure that we have ample amounts of free cash flow to continue to return to shareholders.","Keep in mind we also have cash on the balance sheet that could go back to shareholders. And we still have a non-core asset in a pipeline interest that we could monetize also incrementally return to shareholders. So we think there'll be plenty of opportunities to return cash to shareholders over the coming months and years.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dan Dinges for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.","Dan Dinges","Thanks, Chuck. And thank you all for the questions follow-up question certainly centered around the same focus that we had in the boardroom on how we're going to manage through a low commodity strip. I appreciate the opportunity to give additional color. We look forward to another update in October. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"4501":["Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE:COG) Q2 2014 Earnings Call July 24, 2014  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Dan O.

Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Cabot Oil & Gas Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO of Cabot Oil & Gas. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan O. Dinges","Thank you, Youssef, and good morning to all. I appreciate you joining us for this second quarter call. With me today, as usual, I do have several members of the Cabot executive team. And also, before we get started, the standard boilerplate, the forward-looking statements included in the releases do apply to my comments today.","First, I'd like to touch upon a few of the financial and operating highlights from the second quarter that were outlined in this morning's release, I think, all of which indicates some positive numbers. Equivalent net production for the second quarter was 1.402 million -- excuse me, 1,402 million cubic foot per day, an increase of 34% over the prior year's comparable quarter. This also represents a 5% sequential increase over the first quarter, driven by a 4% increase in daily natural gas volumes, and a 39% increase in daily liquid volumes. Of particular note, oil production for the quarter increased 65% compared to the prior year's comparable quarter, when adjusting for last year's mid-continent and West Texas asset sales. Year-to-date, our equivalent production is up 34% compared to last year, in line with our current guidance. Discretionary cash flow for the quarter was approximately $332 million, an increase of 12% compared to the second quarter of '13. And then for the quarter, Cabot generated approximately $50 million of free cash flow, highlighting the capital efficiency of our program, and that's despite the lower natural gas prices. Net income, excluding selected items for the second quarter, was $115 million, an increase of 21% compared to the second quarter of 2013. Our unit cost, another area of improvement, continues to trend down, decreasing 16% year-over-year to $2.59 per Mcfe, with per unit cash cost of only $1.27 per Mcfe.","Let's move to the region. First, the Marcellus. The company continues to experience exceptional well productivity, as evidenced by the step-out results that were reported in today's press release. The consistency of our acreage to the north and east, while we expected these results, was confirmed by the step-out wells. It is still early in the production cycle, some of these wells, but we are pleased with the results today and expect the EURs per foot on these wells to be in line with our well results we reported at year end.","Net production for the field was 1.26 Bcf per day, up 4% over the first quarter, but did fall a little bit short of our internal expectations. This shortfall was exclusively a result of the ongoing issues directly related to gathering operations and not related to well performance. As we pointed out in the first quarter, Williams had experienced significant downtime with their operations during the extreme winter conditions. Unfortunately, some difficulties persisted throughout the second quarter, which were unrelated to weather. We have been in constant contact with Williams, and have recently seen operational improvements. However, throughout our discussions with Williams, we have made it very clear exactly what our expectations are moving forward, and we do believe Williams' operating results will continue to improve. Despite this unexpected dynamic, Cabot still achieved the midpoint of its production growth guidance for the first 6 months of '14, and we reaffirm our production guidance for the remaining 6 months of '14 and the full year of 2015.","During the third quarter, approximately 60,000 horsepower of additional compression will be added to our gathering system. This new capacity will alleviate high line pressure in certain areas and will also provide for compressor redundancies throughout the system. Having this spare capacity will definitely mitigate a significant amount of the compressor downtime experienced during the first half of the year. We continue to operate 6 rigs in the Marcellus, and expect to hold that rig count flat through 2015, based on our current operating plan. We plan to drill and complete approximately 60 additional wells during the second half of 2014. It certainly is nice to be able to operate only 6 rigs in a field and deliver top-tier production growth of such a large production profile.","Now let's move to the Eagle Ford, where we had some highlights. Our Eagle Ford team continues to work to maximize drilling and completion efficiencies in our core Buckhorn position in the oil window of the Eagle Ford. As a reminder, we currently have over 53,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, with approximately 43,000 net acres at our Buckhorn prospect, which is located predominantly in Frio and Atascosa Counties. Cabot has 3 rigs drilling in the field, and by the end of the third quarter, all 3 rigs will be converted to walking rigs capable of effective, efficient pad drilling.","Pad development equates to drilling and completion cost savings in excess of $500,000 per well, and the facility cost attached to pad development is a cost savings in excess of $200,000 per well on a multi-pad site. The team has shown significant performance improvements in 2014, which has been driven by the continued optimization of our drilling and completion operations in the play, some of the recent initiatives, including drilling longer laterals, reducing the spacing between frac stages and increasing the amount of proppant per foot.","For the first half of 2014, our typical well was more than 25% longer than our average well drilled in '13. We have further reduced our stage spacing in the Eagle Ford, and modified the proppant size we use in our frac jobs, both of which have resulted in a significant increase in fracture conductivity. In the second quarter, our average stage spacing decreased 15%, compared to the average spacing for our '13 program. This equates to more stages per well and more proppant per lateral foot. In '14, we have also increased our proppant per foot by 15% to 20%, over our 2013 levels.","On the efficiency front, also, we continue to see an improvement in drilling days and drilling cost per foot. In fact, recently, we achieved a new record for us, for drilling days, drilling to TD in only 7 days for a 6,400-foot lateral well. As we highlighted in the press release, during the quarter, we placed 10 wells on production, that have now produced for at least 30 days. These wells achieved an average 30-day production rate of 840 Boe per day per well, with a 92% oil cut, from an average lateral length of 6,700 feet. The approximate well cost of these wells is about $7 million. Certainly, these wells are trending above our $500,000 barrels per BO -- per well EUR.","We also recently drilled and completed our first 300-foot down-spaced well, and have been pleased with the results to date. We will continue to monitor the production profile from this pad and have additional 300-foot space wells planned for the rest of our 2014 program. 300-foot downspacing could increase our location count at Buckhorn by 25% to 30%.","While we did not add a material amount of new Eagle Ford acreage during the quarter, we do continue to assess different opportunities throughout the trend, and anticipate adding more meaningful to our position throughout the balance of the year.","And now the remainder of my comments will be addressed to answer the possible questions we might have. In regard to pricing, we were certainly all aware of the pricing dynamics surrounding the Marcellus, and it continues to put pressure on the differentials throughout the Northeast United States, and the overall weakness realized -- in realized gas prices affecting all of the Marcellus and Utica producers. Cabot certainly is in this same position. As we continue to experience differentials that can be attributed to continued growth of supply, increased demand in the in-service of new long haul pipes designated to take Marcellus gas out of the region will certainly help the differentials. As we explained on our last call, we had certain winter contracts roll-off prior to April 1, and we anticipated slightly weaker realized prices for the summer period. As expected, for the second quarter, our realized prices before the impact of hedges averaged $0.89 below NYMEX, which is in line with the guidance we provided in our investor presentation. We expect our realized price point to be reduced slightly in the third quarter, and expect to see improvement as we enter the traditional heating season.","Moving to Constitution Pipeline update. We continue to make additional progress as we await the issuance of the final Environmental Impact Statement. The project is moving ahead on all fronts, as Constitution continues to acquire additional survey permits, right-of-ways and permits required to begin construction schedule for early 2015. We continue to see frequent updates from the Constitution team at Williams. And despite the delay we saw in FERC's issuance of the final EIS, there has been no change to the expected in-service date that Williams provided us back in December of '13. As a result, we remain optimistic for an in-service date of late 2015 to early 2016, but we do recognize several approval milestones do need to be met.","In regard to share repurchases, anticipating that question, share repurchases are still part of our capital allocation discussion internally. Year-to-date, we have not repurchased any shares. Currently, management is focused on balancing long-term development opportunities with share repurchases. Our near-term share repurchase activity will be coordinated with the success of additional acreage acquisitions and the corresponding acceleration opportunities on any of that new acreage we will acquire, and certainly, the share price is of consideration also.","In summary, even in this challenged pricing environment, we continue to generate growth in earnings and cash flow, led by our top-tier production growth. Current natural gas price realizations, certainly while not robust, are still manageable, and allow us to generate best-in-class returns. And add to this, the fact that our efforts in the Eagle Ford will continue to deliver strong oil growth, with our efficiency improvements and results. Plus, in an expanded rig count in the second half of the year, you will see these strong oil production growth. So what can you expect from Cabot is that we will continue to deliver strong production growth. We'll maintain a very efficient capital program, with excellent returns despite the differential effects. We'll add significantly to our reserve book. We'll capture margins with our continuing efficiency gains and operations and unit costs, and we will continue our efforts to expand our investment focus.","Youssef, with that, myself or the management team will be happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Dan, I want to say, I think with your last comments there, I think a lot of us, me included, scratched off a lot of the questions that we had planned. So I think you maybe -- there's been a theme on recent calls. So it's -- thanks for addressing that. I want to, if I could, get you to decompose a bit the results on those 3 pads, with the 191 stages. I know you said that they're in line with the estimates. And I guess, that means your EUR for year end. But can you discuss at all maybe some of the variability that -- when you're with North, and it got thinner, or when you went East, if there's any variance around that 1.25 Mmcf per stage?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, there's not a lot of variance, and each well can be unique in its own way, Charles. When you -- and that statement is consistent with the other areas we've drilled also. We have to make sure that we stay within the exact zone that we select. Down south, where it's a little bit thicker, we have a little bit more leeway to stay within that zone. But certainly, the thickness does not diminish significantly to the north, just slightly, and where we stay very vigilant on making sure that we stay within the zone that we're trying to target. But aside from that, we've been very pleased with the results. The frac spacing that we continue to play with, between 150- and 200-foot space fracs, we're toying with, and continuing to gather data in that regard. The flow back process that we employ up to the north and east has been similar. The type of frac we put on the wells was similar with the amount of proppant per stage and the pump pressures that we utilize. And the type of proppant has been consistent. So we are not seeing, again, any differences in either way, either it's our implementation and how we drilled a well, except being more vigilant and staying in zone, but our completion techniques in operation side is consistent. Flowback is the same, and as indicated, the results are good.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Well, that's great. I imagine you have to be quite pleased with that consistency. And if I could just take one follow-up, on the Eagle Ford, if I remember correctly, I think that on your last call, Dan, you were talking about that your organic kind of lease acquisition efforts were underway. And that, I think, you indicated that was your focus. Is that still -- is that correct? And if so, is that still your posture? Or are you may be looking more at maybe some producing property packages, as some people exit the play?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. Well, we have evaluated through our internal team, not only the primary term or open acreage out there, but certainly, on small bolt-on type of opportunities, we evaluate also. Those bolt-on opportunities could come in the form of either just acreage or it could come with a little bit of production, but we're evaluating both.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. So you're agnostic on that. It's just -- you're just looking for value and how it fits with your existing position?","Dan O. Dinges","Exactly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Allman with JP Morgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you talk about the differential, the gas differential, so far in July? And then, Dan, what are your expectations for the differential, cash differential in 2015?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, I'll let Jeff field that. But I will say this, just from an overall standpoint, that the differential by itself is going to be a certainly a moving target. But the differential will also be -- the final differential would be -- or the final realization would be affected also by the price of NYMEX. So as you see, the fluctuations in NYMEX, I think, you'll see the fluctuations also in what the exact differential will be. But I'll let Jeff answer the question in regard to the July and '15.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Okay, Joe. I'm glad that -- excuse me, I'm glad that Dan led in with that quick summary on the differences that we expect to see between the differentials on our higher NYMEX number rather than our lower NYMEX number. July did come in slightly less than our average for the second quarter. That said, we've sort of expected that. We also expect that to continue as we reach the winter season. Again, weather will play a role here, and if we see a normal winter to a good winter, like we saw last year, we expect the differentials to strengthen a little bit. As far as 2015 goes, personally I don't see much difference between that year and this year in terms of differentials, but again a lot of that has to do with this winter and the weather we will experience then.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, no, that's helpful. And then a question on Constitution, so what are the key hurdles that can affect, whether that really comes on in late '15, early '16 or if it's delayed?","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Okay, Joe. This is Jeff again. Yes, the primary key hurdle is the final EIS statement. We expect that out in the next 2, 4 weeks or so. The certificate will follow under a normal process. With that, along the same path, we'll be -- and have been working with the New York DEC and the PA DEP on getting the permits necessary for our construction. But the final EIS is a significant event and our expectations are we'll see that on schedule. And the in-service date at this point, like Dan mentioned, in his speech, is still scheduled late '15 or early '16.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, just with Eagle Ford. I mean, Dan, it sounds as if you're planning on adding a significant amount of acreage in the Eagle Ford, and you previously talked about just some bolt-ons or potentially some production added with that. But are you also considering a bigger asset acquisition or might even consider a corporate acquisition?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, right now, we're looking at the asset acquisition being in the form of whether it's just additional leases or small bolt-on type of opportunities. The reason is very clear. If you look at our results that we've been able to post, with the type of wells that we're drilling, the efficiency gains that we've had that I've mentioned on the drill side and completion side. We have had in our investor presentation on a typical 500,000 EUR-type well will cost $7 million, and our lateral length being in this type well being consistent with the lateral length in the number of stages that we've done on our last 10 wells. At $90, we did over 60% return on that type of well. Two things in regard to these 10 wells. The 10 wells are trending above this type curve, for the Eagle Ford economics that we have presented. And certainly, our realized price is higher than the $90 that we've represented to get over that 60% return. So we are looking at the additional opportunities out there, with a economic improvements that we've seen and the efficiency improvements that we've seen to take advantage of any additional acreage we can fund.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm wondering if you'd address the takeaway situation. Obviously, there's a huge amount of demand for additional long-haul pipe out of Appalachia in general. I'm just curious for your position, specifically. Have you examined building your own midstream solutions out in Northeast PA? And I'm thinking really, in addition to Constitution?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, we have -- certainly, Constitution, we've talked about. Everybody's aware of it, that the commissioning of that particular pipeline will give Cabot an additional 500 million cubic foot net a day of gas, going through to a different price point. We have also -- are participating in the Central Penn pipeline, which is scheduled for the latter part of '17. Our participation in that is a -- if you will, a midstream investment. But more importantly, we're the foundation shipper on that particular Central Penn pipeline, and that will allow us to move an incremental 850 million cubic foot a day. And again, an anticipated commissioning of that in the latter part of '17. And I might add that, certainly, we're very in tune. Jeff stays up-to-date on every moving part out there in the midstream market, and we have ongoing discussions with how we're going to continue to move our gas, with the growth expectations that we have.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Partly, the question arose because the asset, really, is so tremendous that if you had adequate pipeline capacity, I think, you could grow at basically whatever rate you want it to grow. So maybe there are other considerations. Maybe the macro picture is a part of it. Are there other things you're taking into account when you evaluate your midstream needs?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, we -- kind of back to my comment I made about drilling in a field with 6 rigs. Having a -- I don't know who's producing the most gas in the entire Marcellus or Utica area, but we're close to the either 1, 2 or 3, and at producing a 1.5 billion cubic foot per day up there and being able to grow off that base with only 6 rigs. I don't know who's producing the most, but I know that we have the least rigs running in the area, particularly with that growth profile off of that larger base. So we know we can continue to grow this tremendous asset, a 30 to 40 Tcf resource opportunity up there. We know the present value is important to all of us. So everything we do is to enhance the present value of that asset. A couple of things that will be happening in the future, we're all aware of. I think we all believe that demand is going to be enhanced. Whether that demand is in power generation, industrial use, LNG exports, all of that is moving forward. So we're optimistic. Though we are in a little bit of a lull period, we're optimistic that in the foreseeable future, demand is going to be enhanced. And I think that demand enhancement's certainly going to be coupled with the midstream efforts that are ongoing right now to attach the supply area to existing demand areas and incremental new demand areas. So we think we have a bright future.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, can you speak to the potential you have in the dry gas Utica in West Virginia or even if there's some potential issue there?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, yes, we're in the Utica play. We have some acreage to the North, over 50,000 acres to the north area of the play, and we have some extensive acreage to the south area of the play, where we are. Whether it's the dry area or the liquids rich area, the Utica, we are looking at it. We're evaluating. We have a rig active at this point in time, still an exploratory project for us, but we're optimistic with the geology we see.","Andrew Venker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Dan, is there a potentially get an update on well results this year?","Dan O. Dinges","Possibly. We're -- we can't guarantee anything at this stage, but it's certainly very possible that we could have some initial results this year.","Operator","Next, we have Pearce Hammond with Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Dan, I was curious what your thoughts or plan was for '15 hedging?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. We have looked at '15 hedging, Pearce, and we have considered it and looking at not only the -- NYMEX, certainly, it's just one component of it. But we had -- before, we've kind of changed our accounting process and now go to mark-to-market. We had tried to tie some of our -- and looked at trying to tie some of our '15 volumes to a particular pipe. But what we saw was: one, the -- it was not a fairly liquid market; and two, the differentials that we would have had to lock in, in advance, were punitive. And what we have seen each month is that the forward-looking curve gives a significantly higher discount than the actual month realizations, and we were not prepared to lock in those punitive differentials in advance in a illiquid market. But we -- as we've indicated -- or as we illustrated with our hedge book, we are interested in hedging, and we'll continue to try to find ways to mitigate the volatility.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","But it is your expectation that'll you put on some NYMEX Henry Hub hedges for next year?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Okay. And then my second question is really strong oil production growth this quarter, congrats on that. Would you be willing to put out some oil production growth guidance for '14?","Dan O. Dinges","Scott's shaking his head, no. But right now, with us moving a new rig into the area, us looking at additional acreage out there and how we might move our activity around a little bit, I'm more comfortable just to be putting it out there with what we have. But I am optimistic that what we have out there is certainly reachable.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And then one last one for me, and I apologize if you've already mentioned this in your prepared remarks, but what is current net production in the Marcellus? Or what does the month-to-date production look like there?","Dan O. Dinges","Gross production out there is -- we're working through these William issues that I've discussed, but we're over -- we're somewhere in between 1.4 to 1.5.","Operator","Next, we have Matt Portillo with TPH.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions for me. I was wondering if we can get an update on how your downspacing test is performing in the Marcellus?","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. Just real quickly, we have several examples out there. We had a 10-well pad that we've been producing now about 9 months, about 9 months. We had our closest spacing on that pad. That spacing had the lower Marcellus spaced at 500 feet, and we still like the trend line on our curve from those wells. We do continue to look at and implement additional downspace opportunities. So -- but I guess, to say it differently, we are going to downspace further. So everything we've seen is positive so far.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And so is the plan there to potentially maximize the amount of wells you're able to fit in that section, potentially with a little bit of interference. So you're not seeing interference at this point?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, it's still early in the curve to be able to make that definitive statement. The answer is no, we haven't. But it's still early in the production cycle when you think about how you're going to be able to ascertain what is incremental reserves and what is acceleration reserves.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And just my second question, on the Eagle Ford, as you mentioned, you're starting to see the returns exceed that threshold you guys have talked about in the past. I'm wondering if you could provide a little bit of color around the acceleration potential? And then, I guess, just as a quick follow-up, in regards to the completions you're using in the basin, could you give us a little bit of color on kind of what your current completions are in terms of the size of the fracs you're doing and the number of stages you're completing?","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. On the acceleration side of the Eagle Ford, we have brought in another rig. We plan on implementing a walking package on a couple of rigs that do not have that capability today, which will help accelerate our efficiencies, as we've discussed. We've mentioned that we're looking and continue to look at additional acreage out there. With that opportunity, if we have success, I think you can anticipate additional acceleration, maybe another rig in that as a result of additional acreage. So that is also a way of doing it. When you look at the completions and you look at the 10-well that we recently did, the average lateral length was 6,700 foot or so. We had, oh, an average of 26, 27 stages in those wells. And the items that I mentioned, we're toying with the proppant size. We are looking at the amount of proppant per stage. So all of those things, we're gathering additional information on and we continue to improve with the -- again, are type of things that we're exploring out there.","Operator","The next question comes from Subash Chandra with Jefferies.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Following up on the Eagle Ford questions, 2 for me. One is can you be more specific just on the proppant intensity, the pounds per stage, the pounds per foot, what you might be trying there in terms of escalation? And then were the 8,500-foot laterals included in this update? And finally, if you could just refresh me on the net locations you have remaining in your current acreage?","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. I'll take this first on the location size. If you use 400-foot spacing, we are probably over 600 locations. Now we're looking at the downspacing going down to the 300-foot. And as I mentioned, that could add 25% to 30% or so to the location count. On the proppant, I'll let Steve Lindeman have a brief discussion on the proppant question, on what we're doing on a per foot basis, and maybe how we're tweaking some of the proppant size, without getting into too much detail.","Steven W. Lindeman","Yes, just quickly. If we look at our 2013 program, we had pumped a lot of 40\/70 mesh sand. In the -- with a 300 -- 400,000-pound range, we've increased our proppant to 30-50, and we've actually done some 20-40 jobs now. And we're pumping about 400,000 to 500,000 pounds per stage on those treatments. And then as Dan mentioned earlier, we are narrowing our spacing from 275, that we had last year, down to something below 250 this year.","Subash Chandra - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. Okay, and just the final one was if the 8,500 foot wells were included in this update?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. Some of those 8,500-foot wells were in the 10-well average that I indicated to you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum with KeyBanc.","David Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just to clarify, you talked about, perhaps, adding another rig in the Eagle Ford. But the 2015 guidance assumes, on terms of overall growth, that you're using 3 rigs in the Eagle Ford and 6 in the Marcellus?","Dan O. Dinges","No, that's correct.","David Deckelbaum - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And how do you, I guess, balance? You did talk about you haven't done any share repurchases to date. I guess, do you look at, perhaps, putting a rig in the Eagle Ford as a better use of capital than perhaps thinking about share repurchases right now? Or is there -- are they not necessarily mutually exclusive?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, they're not mutually exclusive. However, with the efficiency gains and what we've been able to see with the realized pricing, the Eagle Ford is furnishing excellent returns. And as I mentioned, we have -- and you mentioned, we have 3 rigs running there now. If in fact, we can be successful on additional acreage, we could increase that rig count also, not only for our guidance on '15, but we might be able to do something earlier than that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Singer.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This may be repetitive, in which case, I apologize. But your CapEx for the quarter was down a bit and the lowest in a while, and I just wanted to see if you could talk about the outlook for capital spending for the rest of the year? How the Marcellus prices could make that fluctuate one way or the other, in terms of the budget that you have outlined?","Scott C. Schroeder","Brian, this is Scott. We reaffirmed the capital guidance last night, which is 1.375 to 1.475. That plan -- again, there might be some variability within it, but that's still the plan that was reaffirmed 2 days ago, in our board meeting. It's basically a timing difference, just some of the timing and the flow-through of the dollars associated with the completion operation and the drilling operation. We still expect to be within that range. So there'll be -- from where we were thinking, maybe earlier in the year, there's going to be more in the second half of the year. And unless there's some huge dramatic fall off, worse than any of us anticipate, that plan is not going to change.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that is actual change in activity in terms of the level of spending in the second half? Or that's kind of accounting noise, where you actually probably really did spend more in Q2 than it gets reported for GAAP?","Scott C. Schroeder","Yes, that's accruals. It's accounting noise.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, got it. So effectively, you think you're generally on pace, as opposed do you expect some acceleration in your base level spending?","Scott C. Schroeder","Correct.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then I think you mentioned share repurchases in your opening comments. Can you add any more color as to what you would need to see to become more aggressive on that front?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, as I mentioned, we're trying to just dovetail out with the management of our capital exposure, and some of the activity that we are in the middle of, Brian, regarding lease negotiations and acreage negotiations. We wanted to flush all that out and balance with that. And with success or without, they're not, again, mutually exclusive. But we felt like that we wanted to do that, and have some resolution, if you will, on a couple of ideas that we're thinking about, before we jumped out and bought additional shares.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marshall Carver with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.","Marshall H. Carver - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC","Most of my questions were already asked. I do have a question on the downspacing test in the Marcellus. How many additional downspacing tests are you planning for the back half of this year, with the 500-foot spacing? And what are your average well spacing for this year?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. Marshall, we're going to -- going all the way down in the lower Marcellus to 500 feet. We're going to watch the wells that we have done that close together to see how they perform. We wanted a benchmark that was very close, and we think 500 foot is very close for the Marcellus. But away from the 500 foot, for example, we have a large pad that we are going to drill. And that will -- all of the wells on that large pad will be downspaced less than 1,000 foot. So we do -- and in earnest, we are continuing a downspacing effort, but the 500-foot was a downspaced distance that, again, is going to give us some very, very good data. But I would not anticipate that the entire Marcellus would be able to be downspaced to 500-foot, but I do anticipate it would be able to be downspaced less than 1,000.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions. We will now -- this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dan Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan O. Dinges","Thank you, Youssef, and I appreciate all the questions. The questions' fairly narrowed in a band. But again, the takeaway from my closing comments prior to the Q&A, Cabot's going to be able to deliver some good results with our growth -- the production growth, our capital efficiencies. I think you're getting a flavor on what we're going to be able to do with our Eagle Ford operation and -- though it's early stage in what we think we can do with our increase in liquids volumes. But we're optimistic that we're on the right track in that area, and directionally, I think you can anticipate the additional capital will be spent in that particular area. So with that, again, I appreciate the interest in the second quarter call, and look forward to visiting with you all on the third quarter call. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO of Cabot Gas.","Dan O. Dinges","Thank you, Shea. I appreciate it. And good morning, and thank you for joining us for this call. A couple of members with me on the management team, Scott Schroeder, CFO; Jeff Hutton, our VP of Marketing; Steve Lindeman, VP of Engineering and Technology; Matt Reid, our VP of Regional -- and Regional Manager; and Todd Liebl, our VP of Land and Business Development. ","As you're aware, the standard forward-looking statements included in the press release do apply to my comments today. At this time, we have several things to cover and expand on the press releases that were issued last night. I'll cover the first quarter financial results, recent successes from our drill bit effort, followed by a discussion of our operations. ","Now before I do go into the details of these topics, I'll start with a brief highlight of last night's release. Cabot grew production 58% over the comparable quarter last year, including a 55% growth in natural gas plus an impressive 138% growth in liquids. The growth figures include only a few days of the new production we recently brought online in the Marcellus coming from a 7-mile step-out to the east of our existing production. The wells have free flowed 70 million to 80 million-plus cubic foot per day since being turned in line. Also of note are increasing liquids production. It's continuing in both Oklahoma and Texas. Plus, we'll cover briefly the initial down-spacing success we had in our Buckhorn area of the Eagle Ford. And finally, we're excited to announce our exposure to the Utica liquids window of about 50,000 net acres. This potential will be tested with a well to spud this summer. ","Let's move to financial results, and last night the company reported clean earnings of approximately $29 million driven by our significant production increase that did more than offset the weak natural gas prices. ","On the production side, in terms of the significant uptick in production, the Marcellus, Eagle Ford, and to a little bit lesser extent, the Marmaton were the driving forces. One item to note is that the 2011 first quarter results include 2.5 Bcf of Rocky Mountain production, which we sold last year. The equivalent pro forma growth would be about 70% regardless that the quarter was a record breaker production-wise. ","The first quarter production landed at the midpoint of guidance even with the shutdown of the Lathrop Compressor Station during the last days of the quarter. This event will not change our full year production guidance of 35% to 50% growth, which we reaffirmed last night. Our net exit rate for natural gas for the quarter was approximately 623 million cubic foot per day, while oil was 5,870 barrels per day. With the completion successes in April, some of which are provided in the operations release, April's net production has averaged 655 million cubic foot per day for gas and 6,500 barrels of oil per day, which provide the basis for modeling the second quarter. ","For cost guidance, we updated other taxes to fully reflect the new impact fee in Pennsylvania. Additionally, we updated exploration expense and discussed pension expense. ","Let's talk about our plans a little bit. The Cabot operation plan remains basically unchanged for 2012. We continue to focus our capital allocation towards our drilling in the Marcellus, and the remainder of our capital dollars are being allocated in the oil window of the Eagle Ford and into the Marmaton. Currently, we have 7 rigs operating in our plays between Pennsylvania, Texas and Oklahoma. We remain committed to balancing these efforts with our anticipated cash flow. However, as you might be aware of the forward curve lower than our February forecast, our plan does result in slightly more utilization of the revolver this year. ","We have been asked the question a number of times, will we slow down or change our investment program? Really, my answer is this, that with the strength of the balance sheet and our objective to secure all our acreage in the best -- maybe the only return gas play in the country, and with the continued growth of our liquids production in Texas and Oklahoma, we plan to keep our operation program as budgeted. ","And regarding hedging, the company did not add any hedges since our February call. Our existing hedges are on the website and represent 39% of midpoint guidance. We also have 7 contracts in 2013, 5 gas and 2 oil. We continue to look at potential for hedging a portion of our oil production as we increase that production strength, but we do not anticipate hedging gas at these levels. ","Now let's move specifically into the operation area in the Marcellus. Our results in Susquehanna County continue to excel. Since our last call, we have achieved a new production record of 678 million cubic foot growth per day, which is over 70 million cubic foot per day greater than our last call. A review of our production history indicates we have produced over 250 Bcf from our Susquehanna area since first production 39 months ago. This translates into close to or over $1 billion in revenue and approximately $125 million paid in royalty. This is substantial evidence of the positive impact we're having on the local community up there and certainly the state of Pennsylvania. Cabot continues to operate 5 rigs in Susquehanna with our plan to reduce this count during the second half of the year by a couple of rigs. ","In operations release last night, we highlighted a couple of key data points. Specifically of note was one 2-well pad site with a total of 40 stages completed, which yielded a combined 30-day average of 40 million cubic foot per day, a couple of pretty good wells. These 2 wells were slightly longer laterals than our average well and illustrated the efficiencies gained with longer laterals. ","A second key data point, and I think most importantly, is our 5-well pad site on the east portion of our acreage. This is approximately 7 miles from current production. These 5 wells we completed a total of 92 stages, as highlighted last night. And it is worth repeating, these 5 wells have averaged about 78 million cubic foot per day over the last 20 days. The successful completion of these wells indicates our eastern acreage should be equally as productive as the central portion of our area, and certainly without question, de-risk another substantial portion of our acreage. ","Another initiative underway in the Marcellus is our pilot program to determine the optimal well spacing and also to look at the Upper Marcellus. We recently completed 2 lateral wells spaced 500 feet and located between 2 existing wells that had a combined cumulative production of over 10 Bcf from the Lower Marcellus. One of the 500-foot space laterals was landed in the upper Marcellus, and the other was landed in the lower Marcellus. Both of these wells have been completed and are cleaning up very nicely. As these results come more available, we will share those results with you when we have those. ","Currently, we have 238 stages completing, cleaning up or waiting to turn in line and an additional 333 stages waiting to be completed in the Marcellus. Our new completion crew continues to make progress with its efficiency. For March, this crew completed 107 stages, a new high for Cabot. Because of the efficiencies gained and the macro outlook for natural gas, we are no longer planning to bring a second crew in for 2012. In regard to our infrastructure up there, our plans continue on course at a consistent and steady pace. ","During the first quarter, we reached a significant milestone with the start-up of the Zick [ph] compressor station. Although we are free-flowing and currently only utilizing the dehydration and measurement facilities, the station is operational. The compressors will be commissioned during June. Other stations, new pipelines, additional connections and upgrades to its existing facilities are continuing as planned. And we have indicated before, we intend to exit 2012 with approximately 1.5 Bcf takeaway capacity. ","Also of note, I might mention that the Lathrop station is back at 100% with all 7 compressor units operating. In regard to the pricing up there in the Marcellus, let me give you a quick update. Everyone is aware of the weak commodity prices the industry is experiencing. In addition, we, as well as other Marcellus producers, have experienced some discounting to the historic Appalachia Surplus and Pricing Index. However, with the flexibility of our Springville line to Transco and the Laser system to Millennium, our pricing is flat to minus $0.03 to $0.05 below the Henry Hub. We expect that trend to continue in that range. ","Now let's move to South Texas, into the oil window of the Eagle Ford and our Buckhorn area. The company has drilled a total of 30 wells. Each well is 100% working interest well located in Frio, La Salle and\/or Atascosa County. 29 of these wells are oil production with one well waiting on completion and one well drilling. As we highlighted last night, our down-spacing test results in the Eagle Ford has indicated success based on the early test data coming from the 2 wells. These 2 wells were drilled with approximately 5,900-foot laterals at a spacing of 400 feet between the wells, which translates into approximately 55 acres per well. The test rates of each well had approximately 790 barrels of oil per day over 24-hour period are certainly encouraging. We plan to continue to monitor these wells with plans for additional down-spacing test later this year. Should be these results be implemented in our total development plan, we would have anywhere between 550 to 700 total potential locations just in Buckhorn. ","Gross production from both Buckhorn and our Presidio [ph] area, which is a joint venture area with EOG, is approximately 9,800 barrels per day, with our net production from the Eagle Ford at 5,700 barrels per day. Cabot intends to drill or participate in 20 to 25 net Eagle Ford wells in 2012. ","Now a brief statement in our Marmaton effort, which has a couple of pretty nice wells up there. Cabot has 6 operated wells on production with 2 wells completing and one well drilling. The latest 2 operated wells have provided very positive data points to continue to assess this play. The results were in last night's release. The most prolific well has a cumulative production of 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the first 50 days of production. That's about 87% oil. We will continue to drill with one operated rig in the area at this time and probably for the remainder of '12. In the Marmaton, our effort continues to identify the more highly fractured areas of the play with slightly over 69,000 net acres. That's our perspective for the Marmaton. We certainly have a lot of running room up there. ","Shea, with that, I'll be more than happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see if I could follow up on the comment in your -- that you said in your prepared remarks, that you were going delay bringing in a second frac crew. Does that have an impact on maybe pushing CapEx into more towards the bottom of your range for this year? Or do you still plan to complete -- and will you build a backlog as a result? Or do some of the efficiency gains you highlighted offset that?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we'll continue to have a backlog simply by the nature of drilling from pads and how the gathering lines are being hooked up to completed pads. We have a significant effort to get those gathering lines to those pads that have been completed, but that will continue to have a backlog. In regard to -- certainly, we're gaining the efficiencies from just the 24-hour crew implementation out there. We do not expect there to be a great deal of reduction in the CapEx because we're going to continue to -- because of the average stages per month, we're going to continue to complete as many stages as we had originally planned, even bringing another crew in for a period of 2012.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then do you anticipate drilling any additional step-out wells to kind of further gain confidence in area like this [ph]? Or do you feel like you have largely done that with the step-out wells that you announced to the east here?","Dan O. Dinges","We've had a lot of confidence probably certainly more than maybe some of the comments that we've heard. We've had a great deal of confidence in our acreage position. We are drilling wells in all areas of our acreage position. It's just the ability to get those wells hooked up. And flowing would be delayed somewhat just because of the distance from the compressor stations that we're putting in and the interstate pipeline. But we would gain the data from those particular wells by simply the drilling, which we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amir Arif from Stifel.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just 3 quick questions. Just first, on the Upper Marcellus zone test, the well that's cleaning up, do you have a sense of timing of when you'll have some numbers and confidence or color to provide on that?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. We've been flowing back. The wells, I would say, have cleaned up very nicely. We have -- and we'll provide color both on the micro-size work that we did and the offset wells and the monitoring there. That was positive to our thesis that the upper Marcellus is not being drained, the Lower Marcellus completions. We are flowing back those wells as we speak. And we anticipate us giving more color on that, I would say, within 45 to 60 days. But so far, so good.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the compressor does seem to be not affected by the Lower Marcellus from what you're seeing on the...","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. We're pleased with the pressures we saw.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then secondly, on the Eagle Ford, the 400-foot spacing, I mean, it's obviously going to increase the number of locations you have, as you mentioned. But I noticed the IP rates were also better. But was it just the frac? Or are you -- is it just longer laterals on the wells you did?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we're -- that's one of the data points that we're looking at on whether or not the proximity of the zipper frac we did enhanced the production from these wells or if we happen to be just landed in a better geologic position. That's something that we are going to monitor in these wells. And certainly, we're anxious to drill our next down-spaced wells to see if we have consistency in those results.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the Marcellus production rate, I know you have 1.2 Bcf takeaway capacity at the end of the year. What kind of production are you estimating as the exit rate for the year for the Marcellus?","Dan O. Dinges","On the infrastructure at the end of the year, we anticipate the takeaway capacity to be at the 1.5 Bcf per day level instead of the 1.2 Bcf. And as far as the -- well, we haven't yet on the exit rate, and at this stage, not prepared to. But our guidance is going to -- we're very, very comfortable with our guidance that we've given in between, the total year, the 35% to 50% production growth. We just haven't given the -- pinpointed the exit rate at this stage.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then just one final question. One of your peers has talked about cost pressures coming down, capital efficiency improving. Do you see the similar impact just from service cost coming down as cash to exit is less or slow down?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, we have.","Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you quantify that?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we are saying in our -- we have actually kind of expressed it earlier when we executed -- up in the Marcellus, when we executed our pumping service contract. We recognize at that point in time that the cost were certainly coming down. And in the Eagle Ford, we recognized the same thing, that the pumping services and some of the other services were coming down. Pumping services, percentage-wise, I think, a little bit greater than maybe the 5% to 15% in various other services.","Operator","The next question is from Eli Kantor of Jefferies & Company.","Eli Kantor - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","On the last call, you had mentioned that if gas prices remain at these levels, that you'd introduce the Marcellus rig count to 3 from 5. And from your comments this morning, it sounds like you plan on maintaining the 5-rig program. So I was just wondering why the reversal on thought process there.","Dan O. Dinges","No. I'm sorry, I didn't make myself clear. What I had mentioned is we are going to continue our capital program as we budgeted, and we have budgeted a reduction of the Marcellus rigs towards the middle part to latter part of the year by releasing a couple of rigs. And we are still on that program.","Eli Kantor - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So the current CapEx program assumes that you get down to 3 rigs by the end of the year?","Dan O. Dinges","That's correct.","Eli Kantor - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of Marcellus EURs, it looks like results, at least the ones that are published, are trending north of the 11 Bcf type curve. Can you just talk about how you think about EURs internally and whether or not we should expect a revision and what the size and timing of such a revision might be?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we have seen, certainly, some very, very good wells out there. And the EURs, certainly, are north, in some cases, the 11 Bcf. It's dependent on the lateral length. And when you -- we're drilling our wells up there, and without cooperative or forced cooling, we're bound and restricted at times to the total lateral length of the wells that we can achieve. And with the lateral length being either extended or reduced, it takes spacing between 200, and say, 225-foot between each stage, how many effective stages we can pump. So our 11 Bcf well is indicative of what we look at as a 15- to 16-stage type well. In the cases where we are able to get extended laterals and more stages, I think we're seeing greater EURs. And certainly in the less stage areas where we're restricted because of the holdout on a mineral owner, then there is slightly less. And then you will always have areas that if you find just one of those good areas, that you can really get some significant wells.","Eli Kantor - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on the Brown Dense, can you talk about your activity there for the initial completion? Where within the horizon you could place a lateral? What are your drilling plans for the balance of the year? And are you guys still within the plan?","Dan O. Dinges","Right now, as far as our drilling activity, we completed the well. And kind of footnote out there, this was our initial well in the area. It's certainly not many data points to go by and our initial well design as we go into each area without a lot of data. We purposely try to manage our exploratory dollars, and we did that in this particular well where we only drilled down about a 3,000-foot lateral. We anticipated only about 10 stages, which we -- that's what we completed at over a couple of hundred barrels per day completion on the very first test. That's not too bad, particularly if you extrapolate out with the added efficiencies in the future and more frac stages. We landed our well kind of in the middle of this section of the Brown Dense, and we didn't have any significant drilling problems. Right now, with the strip price of natural gas, we do not anticipate going out there and drilling additional wells. We'll continue to gather the data points with the other activity that's being conducted out there. And we're looking at and talking to folks about the acres out there, but we're not actively out there with a bunch of brokers leasing.","Operator","The next question comes from Pearce Hammond on Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Dan, when will that Marmaton rig move down to the Eagle Ford? Is that still on track later this year?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we have planned a lot of that -- not a lot of that, we plan on moving that rig down because there is -- some of our acreage is subject to the hunting season restrictions. And with the last well we drilled and some of the sites that we're doing up there, we elected to continue to drill a couple of more wells, which we've done a couple of the wells that we announced. They've been pretty good wells. We're still looking at the science that we're applying up there. And at this stage, we have -- we've decided that it would be beneficial to our program to continue to plan ahead, to continue to gather the data with the drilling information we're gathering and keep the rig up there at this time. Certainly good efficiencies, good returns with a 2 to 3 [ph] type million dollars wells, and seeing some pretty good results. So that's what we're going to continue right now. We have not made a final decision whether or not we're going to continue drilling up there all year or drill -- move the rig down into the Eagle Ford.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then moving to the Utica acreage, just a general overview. How do you feel about acreage like as far as the infrastructure is concerned? You're going to start your first well, you said, this summer, kind of plans beyond that for the rest of the year.","Dan O. Dinges","We haven't made any forward-looking plan up there for the remainder of the year. We are certainly excited of the data points that we have up there about where our position lies in regard to the volatile oil window. And we think we are in a good section. And the thickness, we think, is going to be fairly robust also. So we're looking forward to the test range. We'll operate the well with 50% and capital of 50% this summer. I'm sure we'll take the data. We'll communicate the exchanged thoughts on what we do moving forward and make that decision, but we haven't rolled out anything further on a development plan at this stage. The infrastructure is still going to need to come in and improve in the area. I'll let Jeff make a brief comment on that.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Okay. Where this acreage lies is quite a bit of conventional gas, oil activity, and so there is numerous pipeline. However, they are probably not modestly sized. But there are some -- there is some activity of up there that -- where our infrastructure has already began. So we hope to kind of piggyback on that. And as we get closer, we'll probably give you more details.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then finally, Dan, just general thoughts overall in the Marcellus. Are you seeing a large drilled and uncompleted wells just kind of across the industry? And if so, is that due to limits on takeaway capacity or service constraints or just low prices?","Dan O. Dinges","I think there is certainly wells that are drilled and completed shut in and infrastructure buildout with the programs that are on the board is ongoing up there, and I'm sure that has a bearing on it. But it's also worthy of note that there has been a substantial number of rigs drilled [ph] in the Marcellus are being laid down. So as far as ongoing buildup of wells out there, I don't have the authority to get the count from all the operators, but I don't look at that as being a significant build of Marcellus. Well, I think there are quite a few peers, but I don't think there's just ongoing build of wells out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Hall of Robert W. Baird.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess just a couple of quick ones for me. In the Marmaton, apologies if you already laid it out, but what -- any sort of revised outlook on the location and inventory there on the acreage block at this point?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, at this stage, we have 69,000 net acres up there. What we're trying to do is identify the fracture stages out there. And I think one of our last fragmentation tests is 61,000 net acres. We've ramped that up. But I don't know, we think we have anywhere from 200 to 300, 400 depending on the spacing. It's a large range right now because we continue to gather data. Sorry, Mike, I can't be any more specific in that at this time.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","It's okay. So I guess you need to some natural fracturing, so it's a function of kind of just getting the acreage. Do you have -- remind me, do you have seismic shot on it? Or is that how you're identifying the fractures or...","Dan O. Dinges","No. Well, we have -- we don't have 3D shot. We have -- we've gathered that 2D lines up there that are available, and we've got some reprocessing and things on the 2D lines. And there is certainly a lot of vertical well data points that we're trying to integrate into our reprocess side.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then the other one for me, just more big picture. Dan, you made a comment in the release that given the environment, looking to be opportunistic, should we read into that at all? I mean, have you changed in terms of your general approach to looking at the market, obviously wanting to maintain the optionality around the Marcellus, the core Marcellus asset? But are you looking to get more aggressive in some of these more emerging plays, with either leasing other sorts of acquisitions? Should I read into that comment at all? Or am I getting ahead of myself?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, I think every company on the market is trying to find the next deal that will slot in above the returns that you're allocating -- the areas that you're allocating capital to and comparing the type of returns you get. And in our areas that we -- that all is aware of, we continue to try to capture the acreage in the Marcellus. And we have multi-year drilling programs and locations out in front of us in each of the areas that we're currently active and allocating capital: Marcellus, the Eagle Ford and the Marmaton. We also -- now with 50,000 net acres in the Utica area, that's going to be a substantial -- with success, is going to be a substantial area of future activity for us that we think would slot in, assuming we're in the liquids window there of a good return-type potential. And we're also drilling a well in an area we had talked about. So we continue to try to find those opportunities to add capital efficiency to our program. Unfortunately, even though the Marcellus is a wonderful gas play and probably one of the best gas plays in the U.S., with the gas strip where it is, it's just -- it's difficult. We still make a return up there. It's not yielding the return we would expect forever. We think we will show significant enhancements to the returns in the future. We think those returns will be helped by commodity price down the road, and everybody is trying to guess when that happens. We think we'll also see significant uptick in margin improvement at any commodity price once we get to pure pad development drilling from our operation up there. But as far as the read-through in what we're trying to do, we continue to try to enhance our capital efficiency. And frankly, if we had all our acreage secured in the Marcellus right now and held, I think we would allocate a significantly a greater portion to the liquids opportunities we have. And again, we have many, many, many years of liquids drilling in front of us, and we continue to grow in liquids we've been able to demonstrate with 138% growth just most recently.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's helpful and certainly very noteworthy in the increased inventory in the oil projects. I mean, along those lines, as you think about the second half, is there any thinking of potential around maybe bumping the capital spend in these areas as you start to have more and more in the way of kind of liquids- and oil-rich inventory to set up for a stronger liquids ramp in 2013? Or is it still too early to be thinking about it?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, no. It's necessarily not too early to think about that. We are already starting to kind of look at the horizon in anticipation of presenting our '13 budget to our board in October. And I would venture to say that we will have a larger component of liquids drilling in the '13 budget. But again, I'm not going to deemphasize the window we're in right now, and it is a finite window we're in. We continue to allocate capital to capture our Marcellus acreage, and that does have a squeeze on us a little bit right now. But at the end of the day, and looking at the amount of reserves that we are able to stack on our books through our Marcellus drilling and the growth, both in production and in just pure reserves on the books, in a couple of years, I think shareholders are going to recognize that the drilling that we implemented today is going to have a significant advantage if we have a little bit more balance between supply-demand phenomenon and the gas price.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Allman of JPMorgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Dan, how much of the Susquehanna County do you think you've de-risked at this point?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, I think we have de-risked probably 70-plus percent.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And have you written any part of Susquehanna County off based on any new information?","Dan O. Dinges","None.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the longer lateral wells, maybe you said this earlier, and I'm sorry if I didn't catch it, but what's the cost of those longer lateral wells?","Dan O. Dinges","We're in the upper $6 million range to low $7 million if we get to 20 stages.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then in the Marmaton, that one well that you -- was within your lease, I know you previously disclosed that in your presentation, what made that well so much better than the other wells?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, when you're going to -- when you find the natural fractured areas, and again that's part of our effort up there, I think we can see these type of wells. And that is our play concept, really, when we went up there in the first place. Our challenge we knew was going to be trying to identify the areas that had the significant fractures. And as we continue to drill and gather data and try to do as much science as we can in that regard, where we find good fractures and we find good efficient completions, we think we can repeat these type of wells. That is the poster child right now of the wells we drilled up there, but certainly, we have an expectation that it's not going to be the last.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just in the Marmaton in general, do you think just getting those 700-barrel a day equivalent wells, is that fairly repeatable? Or is the challenge here a little bit more tricky than in, say, Susquehanna County and others?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, it's certainly going to be a little bit more challenging in Susquehanna. I think we have illustrated in Susquehanna that we have an area that has shown very consistent results. And the delta between a absolute great, great well to a well that is not as great is much, much narrower than any other play that frankly that I can think about. I don't care where you are, Bakken or Barnett or Permian area. But you have all kinds of deltas between good wells and not-as-good wells. But I do think that the 700-barrel type of well is certainly a well that we do anticipate we're going to be able to drill a lot more of. But certainly, we're not going to be able to predict those today with the database we have as effectively or with as much confidence as we would if we had another 50 wells drilled out there.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. And then just lastly on the Brown Dense, did you learn anything about a better place to lay the lateral or anything you would do different assuming you'll drill another well, I know you said you're not going to drill one this year, but when you do drill your next well?","Dan O. Dinges","I'll let Matt Reid to kind of answer that.","James M. Reid","Yes. We're still in the early stages around that, Joe. We're still looking at the data. We're looking at some of the pressure data and some of the other information we're gaining from the wells. We think that there's some highly core center wells within the Brown Dense, and we're trying to land our laterals in them. I think half our [indiscernible].","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And did you have data on the permeability before you drill this first well or...","James M. Reid","We did have some data on the Brown Dense permeability, some processes as well. There have been some additional straight wells drilled in there. And we did look at that data and some [indiscernible].","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What was the frac pump rate that you've put on this one?","James M. Reid","The rate, we were pumping at 80 barrels per minute, about 8,000 PSI.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Stewart of Citi.","Joseph Stewart - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dan, the 7-mile step-out wells, does that put you in -- is that Harford Township?","Dan O. Dinges","No. I think it's in Lennoxville.","Joseph Stewart - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In Lennoxville. Okay. All right. And kind of following up on Joe's question about the de-risked acreage in Susquehanna County. When you say de-risk, does that kind of imply that you think approximately 70% of your acreage will produce results basically in line with your 2011 type curve assuming the same number of frac stages?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we have -- certainly in the central portion where we drilled the majority of our well and we started our infrastructure, we feel very comfortable with the consistency yield that we're getting from these wells. And now as we move to the east with the step-out and the results from these wells, we feel good about that. We drilled and seen the information to the west. Even though we haven't drilled a lot of wells to the west, we feel very, very comfortable about that. On the northern fringe of our acreage where we've identified the -- where we're flowing into the Laser line, those particular wells, as they get a little bit shallower, slightly better, we think, are not going to be quite the 11 Bcf type wells that we see in the majority of the rest of our acreage. And we've recognized that as they maybe being 10% of that number.","Joseph Stewart - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. Okay. All right. Great. And then on the well cost question, you mentioned the longer lateral well cost. Keeping things kind of -- or making apples-to-apples comparison with 2011, would a 2011 well cost be about $6 million in 2012 though?","Dan O. Dinges","That's a good number to use.","Joseph Stewart - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. Okay. And then finally, on the Marmaton, given you had a little bit more production history on your belt now, any update to your thinking on potential EURs there?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. We think it's 150, 175, 200, 225, maybe, on the better wells, that kind of the range, a little bit wider range than we normally have because we've seen wider results.","Operator","The next question comes from Ray Deacon of Brean Murray.","Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your investment in this Constitution Pipeline and if that would be incremental to your current takeaway or not.","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. Good question, Ray. I'm going to let Jeff Hutton answer that.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Okay. Yes. Constitution is after the hunting season, and it was established to be a 30-inch pipeline and a 121-mile fleet [ph]. Initial cost estimates are, I think Williams' press release just yesterday, around $750 million range. Our participation is at 25% as an owner, and so sometime between now and 2015, our investment will be about 25% of that.","Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Got it. Got it. And with the -- so would you just add the 1.2 -- I mean, 1.5 Bcf a day to that 600 million a day you gave there? Is that kind of the right way to look at it? Or...","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Well, 2 ways to look at it. One is that it\u2019s a 30-inch pipe which is now designed for 650,000 a day of capacity in which Cabot has 500,000 a day of broad [ph] space on the pipeline. Down the road, if it's -- if it merits expansion, then certainly, the 30-inch pipe can be expanded to an excess of 1 Bcf a day of capacity. But right now, we're comfortable with the 500 million a day add, and yes, it is in addition to the current infrastructure plan on takeaway as a 1.5 Bcf.","Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Got it. Got it. Great. And I guess -- and maybe just to clarify one of the points you made in terms of resource per location kind of across the acreage. So I guess if you were to look at it per stage, just the 11 Bcf wells, so it's about 3\/4 of a Bcf per frac stage and maybe to the north if it's 10% less than that. Is that -- based on what you know now, is that fair? Or do you want to see improvement in that?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, I think as far as a number in there, I would say it's 7 to 8 Bcf -- I mean, 700,000 to 1 million on production from the wells, EUR, 3\/4, that's probably in the ballpark. Also, on the north end of the acreage, on the -- again, the wells that we drilled up there, we think it's probably going to be more on the 5 and 7 Bcf type wells up there.","Raymond J. Deacon - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Got it. Got it. So that's in 15-stage frac type wells?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, correct, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marshall Carver of Capital One Southcoast.","Marshall H. Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I did have a couple of final questions though. On the Marcellus, the wells that are at the Upper and Lower Marcellus test, as well as the ones that you're drilling, the down-spacing, so those 500 feet from the nearest current producers. How close are those -- is the upper well and the lower well from each other?","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. Marshall, the 2 wells that have gained over 10 Bcf, they're slightly less than 2,000 feet completed in the Marcellus, the Lower Marcellus. We landed the one well right in between those 2 wells in the lower Marcellus, and then we landed the upper Marcellus well at about 500 foot -- or in between, say, the new well we drilled in one of the wells that has cleaned significant production.","Marshall H. Carver - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I got you. That makes sense. And then on the Brown Dense, you said you're not actively leasing. Is that because there's not much available near you, ?or is that a sign you're not very encouraged about what you're seeing so far?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, there had been a significant land play come through contemporaneous when we were kind of out there. And we picked up a position and felt like when we go into a play, we pick up acreage, and hopefully, we can get in there and make some determination earlier before there is a significant acreage play being made, first-mover type contract. But in this case, there was already a significant acreage play ongoing when we moved up there also. So it just limited and restricted the amount of acreage that we could block up in the area, and our preference is to block up -- so it reduced our additional leasing capacity. The play is still very, very young on results. It's got a large, large geographic footprint, and it's still very, very young with complex -- complexities that you see in every play. And once that data is gathered, we're still making the play as merit.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dan Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan O. Dinges","Thanks, Shea. I appreciate again everybody's interest in Cabot. Certainly, as I mentioned, we're going through this soft gas price, anybody's crystal ball, can look into the future and I think has a different date on when we might see additional support from the supply-demand equation. I think it's apparent that the industry is not going to allocate capital to dry gas with the strip that we see. So I think brighter days are ahead. But even though we are in this low gas price and not certainly generating the cash flows we'd all like to see, we are going to be putting significant reserves on our [indiscernible]. We'll have the opportunity to grow those reserves still with a return even at strip prices. So I think we are in a unique position as being looked at as a dry gas player, but at the same time, you are going to continue to see Cabot increase its liquids production. With its every spare dollar we have, we're going to put into the ground where we think we can find oil. So again, appreciate the interest and look forward to the next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note: this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan O. Dinges","Thank you, Maureen, and I appreciate all joining us for this third quarter conference call. We have a lot of good information to go over today, and with me to answer any questions is Scott Schroeder, you all know him, CFO; Jeff Hutton, our VP, Marketing; Steve Lindeman, our VP, Engineering and Technology; Matt Reid, VP, Regional Manager; and Todd Liebl, our VP of Land and Business Development.","Let me just say the standard boilerplate, forward-looking statements, including in our press release last night, do apply to my comments today. On the call this morning, we plan to cover the third quarter operating and financial results. We'll give you an update on our '12 and '13 guidance. We'll also update our hedging program for '12 and '13, followed by an update of our operations in the Marcellus, Eagle Ford, Marmaton, and now, we're going to add a brief comment in the Pearsall.","Before I do go into the details on those topics, I'd like to highlight some of the items that were brought up in our press release last night. Cabot's production is up 42% over comparable year-to-date periods. Third quarter production was up 6% over the second quarter, even with the delays that we've discussed in permitting and gathering lines in the Marcellus. Earlier this month, as far as a little bit granular information, we brought on line 2 -- a 2-well pad, 1.5 miles west of our Zick compressor area. That pad site with 2 wells had peak rate of 43.8 million per day from only 25 stages, which I think further demonstrates the productivity of our Marcellus wells and the benefit of our reduced spacing between stages. We also recently drilled and completed the first Pearsall short lateral well under our joint venture with Osaka. The well was drilled in Frio County and tested at a 24-hour rate over 1,400 barrels equivalent per day. And I think most importantly and from a macro standpoint, Cabot will deliver industry-leading production growth in '13, with a cash flow positive program using a $3.50 gas price. I think certainly, all those stack up to good information.","Last night, our financial results, the company reported clean earnings of approximately $43.1 million or $0.21 per share for the third quarter of '12, up from $35.3 million or $0.17 per share for the third quarter of '12 -- excuse me, of '11. The increase was driven by higher equivalent production and higher realized crude oil prices that more than offset weaker natural gas prices.","Cash flow from operations and discretionary cash flow for the third quarter was $164 million and $175.7 million, respectively, both up from last year's comparison.","Moving to a comment on production. Cabot continues to provide industry-leading production growth, driven by our premier Marcellus assets in Susquehanna County. Equivalent production for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2012 was approximately 189 Bcfe, which represents an increase of 42% compared to the 9-month period ended September 30 of 2011. Taking into account last year's fourth quarter sale of our Rocky Mountains property, our pro forma year-to-date growth in production is 51%. This 9-month production level already exceeds our full year 2011 reported production.","Now to give a little forward-looking as far as our guidance is concerned for '12, we have updated our equivalent production growth range to 38% to 44%, and our liquids production growth range to 60% to 70% to better reflect our outlook for the remainder of the year. We had hoped for and scheduled earlier timing for our Marcellus gathering permits, i.e. being able to turn wells in the line. However, as previously mentioned, the permits were just recently received by Williams. This resulted in not achieving the high-end of our guidance. With that said, we are comfortable with the guidance range that we have just put out. Full year per unit cost range were also tightened based on year-to-date results and our expectations for the fourth quarter. We reaffirmed our net capital spending for '12 at $775 million and $825 million.","Okay. For '13, we have updated our equivalent production growth range to 35%, which is up from the 30% we had previously posted, to 50%. So 35% to 50%. And we've established our liquids production growth range at 45% to 55%.","The midpoint of our guidance ranges, when you look at 2012 and 2013, implies 3 consecutive years of 40-plus percent equivalent production growth, which is an impressive number on an ever-increasing base, while at the same time, maintaining our capital discipline not covering our balance sheet or diluting our shareholders. We have also provided initial guidance on cost for 2013, which reinforces our industry-leading cost structure and the continued trend for decreasing per unit cost. We further refined our estimates for capital spending in 2013 to between $950 million and $1.025 billion, with approximately 70% of that capital being allocated to our high rate of return projects in the Marcellus. In a $3.50 natural gas environment and with recent efficiency enhancements, our Marcellus rate of return certainly exceeds industry returns in all gas plays and most, if not all, oil plays in current commodity prices. Additionally, the planned program will deliver a slightly positive cash flow at a $3.50 natural gas and $90 oil price. And I'd say not a common occurrence in our space.","Our 2012 production. Excluding the 5 basis-only hedges, the company has 37 contracts in our hedging book: 27 are gas swaps at $5.22; 5 are gas collars, with a floor of $3.60 and a ceiling of $4.17; and 4 are oil swaps at $99.30, with an additional swap at $105.05. Approximately 40% of the midpoint of our guidance for the remainder of '12 is currently hedged.","For our 2013 hedge book, we have added 25 new hedges since our second quarter call in July. We now have 48 contracts, 45 for gas, which are all collars, and 3 swaps for oil. Approximately 45% of the midpoint of our production guidance for '13 is currently hedged at an average floor price of $3.63 per Mcf, which is $0.13 above the $3.50 we're using in our 2013 budget. For additional information, you can go to our website for any additional specifics.","Now let's move to the operation side of our business. During the third quarter, we achieved a new milestone, with a 24-hour record of 252 million cubic foot of gas produced in our Susquehanna County area. I should note we will exceed that level, we think by 10:00 this morning in the last -- for the last 24-hour period, touching approximately 780 million cubic foot a day. I'm probably impressed with the North region's ability and their timing of some of these new releases. I probably should have more conference calls.","Our gross cumulative production from the field is almost 400 Bcf, with just 60 producing horizontal wells at this time -- excuse me, with 160 producing horizontal wells at this time, certainly highlighting the prolific nature of this asset. While permitting delays for gathering lines continued to be an issue this last quarter, we were able to bring on line 23 Marcellus wells and have subsequently brought on an additional 5 wells during October. Our wells continue to outperform our expectation, as evidenced by the highlighted 2-well pad that recently came on line in the Zick area. The combined IP, as I've mentioned, of the 2-well pad was over 43 million cubic foot a day from just 25 frac stages, which utilized the narrower frac stage spacing of 200 plus or minus feet. The original 5-well pad at Zick has produced over 11 Bcf and approximately 180 days, which I think further highlights the quality of our acreage as we continue to expand to the East.","In other news, we recently had a 22 frac stage well, reached 3 Bcf of cumulative production in just 105 days. I think that's the fastest record to date. It's broke the previous record we had set by 60 days. We are currently operating 4 drilling rigs in the Marcellus and have 450 stages completing, cleaning up or waiting to turn in line, along with an additional 296 stages waiting to be completed in our Marcellus area.","In terms of our plan for 2013, we will increase our rig count in the Marcellus by 25%. We'll go from 4 rigs to 5 rigs. Scott likes that percentage level, by the way. We will stay at this level for the majority of the year and then add another rig as we enter 2014. The planned well count for the 2013 program in the Marcellus is 84 wells, with a placeholder for a handful of wells in the Utica, depending on the success of the well we currently have shut in. I kind of might add that, that is also dependent upon whether or not Range and Cabot get together and continue drilling in an area that has all of our acreage HBP already.","The investment level, as previously highlighted, is about 70% of the overall program, with 88% of that level focused on Marcellus drilling.","Okay. I have a little bit of a narrative on the infrastructure. We continue to aggressively pursue our infrastructure goals up in the Marcellus. As you're aware, we have been very clear to specifically outline those objectives in our discussion and presentations. Last quarter, we reported that the 2012 slowed down in the permit approval process did delay the construction of various gathering pipelines that ultimately affected the dates we turned our wells in line. We believe that issue has been fully resolved, and, in fact, Williams, our midstream provider, has now received 90% of the pipeline gathering permits to complete the 2012 program and has acquired 100% of the rightaways needed to complete our 2013 program. In fact, we have no less than 12 different pipelines that are currently in the construction phase. This is great news on the pipeline construction side of the infrastructure.","On the other half of the infrastructure picture, deals with the timing of compressor stations and free flow interconnect into the interstate pipelines. These projects have made significant progress, and while we are not going to see any of these individual projects have an in-service date earlier than we expect, we do still expect to be close to our original goal of approximately 1.0 Bcf per day of takeaway prior to year-end 2012.","But just to be clear and as we have previously discussed, when we put your models together, as the infrastructure requirements grow and the facilities are placed into service throughout our acreage position, we will, in some cases, have excess capacity in some areas but still slightly constrained in other areas. And that phenomenon is simply a result of where we need to have our drilling rigs throughout the year.","One other point regarding infrastructure. We have already provided Williams with the necessary information for our 2014 program. We anticipate Williams will submit the completed application for permits in January of 2013 for our 2014 program.","Now let's move to the South. This region has 5 rigs operating as we speak: 2 are in the Marmaton; and 3 rigs are drilling in the Pearsall, with 1 of these rigs moving back to the Eagle Ford program fairly soon. This rig level is expected to continue throughout 2013, as current plans call for about 50 net wells to be drilled. The region accounts for roughly 30% of our overall capital program, and of that amount, 75% is dedicated to drilling.","All right. I have been a little bit reluctant to discuss the status of the Pearsall with just 1 well, but as I just mentioned last night, Cabot has successfully drilled and completed its first Pearsall Osaka joint venture well in Frio County. The short lateral well was drilled and completed with only 11 frac stages and tested at a 24-hour rate of over 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As mentioned, 1 additional Pearsall well is completing and 3 wells are drilling. A total of 6 Pearsall wells are planned for the 2012 program.","We hope our early drilling and completed wells will fall in the $9 million to $9.5 million range. Our first well was slightly over $10 million, with the science that we threw in that. But with the learning curve, we hope to be able to continue to improve what our expectations are on the drilling cost.","Cabot's net well cost will be 9.75% during the Osaka carry period, and we will have a 65% working interest in the wells on first production. We have accumulated over 70,000 acres net in the play. And as I mentioned, we do not normally discuss exploration efforts at this early stages. However, with the level of interest and the number of questions we had been receiving, I felt it was necessary to provide an update.","In the Eagle Ford, we announced our release of another successful well with 4,500-foot lateral and treated with 15 stages. To date, we have 38 Eagle Ford wells in the Buckhorn area. As with other plays, we have seen well cost come down as efficiencies are gained, and we are now in the $6.5 million to $7 million completed well cost range.","Also in the third quarter, the integration field to full pipeline access versus trucking our oil, that occurred just a couple of months ago. We are now able to produce the oil and transport it by that pipeline to Corpus Christi, where we received LLS pricing. This effort has made a fairly significant improvement in our realizations on an average of approximately $8 per barrel above NYMEX indications. The combination of lower cost and higher prices certainly has improved our overall economics in this area.","Now let's move to North Texas, the Panhandle of Oklahoma in the Marmaton. Cabot recently completed a well with a 15-stage frac stimulation. The well produced, at a initial 24-hour rate, 664 barrels of oil a day and an average of 593 barrels over the last 20 days. We also drilled our first extended lateral well, with a lateral length of approximately 9,500 feet. The well was stimulated with 30 stages and is presently in the early stages of flowback. The second extended lateral well has been drilled and will start completion at the end of October. Completed well costs continue to average around $2.9 million to $3.3 million, with early drilled extended laterals coming in between approximately $4 million to $4.5 million. To date, we have accumulated about 70,000 net acres in that play.","So in summary, our drill bit success continues to drive our significant production and reserve growth expectations. What I'm most pleased about is the continued innovation our team has come up with, with new ideas that certainly is going to translate into incremental value. My expectation, that we will post excellent numbers at year-end '12, and it's also as a forward-look, my expectation that Cabot will, in 2013, certainly have industry-leading production growth. We'll have a significant reserve addition at a very low cost to finding. We will also have an improved balance sheet, with a positive cash flow program using only a $3.50 gas price. I think we'll see a milestone reached in '13 where we\u2019ll have a Bcf per day of net production at some point during the year, and we will achieve these results with only 10 operated rigs for most of the year. I think a couple of these points may set us apart from some of our space.","Anyhow, Maureen, with that brief summary, I will be more than happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Pearce Hammond, Simmons.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","On your capital guidance, you mean, on your production guidance for 2013, you provided the liquids production guidance. Does that include the Pearsall?","Dan O. Dinges","That includes the Pearsall with a risk profile attached to it. In other words, we obviously risk our exploratory exportation ideas and by putting together a production cash flow statement, we risk our expectations accordingly.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then if you look at -- you're going to go to the reduced frac spacing in the Marcellus and in a larger way next year. So how should we think about the total number of stages completed in the Marcellus in '13 versus '12?","Dan O. Dinges","We will -- we'll certainly be higher. I would expect that the increase will be 35-or-so percent.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then finally, just from the industry standpoint, given the recent rise in gas prices specifically for the calendar year '13, do you think the industry is going to be more active in the Marcellus and we should see a gradual uptick in the industry rig count in the Marcellus?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, I don't know. It -- I think it depends on where companies have rate of return projects in their portfolio that would complete -- compete with their positions in the Marcellus. Some of the Marcellus up there is not quite as prolific as the area that we have, and the threshold for economic returns in other areas of the Marcellus might not compete with the returns that some companies might be able to deliver by drilling in some of their oil portfolio.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Brackett, Bernstein Research.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I had a question on the Pearsall shale. You're quoting numbers of $9 million to $9.5 million. If I just compare that against your $7 million Eagle Ford wells, what's that incremental cost? It doesn't seem like just go it a little deeper is going to cost you that $2 million.","Dan O. Dinges","I'll pass it over to Matt for a second. But one of the things that you have to take into consideration is we're trying to determine where we're going to land the well. We're trying to get our mud property straight. And certainly, it's in a higher pressure regime, and the fracs require a little bit more -- well, more pump pressures. And we're using ceramic in the frac stages. But I'll let Matt also expand on some of that.","James M. Reid","Dan is exactly right. And actually, it's a different casing program than our Pearsall program. We have an extra string of casing in our Pearsall program as opposed to our Eagle Ford program. And we do see higher pour pressures in the Pearsall, and we do see higher frac pressures as well. And we do increase our profit strength as well during our fracs in the Pearsall.","Bob Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And are you landing those Pearsall wells in the Bayer Shale or in the Pine Island? Or you -- do you think you're stimulating all 3 sub units?","James M. Reid","Right now, we barely -- we haven't really discussed that, and I can give you a little bit better feel for that after we do some micro seis work. We'll be doing that probably in the first quarter of next year, as to what we're actually stimulating. I know where we're landed, landed in about 70-foot interval there in the Pearsall. You can call it the Bayer, you can call it the Calcreek, you can call it the James. People call it different intervals.","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, the 70-foot is in approximately 500 to 600 foot gross Pearsall interval.","James M. Reid","Correct.","Operator","Our next question is Michael Hall, Robert W. Baird.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just, I guess, a couple of follow-ups on the tighter frac spacing. I just want to make sure I'm, I guess, understanding the initial 2 wells. Were those roughly 2,500 foot laterals, if you're in about 25 stages between the 2 of them? And is that a bit shorter than your typical lateral, and so on a more kind of a normalized basis, we should see even more uplift? Is that a fair way to think about it?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, we have -- I don't have the exact lateral length of those wells, but keep in mind that some of our wells up there are shorter laterals, not because we prefer that but because geographically, if we are unable to get a leasehold position, that at times, we have to shorten the laterals. So again, I don't have the laterals space right in front of me, but that typically -- well, that is the reason why we shortened our laterals.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And, I guess, is there any way to quantify or are you ready to kind of quantify a little bit more in terms of what sort of percentage increases in productivity and EUR per lateral foot you're seeing as a result of that program? And then also, what -- all right, go ahead, then.","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. Well, Mike, we certainly have seen an improvement, and that's the reason why we're moving our program to the reduced spacing for the fracs. We're not prepared to give details. We are still evaluating all the pilot wells that we've drilled with this reduced spacing. Steve Lindeman and his group are currently in the throes of preparing for year-end reserve. And through that effort and evaluation of more data points on the production curve of these wells versus the wells that we are frac-ing at 250 will go into our bookings on EUR at the end of the year, and we'll certainly be able to quantify a efficiency gain by virtue of that process.","Michael A. Hall - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. No, that will be helpful. And then, I guess, last one on that is, how much of the 2013 program would you say is going to be utilized in that new approach, roughly?","Dan O. Dinges","We will be implementing the 200-plus or minus foot spacing for our entire '13 program.","Operator","Our next question is Brian Singer, Goldman Sachs.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you give us the latest update on the backlog that you have in the Marcellus of stages or wells that are drilled but not completed, and completed and awaiting tie-in? And then can you talk also -- you -- as you get to the Bcf a day by the end of the year, how much of that would come on from wells that are already drilled, already producing or wells that still need to be drilled?","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. I was going to pass that to Scott, but he got a coughing attack here. We have -- nice move, Scott.","Scott C. Schroeder","Thank you.","Dan O. Dinges","We have 19 wells that have -- are waiting on the pipeline. Those have 283 stages. We\u2019re currently completing 9 wells with -- or in the process of flowing back one of the other 167 stages. And we have 21 wells that are waiting on completion or -- with 296 stages. And I'm sorry. Brian, what was the rest of your question?","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The rest of the question is as you get to a Bcf a day, how much of the difference between where you are now and there will come from wells that are actually already producing today that may be constrained versus wells that are -- that you\u2019ve got entitlement [ph] in your backlog versus wells that you may still have to drill?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we have the expectation between now and the end of the year to bring on, say, another 30 wells. And if you look at what the guys were able to provide me this morning, that we think this most recent 24-hour period, that we\u2019ll be at 780 million cubic foot a day. It's -- to me, it looks like that we will be able to, depending again where these 30 wells are coming on line and the infrastructure capacity, it looks like that the wells that we'll bring on line will provide that -- get up to that Bcf a day. And as far as capacity restraints or the existing wells being restrained either by lack of capacity through dehy or compression or by higher line pressure because we have not yet gone into the phase where we're reducing our field pressures, I think we could see incremental gains from those wells once we are able to implement reduced line pressure. That doesn\u2019t answer your question, I know, exactly, Brian, but I do think the wells that we'll bring on between now and the end of year in our existing wells, if we were able to deliver all of the gas that they could produce, we could hit that Bcf a day. However, we will have constraints within the system.","Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then when we look at the midstream options for next year, what are your thoughts on major milestones or the trajectory of further debottlenecking and new midstream outlooks coming on over the course of 2013? And how do you think about differential and the content of flexibility in terms of where you sell your gas as you look ahead to next year?","Dan O. Dinges","Okay. Well, good questions. And the focus on the infrastructure has been something that we have dealt with through this entire year. I am pleased that we will be able to get this problem behind us for the most part in the -- as far as the effect it has on where our guidance is. And I think Jeff is the appropriate person to kind of reference the current status of the infrastructure and also where we're going with the infrastructure and the market as a whole up there.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Okay, Brian. I think if you look back to our last presentation, you'll see a central compressor station, which is in the north central part of our play. That is the next major step for Cabot in terms of completing the original infrastructure plan. So that's kind of a second half or second -- late second quarter 2013. We're not relying solely on that, of course. We have a number of projects: some new interconnects with existing pipes that will be free flow activity; units that are coming on late this year, early first quarter. But, again, you asked about the major next step. That will be central compressor station that feeds a new 24-inch pipeline that's currently being laid. It comes down to the old Springville system down the Transco. In terms of moving gas around, we, of course, are very, very blessed to have 3 interstate pipelines that we're able to take our production to: a Millennium Pipe to the North, a Tennessee Gas Pipeline on the 300-line right through the center of our acreage; and, of course, the Transco lighting system. So currently, with the options that we have with each compressor station, we're actually able to, for the first time, start to play a little bit of the pricing game. So better prices on Transco, a little more gas goes there; better pricing on Tennessee, a little more gas goes there. So it's been fun compared to last December when we had, as you know, 600,000-day flowing into one pipe. And we expect to continue to build the optionality into the system and the flexibility so that as we -- as our production grows, we continue to have those options to deliver gas to different markets.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Portillo, Tudor, Pickering & Holt.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a few quick questions for me. On the Pearsall, could we get just a breakdown on the hydrocarbon content between oil, NGLs and gas?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, right now, I'll say it this way, that it's one way all in one area of the field, so I'd be reluctant to give it all right now. But we're over 50% black oil right now in the stream, and then we have a high Btu content gas along with it.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Perfect. And then just jumping quickly up to the Marcellus, just a bookkeeping question. In terms of well cost, could you give us an update on -- kind of as we look at these 12- to 15-stage frac wells, where you\u2019re expecting cost to come in at the moment, and how you see cost trends heading into 2013?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, we have -- as we have stated in the past, we've looked at the Marcellus, and we've always outlined our typical well as being a 3,500-foot lateral with 15 stages. Now it -- our typical well, as we build our database now, will be most likely reflected as a 3,500-foot lateral with approximately 18 stages in it. That cost of that well is going to be a little bit higher because we'll have 3 additional stages in there. And in regard to cost, we're about $6 million or so now with our typical 15-stage frac well. So we'll have a little bit of incremental cost with 3 additional stages. But I'll also add that we're currently in negotiations with our pumping providers up there, and that process has not executed yet. We have not yet executed a final contract for our 13 pumping services, but I am comfortable in saying that our pumping service cost will be below our cost we saw in 2012. So I can't say exactly what I think it's going to be until we see where we land with the pumping service contract. But directionally, all our costs are going down.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a last question for me. As we kind of look across your portfolio today, you've obviously established quite a few new potential cornerstone assets. And just trying to get a better sense of how you guys think about the potential for acceleration of development on these assets, either with your own capital or potential through JVs over time. So just wondering if you're looking at bringing in any additional partners across any of your either exploration or development plays and then how you guys are potentially thinking about capital acceleration, potentially heading into the back-end of '13. And I know it's a little bit early for that but just trying to get a better sense of how you guys are thinking about the opportunity set.","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we're firmly blessed with a portfolio that yields very good returns and particularly our Marcellus, and we're very cognizant of the fact that our Marcellus assets yield some of the best returns of any asset in the industry. And we will continue to allocate and grow that asset as rapidly as we can. Our main objective would be to enhance our present value of that asset, and we'll continue to do so. In the other areas of our portfolio, we will continue to capture our acreage out there, that's primary term acreage. We have done so -- as an example of what we've been able to do is the Osaka transaction. We were able to bring a partner in, Osaka, and we're very pleased to have them as a partner. And we look forward to having them as a long-term partner. So we are able to bring them in, give them an opportunity to get a foothold in the States. But also, it allowed us to have leveraged dollars to drill a little bit deeper in the section, i.e. the Pearsall. We knew the Pearsall had potential, and we are currently drilling in the Pearsall. Those leveraged dollars have allowed us to, in essence, maintain all of our acreage, including the Eagle Ford acreage, and it certainly has allowed us to compete on a return profile with these -- with the carrier we have at a very favorable rate compared to the Marcellus. In the other areas, like the Marmaton, we have acreage out there that we would continue to desire to capture because we have very good returns out there in the Marmaton, particularly with the very low completed well cost. We will look at that and have looked at that, as it is an area that would be right for a partnership. And right now, we have not strained our balance sheet. Our '13 program has free cash available even as we operate in our area out there without -- in the Marmaton, without a joint venture partner. But we do evaluate it and we do look at how we can maximize the capital efficiency of every dollar we spend. We have not taken off the table having another joint venture partner in any of our operations, less and except the Marcellus.","Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. So as we think about those, is it both the Marmaton and the Eagle Ford that could potentially be assets where you may bring in additional partners or just the Marmaton at the moment?","Dan O. Dinges","No, I think the entire area we'll look at, if it looks like a significant enhancement to us and we have the right party that we would like to be in business with, certainly, being able to enhance our capital efficiency, we would consider it.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Meade, Johnson Rice.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Quick -- a couple of quick questions for you. That -- those 2 wells in the Zick area, is that the Daniels pad or are we still waiting for results on that?","Dan O. Dinges","No, the Daniels pad is another 7 miles to the East further. We are still waiting on that area to get some pipelines to that particular area. So that will be further out in '13 before we get a line out in that area. We wanted...","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","I'm sorry. That was -- So that will be like a first quarter '13 or something like that?","Dan O. Dinges","No, it's second quarter, actually, by time we get that line out there.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then the second question I had was, regarding your Pearsall activity in 2013, is that going to be all in the Buckhorn area or are you going to pull a rig over to Powderhorn for part of the year?","Dan O. Dinges","We will have the majority of the activity in the Buckhorn area, but we will also do an exploratory evaluation of our Powderhorn area.","Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","And so -- I mean, do you have in mind, I mean, like a rough percentage? What percentage of your activity is going to be in Buckhorn versus Powderhorn?","Dan O. Dinges","90% is going to be in Buckhorn.","Operator","Our next question is Joe Magner, Macquarie.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Just wanted to, I guess, try to tie some things together in case I missed it. With the ongoing drilling activity, have you -- I guess what -- have you quantified what sort of efficiencies you're seeing in terms of how many wells you can drill per rig per year?","Dan O. Dinges","No, we -- I haven't broken out -- I've broken it out like that just on the back of an envelope, but we're -- our efficiencies that we see on a per rig basis kind of reflect in our rate of return number per well. So when you look at -- if you want to look at it from a days drilling and rig-to-rig -- or, excuse me, spud-to-spud in the Marcellus, we're looking at 20, 22 days, something of that range. Pearsall is still a little bit early to make that determination. I will say that Matt and his group had actually penciled in drill time and run pipe about 60 days originally in the Pearsall before we drilled our first well, and they have come in, in the 40 days to get that accomplished. So they had already -- were able to beat their initial curve, and certainly have ideas on how they're going to enhance that. So we're fairly good on the type of drilling we're doing in the Marcellus, and that 20, 22 days is a phenomenon based on us having to make a lot more rig moves than we would have to -- than we'll have to make once we get to pure pad drilling. We're only drilling 2 or 3 wells per pad, and once we get to pad drilling, certainly, that spud-to-spud time will be reduced once we drill the 10 to 14 wells per pad that we plan on in future. And I would expect Matt will be able to engineer the drilling of, for example, the Pearsall wells and get that drill time down just like he has in other -- every other area that we have been operating.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. Great. And just touch on Pearsall being a risk component of your year-over-year liquids growth. What are the, I guess, primary drivers that your liquids? Is it Marmaton? Is it -- just kind of provide a little more detail on that.","Dan O. Dinges","Yes, it's Marmaton and the Eagle Ford. And we certainly have, in the mix, a risk profile of our Pearsall expected completions.","Joseph Patrick Magner - Macquarie Research","Okay. And just one last one. That 1 Bcf a day rate you're referring to, is that a net or a gross number? Just to clarify.","Dan O. Dinges","That is -- that would be a net number.","Operator","Our next question is Jack Aidan, KeyBanc.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Dan, could you guess or venture to guess what would you might exit the year in terms of production out of the Marcellus? I mean, you have 780 million now.","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. We have a number of wells coming online, and we have a pretty good rate going right now. I would say that if we were -- and, again, Jack, you\u2019ve got the snapshot, so we got to make sure everything is in sync. But I'll do the total company. I think the total company would be 900 million equivalent a day or better.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second question. Now, in the past, you booked -- most of the...","Dan O. Dinges","That\u2019s a net number, by the way.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes. Okay. In the past, you booked your reserve at certain EURs. Now with reduced spacing for -- in the frac stages, now it looks like those 2 wells, you're getting $2 million for the frac stages. If that's what you're going to grow through the year, 2013, directionally, what kind of uplifts we might see in the reserve booking? I know it is early, but can you venture in that area also a little bit?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, I can tell you like this. I do think that our typical well definition of 3,500 feet in 15 stages will go to 3,500 foot and 18 stages or so. And those 3 additional stages are going to have some incremental effect on a similar lateral length well as we had in our 11 bookings. I'm not going to stretch to say that every frac stage now will be a 2 million a day increment. That's just -- that's a very aggressive number, and we don't have enough data points to say exactly what it's going to be. But I will say and what we're trying to gather and what Steve Lindeman and his group and also Phil Stalnaker and his group were trying to determine is the additional frac stages, it's just not additive for the 3 additional frac stages. We think the additional reduced spacing for all the lateral length is going to have some incremental add, some incremental gain by virtue of the stages being reduced from 250 to 200. What that number is and how we quantify it on a IP per stage basis or an EUR basis, I'm not prepared to narrow that at this stage. But I am excited, and obviously, us moving our '13 program to that 200-foot spacing is indicative of how we feel about it.","Operator","Our next question is Biju Perincheril from Jefferies.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. On this Marcellus completions, how should we think about it? Are you \u2013 with the more stages and doing lateral length, are you still pumping the same amount of proppants and water per stage or are you now proportionately pumping less? And can you talk about what -- does it have any impact on the spacing that you had assumed before?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we are still pumping at the same barrels per minute rate, and we are also pumping these stages with the similar amount of proppant. And again, the effect on the way we were pumping -- or the stages and how we were completing wells before, I think it's just -- the enhancement is going to be recognized through our production charts on each well as we get more data. But I do think the efficiencies gained by reduced spacing and in keeping the pump pressures similar and the pump rates similar and the amount of proppant is going to be incrementally beneficial across the entire lateral length.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. So if I think about the frac length laterally, that's about same as before?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then on the infrastructure issues you've had, was that related to some changes in the regulatory process or was it just a manpower issue with DEP or Army Corps of Engineers?","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Yes, Biju, it's actually a combination of those factors. In fact, the -- Williams has done an excellent job with the agencies, at time-to-time try to venture and interpret the regulations a little differently with each application. So there's a little bit of that going on. There was the typical backlog of so many permit applications that without increased manpower at those agencies, just a number of factors from communications between dual agencies when you have a wetland application, for example. Bit the DEP has made progress. The governor actually has intervened somewhat into the process. And so we feel much, much better today than we did a year ago.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. So when do you think Williams will start receiving permits for the FY 2013 program?","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Okay. So the applications that Williams\u2019 files are -- with the agencies, the Corps of Engineers and the DEP, they are on an ongoing process. So it's not exactly a calendar year. We gave Williams a 2013 program well earlier than some of the other wells. That permit actually could come out earlier or maybe we already have and I think we do have some of the '13 permits in hand. So it's really not a stop-and-go process with each program year; it's just an ongoing process.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I should think about -- you have about 30 location backlog today in hand, permit. And then...","Scott C. Schroeder","Biju, this is Scott. One of the other things, picking up on what Jeff said, is, again, Williams had all the permits fully 100% ready to turn into the regulators by July of this year for '13. And so one of the things the dynamics that happened is early in this process, if you remember, was kind of 6 to 9 months to get them out, and then it kind of ballooned out to 18 months. It's moving back towards the 12- to 13-month time period. One of the things we've said in some of our meetings was that by the end of next summer, directly to your question, we kind of expect we'd have all the 13 permits, if they kind of take a little over the \u2013 a year to get.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Perfect. That's very helpful. And then one last question, just clarification on that Piersall rate. Dan, did I hear you that the rate that you quoted is not -- does not include NGLs, such as the oil and rich gas?","Dan O. Dinges","The BOE of 1,400 barrels a day does include the full well stream. I just haven't given the mix of the MMBtu quality of the gas and the NGLs that are associated with it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is Joe Allman, JPMorgan.","Joseph D. Allman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So in terms of infrastructure in the Marcellus and, in particular, the interstate pipes, what gives you the confidence that you can grow your production as much as you've forecast? Are you relying on your own firm transportation or are you relying more so on the firm capacity of others? And where might there be some vulnerability?","Dan O. Dinges","I'll let Jeff go into that, Joe.","Jeffrey W. Hutton","Okay. Well, there's always a challenge with that subject, but here's how we plan for that one. We currently hold FT basis of around 350,000 a day of firm takeaway. So we sleep well at night knowing that we have that amount of capacity. Of course, we're always participating in expansion projects, and we have a number of projects that we're considering participation in. On a -- if you kind of think we're producing -- we're just on an average day in the past few months 750,000 a day, then you can assume that our firm transport moves x amount of gas and then our customers firm transport moves x amount of gas. So we have, from the beginning, sold to utilities LDCs in the Northeast volumes of gas that they move under their end-path firm transportation. And that's been our success to date. As we move larger volumes, we've signed some longer-term contracts with a couple of parties that have this firm transportation. It is very valuable. There's been a couple of expansions, particularly on Tennessee, the EQT expansion, which added 350,000 a day of firm. That capacity is currently not all in use, so capacity has freed up on that pipeline and also in Millennium. So we feel good that the interstates have responded with additional backhaul and additional expansion capacity. Transco has a project right now that will come about in 2 years that will add around 500,000 to 600,000 a day capacity. And last but not least, and I'll use this opportunity to plug Constitution Pipeline, that is our 650,000 a day pipeline that's going to come from a central compressor station that I mentioned earlier into the Iroquois Zone 2 market and a Tennessee 200-line market. Cabot will have 500,000 a day of firm capacity on that pipeline. So we are planning for the future. We're going to end up holding a lot of firm transport, but we'll always be selling to utilities in the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic area that do hold firm transportation.","Operator","Having no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dan Dinges for any closing marks.","Dan O. Dinges","Thank you, Maureen. I appreciate everybody joining us for the call. I think you can see that we have posted some good numbers for our third quarter year quarter-end, expect the numbers to continue to improve as we get to '12 year-end. And we've given you a little bit of a look at our '13, and our expectation is our '13 is going to be equally as robust as our '12 was. So thank you for your commitment.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Dinges, Chairman, President and CEO of Cabot Oil & Gas. Please go ahead.","Dan O. Dinges","Thank you, Valerie. I appreciate everybody joining us for this call. I have with me today, Scott Schroeder, our CFO; Jeff Hutton, VP of Marketing; Steven Lindeman, our VP of Engineering and Technology; Matt Reid, our VP and Regional Manager; and Todd Liebl, our newly appointed VP of Land and Business Development. Before I start, let me say that the forward-looking statements included in our press releases do apply to my comments today. ","All right. At this time, we have many things to cover and expand on, particularly the press releases that were issued last night. I will briefly cover full year financial results, the results of our year end reserve analysis. I will discuss our outlook for Cabot, followed by a discussion of our operations in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma and Texas, including a brand-new takeaway project that we announced in the Marcellus. Before I go on the details of these topics, let me give you a couple of cliff notes of the 2011 for the company. ","We grew production 43.5%; grew reserves 12% absolute or 22% pro forma taken in consideration asset sales. All-in company-wide finding costs of $1.21 per Mcf, including an all-in $0.65 per Mcf Marcellus finding cost figure. We had doubled the level of proved reserves associated with liquids. 2010 Marcellus wells, we revised up to 11 Bcf from 10 Bcf. Undrilled cut [ph] percentage is 36%, flat with 2010. Net income exceeded $100 million for the seventh consecutive year even with the lowest natural gas price realized in that same timeframe. And our debt levels were reduced year-over-year. ","On the financial results. Cabot reported for 2011 clean earnings of $139 million with discretionary cash flow of about $549 million. The year experienced the lowest natural gas price since 2004. Fortunately, this was offset by the highest production growth recorded by Cabot. In terms of full year production, the company posted a 43.5% growth rate in 2011 compared to '10. This was driven by a 42.5% expansion in natural gas volumes, which was driven entirely by the Marcellus and a 68% growth in oil and liquid volumes. ","From our organic program and net of asset sales, Cabot had another stellar year adding reserves to surpass 3 Tcf mark, just 2 years after reaching the 2 Tcf mark. Our oil and liquids reserve bookings contributed by doubling between 2010 and '11. However, the main driver of this growth was the Marcellus effort and the continued strength of this drilling program. As we have highlighted in previous presentations, we have wells that rank as the top performers, included -- including released last week by Pennsylvania, 8 of the top 10 for cumulative production during the last 6 months of 2011. ","For 2011, the typical 15-stage well has been booked at 11 Bcf, while the 2010 Marcellus program EUR average was raised to 11 Bcf from 10 Bcf. Also of note is Cabot did book a couple of wells with EURs in excess of 20 Bcf, creating a high watermark for Cabot and, most likely, the industry. ","At the end of 2011, we adjusted our PUD portfolio removing the EUR in the Marcellus, moving the EUR in the Marcellus slightly higher to 7.5 Bcf for the representative 10-stage well. We also, once again, removed legacy PUD bookings throughout our portfolio, which were not in the queue for drilling, totaling 190 Bcfe. As result and as mentioned, our undrilled PUD reserves account for 36% of the totals with another 5% drilled but not yet frac-ed, and we have a 59% proved developed percent. ","In terms of economics, the Marcellus finding cost of $0.65 per Mcf is a standout for the 2011 program. And considering the oil and liquids efforts by the company, the $1.21 per Mcf oil source number is also very competitive. As you're aware, the oil dollars are converted 6:1. Let me also recap with our 2011 program, what we are able to deliver. ","Net of asset sales, legacy PUD removal and record production, which was about 600 Bcf, we had double-digit reserve growth, we had competitive finding cost and a debt-reducing program. Obviously, '11 being a good program, the question quickly moves to what are we going to do in '12 as an encore to '11? ","Before I go into the operations report, I think it would be beneficial to review our thoughts on the macro environment and also discuss our rationale for capital allocation decisions. We are all aware of the supply-demand imbalance that exists today for natural gas. Our industry is starting to make adjustments by laying down rigs, reducing capital allocated to natural gas plays and throttling back on production growth expectations. Once gas is as good as another on the short-term, midterm effects on supply and the resolved effects of value per Mcf. Regarding demand, we continue to see evidence of natural gas increases in use in power generation, transportation considerations with ongoing expectations and applications for export opportunity. We experienced a no-show for the winter this year, which has left storage at a historic high and lingering concerns for 2012 prices. The industry has made a statement that current market prices will not yield sufficient returns for further capital allocation. Active leasing for natural gas plays is virtually 0. Some companies have elected to allow fringe acreage to expire instead of burning capital. Virtually every company now discusses its desire to allocate capital to liquid-rich plays, and Cabot is no exception to that. However, Cabot does have a large acreage position area in the Marcellus that continues to yield excellent returns at the current market rate. As evidenced by the most recent release by the PA environmental protection on well data, it remains evident that Cabot has the most robust position in the Marcellus. In fact, our internal rate of return exceeds many areas in the Permian, Bakken and Eagle Ford. Even with these results taken in consideration the efficiencies we have gained in our drilling and completion operations and the fact that we continue to manage our primary term acreage, we are able to reduce our capital allocation to the Marcellus by about 15% to 20% or $100 million and still maintain a top-tier growth program of 35% to 50%. Again, I will mention that we are going to maintain our acreage -- all our acreage in the Marcellus. We've taken our foot off the pedal somewhat. Our value-added growth allows us to maintain financial discipline and our cash flow. This will have the effect of bringing our investment to within $50 million to $75 million of anticipated cash. I might add, we do feel the market correction for the price of natural gas has begun. With that said though, the pace of recovery is uncertain. And our 2012 program will be allocating 40% to 45% of our capital to our liquids plays. It is not insignificant that we increased our oil production by 68% last year, and we expect to yet again experience greater than 55% increase in our oil production in '12. Though we're in a soft market for natural gas, as I mentioned, we do feel the floor has been found. As natural gas continues to increase its share of energy demand across the U.S. and the world, I do like our position and expect Cabot to regain the returns it has recently lost in the market. ","In regard to hedging, the company added new oil hedges. Since our last report, the company has 31 contracts for 2012 production, including 27 contracts for gas at $5.22 and 4 contracts for oil at $99.30 and 7 contracts in 2013, 5 gas and 2 oil. ","In the Marcellus, our results in Susquehanna continue to excel. During the fourth quarter, we achieved a new daily production record of 606 million cubic foot per day, which is 370 million cubic foot per day greater than year end 2010 and a ninefold increase from 2009 exit rates. The well results in Susquehanna continue to show why they're in a class of their own as we have highlighted in our release. Cabot added a new build rig, which brings us to a total of 5 rigs operating in Susquehanna. 2 of the 5 rigs are equipped with the latest technology and can run on natural gas as a fuel source. This is a system we will install and utilize when our CNG station becomes operational in May. ","For the year, Cabot completed 904 frac stages, which is an increase of 71% from 2010. In the fourth quarter, we signed a new frac contract, which I mentioned previously, which will reduce our frac cost by more than 30% with even further reductions on all stages after 60 stages are accomplished in a given month. In the initial 2 months of operations, this new crew has completed 82 stages and 92 stages, respectively. Currently, we have 198 stages completing, cleaning up or waiting to be turned in line and an additional 326 stages waiting to be completed. ","To help manage capital, our plan is to reduce our well count in the Marcellus by approximately 10 wells, and with no price improvement, we will reduce our rig count to 3 rigs in the Marcellus by the end of the year. Additionally, we will attempt to maximize our frac completion level to take advantage of the most efficient dollars from our new contract, working off our backlog and completing newly drilled wells. Again, I will mention that we do plan on maintaining all of our acreage. ","2011 was a tremendous year in terms of the infrastructure buildout for us. During the year, we added significant capacity with the final completion of the Lathrop station to Teel station upgrade and the initiation of volumes into Laser Pipeline. In early '12, we commenced deliveries into the Springville line, completing our initial plans for flexibility and diversification of our markets. In fact today, approximately 50% of our volumes are currently flowing into Transco, 10% of our volumes are flowing into Millennium and 40% are flowing into Tennessee. The remainder of '12 will be focused on completing our current plan for additional takeaway projects we have previously reported. ","Our lead projects are classified as work-in-progress. There have been continual changes, some positive, some negative as the planned completion date move around. Let me be clear, the environment surrounding infrastructure buildout is both dynamic and challenging with ever-changing rule book and policy changes. We do intend to update you on new compressor stations, new pipeline and upgrades to existing facilities throughout the year as we place them into service. However, as of right now, the plan for exiting 2012 with approximately 1.5 Bcf of takeaway capacity remains our expectation. That said, we will -- we also reported this morning, a joint venture with Williams Partners LP to develop and construct a new high-pressured pipeline to serve both New York and New England markets through their Transco affiliate. Cabot will own 500 million per day capacity on the new constitution pipeline. This pipeline for the future is our next major step for development of our Marcellus resource and will ensure that Cabot's production will reach the most constrained demand area in the country. We expect the market to be fully supportive of this new link between the Marcellus and our customers' operating area throughout the Northeast. Specifically, the pipeline will move gas from our central compressor station in Susquehanna County to Iroquois Gas Transmission and onto the Tennessee Gas Pipeline 200 line. ","Although the in-service date is anticipated early in 2015, we feel this timing is ideal as we internally plan for the future growth of Cabot. Cabot will be an investor in this project for a 25% equity interest valued at $175 million to $200 million. Again, most of this expense will be coming in years '14 and '15. The northern part of our acreage where we've done some drilling, our reserve report has limited information included as it relates to the wells drilled in the, what we'll call, the Laser or northern portion. If you recall during the last 2 months of '11, the Laser Pipeline was placed in service only to be shut-in with miscellaneous startup in operational challenges. Those challenges were partly due to some water production that made its way into the system by other operators. As we have stated before, the northernmost area of our acreage position gets slightly shallower and begins to thin from the top of the section down. This thinning is relative, however, as the section is still over 200-foot thick. Additionally, several large traverse faults go across this area. About 10% to 12% of our acreage falls in this more complex geology. We think this area is going to require greater attention to our lateral placements than the area to the south in order for us to deliver more efficient fracs to the entire length of lateral. Though it's still early in our drilling and completion efforts in the northern part, we do feel the wells in this area will yield similar to the performance we reported by other operators in other portions of the state.  Moving south from this complex fault area, you quickly get away from the concern of lateral placements and any issues. ","In regard to spacing, Cabot commissioned a third party to determine, among other things, the optimal well development spacing for the Marcellus in our Susquehanna area. This team was selected based on their experience completing similar studies for the major North American shale plays, in addition to their experience in the Marcellus. This study evaluated log information, core data, micro size data, reservoir pressure data and well production volumes and flowing pressures. In fact, physical model was generated, the resulted data was subsequently input into a stimulation -- in simulation model and a history match was generated based on wells producing in the study area. Once validated, multiple simulations were generated to determine the optimum well spacing. The result of this analysis determined that wells in the lower Marcellus may be optimally spaced at a distance of approximately 1,000 feet between laterals, which will allow for an upper Marcellus well to be drilled at a distance of 500 feet away from each lower Marcellus lateral in an inverted V pattern. Cabot is currently drilling a pilot program to test the simulation results. The wells will be TD-ed and completed by the end of the second quarter. However, 6 months to 1 year of production in pressure data will be required to determine if the effectiveness of the pilot program is working and evaluate all the study results. The total number of locations, based on this study, is about 3,000 Marcellus and Purcell wells. Also with a little over 100 wells producing today, there remains tremendous upside and many years of inventory to contribute to our existing and planned takeaway projects, including, of course, our new pipeline to the Northeast. ","Now let me move to the South area, in our Buckhorn area and the Eagle Ford. The company has drilled a total of 28 wells. Each well is 100% working interest well and the area lies in Frio, La Salle and Atascosa Counties. 27 of these wells are in production with one well waiting on completion and one well drilling. As we gather information results, we realize how much additional running room we have. Some of the positives from our ongoing study are a 26% increase in booked EURs in our 2011 program versus our 2010 program, a 34% increase in EUR per foot of lateral drill, a 23% increase in our maximum peak production rate and near sevenfold increase in gross oil production from the Eagle Ford. Recent well highlights include the last 7 wells, all in the fourth quarter, averaged 24-hour peak rate was 861 BOE per day with these 3 wells over 1,000 BOE -- excuse me, the 24-hour rate was 861 BOE, with the 3 wells being over 1,000 BOE. The 30-day average of all these wells was 566 BOE. In our AMI area with EOG, there are 9 wells presently on production in this 18,000-acre area with the last 3 wells testing at peak rates that averaged over 1,000 BOE per day. Gross production from both areas in the Eagle Ford is approximately 7,600 BOE per day. Cabot intends to drill or participate in approximately 25 to 30 net Eagle Ford wells in 2012. As was highlighted last week by peer in several pairs, in fact, and in our operations release, Cabot is testing downspacing in the Eagle Ford down to 50 acres at this time. ","In the Marmaton, Cabot's progress in the Marmaton, Beaver County, Oklahoma oil play continues with 3 operated wells on production with an average 24-hour production rate of 429 BOE per day. Our fourth operated well is flowing back after frac, with our fifth operated well completing and a sixth well drilling. Also Cabot has participated in 12 non-operated wells, of which 9 are producing, 2 are drilling and 1 is completing. Our average working interest in these wells is 15.3% with an average NRI of 12.1%. With the limited capital plan we have this year and the enhanced results we're seeing in the Eagle Ford, we are planning to use 2 rigs in the Eagle Ford and move the Marmaton rig south, while we schedule and permit additional wells in the areas we are seeing the most extensive fracturing in our Marmaton play. Just a quick comment on the Brown Dense, we have just begun flowing back our well there and have no additional information than that. ","2,000 plans in closing, Cabot's operations remain fairly simple. We will continue to focus our gas efforts solely in the Marcellus and allocate dollars in the oil window of the Eagle Ford, which will drive our double-digit growth in reserves and production year-over-year, and all still within 5% to 10% of anticipated cash flow. Valerie, with that executive summary, I'll stop and be happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Lively of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a few questions on the -- Dan, your comments on the Marcellus simulation model. Just curious, what is the assumed EURs for the upper and lower Marcellus?","Dan O. Dinges","Let me see, well, in the lower Marcellus, we have 11 Bcf as our assumed EUR, which is what we have been drilling today, Brian. And the assumed EUR in the Purcell, upper Marcellus as we stagger these wells, we kind of used what our PUD number is right now at 7.5 Bcf until we get further information.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that's -- I assume that's what's loaded in the simulation work. So what key -- what are the key history match variables?","Dan O. Dinges","I'll let Steve Lindeman answer that.","Steven W. Lindeman","Brian, the key history match variables are really the production rate and pressure that we've seen on the 2 offsetting wells that we have modeled, and then, obviously, as we get an in-fill well, we will then look at that similar information to see how it matches our model.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Then I'm curious too just because the wells have been so productive as you guys have history matched, I guess, some of the production pressure data so far, what type of permeabilities are you guys able to match to?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, Brian, I'll have to get back with you. I don't remember exactly what the permeability numbers were in the model. I was more concerned about the match and how it corresponded to the history. What they did is took the petrophysical data that they had from the logs and then correlated that back to what core data we had to then get a permeability match. And that matched extremely well and then we applied that to the production history, again, to validate the model.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Just a last question on the simulation work. Are you guys integrating the downhole with the surface conditions? Meaning do you have a long-term forecast of compression and pressures and that sort of thing?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. The initial modeling that we did was at the -- a higher line pressure but the really, the ultimate model when we looked at our NPV analysis, we looked at a lower line pressure.","Brian Lively - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Dan, on the $100 million of lower CapEx, the question, I think, is probably out there for everyone is at what gas price would you guys add that $100 million back?","Dan O. Dinges","That's a good question. What we see and what we're able to accomplish with this $100 million reduction, we're able to maintain our acreage, we're able to deliver still double-digit production growth, we're within the $50 million, $75 million of cash flow. We have a production growth of 35% to 50%. And with that being said, we're comfortable in delivering that program, and if it looks like that more on a macro sense, that the market has corrected itself in a way that will not create volatilities, then we would probably start adding additional capital. If it's just kind of a near-term spike in prices or something like that, we'll probably stay the course that we've outlined and until we see some macro improvements in the market.","Operator","And the next question comes from Joseph Allman of JPMorgan.","Jeanine Wai - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Jeanine Wai. I just had a quick question on your lower Smackover. I know you said that you're just slowing back the first well. But I was just wondering if you could give a little more clarity around the acreage position you have and where it's located.","Dan O. Dinges","No, we have not gone into that at this stage, but as soon as we come up with some well results and all, we'll be able to come out with more detailed information.","Jeanine Wai - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then the second question, as far as your decline curves in the Marcellus, are they really representative, or are the production curves kind of flatter because of the physical constraints that are going on right now?","Dan O. Dinges","I would say that because we're producing into a higher line pressure, they're a little bit flatter than what we would see if we have the opportunity to flow into a lower line pressure. But again, I think, they're pretty consistent through from well to well, and we see a pretty good decline that's consistent.","Operator","The next question comes from Gil Yang of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dan, you said that the PUDs were moved to 7.5 Bcf for 10-stage well. What were they booked at before?","Dan O. Dinges","We had those at 6.5.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","6.5 for all the 10 stages?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. That was again 10 stages, correct.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the 2010s were how many stages?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes 20 -- go ahead, Scott.","Scott C. Schroeder","Gil, 2010 PDPs, we assumed 14 stages.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the 2011 was, you said, was 11 -- 15 stages but 11 Bcf?","Dan O. Dinges","That's correct.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you talk about how many PUDs per PDP you've been booking?","Dan O. Dinges","We're at just slightly below or right at 1:1.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Is that going to change anytime soon?","Dan O. Dinges","We're comfortable with that. We've been managing our PUD book, as you're aware, in light of the SEC 5-year rule and in the last couple of years, we've been managing that PUD book. We probably have just a handful of PUDs still that we'll continue to manage into next year and that will be taken care of. But we're comfortable with our PUD booking at this stage.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. How much lower -- could you cut more capital and still maintain your acreage? Or what kinds of resistance to cutting additional capital would there be in your program? Are you obligated to the 4 rigs for this year, and you're going up to 3 later in the year? Or what kind of limitations do you have in terms of additional changes to your budget?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, there's a number of things that balance in making a decision to cut capital. We're still trying to retain as much efficiency in our program as we can, and the greatest gain of efficiency is when we can drill multiple wells from a pad site. That gets strained a little bit as we have to incorporate the development of our acreage out there. And to reduce capital further, create somewhat additional inefficiencies if we have more rig moves. And it'd be difficult, in my opinion, to reduce capital much further than we are right now in the Marcellus. Obviously, we could still reduce some spending in the Eagle Ford by maybe only having 1.5 rigs for the entire year versus 2.5 -- versus 2 rigs. But we don't anticipate doing that.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right, great. And just a last question. What's your -- what's the current total backlog of wells that are, at some stages, not being -- not producing? What do you expect it to be by the end of the year?","Dan O. Dinges","Are you talking about in the Marcellus?","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","In the Marcellus, how many frac stages are not yet producing in some stages being completed or waiting on pipeline?","Unknown Executive","Yes. Gil, in the speech, we said we've got 198 stages completing, cleaning up or waiting to turn in line and an additional 326 stages waiting to be completed.","Gil Yang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And where is that going to go by the end of the year?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, the simple math is even if you drill just, say, 1.5 wells per month with the rigs and assume a 15 Bcf -- excuse me, a 15-stage completion and averaged somewhere between -- even though they've done really good on the first 2 months of 82 and 92 stages for the frac crew, assume 70, 80 stages a month by the frac crew, that's -- you can do some good math with that.","Operator","The next question comes from Pearce Hammond on Simmons & Company.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","You guys had a lot of success last year of reducing your well cost in the Marcellus. I'm just curious how you see that trending this year.","Dan O. Dinges","Well, this year with the program that we've announced and having a number of rig moves as opposed to just parking on a location and drilling out that particular location, we anticipate the efficiency gain to be relatively flat from the gains that we have to date. We don't anticipate gaining a great deal more just because of the nature of how we're having to conduct our operations.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Now I know you've already signed your frac-ing contract, the 13-month frac-ing contract. Do you see on other services potential for lower cost that would flow through to your walls?","Dan O. Dinges","On the -- and this is a little bit of speculating right now, Pearce, but on the vendors that we pick up on a spot basis and the announcement made by a number of companies that they would be reducing their rig count whether it's because of natural gas or whether it's a result of the Pennsylvania impact fee that has been imposed, I could see where spot vendors and that type of service could be coming down as some would desire to keep their crews or services busy.","Pearce W. Hammond - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Great. And then on a leading-edge basis, how many stages are you completing per well right now? And is there a difference between the North and the South within Susquehanna County?","Dan O. Dinges","No. We're -- right now, we have -- are completing, as our '11 program indicated, about 15 stages per well. And when you move to the -- and do we hope to be able to get that a little bit higher? We would hope to be 16 to 17 for our total program in '12. And what we did in moving up in the North area, we recognized certainly with our size that it was a little bit more complex at the very northern end of our acreage and to additional faulting, and we went out there and frac-ed a couple of our early wells and -- but we did set up our micro-size work and as we were frac-ing the early wells, we just kind of went through the fracs. And then after we integrated the micro-size work, and we started looking at the micro size, we determined that the efficiency of some of the fracs along the line drill, if they get off into a fault, we're not getting good efficiencies in those frac stages and in fact, through our micro-size work in the northern end when we started pumping, if we had -- did not get to the pump pressures we wanted to see and felt like we were losing efficiency, we just shut down a couple of the fracs on those wells and said we're just not going to pump that stage and move to the next stage. And that's how we monitored the frac-ing up there with micro size. And that's why I made the statement that as we place these laterals up in this faulted area, we're going to have to just be a little bit more selective on not only where we lay the laterals but how we pick the frac stages.","Operator","And the next question comes from Biju Perincheril of Jefferies.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Dan, a couple of questions. Just going back to those -- the northern wells. How many do you have now producing there? And do you have a number on what the average well is up there?","Dan O. Dinges","We have about 9 wells producing right now.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then how many of those wells had issues, didn't have -- had an ineffective assimilation?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, we had -- at least half of those wells had issues with what we would deem getting effective frac stages put away.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then do you have a number on the well frac, did it have an issue what those wells are producing now?","Dan O. Dinges","I don't know.","Unknown Executive","That group, that path just went online, so it's very early. And because it was right on the pipeline, Biju, we limited our flow back and we're cleaning these up in the line. But we believe that early indications are that they are performing a lot better than the first pad sites.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then I think you mentioned you're going to go 3 rigs by the end of the year. What is sort of the timeline from going to 5 to 3? When is that first and second rig's going to come off?","Scott C. Schroeder","Biju, this is Scott. The first one kind of rolls off in the July time period, and the next one late third quarter or early fourth quarter. So again back to the earlier question, if we do see some positive changes in the macro that Dan talked about, we could change that decision at that time.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got it. So if you do end up going to 3 rigs, then how do you think about your program the next few years from an HBP requirement standpoint, like what kind of rig activity do you need?","Dan O. Dinges","We have every expectation of maintaining our acreage and, again, we balanced our '12 program and I realize it's kind of a snapshot. But with the efficiency we have in drilling out there, I think we can maintain our pace if we look at the horizon and see optimism, we can maintain our pace and catch up fairly quick. And certainly our intent is to stay ahead of the frac rate.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the oil side, if I look at your first quarter guidance, if I look at the midpoint, you're guiding to a sequential decline. Is that just some conservatism bolt into the guidance? It doesn't look like you changed it from the last time you updated it. Or is there something from a completion schedule that could cause that?","Dan O. Dinges","No, we're just -- we just are relatively conservative with our guidance. We think the range of 5,000 to 6,000 barrels is okay at this time. And again, once we get deeper in the year, then we'll look at both our gas and oil, and, I think, certainly our oil is anticipated to increase.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jack Aydin of KeyBanc Capital markets.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A question for you guys. How quickly could you respond to change in prices and what is the price inflection that you might get 50% plus ROR?","Dan O. Dinges","Well, I'll let Scott visit about the ROR a little bit because he's been in a lot of work on that, but as far as the price change, Jack, again I'm not trying to dodge the question, but it is going to be more of a fuel of the overall market and the strength of the overall market and make sure that we have some support and that we feel like that the supply-demand function is in fairly close balance. And as far as the ROR, I'll let Scott visit about that.","Scott C. Schroeder","Jack, as we highlighted in our press release back in January when we announced the exit rate for the Marcellus and reinforced the rate of return, and that was on account of a $3.18 when we telegraphed the realizations for the fourth quarter, at $3 we're still modeling a 50% for tax rate of return. And so these things, as Dan alluded to in his speech, are still highly economic even at this $3 strip that we're hanging around at this point in time.","Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","The next question I have is basically when you look at 3,000 locations and you -- the simulation and everything, what percentage of those locations is going to be Purcell or upper [indiscernible]? Do you have a number there?","Dan O. Dinges","No, I haven't looked at it exactly, Jack. I think it'll probably be 25% to 30% would be in the -- maybe 40% would be in the Purcell, upper Marcellus.","Operator","And then next question comes from Joe Stewart [ph] of Citigroup.","Unknown Analyst","On the 2011 Marcellus wells, what's the average 24 IP in those?","Dan O. Dinges","On 2011 wells, Joe?","Unknown Analyst","Yes, 2010 was 16.4 million a day if I remember correctly.","Dan O. Dinges","Well, I think it's going to be similar to that. It's going to be 15 million to 16 million cubic foot a day.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, got it. So the cume [ph] production, that's probably going to be pretty close to in line with what you had pointed out in a couple of your presentations about 2.75 Bs in the first year, does that sound right?","Dan O. Dinges","That's going to be...","Unknown Executive","We're modeling about 22.5% in the first year in terms of what the cumes [ph] would be.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, got it. And then you kind of hinted to it a little bit earlier but on the absolute well cost in 2012, with the 30% reduction in the completions, aren't you still expecting a decrease in the total well cost?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes. We're looking at plus or minus $6 million for a 15-stage well.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. So plus or minus $6 million versus average of about $6.75 million before right?","Dan O. Dinges","Yes.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So really that should get your pretax IRR to something closer to 70% at $3 gas if everything else stays the same but you have the 11 Bcf EUR now versus the 2010, right?","Scott C. Schroeder","Yes. I don't know that I'd go as high as 70%, but I know the number would be above 50%, maybe somewhere in the 60% range.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. All right, great. And then -- so the PUDs in the Marcellus, how many PUDs do you have booked now?","Dan O. Dinges","We have about 150 undrilled PUDs.","Unknown Analyst","150, okay. Great.","Operator","And the next question comes from Andrew Coleman of Raymond James.","Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I had a question on Btu content for the Marcellus, I guess, what range of Btu content have you seen in...","Dan O. Dinges","We've seen 1,020.","Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And, I guess, what sort of -- do you have any CO2 or nitrogen up in that -- up where you produce?","Dan O. Dinges","No, we do not.","Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And, I guess, how low down -- I mean, I've heard folks talk about ranges throughout the state as low as 800. I mean, is that consistent with what you've seen in your analysis of the state?","Dan O. Dinges","800 what?","Unknown Analyst","800 Btu per Mcf.","Dan O. Dinges","No, where we are, we're at 1,020.","Unknown Executive","[indiscernible] have you seen that? We haven't looked at that.","Dan O. Dinges","No, I'm sorry, Andrew. I have not looked at that across the state.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question from Biju Perincheril of Jefferies.","Biju Z. Perincheril - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A quick question, Dan. You mentioned $1.4 billion future development costs. Is that for the wells that are undrilled only? Or does that include the wells that are waiting on completion?","Dan O. Dinges","That's all-inclusive. That is -- is for reserve report capital.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dan Dinges for any closing remarks.","Dan O. Dinges","Well, thanks, Valerie. I appreciate everybody's interest in the program, and I hope everybody appreciates a little bit more of the adjustments that we've made to the program and some of the reasons why we did. Kind of the top 5 takeaway is that certainly we have top-tier Marcellus production and that's evidenced by the most recent DEP release on all the wells in the Marcellus. We have a new catalyst and a new pipeline coming, the constitution pipeline, which we think is setting the stage for a very opportune time that we see out on the horizon for the natural gas market. We have seen some 20 Bcf wells in our area, and we are excited about how they perform. Our cash flow focused investment program even at the current strip price, I think, is going to yield very, very good returns, both in production and in reserves. And with the year end 2012, I think, we're going to be able to mimic what we've done in 2011, and that's have a double-digit growth in both production and reserves and our balance sheet is going to be very strong moving into '13. Thank you for your interest in Cabot. Goodbye.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."]}}
