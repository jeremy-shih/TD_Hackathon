Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges, provisional one-time impacts of the recently enacted U.S. tax law, and other adjustments disclosed in our press release. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call.","And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio now.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our excellent performance continued in our fiscal third quarter, building on the momentum we generated in the first half of the year. Our strong growth was broad-based across all regions and product categories, which produced double-digit increases in both the top and the bottom lines. Sales rose 13% in constant currency, about double the robust pace of global prestige beauty, and we gained share.","We leveraged our higher sales into even greater profit growth, aided by further cost savings, efficiencies and lower tax rates. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 17% in constant currency. With these better-than-expected results and confidence in the fourth quarter outlook, we are again raising our sales and EPS guidance for the fiscal year, which should make our performance one of our best in the last decade even in the midst of high competitive environment.","Our global success came from bringing our brands into high growth markets, channels and retailers, and attracting consumers with compelling innovations, high quality products and social media activities. We have been able to devote increased investments to our digital activities as a result of our Leading Beauty Forward initiative, which has freed up resources from other areas. Today, all our brands are amplifying their digital communications and aligning with inspiring influencers.","We have reengineered our financial structure to make this happen, and our results this quarter are proof of our ability to capitalize on positive industry trends. Our winning strategy is centered on activating and accelerating multiple engines of growth. As our business flourished around the globe, we continue to support the momentum of our fastest growing brands, countries and channels. They are gaining greater traction, as we develop more growth engines in each area.","We opened new doors in consumer preferred channels and retailers, and closed less successful ones. Our results reflect skilled execution, improved analytics and our increasing agility to take advantage of opportunities quickly, effectively and respond to trends faster. Consumer interest in beauty and access to products is expanding in established and emerging markets. This trend is evident in our third quarter results, where virtually all our brands grew on a global basis.","Many rose by double-digits led by our luxury tier, skin care focused brands and the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand. Many of our mid-sized brands have grown so strongly in recent years that they are now leaders in their respective categories in prestige beauty. Jo Malone London for example is a top brand in high-end fragrances. La Mer is number one in luxury skin care. Tom Ford is a leader in luxury makeup and Aveda is highly ranked in natural prestige hair care. All these brands improved in the third quarter, further solidifying their positions.","Sales at each of our largest brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and M\u00b7A\u00b7C grew globally. Our established brands are winning because they are changing, innovating and appealing to new and younger consumers. The most brilliant example of this transformation is our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, and we intend to apply its playbook to other brands. Like many of our mid-sized brands, our big brands are also prestige beauty front-runners. Est\u00e9e Lauder is a global leader in prestige skin care. Clinique is number one in prestige beauty in the U.S., and M\u00b7A\u00b7C is top ranked in prestige makeup worldwide.","Est\u00e9e Lauder was again a standout in our portfolio. Sales climbed strong double-digits, reflecting the brand's strengths across skin care and makeup, as well as in many markets and channels, illustrating it increasing global appeal. The brand's success stems from the high quality of its product customization to consumer needs by region, strong repurchase rates especially amongst its hero products, and a focus on engaging consumers through digital and social media.","Clinique growth improved, led by gains in skin care, which rose in every region. The brand's makeup and fragrance business also increased with particular strength in European region. M\u00b7A\u00b7C global sales increase reflected strengths in Asia and travel retail. Several of M\u00b7A\u00b7C top global doors were in travel retail location in Asia, boosted in part by visitors to Korea for the Winter Olympics.","Several factors drove our skin care acceleration. Asians are large users of skin care, and our business in that region was robust. In addition, more millennials are purchasing skin care products, and our innovation in hero products were well received, including newer ones like masks. This is a trend we had anticipated, and therefore, we are well positioned. Many of our brands' hero products continue driving our strong performance.","Clinique new Moisture Surge 72-Hours Auto-Replenish Hydrator was first introduced in North America in December, and the franchise nearly doubled there this quarter. In the past two months, the new moisturizer has been rolling out internationally and it's helped lift Clinique Moisture Surge franchise by over 50% fiscal year-to-date. In Asia\/Pacific, Clinique hero products comprise about one-third of its sales, driven in part by strong Moisture Surge growth.","Clinique is gaining share in moisturizers in many large marks, including the U.S., UK, France and Spain. Est\u00e9e Lauder launch last July of Advanced Night Repair Eye Concentrate Matrix has helped solidify the brand leadership in the eye treatment subcategory, which is a critical recruitment area in skin care.","Our makeup sales were solid, but consumers demand is leveling off after several years of exceptionally strong growth. Our top performers were Est\u00e9e Lauder, M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Tom Ford. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brands gained share globally in makeup, largely driven by Double Wear foundation franchise. We are supporting Double Wear with a wider range of shades and forms such as Cushion Compact to address the needs of consumers worldwide.","M\u00b7A\u00b7C enjoyed growth internationally and has been well received as it enters new channels and retailers. It was our first brand to launch on ASOS in the UK, an exciting online platform that is especially popular with millennials, and M\u00b7A\u00b7C successfully reached new consumers. Its recent NICOPANDA collection with the edgy fashion brand has been a big hit.","Too Faced global growth was mainly driven by success in specialty-multi doors in Europe and Asia, and it has gained share internationally. The brand grew at a slower pace than in recent quarters because of tough comparisons with the prior year as lower makeup category growth in the U.S. We expect Too Faced also will return to significant growth in the U.S. next quarter with roll-outs of new products and target expanded consumer reach.","Turning to our geographies, sales rose in about three-quarters of our markets. Asia\/Pacific was our strongest engine, where nearly every country posted growth and most brands grew double-digit. In China, we achieved another quarter of stellar double-digit growth and gained share. Skin care, the predominant category, rose significantly. Yet, at the same time, our makeup business doubled and fragrance was sharply higher. All major channels posted strong growth, driven by online and specialty-multi, which more than doubled.","Our investments in China are creating even greater awareness of our brands among Chinese consumers, especially as we intensify our social media campaigns. Through our own brand sites and third-party sites, we can reach millions of consumers in more than 500 Chinese cities who desire our products, but don't have access to a physical store. This is evident in our online sales, which accounted for nearly one-quarter of our Chinese business.","Outside of travel retail, our strength in Europe, the Middle East and Africa was led by Italy, where our local currency growth far outpaced the market. Across the region, several emerging markets including Turkey, Central Europe, India and Russia posted double-digit gains. The Middle East, however, continued to be challenged. In the U.S., our brands generated stronger sales online and in specialty-multi retailers. But in total, our business declined slightly as a result of continued challenges in some brick-and-mortar department stores and free-standing stores.","As the physical retail landscape continues to change, most recently with the unfortunate news of Bon-Ton's liquidation, our business will be impacted in the short-term. Longer term, however, fewer stores should provide a healthier environment, as sales continue to migrate to experiential retail and to online. We are working with retailers to strengthen our brands' assets on their websites, where we are seeing good growth, as well as the experience in brick-and-mortar stores to increase sales in both areas.","Looking at our business by channel, nearly all posted improved results. I will highlight two of our most vibrant. Travel retail generated momentum in every region due to increasing demand for our brands worldwide and outstanding execution by our organization's teams. The channel had strong retail growth in Asia, double-digit gains in the U.S. and Canada, and retail sales in the European region outpaced the local market.","Our eight largest brands in the channel rose double-digits at retail and skin care accelerated sharply reflecting positive global trends. Travel retail results are driven by our investments in key local markets that are fueling our conversion efforts in airports. We launched our seasonal fragrance brands and Too Faced and BECCA in more airports to meet growing consumer demand. We are seeing the clear success of our high-end fragrance strategy in the travel channel.","Fragrances are an important category in travel retail, and our luxury fragrance portfolio is already a strong growth engine. Most of our travel retail growth came from like-door gains. Starting in June, there will be more than 30 new flights a week between China and Europe, which is expected to help increase passenger traffic. Numerous growth engines are driving our online business, which once again climbed sharply. Sales grew double-digits across all platforms, regions and categories.","Even as our online business has become significantly larger, we are sustaining our momentum. In Asia, our online sales doubled led by Tmall in China. M\u00b7A\u00b7C's first Super Brand Day on Tmall delivered terrific results. One of M\u00b7A\u00b7C's most popular products is lipstick, and it sold approximately 180,000 during that brand day. In March, we launched Darphin on Tmall, our eighth brand on the platform with promising initial results.","Our retail dot-com business grew double-digits in every region. In the U.S., we had excellent retail sales on department store sites. Retail sell-through on Macys.com grew 30%, and the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is the number one beauty brand there. Social media is becoming an integral part of our brand dot-com business. By offering unique content and easy-to-use functionality, we are making them competitive destination sites and even more useful for consumers. We launched seven more brands dot-com sites internationally, including Origins sites in France, Sweden and Hong Kong.","Our digital-first mindset continues to influence everything we do. Our brands are finding new ways to engage consumers by using big data to inform trends, paired with the right influencers and create impactful content. To stay at the forefront, we are adding digital talent, leveraging new technology like augmented reality, monitor real-time campaign analytics across all brands and directing more advertising spending to search influencers and mobile-first videos.","In the last call, we discussed our intent to enhance the company benefits and invest in our workforce to help attract and retain the best global employees. As a first step, we are improving our family-related benefits for our diverse employee base in the U.S. This includes an expanded parental leave for all employees irrespective of gender and enhanced benefit around adoption, child and elder care, and enhanced flexibility when employees return to work. Our new policies are among the most comprehensive in the U.S. and underscore our commitment to family values and work-life balance. We plan to share additional benefit announcements in the coming months.","I want now to spend a moment discussing a situation which we disclosed in our press release this morning. We recently learned that some testing related to certain products advertising claims had been intentionally altered for some time by a small group of employees. We became aware of this when an employee brought this to our attention through our internal escalation process. This clearly does not meet our standards, and we immediately launched a comprehensive review of our product advertising claims support, which is ongoing.","It is \u2013 this is not a safety issue. All of our products are completely safe. Our ingredients remain of the highest quality and consumers can continue to use the products they know and love with confidence. As we undertake this review, we expect that many of our claims will not change, but others will. Some changes may be minor and others could be more significant, and we will make any necessary changes as quickly as possible and bring this area up to our high standards.","We have resolved this testing issue by now, so that claims for new product launches will not be affected. We are investing in strengthening our talent, resources and independent validation to ensure that this does not happen again. This matter does not reflect our strong commitment to our consumers or the integrity that is at the heart of our company. We are sorry this occurred and we take full responsibility for this matter. We will continue to address this in a way that reflects our values and our high standards.","So, we are proud of our many successes this fiscal year and confident about our future. We believe our broad brand portfolio, strong innovation, global reach, amazing people, greater channel diversification and agility to take advantage of new opportunities position us well to continue outpacing the industry. Our focus on being financially disciplined will help us further fuel our multiple engines of growth to continue our momentum. We are extremely pleased with our results and are on track to deliver outstanding sales and earnings gains in fiscal year 2018.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I remind you that my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges and adjustments primarily related to our Leading Beauty Forward initiative and the new U.S. tax legislation. Net sales for the third quarter were $3.37 billion, up 13% in constant currency compared to the prior year period. Once again, our performance was broad-based across geographies and product categories with exceptional strength in the Asia\/Pacific region, travel retail and online channels and in the skin care category.","Our gross margin improved 40 basis points to 79.8%, driven primarily by a favorable comparison to the inventory step-up in the prior year period post the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were consistent year-over-year. Higher investments in advertising and promotion of 110 basis points and stock compensation expense of 50 basis points were offset primarily by lower selling costs.","Operating income rose 21% and operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 17.4%. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 22.8%, a 490 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. This reduction was driven primarily by excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. As a result, and as a reminder, provisional charges related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be finalized within the allowable one-year measurement period.","Diluted EPS rose 30% to $1.17 compared to the prior year and grew 17% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included approximately $0.11 of favorable currency translation. The higher-than-expected EPS primarily reflected better sales growth, a slightly lower tax rate and more favorable currency translation.","For the nine months year-to-date, we generated $1.93 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, a 54% increase over the prior year due primarily to higher net income and improvements in certain working capital items. We invested $368 million in capital expenditures, repurchased 5.5 million shares for $676 million, nearly double what we spent last year, and paid $407 million in dividends.","Now, let's turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full-year. Global prestige beauty is a vibrant category that continues to grow. With the outstanding performance we've seen year-to-date, we are again raising our full-year guidance, as Fabrizio indicated. We expect continued strong execution to drive performance in our final quarter, although our fourth quarter comparisons are the most difficult against the strong growth in the prior year quarter, and we remain cautious on the brick-and-mortar retail environment in North America and the UK.","We anticipated some risk for Bon-Ton in our previous estimates and our current guidance reflects the new reality. Furthermore, there continues to be a number of macro and geopolitical risks that could disrupt the positive trends we have seen. That said, we are raising our sales growth expectation for the fiscal 2018 full-year to 11% to 12% in constant currency.","This includes approximately 2 points of growth from the incremental sales from Too Faced and BECCA in the first half of the year. Currency translation is expected to benefit reported sales growth by 4 percentage points, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.20 for the euro, $1.35 for the pound and \u00a5110 (24:29) for the yen for the fiscal year. We are maintaining a degree of prudence in our outlook as we work through the review and retesting of some of our product advertising claims.","Nevertheless, we are raising our EPS expectations to a range of $4.38 to $4.42 before restructuring and any other charges and adjustments. This includes approximately $0.22 of benefit from currency translation. It also includes an estimate for accelerated claims review and testing, consumer call center support, changes to some of our product communications as necessary, advisory fees and other costs related to the advertising claims review. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 20% to 21%.","For the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 8% to 9% in constant currency. Currency translation is estimated to add approximately 4 percentage points. We expect to increase investment substantially behind advertising and promotion and select brand expansion, reflecting the increased flexibility we have from higher-than-expected sales growth and our desire to support a strong start to fiscal 2019.","EPS is forecasted to be between $0.48 and $0.52 before restructuring charges. This includes an approximate $0.07 benefit from currency. With two months left in the fiscal year, we remain encouraged by the momentum in global prestige beauty and our ability to execute our strategies effectively to exceed that growth. Our outstanding organic sales increase reflects the thoughtful investments we have made in innovation, advertising and promotion, digital and talent development.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Our first question today comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, I guess for a couple of years I've been interested in the question of the impact of channel mix on profitability and seeing that as a long-term positive. My sense is that Leading Beauty Forward is still kind of in like a net investment mode, but I still would have expected to see I guess better operating leverage this quarter just given the magnitude of the upside to top line. So, I was curious if you can talk a little bit about why we didn't see that. Were there may be some expenses accounted for this quarter related to the advertising claims dynamic? You talked about wanting to start off 2019 strongly, if you're kind of putting some money to work today more aggressively than you maybe initially planned before the top line came through as strongly as it did? Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Lauren. So, I'll start by answering that question. We have talked all year about our incremental investment in advertising and promotion. You're correct that Leading Beauty Forward this year, we did indicate that there would be some savings related to the program that we plan to reinvest, reinvest in capabilities as it relates to digital marketing, reinvest in some of our analytical capabilities which we've referred to earlier in the script, and other areas of capability for the future.","So, that has been the result of some of the savings that we have generated from Leading Beauty Forward. We've seen a big step-up this year, and again, mostly in this quarter and next quarter, so the second half of the year, more investment in advertising and promotion than even in the first half of the year. So, that is also what you're seeing in the quarter and what you're also seeing in the full-year guidance. And we have done a terrific job, as Fabrizio indicated, of reallocating resources to invest in more advertising and promotion and other areas of investment like IT support for some of our consumer-facing activities.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I want to add, we are really in a transition period of using these resources to accelerate, but mainly advertising a new capability like digital, data analytics, ability to anticipate trends, new talent in these areas, improvement in retail. But the advertising piece frankly is very exciting. Yes, in these two quarters, quarter three and quarter four, we have a serious improvement of the investment and increase on the investment.","This is aiming at obviously preparing hopefully the continuation of a strong fiscal year 2019, but is also the result of going from an era, where certain brands were advertised and others were not were mainly driven by their brick-and-mortar experience, to an era where every single brand will be leveraged by social media and in a way advertised. And in this transition, we are putting more advertising funds in every single brands, also the brands in the past had not a lot of advertising. The result of this transition is frankly a very promising acceleration of top line that will be leveraged, that will be leveraged better over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line from Michael Binetti, Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice quarter.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Tracey, there's obviously a lot of minutiae as go through the margins and the different reporting lines but \u2013 and you spoke a little bit about advertising, Fabrizio. But the 110 basis point step-up in this quarter, can you maybe help us think about the medium-term a little bit as far as \u2013 you said there's an \u2013 I guess a leverage point on the horizon. But could you walk us through whether you guys feel like you're getting \u2013 you're obviously landing it on the top line. But as we think about the medium-term and how that was a 110 basis point hold-back in the quarter, is the best strategy to keep spending that faster than revenue growth for the next year to keep playing offense? Or do you think in the next year, we start to see a leverage point on that line?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","I think in the next year, you will start to see that normalize more. One of the things that we have done this year, we have such great momentum behind terrific brand innovation like what we're seeing in Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer. Some of the expansion that we've done in our travel retail channel behind new brands in addition to the existing brands in the channel that we have taken the opportunity and we have some terrific social media programs as well. So, this was the year really to invest behind to capitalize on that growth. We don't expect that we will see deleverage in advertising and promotion on a go-forward basis.","Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then, if I could just follow up quickly on the gross margin, nice inflection in the quarter. And I know you mentioned that there was some things in the compare on the inventory step-up from Too Faced and BECCA. I'd be interested in hear in how you think about the puts and takes on that over the next couple of quarters and then maybe what we should think about by geography or product mix and whether we can continue to see that kind of leverage flow through.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I mean one of the reasons we saw deleverage in the first half of the year was because of the comparison year-over-year with the non-comp and the acquisitions, and I think I did mention that we would see favorability in the second half of the year when our two acquisitions became part of our base. So, we \u2013 really, our gross profit margin is very much dependent on our category mix and our channel mix. And so, the real measure, if you will, of margin that you should be focused on is the operating margin, because mix does have a differential benefit on our gross profit margin mix. But you could expect to see certainly some level of expansion in gross profit margin on a go-forward basis, not perhaps what we saw in this quarter, because of anniversarying the inventory step-up, but some benefit in gross profit margin given the near-term programs that we're expecting to launch.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser, D. A. Davidson & Company.","Linda Bolton Weiser - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Yeah, hi. So, I was wondering if you could give a little more detail just on the margin performance in the Americas, because the profit was down about over $50 million year-over-year. I don't think that includes any charges in there. And you mentioned a comp issue, which I think you had referred to earlier. Maybe you could quantify that.","But also you mentioned investment in social media and digital, I think. So, I was curious about that and what areas \u2013 like are you putting more toward the smaller brands that you've recently acquired or more towards some of the larger brands, which seem to be slipping a little bit in social media prominence.","In particular GLAMGLOW is quite lacking in prominence on social media compared to some of your other even smaller brands. So, is that one of the areas receiving more investment? And then, on the bigger brands, Bobbi Brown, Clinique, Smashbox and Origins appear like they need a little more investment. So, could you talk about the investment side and then the comp issue there in the margins? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So, Tracey will take the margin question. But on the advertising, basically the answer is yes. The short answer is we are increasing social media activities on our big brands and on our mid-sized brands and on some of our new acquisitions. Particularly, we are looking for accelerating this area. You mentioned GLAMGLOW, which actually is a brand which is doing very well behind these extra investments recently in the social media in the U.S. and in other areas of the world.","So, our intention is to do that. As I said before, our intention is to make sure that also the brands that historically has been driven more by in-store activation and innovation that get driven by investment in the social media arena. And in order to do that well, we don't need only more money on the advertising line. The real big difference in going from a brick-and-mortar brand to a social media-driven brand is creative assets and the amount of talent in communication.","And that's the areas where we \u2013 in each one of the brands you mentioned, we are making some excellent progress, and we will continue. The way we produce creative assets, the way we expose consumer to our creative assets, the way we involve and engage consumer in actually, in some cases, the generations of the assets is really changing, and that's very exciting. That thing will (36:24) produce better results over time as we learn how to practice on every single brand this new reality. And finally, on margin, Tracey?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. So, on margin, a bit of it is a step-up in advertising, you mentioned due to some of our newer smaller brands. So, we are investing more in advertising in Too Faced for instance and some of our other brands as well. We are investing a bit more in digital marketing as well in the U.S. I mentioned the change in accounting in stock-based compensation. That is also impacting the Americas segment. So, that is also a margin drag, if you will, on the segment for the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, and good morning, everybody.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Probably a bit too early to talk about fiscal 2019 expectations, but I guess maybe looking at it sort of a different way. Any thoughts on what would impact global prestige beauty growth from current 6% to 7% levels and even up from the 4% to 5% that you were expecting back in August, and then anything that you were seeing that potentially impacts your ability to continue growing ahead of the global market?","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. So, obviously, today is not the day to speak about guidance for 2019. But to answer your question on the market is, so we believe that our above 5% long-term market growth potential is still the right estimate for the long-term, meaning that year-after-year, the 4% to 5% average that we quoted in the past will likely continue to be the reality in terms of what are the global forces that drive that. This is an extraordinary year. The 6% to 7% is happening in fiscal year 2018, we believe, is an extraordinary strong year.","The reason why it's extraordinary is it's a year where there is the combination of very positive factors. One is the consumption in China has jumped as we see in the market. The social media boom that in the past was mainly on makeup is coming through also in skin care. That's behind the sudden reacceleration of skin care. The U.S. tax cuts give some push to the U.S. consumption. International passenger traffic for travel continues to increase. So, the combination of factors of accelerating all together is there.","We believe this acceleration started at the end of last fiscal. Obviously, this somehow will normalize in the future, and that's why we continue to believe that above 5% growth is the current long-term estimate. As far as your second part of your question, we continue to believe that we will grow ahead of this 5%, and we say that 6% to 8% is our long-term algorithm. We are continuing to be behind that. And in some years like this one, we are growing double than the market, because many of our activities are coming together in a brilliant way. So, we are still confident our long-term algorithm is pretty strong and pretty right.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink from Jefferies.","Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Tracey, a question for you on the balance sheet. I'm wondering if you can talk about your comfort level with stretching the debt load, what kind of leverage would you like to see over time in the model, just thinking about your M&A capacity over the next couple of years. Thank you.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Sure. We feel very comfortable with our balance sheet. As you all know, we've been very prudent in terms of managing our balance sheet, and the biggest acquisition that we've done from an M&A standpoint was last year with Too Faced, where we took on additional debt in order to fund that. We typically are in the 2 to 2.5 times range in terms of leverage. That's a comfortable position for us to be, certainly to maintain our credit ratings. But we certainly have more capacity than that. So, we are not restrained at all from an M&A standpoint in terms of doing further acquisitions. And given the strong free cash flow that we have, we certainly can fund all of the needs of the business. And certainly, we have our debt payments spread out in such a way that we can certainly manage the repayment of that with no problem whatsoever.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Fabrizio, could you comment on maybe the economic cyclicality? Particularly, if I look at the Europe luxury business or even the development of North America, it seems like a lot of the growth comes from \u2013 I guess how \u2013 maybe more simply, how does the development of your luxury portfolio relate to what's going on economically and what happens when the economy slows down? How has beauty changed in the past 10 years or not changed that makes the economy drive that high into the business? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So, obviously, the global economy overall is stronger this year, and this benefits our high-end part of the portfolio. But what benefits even more our high-end part of the portfolio is the growing consumption in Asia. Asia, among the various regions, is the most oriented to the high-end of our portfolio. So, brands like Tom Ford or La Mer are doing very, very well there. And the new high-end fragrance portfolio that we have recently developed, which includes again Jo Malone, Tom Ford, Le Labo, those brands have huge potential in that region at the high-end. And so, we believe this will continue.","Asia economically is on a roll, and we count on that. In the past years, which is also the other part of your question, what happened is when there was an economical crisis or an economical cycle, actually what suffered the most is the entry price point of the portfolio, not the high-end. The high-end part of the portfolio is the most resilient, because even during economical cycles, the wealthier part of the population tends to be the ones that suffer the least. And so, that is the reality. So, we believe that the fact that the high-end of our portfolio is solid, increasing and becoming bigger is actually an element that over time will mitigate volatility in our results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning, guys. So, Fabrizio, clearly you're delivering substantial upside to your long-term top line algorithm this year. I was hoping you could just take a step back and discuss two of the key drivers behind that in terms of China and travel retail. You gave a bit of detail in your answer to Mark's question. But, A, just a review of what drove the greater-than-expected growth in those areas this year; B, have your long-term expectations changed at all looking out over the next few years in those areas with the outperformance; and then C, is there risk you could see an abrupt deceleration in fiscal 2019 with the difficult comparisons, et cetera? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah, sure. First of all, there are several factors which are behind this acceleration. Let me mention at least some of which are among the most important. The first one is the fact that we are winning again of our big brands, and particularly our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, which is really growing at a strong double-digit everywhere in the world. So, this proves that the big brands, when big brands make the necessary changes and speak the language of the new generations and tailor like the Est\u00e9e Lauder has done by region their activity in a brilliant way, big brands are still a stronger proposition than small brands, because big brands have the tools in terms of money to spend, money to invest, quality of talent, global reach, level of consumption and level of awareness with the consumers.","When they do the right thing, this becomes immediately impactful. And I think the story behind our Lauder brand shows that when we do good things, they become fast \u2013 very fast they become impactful on the business. And that's very positive news for us, and that's a big change versus what was at a certain moment the dynamics a couple of years ago. The second \u2013 and by the way, this is sustainable in our opinion. Actually, it could get better and stronger with the time.","The second driver has been Asia and particularly China. Now, in China, what's happening is very interesting. What's happening is that the social media reality is making the awareness of these beautiful brands, innovation, propositions, idea and the conversation with the consumer is getting to a large majority of the population, because social media is very popular. And so, the conversation goes on in 600 cities, 700 cities, but the physical distribution is actually today the Lauder brand, which is the most distributed, is 117 cities. So, there are hundreds of cities where there is awareness, there is demand, there is desire and there is no physical distribution.","And these hundreds of cities, the people can buy it online or during their travel, their travel within China or their travel outside of China. And that shows that is a big implication of the great results we are seeing on Tmall, on our brand dot-coms, in the online in general, in the travel within China of Chinese consumer, and obviously, in travel retail. So, this other thing which is happening in China, which is sustainable, is China has been for years mainly driven by skin care, and this is continuing. Actually, it's accelerating. But importantly, it's also driven by makeup and fragrance acceleration.","So, our portfolio now in place in China is (47:39) leveraging its scale at full, while in the past was mainly a skin care discussion. That's another big change that is here to stay. And finally, the quality of our execution. We have an extraordinary China team that does an amazing job in China, and so the quality of our execution with our team in China is second to none, and we believe this is a lot of what is behind our success there.","The other driver is travel retail. The travel retail is working. We are today the market leader in the combination of skin care and makeup that we call beauty. And with the recent activation of the fragrance business, which is huge in travel retail, we chose a niche, meaning we are now the leaders in what we call the high luxury artisanal fragrance, which includes brands like Jo Malone, Tom Ford or (48:38) acquisition. We have chosen really to leverage that piece of the fragrance market, because we believe that's where a lot of the future is, and we are making great inroads there.","So, very solid. Our position is very solid, and we believe the trend of growth will continue to be there. So, this is another strong driver and is globally \u2013 is a good driver globally. Now, the reason behind this driver is that many of the emerging market consumers, Chinese, but well beyond Chinese, Russians, Brazilians, Middle Easterns are among the big purchasers in travel retail. So, our investments on our brands in these markets of origins of the travel is what really makes the difference. And again, we have an amazing travel retail team that is learning better and better how to convert travelers into purchasers at the airport.","And so, this combination of investing in the market origins and learning how to convert in airport is really working for us, and we believe will be another strong driver for the long-term. So, we feel comfortable that this will continue. Now, said these, you were asking about 2019, 2020, the future. Obviously, the base period is becoming stronger and stronger. So, we need to imagine \u2013 even in these strong drivers, we imagine a certain normalization of the trends. But even in thinking of a normalization of the trends, we still believe there will be a lot of exciting growth opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson from Citi Investment Research.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citi Investment Research","Hi. First thing on the product claims issue that you disclosed, it surprises me \u2013 number one, it just seems so un-Est\u00e9e-Lauder-like. So, does it reflect anything internally? Are you growing too fast? Do you feel like you've got the same level of control and corporate culture that you've always had? And what's the risk associated with that? I can't imagine consumers will care all that much, but it's interesting to me that you called it out so specifically. So, do you perceive any risk either in terms of your market share or sales trends or anything like that or any litigation associated with it? So, that's question number one.","And then, question number two, I heard what you just said, Fabrizio, in terms of the Lauder brand and the investments you've made and how, when you love a brand, it grows. But I'm still just struck by the slowdown in the U.S. market. With all the incremental distribution in Ulta, with the strength in online, your U.S. department store business, is it down double-digits, is it down mid single-digits? It surprises me that that business isn't responding better to the stuff you're doing behind M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder. So, if you can just address the U.S. department store business and maybe your outlook for that going forward, that'd be great. Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So, Wendy, let me start with your question on what we've included as it relates to the review of the product claim \u2013 the advertising product claim issue in our estimates. So, clearly, I said in my prepared remarks that we're being prudent in the full-year estimate and the fourth quarter, as we are doing a review of the situation and making sure that as we look at some of the claims on some of our products to the extent that we have to do retesting, we are in fact doing that retesting and we're doing it in an accelerated way. And so, that certainly is incorporated into our Q4 expectations.","So, there are some communication vehicles such as websites that have to change to the extent that we can't prove a claim. And to your point, we don't know at this point that these are \u2013 how many of the claims are impacted. We don't think that there are that many, but we don't know. So, we prepared ourselves at least in the estimate to be able to address this entire situation as quickly as possible, and we have advisory fees, et cetera. We certainly do not have any cost in the estimate related to any legal activity from this, as you indicated.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","And so, to continue on that \u2013 on the first question is \u2013 obviously, you're right. This is definitely not typical of Est\u00e9e Lauder. And that's why as soon as we learned that, we decided to act on it with, first of all, maximum transparency and maximum speed. We have decided to analyze the situation, retest and invest in retesting everything we have to retest to validate our test \u2013 our advertising claims.","And in the cases where there will be a minor change to do or a more serious change to do, we will do it immediately and transparency communicating with our retailers, consumers and everyone, and we'll take care of that. Second thing we have decided to do to invest into improving our process in that area, first of all, and to be clear, as I said in my prepared remarks, we already fixed it. So, everything we are doing from now on is under control, and we have invested and fixed it immediately.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for squeezing me in.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Sorry.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Jason, can you hold on a second?","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Jason...","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Fabrizio is still finishing his response to Wendy.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Oh. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, I'll go mute.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Sorry. I'll give you the word in a second, Jason. So, we are addressing every other aspect and checking for quality in everything we do, and we are further strengthening every one of our processes. So, we are acting on it fast, transparently, and making sure that while what has happened is not in line with our standards, I want to make sure that our reaction to what happened is fully in line with our standards and with our integrity. And that's what we have done.","Now, the last part of your question here was the risks. As we say, we don't know yet how much of this will be the impact. As Tracey said, we have put all the impact of our actions into our estimate. But in terms of the impact on our business in a broader sense, we don't know yet, but we will know soon. And as we know, we will decide if this has an impact or not on our overall results. On your other question very fast on the United States, the situation in the United States is clear. We are very successful in our new distribution. We continue to win online, as I explained in my prepared remarks, also in department stores.","We are doing fantastic in specialty-multi. Our brands are all growing there. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand by the way in the United States is very strong and growing overall. But particularly our M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Clinique brand exposure to the brick-and-mortar department store in percentage of the business is still so big that it's very difficult to offset that decline with the growth of online and specialty for the time being. But this will change. It is changing. And things like the closure of Bon-Ton will accelerate this change. Bon-Ton had \u2013 we had the business with Bon-Ton, it was more than $50 million business in the past. So, these kind of changes are significant, and we need to recover this business in the other channels. Jason, back to you.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Are we good? Am I still here?","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah, you are on.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Excellent. Okay, thank you. Hey, I guess I want to come back to the question on global category growth. If we rewind the clock the last couple of years, there's been a lot of consternation around potential market fragmentation, the rise of indie brands, the shift to online, shift to specialty-multi, where there's just clearly more brand assortment and more risk of brand fragmentation.","But if we look at results from you, it was solid 13%; LVMH Perfumes & Cosmetics 17%; L'Or\u00e9al Luxe 14%; P&G's SK-II on fire also, either your market growth rate either \u2013 materially understating market growth rate we're in a much bigger beauty super-cycle than the 6% to 7% range suggest? Or we're in a period where this fragmentation has gone entirely other way and we're concentrating growth within mega brands?","Can you weigh in on your view of \u2013 I mean, clearly, you have a view of which side we're at, and that's the concentration of growth behind mega brands. If that's the case, what's driving it? Where are the losers? What's causing this rise of indie brands to maybe stall out and go the other way?","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Jason, thank you for the question. I've talked to that in the past. I don't know if you remember. But first of all, I believe we are in your second camp, meaning the growth is 6% to 7%. That's what Euromonitor is publishing and that's what we believe is happening. But it's obviously a very special growth. I don't know many other consumer markets, which are growing 6% to 7%. So, definitely, we are in a booming of this industry, of the fact that particularly luxury cosmetics are driving, which means the first thing that is happening is consumers are trading up over time. So, the growth of the luxury part is much stronger than the mass.","Now, this is true since 10 years by now, and we are driving it. And the big companies that you mentioned including ourselves are all driving that phenomenon with good innovation, great service. But what's happening particularly in this new world of social media, consumers are interested not only in the product as a commodity, but in the how to use the product, in the service attached to it, in the creativity attached to it, in the case of makeup in the artistry that comes with it, in the case of skin care in the new learning and new habit to do what the previous generation didn't know how to do like the mask boom around the world. So, there is a lot driven by novelty and a lot driven by what the companies are doing in innovation and creating new market.","And then finally, there is all this growth of Asia and Asia consumers that are avid consumers of luxury beauty, and they are now getting wealthier and so they have better access. And finally, it's the access. Luxury beauty is at a click distance from any consumer around the world. In the past, people had to go to destination store, take the car, go there. So, there is a reason why this market is growing strongly. Now, why the big companies are growing so much better than the market, including Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, is because at the end, what really makes the market growth is repurchase. It's not trial. What is happening is the big competition of the many small brands is people try the product the first time because of the novelty. But there is no consumer that buys the second time a product unless was happy with that product.","So, what we see in our brands, that while the trial game has become more competitive and is in a way more expensive to do, the repurchase game is still driven by product quality. Our repurchase numbers are going up despite increased competition. And so, the big brands, the successful brands, where product quality and great performance in the long-term are winning, are driving repurchase rates. And that's the reason why companies with strong brands, with strong research and development, with strong formulation capabilities, with strong product quality, have a chance to continue winning even in this more competitive environment in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I have a bit of a follow-up question, the slowdown in growth of your makeup artist brands. You've stepped up spending. So, curious if you're starting to see a lift from the increased spend. For instance, did things improve for some of these brands by the end of the quarter and then into April? And then, I have a question on skin care. It's very encouraging that you're seeing the pick-up in demand among younger consumers that you mentioned, but curious to hear what your outlook is for this trend and how sustainable it is. And then finally, how do you think about the interplay of the two categories for this demographic and if you believe they can both accelerate or is there a risk that a shift from makeup to skin care could become more pronounced? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Okay.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So, let me start with makeup. Just to remind you that in the first half of the year, we had non-comp growth in our makeup category. So, Too Faced and BECCA obviously were in our results this year and not in the results the prior year. So, in terms of what we're seeing now given some of the investments that we're making, we are very recently seeing a slight pick-up in a couple of the makeup artist brands, and we are very encouraged by the strategies and some of the product launches, in particular Bobbi Brown with the new foundation launch and other brands as well. So, we are encouraged that we will see growth. But clearly, if you look just from a total category standpoint, skin care is growing faster than makeup. So, not just for us, but certainly for the category globally and in different markets. And then, in the interplay between skin care and makeup, Fabrizio?","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. The interplay is \u2013 what's happened in the last years, as you obviously have seen, is that the social media impact in terms of the impact of social media communication, social media impetus started from makeup, and makeup has been driven and accelerated by the social media phenomenon for a couple of years. Now, it's happening also on skin care. Still a lower level than makeup, but it started happening more intensively also in skin care. That's what's behind the acceleration of skin care.","And at the same time, some consumers start understanding that good skin care, just to take care of the canvas before you put the makeup on your face, is a great practice and make even your makeup work better. So, skin care is not an alternative to makeup in my opinion, but it's just preparing the canvas in a completely different way.","At the moment, social media started clarifying this opportunity to \u2013 particularly to young women, we see a boom of skin care. Interestingly, the boom of skin care or the acceleration of skin care is mainly about younger people, particularly in Asia. So, it's not anti-aging which is accelerating. It's really the skin care for natural benefit for preparing the canvas. Skin care is a base to makeup. So, the skin care which is complementary to great makeup results.","Operator","Your next question \u2013 the last question comes to us from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. So, I just want to go back to your commentary on the mid-tier department store challenges in the U.S. So, as you look at your remaining exposure there, how much would you say of your remaining base is still at risk? And then, as we look forward with the Bon-Ton headwind that appears to be going on right now and may, I guess, linger into next year, how do you think about recapture rates when these department stores close down? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So, we had a lot of closures of department stores in brick-and-mortar. Now, we had some Macy's closures last year. We had Sears in Canada. We have Bon-Ton now. We assume that the reduction on number of stores in brick-and-mortar will continue. And we believe this will be for us in the short-term a negative impact. But in the long-term, this could be actually a positive impact, because the brick-and-mortar will need to improve the experiential part of retail, which is here to stay and in my opinion is here to be very successful over the medium, long-term.","So, we are working to improve the experiential quality of the strong brick-and-mortar and physical retail, and at the same time, we are focusing on leveraging the fast acceleration of online across every retail partner, and this is working. So, what will be the impact? As I said, depending by brand. On some of our brands, which are overexposed to brick-and-mortar department stores particularly in the country, we expect that this transition will take some time \u2013 is taking some time, particularly in presence of closures like the Bon-Ton situation now.","On other brands, which are more focused on specialty and online as the way they started, this will not be the case. And depending on how different brands will do, the mix will have an impact. But as I said, I believe that we are in front. In the future, we are going to stabilize and then to restart growth also in the United States the moment that's balanced (01:07:26) by physical and online distribution and by destination stores versus experiential stores will be adjusted. And I personally believe this will be a very booming and interesting retailing environment at the end of this transition.","Operator","Okay. That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Sales increased 7% in local currency to a record $10.8 billion, excluding accelerated orders relating to our recent SMI implementation. These results were in line with our estimates and approximately three points ahead of global prestige beauty growth.","All regions and categories contributed to our performance. We successful leveraged our higher sales and created greater efficiencies to boost the bottom line. We grew our sales and profit in the phase of several challenging markets, including slower prestige beauty growth in the U.S. and China and softness in certain other countries including Southern European and Korea.","Additionally the competitive environment in global beauty intensified our ability to successfully manage through these headwinds enable us to deliver an impressive performance. By targeting our investment to the most promising opportunities around the world, we achieved record financial results including sales, gross margin, operating margin, EPS and cash flow from operations.","We accomplished many of our strategic goals, gained global share in prestige skin care and makeup, due in part to strong innovations. Our two biggest brands Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique each reformulated one of their iconic skin care products with new technologies to deliver greater value to the consumer.","We had several strong skincare launches in Asia with watery lotions, a large sub category where we had not previously represented entered with new innovations. In the U.S. Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and La Mer products were the top 10 SKUs in prestigious skin care for the fiscal year.","Our makeup category was vibrant, lipstick sold especially well across several of our brands as did hybrid products that incorporate makeup and skin care like CC Cr\u00e8me. We maintained our strong leading position in prestige makeup in the U.S. The six best selling makeup SKUs for the year were from M-A-C, Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder.","M-A-C has one of its best years ever and the popularity of this global makeup powerhouse keeps soaring. The brand's highly creative collections and standing visuals are steeped in the latest fashion and culture strengths. M-A-C expanded its global distribution and awareness through those brick and motor stores and grew it's digital audiences significantly.","Our fragrance business accelerated its sales growth as planned and we gained share in U.S. prestige led by recent launches such as Est\u00e9e Lauder Modern Muse, the Michael Kors collection and Tory Burch and also importantly our luxury brands.","Due to first year investments in some big launches, our profit for the year declined and we expect our profitability in the category to improve going forward, thanks to leveraging successful launches and our more profitable luxury brands growth.","Our small and mid size brands were among the fastest growing, especially our luxury brands, which primarily focus on one category of prestige beauty, La Mer for instance, which specializes in luxury skin care, had global success by building it's selective distribution reach, creating incremental usage with new products and attracting new consumers.","Turning to our geographies, in China, our sales climbed double-digits and we remained the largest prestige beauty company. We delivered terrific results despite lower beauty industry growth rates. During the year, we entered 12 additional cities, increased our presence in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities and launched our Jo Malone brand.","In the online space, Est\u00e9e Lauder opened a shop on Tmall, which contributed to our eCommerce business in China more than doubling. We generated strong sales growth in other emerging markets, which represents an important part of our expansion plan. Taken together, these markets, which include for example Middle East, Turkey, Russia are climbing double-digits.","In our established markets, our U.K. business was exceptionally strong, led by M-A-C and Jo Malone. We gained share by seeking opportunities in smaller cities and underserved areas in catering to multicultural consumers. We grew our business in the U.S. reflecting new product introduction, while selectively increasing distribution for some of our strongest and fastest growing brands.","In terms of channels, we've continued our strong performance in the high growth ones where we are focused. Our online business rose double-digits and travel retail once again posted strong growth far ahead of passenger traffic. Our three largest markets in the travel retail channel are in Asia and each generated double-digit gains.","In fiscal '14, we prepared the last major wave of our strategic modernization initiative, which included North America, Japan and travel retail amounting to the largest volume of sales going live at once. We worked closely with our retail partners and suppliers and I am pleased to say our detailed planning and training paid off as large mass implementation has gone smoothly thus far.","Today approximately 93% of our sales are SIP enabled and we expect to see greater efficiencies from the new processes in demand in years to come. Our fiscal '14 performance build upon the dramatic progress we made in the past five years. Over that period, our sales grew by $3.5 billion, excluding the accelerated orders in fiscal year '14.","This was a compound annual growth rate of 8.1% and twice as fast as global prestige beauty on average. We oriented a company distribution to high growth channels. As a result, our online sales have tripled our travel retail business more than doubled and we have added nearly 220 free standing stores bringing our count to almost an 950 directly owned stores today across the globe.","We eliminated more than 800 million of costs, which enabled us to reinvest in business driving activities including substantially increasing advertising. We increased our operating margin by 910 basis points faster than we expected allowing us to raise our long-term operating margin targets.","We posted double-digit EPS growth every year. We increased our dividend very sharply and all told, our stockholders saw a total return on investment of 383%. As I noted, this five years period, is a solid foundation for our future growth and underscores the confidence in our strategy. Thus we are updating our long-term operating margin goal to 17.5% in fiscal year 2017 with at least a 50 basis point improvement on average each year.","We continue to be guided by our 10-year compass a high level roadmap of expected economic and consumer trends. It helps us position our brands in the largest, fastest growing and most profitable categories, regions and channels, which should enable us to deliver consistent solid growth for years to come.","As for the current year, we estimate that global prestige beauty will continue to grow at about 3% to 4%. Our strongest growth is anticipated to again count from our online business and emerging markets across the world where in the aggregate, we expect to post double-digit sales gains.","Our results confirm we have strong strategy and we will focus even more on excellent execution and building capabilities while maintaining the flexibility to anticipate and respond to new opportunities and dynamic market conditions.","Our outlook for Asia Pacific is bright. We anticipate China will deliver solid growth. Japan meet single-digit improvement will continue and our business in Korea will show sales gains. Our sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are expected to further increase. Certain European countries are expected to improve and others that have been soft are forecasted to stabilize due to our portfolio strategies as well as strengthening economies.","The U.S. retail landscape continues to show stronger growth at the high end, which bodes well for our company and particularly our luxury brands. Over the past five years our emerging market sales have more than doubled to explore the next wave of growth we will use our diverse brand portfolio to address varied consumer preferences in different geographies. We will also expand the development of freestanding stores, which are essentially in some countries because of limited distribution opportunities.","It is also important we will be casually attuned to our consumer, through our product offering, advertising and services. We have prioritized our emerging markets and there are several that we believe have the best prospects for growth. China our largest emerging market remains the most promising and our brands are positioned to win by taking advantage of the best opportunities there.","Our goal is to grow a double-digit compound rate over the next three years by strengthening our largest brand and making them more locally relevant. We also expect to increase the pace of innovation in key subcategories and deepen our penetration in smaller cities.","All our other emerging markets taken together are growing double-digit and generate sales growth greater than our China business. Our large heritage markets are essential also to our continued growth. We are number one in prestige beauty in the U.S. and in the U.K. and intend to grow our share profitably by farther optimizing our brand portfolio sourcing consumer from mass and expanding our digital presence. Multi acting consumers are a growing opportunity and we will enhance our efforts to appeal to them.","Internal distribution, global department stores remains our core channel and we will concentrate on building traffic on the beauty floor by making our merchandizing and high-touch services more engaging. Our Bobbi Brown brand for example is building traffic by amplifying its free makeup metabolism at its counters and that service has significantly increased the average unit sales per customer.","We continue to demonstrate success in higher growth distribution channels as well as we expand in specialty multi across the globe and we match the right brands with the right retailers. Our plans also include continued global expansion of our freestanding store to reach consumers where prestige distribution is limited and in busy locations.","M-A-C is piloting several new store formats featuring different designs and sizes. As I mentioned earlier our eCommerce business has grown tremendously as we plan to keep up with exceptional pace. In fiscal 2015, we plan to bring more brands online in several new markets. We are building on the success of Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder on Tmall in China by opening origins there later this year and looking at more brands to follow.","We also plan to expand our mobile capabilities. Believing more bi-commerce holds the rate potential in many countries. Our online business grew more than three times the rate of the total company and mobile is the fastest growing component of e-commerce with its sales having doubled last year. M-A-C is our leader in M-commerce.","We've enjoyed sharp growth in travel retail and have many initiatives underway to drive further momentum. We are the leader in skin care and makeup categories as well as in Asia and plan to strengthen our position in these areas to capture opportunities in prime travel corridors.","As for our product offering skincare sales will be in integral to our growth strategy and we have a number of key innovations from our biggest brands. Clinique recently launched two major products that reinforced its authority in customization and cleansing. One is its mass Smart Custom-Repair Serum that treats different concerns depending on individual skins and the other is Clinique Sonic System Purifying Cleansing Brush, which works in concert with its three steps cleansing system.","Both products started on clinique.com with very positive results and are rolling out globally this quarter. In hair care our brands play in the relatively small but growing prestige niche. Aveda our largest hair care brand expands its rising strength in Asia to continue. It opened its first freestanding store in Korea and Thailand last year and will accelerate its travel retail expansion in Europe and Asia.","We intend to increase our R&D investment this year. Our innovation pipeline is robust across our brands and this year is more focused on wide spaced products that will fill intact areas for us. These kinds of product generate incremental net sales because they incur us tryout by both new and existing consumers. We also will continue innovating existing products in core franchises to keep them fresh which drives loyalty for existing consumers.","Many of the new innovation will be locally relevant and targeted to the specific consumer segment before possibly rolling out more broadly. To help fewer our company investment across all our business we will leverage our SMI enabled capabilities to achieve greater efficiencies and cost savings.","We now have better visibility into vast amounts of data information from our brands and countries that we can analyze and use to improve our operations. During the next phase of growth we will focus on superior execution in all facets of our strategy.","I am proud of what we have accomplished over the past five years and excited about our journey still to come. Our brands will be using their amazing creativity to set trends, create the most desirable high quality beauty products and size opportunity evident in our compass as well as others we can even imagine now. It\u2019s a winning formula that we believe will enable us to deliver sustainable consistent growth throughout our strategy.","In fiscal 2015, we expect growth to come from many different engines together producing healthy constant currency sales gains of 6% to 7% and double-digit increases in EPS.","Tracey will provide more details on our financial outlook. Our company has made terrific progress and I thank all of our employees for this fantastic achievement. Their passion and excellence has resulted in another year of outstanding growth and creativity and helped build a strong winning foundation for our future.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to John.","John Demsey","Thank you, Fabrizio. I\u2019m glad to be here today to share some details about our portfolio and our forward looking strategies. I am going to focus primarily on the growing makeup category and our luxury business. I joined the company 23 years ago with the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand and helped build the M-A-C brand. Now as Group President I oversee nine brands some of which include Est\u00e9e Lauder, M-A-C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Tom Ford Beauty and Smashbox.","One of the core strength of the Est\u00e9e Lauder companies is our large and diverse portfolio. We have more than 25 prestige brands in four major beauty categories across a range of price points and position to appeal to a multitude of consumers.","Our channel, geography and category diversity lets us dial up and dial down what we are investing and seeking opportunities. Our broad range allows us to react quickly and optimize our brands to focus where the industry is growing and navigate where there may be weakness.","Makeup is a key growth driver for us. The Est\u00e9e Lauder Company is the global leader in prestige makeup and the category is the second largest and fast growing one for the company.","In the United States the Est\u00e9e Lauder Company share in prestige makeup is over 45%. We have the top two brands M-A-C and Clinique and the last 10 of the top 20 prestige makeup launches in the United States were from our brands. We are outpacing industry growth and global prestige makeup, which is expected to be the fastest growing category in many markets.","We are well positioned in this category since it plays to our competitive advantage, creativity and innovation. Within face we leverage much of our skin care technology to create high performance foundations. In color we are able to leverage our extensive color library within the unique formulas of each of our brands. This is the area where we use our creativity the best, tapping into makeup artist to create collections and products that surprise and delight the consumer.","We also have great reach from entry to largely price points. Our makeup brand span the spectrum in terms of pricing and target consumers. Let me tell you about some of the brands that are driving our makeup success.","Our makeup focus brands are expected to grow by double-digits this year through a combination of strong organic growth and increase selective distribution. M-A-C one of our powerhouse brands is our best known and largest makeup brand. Its democratic pricing and all ages, all races, all sexes appeal literally to everyone.","To give a quick fact on average in fiscal '14, M-A-C sold four products every second. M-A-C has thousands of makeup artists globally and supported more than 425 shows during fashion weeks in New York, London, Malone and Paris.","M-A-C has grown from its strong North American roots and has diversified geographically. In fiscal '14 M-A-C\u2019s international sales again surpassed those from its North American business. We opened M-A-C doors in six new countries for distribution in total of 94 countries and even as we are expanding M-A-C, we were generating strong comp door growth at the same time.","Department stores continue to account for the majority of M-A-C\u2019s business drawing multigenerational consumers. M-A-C had great success at Nordstrom where it's has been the best selling beauty brand for many years and also at Macy's where it recently became the number three beauty brand behind Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder, which is an amazing accomplishment given the fact that it has only sold less than half of the Macy's doors.","M-A-C\u2019s freestanding stores are also a key distribution strategy and act as a great venue for learning and experimentation, which lets us apply their success to other channels. M-A-C is our top brand in terms of the number of retail stores and we added almost 60 of them last year. These stores full represent the philosophy and positioning of the brand globally and showcase our amazing creativity.","M-A-C also expanded its digital audience through successful social media channels. It became the largest beauty brand on Instagram and increased its Facebook fans by 25% in fiscal 2014.","In addition every week M-A-C launches successful fashion and pop culture collaborations that bring consumers to its counters and stores and online. This year will be no different with collections as varied as pop culture favorite Mark Simpson from the Simpson\u2019s to Brooke Shields. Another of our pure-play beauty makeup brands is Smashbox, which has doubled in sales and profitability since we acquired it four years ago.","Smashbox occupies a unique space in the industry with its photo studio positioning. Smashbox resonates well online and with Millennium. The brand won a clear for best digital social campaign and was an honorary for the top two online awards. Smashbox is a perfect fit for the specialty multichannel and remains a clear leader in makeup. It's one of the top three brands and primers and BB and CC creams in North America prestige beauty.","This year we plan to continue this trend with exciting launches in contouring, primer and eye shadow. Smashbox also has been opening new international markets during the past two years and there is significant expansion potential to come including strong growth in the European region. We also have had great strength in makeup within our multi-category brands.","Est\u00e9e Lauder is a global three category power house with wide multi-tire distribution and a strong focus on Asia and skincare. This year Est\u00e9e Lauder is leveraging its leading authority in serums by launching Perfectionist Foundation rooted in Perfectionist Serum. We plan to leverage Est\u00e9e Lauder Heritage and Iconic franchises, which are some of the best known in the business.","Last year we modernized the pure color franchise with Pure Color Envy Sculpting lipstick, which hydrates with a time release moisture complex and shapes and sculpts lips. This year we will build upon success with Pure Color Envy eye shadows.","Clinique is one of our company\u2019s largest brands and the second largest prestige makeup brand in the United States. While it is not part of my portfolio, I could not talk about makeup with our talking about Clinique, allergy testing and fragrance free Clinique occupies a unique position in prestige, which embraces healthy beauty.","Clinique is a leader in foundation in the United States because its formulas offer flawless skin instantly and dermatological benefits over time. A philosophy that says, pretty can be easy as to the broad appeal and also Clinique draw consumers of all ages and retain them through product innovations like chubby stick. Chubby sticks make color easy to apply and expand the chubby franchise of eye, lip and cheek to help anchor Clinique\u2019s leadership role in the category in North America and around the world.","Our other makeup artist brand Bobbi Brown has a luxury and classical positioning that helps women look like themselves only better, prettier and more confident. The brand has been making great strides in the specialty-multi channel and plans to expand its distribution there over the next several years.","Bobbi\u2019s makeup lessons in departmental stores and freestanding stores differentiated as a teaching brand and are a strategic service that drives significant traffic and loyalty. Next year, Bobbi will build upon this service with locally relevant menus by market and makeup lesson videos featuring multi-ethnic models.","Bobbi is also rapidly and successfully embraced the digital world. Its eCommerce site in the United States is its number one door worldwide and that it's accreted an outstanding social media results with 72 global digital platforms that are followed by a subscriber base of 4.5 million consumers.","The brand has been number one rank branded beauty channel on Youtube with videos that have been viewed globally 10 million times. We\u2019re confident about our continued strength in makeup this year based on our innovation pipeline, planned distribution expansion. We expect to capitalize on strong established markets like North America and the U.K. as well as increasing demand from emerging markets.","We expect another key growth driver to be our luxury brands. As the luxury market continues to grow, driven by affluent consumers around the world, sales of our luxury brands La Mer, Jo Malone and Tom Ford has been rising double digits globally for several years. These three luxury brands cut across different product categories are largely in skin care and fragrance.","Additionally, Bobbi Brown as I mentioned is our main luxury entry in makeup and has generated double digit growth over the past five years. Tom Ford also offers a Q-rated Super Luke\u2019s makeup collection in limited distribution that is also enjoying rapid growth worldwide. La Mer our luxury skin care brand has doubled its net sales in just four years making it now one of the top five brands within the company\u2019s portfolio, an honest to becoming a billion dollar brand.","What\u2019s even more impressive is that La Mer has grown this fast while still in limited distribution maintaining a strategic balance between accessibility and exclusivity. To put its global presence in perspective, La Mer is an about 6% of the doors of the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is in and has sold in less than half of the countries where we do business offering ample expansion opportunities.","La Mer\u2019s had brilliant success with the moisturizing soft cream, which continues the brand\u2019s strong track record in moisturization. More recent launches include the treatment lotion and the Lifting and Firming mask, which have expanded its success beyond moisturizing products. La Mer continues to focus on the Luxury consumer creating compelling product innovations leveraging the heart of the sea in the surpassed experience in store.","Jo Malone has also seen double-digit growth across every channel that it is in, doubling its business in the last three years. It\u2019s success is balanced between heritage sense as well as recent launches such as peony & blush suede in the U.K. its home market where it is the number two women\u2019s fragrance brand and Jo Malone comes with a number one fragrance position in some high end retailers across the globe.","We see excellent growth opportunities believing Jo Malone has the potential to become one of the largest and most successful high end fragrance brands in the world. We expect the brand to flourish by strengthening categories beyond sprayed fragrance capitalizing on its lifestyle positioning and leveraging it\u2019s freestanding stores under unique fragrance combining experience.","Our Tom Ford brand sets the standard of the luxury for beauty. In fiscal 2014, our sales grew double digits at all regions and profits doubled versus the prior year. Tom Ford continues to tap in to the growing demand for luxury and we expect to continue toward this amazing track record to increase distribution in key luxury revenues strengthening pillar fragrance franchises and expanding its Neroli Portofino collection.","We also see a major opportunity to develop Tom Ford\u2019s makeup line in high end luxury retailers around the world. And there are large luxury segments within our brands as well. For example, Mrs Est\u00e9e Lauder was a pioneer in luxury skin care and created Renutra part of her name sake brand. It\u2019s one of the top selling luxury skin care brands by itself in the world and we continue its tradition of harnessing nature\u2019s rarest and most powerful ingredients.","Renutra plans to launch a new anti-aging serum in the fall to build upon the luxury consumer\u2019s desire for highly effective and technologically advanced products. We have been nurturing our makeup and luxury brands for several years and now they\u2019re poised for even further growth. One of our company\u2019s greatest strengths is building brands and we\u2019ve strengthened the equity of these small and midsized brands and now even met one of our largest to improve their productivity, profitability and desirability so they\u2019re ready to embark on the exciting stage of their growth.","These brands share several important characteristics. They\u2019ve been highly successful in travel retail and still had a great expansion potential. They\u2019re digitally savvy and less dependent of traditional advertising. They expressed their authentic equity through an editorial social media freestanding stores and luxurious counter services. We will continue to partner with department stores to elevate the experience with our brands to keep them fresh while selectively broadening their geographical and categorical reach and potential.","We will continue to ensure that our makeup and luxury brands stay relevant to consumers in every region. It is thanks to our affiliates with their deep insights of local taste and effective go to market capabilities that have made our brands and product as successful and desirable in small European towns as they are in Midtown Manhattan.","With our strong innovation pipeline and this is an exceptional product quality and creativity at local and global capabilities, we\u2019re confident about the growth plans I've outlined today because they build upon our existing strengths. At the heart of our makeup and luxury are our brands and our brands have always been the strength of our company.","The brands I discussed today are at different stages of their development and we\u2019ll nurture them profitably. I want to thank our employees and our regions and affiliates for contributing the success of these brands and our company. We expect our larger brands will continue to grow and some of our mid size brands have the potential to become billion dollar brands over time.","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas","Thank you, John and good morning everyone. I will briefly review our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter and full year financial performance and then share with you our expectations for fiscal 2015. Please note that my commentary excludes the year-on-year impact of restructuring and other charges, primarily the Venezuela remeasruement charge we took in the third quarter of this year.","Also excluded is the fourth quarter and full year impact of the acceleration of retailer orders that otherwise would have occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 related to our July rollout of SMI. The final impact of that shift was $178 million in sales and $127 million in operating income equal to approximately $0.21 per share.","This amount was larger than the estimate we provided in May primarily due to higher advanced orders from our travel retail customers. A full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial statements can be found in today\u2019s press release and on our website.","I am pleased to report that for the fourth quarter net sales rose 6% to $2.55 billion. Excluding the impact of currency translations sales grew 5%. Net earnings grew sharply and were 81% higher at $175.2 million compared with $96.8 in the prior year quarter and diluted EPS was $0.45 above the top end of our expectations primarily due to the timing and discipline of expense management.","Regarding our regional performance, sales in the Americas increased 4% in local currency with 4% growth in the U.S. and double digit growth in Canada and Latin America. We continue to realize double digit growth in the U.S. through specialty multi-stores, online, our freestanding stores and salons and spas and low single-digit growth in department stores. Latin America, double-digit growth was driven largely by Brazil.","In the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, sales increased 6% in local currency. We achieved double-digit sales gains in most emerging markets including Turkey, the Middle East and South Africa.","In the more established markets, continued strong growth in the U.K. and Northern Europe was partially offset by softer results in Spain, Italy and Greece. Our sales in the travel retail channel rose 8% primarily reflecting continued growth in global passenger traffic and the expansion of our brands.","Sales in the Asia Pacific region rose 7% in local currency, led by double digit gains in China. Like-door growth in China was flat, which was an improvement from recent quarters. Hong Kong and Singapore contributed solid growth while Korea declined slightly. Our gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 80.4% primarily related to pricing and mix. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 350 basis points to 70.5%.","The primary drivers were lower advertising, merchandizing and sampling of 280 basis points reflecting the planned cadence of marketing increased to earlier in the year as well as impairment charges in the prior year of 70 basis points. Operating income rose 68% to $252.2 million and operating margin increased 360 basis points to 9.9%. Let me now turn to the full fiscal year.","We managed to deliver strong full year results while again navigating several macro-challenges as Fabrizio indicated. We achieved these results because of the breadth of our product portfolio, our agility in managing resources to fund the best opportunities and the continued focus on the elements of our multiyear strategy.","Net sales rose 6% to $10.8 billion, excluding the effects of currency translation, sales grew 7%. Net earnings grew 11% to $1.16 billion and diluted EPS increased 12% to $2.95.","Every region and product category contributed to our sales result again this year with international growth continuing to outpace domestic growth. Gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 80.3%. The increase came primarily from positive mix and pricing.","Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 80 basis points to 64.2%. The decrease was primarily due to leverage in our marketing and advertising costs reflected shifts in our mix of brand sales as John indicated as well as a planned shift of media spending to the first half of the year to support major launch activity.","We also continue to benefit from our cost savings initiatives and reinvested a portion of those savings in the business building activities we\u2019ve indicated before. Operating income rose 12% to $1.74 billion and operating margin increased 90 basis points to 16.1%. Net interest expense declined 7% to $50.8 million primarily due to the debt refinancing charge in the prior year and the higher interest income this year. Our effective tax rate for the year was 30.9%.","On a reported basis, inventory days to sell rose to 198 compared with 183 days last year primarily to support planned growth, the SMI transition and the expansion of our retail stores. The cash flows generated by operating activities increased 25% to a record $1.54 billion compared to $1.23 billion last year primarily reflecting higher earnings and certain working capital improvements.","We invested $510 million in capital projects mainly for counters, retail stores and information systems. We\u2019ve returned approximately 100% of our free cash flow to stockholders consistent with our stockholder actions since fiscal 2012.","This included $667 million to repurchase approximately 9.6 million shares of our stock, which was a 72% acceleration in dollars from last year\u2019s share repurchase activity and $302 million in dividends, which reflected an 11% increase in the quarterly dividend rate and a dividend payout ratio of approximately 26%.","We continue to review our capital structure annually and at this time, we\u2019re comfortable maintaining our current credit rating, which gives us flexibility by way of borrowing capacity at favorable rates for acquisitions or to manage through an economic downturn.","As I mentioned before, over the last three years, we\u2019ve distributed 100% of each year\u2019s accelerating free cash flow to our stockholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We will continue to be opportunistic with regard to future share repurchases while expecting to subtly increase the dividend, which combined with our focus on operating performance and growth, we believe will create the best frame work for us to deliver total stockholder return.","Clearly, we have demonstrated that opportunities we have to reinvest back into our business yield for higher stockholder return, given our growth profile. We\u2019ve increased our dividend rate by 191% over the past five years. Our payout ratio, which has always risen from a base of 20% in fiscal 2010 currently stands at approximately 26% of earnings in line with many other growth companies.","We will continue to review our dividend on an annual basis keeping it within the larger framework of a sustainable payout ratio, while being mindful of our continued growth opportunities.","Looking ahead, over the next three years, we plan to build on our strategy by continuing to focus on superior executions. We expect global prestige beauty to continue growing about approximately 3% to 4% in fiscal 2015 and to potentially return to 4% to 5% annually thereafter.","Our goal remains to exceed this growth by at least one percentage point annually by focusing on the areas that represent the greatest opportunities for momentum and sustainable growth. Our fastest growth is expected to be coming from emerging markets reflecting the continued expansion of the middle class and our medium sized brands as they build awareness and loyalty and expand into the more countries and doors.","Skin care and makeup will remain our largest categories and we believe we have an exciting innovation pipeline for the next few years across brands, categories, and geographies. And from a channel perspective the fastest growth is expected to come from our direct to consumer businesses, freestanding stores and online as well as from specialty-multi and travel retail.","These topline growth drivers plus cost leverage and savings should allow us to deliver at least 50 basis points of average annual operating margin expansions each year to reach a target of 17.5% in fiscal 2017 as Fabrizio indicated.","That takes into account our reinvestment and growth drivers and capabilities necessary to enable the growth and translate into our ability to deliver double digit annual EPS growth in each of the next three years.","Last month SMI implementation was the last major wave of a long term project that has enabled us to standardize our key business prophecies around the world. This was an enormous undertaking and our teams executed it superbly. SMI gives us greater consistency and execution, enhanced visibility of information for improved management of inventory and expenses, and process scalability to support growth.","As the major deployment phase has ended, we\u2019re focusing our attention on realizing the full value that SMI can deliver through better process adoption and proficiency with using the new technology to drive many efficiencies across the organization.","Some of the key areas of opportunity we\u2019re addressing include improvement in forecasting capabilities, which should result in reduced inventories, fewer sales returns and less obsolescence, improved management of the total cost of global and local launches and better enabling our AMP effectiveness, additional indirect procurement savings and improved customer service to name a few.","In addition to these planned four benefits, we certainly expect to uncover additional areas of opportunities as our global understanding and visibility of SMI prophecies and SAP technology increases. Importantly we have a governing structure in place to support our initiatives and ensure we have continuous cost improvement every year through leveraging the SMI capability.","These savings and efficiencies combined with some pricing mix benefits should allow us to deliver the net margin improvement I mentioned as well as reinvest a portion of the savings generated back into critical areas fundamental to our success and sustainably delivering our strategic objectives, areas such product innovation, digital and ecommerce and retail capabilities as well as supply chain agility to name a few.","Now let me discuss our outlook for fiscal 2015. The SMI shift discussed earlier adverse affects the first quarter and full fiscal 2015 year and will also create a difficult comparison in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. This is something to keep in mind when modeling the quarters and the full year. So to put this in perspective, I\u2019ll provide our financial expectations for fiscal 2015 both including and excluding the impact of the shift.","First, our expectations for reported result, for the full year, sales are forecasted to grow 3% to 4% in constant currency with growth in our international regions continuing to outpace North America. Currency translation is estimated to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 2%. Our estimate assumes weighted average exchange rates for the full year of 1.3 for the Euro, 1.63 for the pound and the 104 for the yen. Reported EPS is expected to range between $2.89 and $2.99.","As I mentioned previously, the $178 million of accelerated retail orders equal to a $0.21 per share, which benefited our reported numbers of fiscal 2014, would have normally occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. So let me share with you our comparable non-GAAP expected results excluding the impact of this SMI shift.","Constant currency sales growth is forecasted to grow approximately 6% to 7% in line with our long range goals. We plan to achieve expense leverage through a combination of cost savings, net of investments, which combined with improved gross profit margin, our expected to drive operating margin improvement of approximately 40 basis points.","Our cost savings initiatives are primarily focused on productivity, indirect procurement, AMP effectiveness and returns and obsolescence. Investment areas include innovation, R&D, supply chain planning and travel retail expansion, as well as retail and HR systems. SMI savings post high procure are somewhat offset by the ongoing support, maintenance in additional depreciation related to SMI.","Throughout the fiscal year we will continue to be flexible in our investment spending behind the activities that demonstrate the best momentum which could impact the quarterly cadence of our spending.","As you know, our guidance excludes the one-time charge related to the devaluation of the Venezuela Bolivar last year. And as a reminder, in fiscal 2014, we derived less than 1% of our net sales from Venezuela.","Earlier in this calendar year, the Venezuelan government enacted a margin cap law, along with controls on foreign currency exchange, that affect our comparability in fiscal 2015 to the prior year by approximately one percentage point of earnings growth or $0.03 of EPS. The guidance we are providing this year absorbs the impact of this lower margin.","Our fiscal 2015 rate is planned at 30% to 32%. Adjusting for the SMI shift, we are forecasting full year EPS in a range of $3.10 to $3.20. This would be comparable to our fiscal 2014 EPS of $2.95 before charges in the accelerated orders.","Depending on the magnitude of exchange rate movement, the approximately 2% negative currency impact on our top line this fiscal year equates to about $0.09 of EPS. Excluding this foreign currency exchange impact, our EPS is expected to rise by 8% to 12%.","In fiscal 2015, we expect to increase cash flow from operations to approximately $1.7 billion. Our capital plan is $560 million and it will continue to support consumer phasing investments in counters, retail stores, and retail and HR systems.","We expect a modest improvement in inventory days in fiscal 2015 with more aggressive improvement in future years as we fully leverage the benefits from SMI.","So that is our guidance for the full fiscal year. In our first quarter, on a reported basis we expect sales decline approximately 1% to 2% in constant currency. Translation could hinder growth by approximately one percentage point. We anticipate that EPS will be between $0.51 and $0.55.","Adjusting for the SMI shift, first quarter sales are forecasted to increase between 5% and 6% in constant currency and EPS is expected to be between $0.72 and $.76.","Our first quarter profitability is expected to be impacted by the timing of expenses related to new launches and promotional activity compared to the prior year. This is an addition to the increase spending for capabilities I just mentioned.","So that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","","Thanks. My first question was just around capital structure. I think many of us, just even based on what you shared in the recent past conference and so on expected. A little bit more of an update really change in terms of capital structure particularly as you have seen greater visibility and the potential for improvements in cash and inventory after SMI is implemented.","So could you just maybe elaborate a little bit more there, if you have plans for where inventory levels could go over the next couple of years, and what your priorities will be for any changes in Cap structure once that comes to path? Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis","","Sure Lauren. So again, now that we are in the hyper care stage as it relates to SMI and certainly starting to deploy some of the insight that we\u2019re getting from SMI to aggressively reduce the inventory levels that we have. There are quite new initiatives going on this year that should meaningfully impact our inventory levels towards the back half of the year and certainly in the next few years.","So I think we have spoken about at least a 20 to 30 day improvement in inventories over the next few years that we could see clear visibility to. That as it relates to at least our structure currently, most of the free cash flow that we generate is returned to shareholders via dividend and share repurchase activities.","So certainly as we free up cash from working capital as we demonstrated this year, with some of the areas of working capital improvements that we had, we fully expect to redistribute that back to shareholders assuming that we don\u2019t have other uses for that cash which -- in the acquisition area.","So I think certainly we expect over the next few years that our free cash flow generation will increase as our working capital improves.","","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Okay. Thank you. And then I did have one question for John. The Est\u00e9e Lauder with Pure Color Envy that and Modern Muse I feel like there has been a pretty significant shift in the maybe call it the tone of the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand advertising.","Have you done any consumer testing at this point or a sense if the consumer profile has shifted at all with those two launches over the last I guess it will be six-plus months now younger, more mobile any kind of change there to know that this is maybe having a bit of the impact you\u2019re hoping for?","John Demsey","Sure I'll have it over to Lauren welcome back.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","Lauren welcome back, this is Fabrizio.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Thank you so much.","Fabrizio Freda","In truth, yes, the new inventory round Pure Color Envy and Modern Muse has brought a younger more contemporary customers to the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand. We\u2019ve seen fantastic performance for both Modern Muse and for Pure Color Envy which is the most successful lip color launch that the brand is having over a decade. So we are bringing younger consumers and the good thing about fragrance and makeup is being transactions.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays ","Great. Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","A couple of questions, the first is how do you really know what sales from SAP pulled forward and what are normal, meaning like, does the retailer tell you like we\u2019re buying this because, you need to got your SAP stuff in order.","And then my real question is, on skin care is there a plan to take back market share because, obviously some of the selling data has been great, but some of the market share data which has improved recently has been a little bit soft.","So is there an urgency there and should we expect market share gains in '15? Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis","","Okay. so, on the SMI orders what we do is work with our retailers to look at the first few weeks after go live of what the expected sales that they have will be on the expected shipments that we would normally have to support those sales.","And those are the sales that we pull forward. So it's skew by skew, its week by week in terms of how we plan with our retailers.","Obviously this pull forward was greater than all of the others that we\u2019ve had A, because the markets that were involved were larger, and the time frame of the year is larger. So July is a big time period for us as well as certainly for our retailers in terms of receiving shipments.","It\u2019s all the timeframe that we have big launches as you heard from retail, as it relate to Clinique and some of our other brands. But it is the first few weeks of the July time period that we worked with our retailers to plan.","Fabrizio Freda","To answer the question on skin care, definitely there are very strong plan to grow market share on skin care. I just wanted to clarify that in fiscal year '14 we did grow market share of skin care globally and we plan to continue to do that.","If you\u2019re referring to the North America market U.S. market share, trend in skin care, yes, we didn\u2019t grow market share in the U.S specifically and we have plans to go back to growth via, first of all, innovation.","Innovation, which is much more wide space in new areas and less cannibalizing than what we experience in the beginning of fiscal year 2014 and strongly improved merchandising store in this area and new services connected to the skin care area.","Also, globally the skin care local relevant approach of our innovation is actually giving us some great returns and so we plan to continue growing market share globally in skin care also across fiscal year 2015.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Right, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research.","Alice Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research","Hi, good morning. One housekeeping question. Can you tell us what the organic sales growth was for the year overall for Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder. So we can see the difference between those and the other brands of your growth overall?","And, your organic sales growth in the fourth quarter was 5% and you\u2019re saying its 5% to 6% in the first quarter, both of which are lower than what you think are sustainable organic sales growth will be including for fiscal 2015 overall. Why should we expect that acceleration next year?","Fabrizio Freda","First of all, our fiscal year '14 overall, our constant sales growth was 7% and we are forecasting 6% to 7% for '15. So, is not acceleration for the year is consistent. In term of the sales by quarter, again they are heavily dependent on the amount of new innovation to happen in the quarter or in other also in the geography where these innovation is launched and finally in the category in which these innovation is launched.","So, as I say every time, don\u2019t attribute too much into reading a single quarter, read our fiscal year overall trend which I think is a much more solid element for predicting the direction and the solidity of our business trend. So, we are 7% in 2014, we predict 6% to 7% and this will be driven as I said by market overall at 3% to 4% in our estimate.","So consistent overall global market growth, but a strong innovation our brands and the profile of our growth, will continue to be the double-digit energy market, double-digit online, very strong results into our retail and some markets like the U.K. are doing fantastically well that we expect to continue.","And growth in China is expected to continue. And so, there is a full consistent approach to growth which is the strength frankly of our strategy.","Tracey Thomas Travis","And we don\u2019t comment on individual brand growth.","Fabrizio Freda","But I want to clarify on the individual brand growth that Lauder and Clinique are growing. They are growing globally for the fiscal year and that will continue to grow globally if in some markets their growth has been below the market growth meaning losing some share points, but little share points in some markets but this will not distract by the fact that both of these brands are growing and growing globally.","Alice Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research","Are they growing globally in line with the prestige market globally?","Fabrizio Freda","They are growing globally in line with the prestige market, also likely below depending by quarter and by brand and that's the ones that we want not to comment on to give too many details, public details\u2026","Alice Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research","But for the year overall?","Fabrizio Freda","On our growth rate, but they\u2019re growing and they're growing in a way as I said, we plan to grow market share also in these brands globally over the next two years.","Alice Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Fabrizio, against your advice I apologize, I have to ask a question about the quarter, but I was hoping in the context of the picked up investment you\u2019re going to see that you\u2019re talking about in Q1, can you just talk about how extensive that\u2019s going to be to the point that it would not knock earnings lower year-on-year?","And I guess, if you can marry that with the fact that the topline for the quarter is expected to be below what the full year range is, I am just curious with the dynamic is there?","And then just a quick follow up for Tracy, I think you said 20 to 30 days in inventory coming out, but I thought that you had said over time the number would be much more extensive than that. I thought you guys did something like 130 days, 140 days of inventory might be more reasonable? So, any color there would be fantastic. Thank you.","Tracey Thomas Travis","So in terms of the quarter and again, some of it has to do with what we\u2019re anniversarying. So, we had major launch activity last year and we have solid launch activity this year as well. There are some margin differences, gross profit margin differences between the launch activity we had last year and the launch activity we had this year.","So, that is suppressing some of the margin expansion that you would normally expect to see I think in the first quarter. Clearly it\u2019s even down over the course of, over the year and it\u2019s really first quarter phenomena for us from a gross profit standpoint.","In addition to that, I talked about some of the investments that we have in the first quarter. We do have SMI hyper care going on. So that is an investment this quarter that we didn\u2019t have last year. We had SMI going on but much of that activity was, some of that activity was capitalized and some of that activity was expensed.","It\u2019s all expensed this quarter as we are in hyper care other than obviously the system itself. We do have some consulting expenses for some projects that we have going on this year that are impacting us in the first quarter as well. So, all of those things are impacting us in Q1, which is why we -- and Fabrizio made the comment quarter-to-quarter really the focus should be on the full year as I think we demonstrated quite solidly last year.","As it relates to inventory, you are right on the both the counts, so what I said we have near-term visibility to 20 to 30 days and the team, as the actions in place to drive to that and then we have visibility over time and plans over time to achieve greater than that. So, you\u2019re right on both counts.","Fabrizio Freda","And I just want to add one your question on reconciling rest of the sales growth, many of the investments Chris as you referred to are not necessarily in advertising at the immediately the sales growth within the quarter. For example, we are investing in the first quarter into the big part of our R&D investment will happen there.","In the direct channel going more direct online sites and things will happen there. We have a trial retail investment that will happen there and then we all benefit the rest of the fiscal year and finally we have investments on the consultants that was discussed in creating the savings that then will impact possibly the next of the fiscal year and in other capabilities like in the area of supply chain fundamentals.","So, some of this investment will not provide immediate results on sales within the quarter. We\u2019ll provide first of all sustainable growth in the long term and results on profit in the second part of the year.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong of BofA Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch","First, why do you only expect operating margins to be up 40 basis points on a like-to-like basis in fiscal 2015, perhaps can your parse out a bit more in terms of the major drivers there.","I know you\u2019ve thought obviously on hyper care expenses, but what have you expected that to be offset more or less by the savings associated with SMI, and then Fabrizio I just want a follow up on your comment about growth in the small and mid size brands versus the Clinique's and Lauder\u2019s are you seeing an acceleration in the divergence of the Lauder and Clinique brands relative to the others or is it just a continuation of what you\u2019ve already being seeing for some time? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","I\u2019ll answer first there on the growth profile of our company. I think I said in the last calls, the profile of our growth is that we have created multiple engine of growths by brand, by channel, by region. Some designs go in certain moments at double digit, other at single digit. But they all provide support to the growth.","So, from brand standpoint and John commented on some like M-A-C or the luxury brands which are definitely driving double-digit because of their level of development at their profile and their opportunity for expansion.","There are other brands that are definitely, Lauder and Clinique are in this camp in that fiscal year that are driving single digit. The same profile is by channel, we have channels like online, travel retail, freestanding stores, which are driving the business at double digit and other channels like our core department stores which are driving at single digit in this moment.","And then during the years, this has changed and our ability to flexibly react to these changes and make sure that we invest where the opportunity is in a given moment of time is also the strengths of our model. So we do keep the flexibility to make these changes and these adjustments on purpose in order to be able to leverage growth where growth is. I'll let Tracey answer the other question.","Tracey Thomas Travis","In terms of the 40 basis points, the hyper care just affects the Q1 year-over-year comparison. The SMI net is a benefit this year and we have many other costs savings activities that benefits this year. Some of the investments that we have spoken about as it relates to increasing R&D innovation and other investments to support capabilities for future growth are impacting this year. But we feel very confident that if the sales growth materializes this year then we will very much deliver double-digit profit growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers of UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Stephen Powers - UBS","Great, thanks. Maybe, Tracey, if I could push on the capital structure point just a bit. I understand that you are returning much of the excess free cash flow that you are generating to shareholders. But looking forward, clearly you're confident in underlying P&L momentum, and you seem well positioned to accelerate free cash flow ahead of income growth, given the working capital opportunities.","So with that plus your starting point of a net cash position, why not take on a bit more positive leverage just in order to accelerate returns to shareholders? Or are there other cash uses, priorities, that we should be considering more near-term -- like M&A, for example?","Tracey Thomas Travis","So clearly as we have spoken previously M&A is a high priority for us. We certainly have locked the activity going on in terms of looking at acquisition opportunities and we certain want to reserve flexibility for M&A activity so that's certainly a piece of why we would not consider taking on additional debt at this particular time.","And as I mentioned in my prepare able remark, given the improvements that we have made and we will continue to make in certain areas of working capital and the improvement that we have in front of us as it relates to inventory, which now that estimates behind us we can certainly expect more steady improvement as it relates to our inventory turnover that should deliver very strong returns to the shareholders.","We are mindful that in order to keep and support the wonderful brands that we have it requires investment. It requires investments in advertizing. It requires investment in infrastructure and in capability. So we balance all of that when we look at the capital structure as well as our plans for any fiscal year.","Stephen Powers - UBS","Okay. That's great. Thank you. Then maybe John, you talked a lot about the strength of your current brand portfolio. But with that M&A consideration, maybe looking at things through a different lens, where would you say you have the largest opportunities to fill gaps in the portfolio? And I guess how many of those gaps can be filled with existing brands being extended, versus maybe looking outside to realize opportunities through acquisition?","Fabrizio Freda","This is Fabrizio. I think I\u2019ll take this one because I don\u2019t think we can start talking openly about acquisition opportunity by brand or by gap because this would be frankly to match information to our competitors so more than to you.","But the key point again as we stated is our overall M&A strategy. Our overall M&A strategy is first of all is a strategy looking at brands, which has global potential. As you know we don\u2019t have a strategy of weak M&A partnership but rather is about buying brands that we can develop over the years.","M-A-C is the example of the ideal acquisition strategy for a settled company buying a medium sized brand and making it use huge over the years that\u2019s our strategy in M&A.","Now in which areas we focus I said it repeatedly obviously skincare acquisition around the world particularly in Asia at an area where we are starting the market continuously and then there are opportunities in all the area, which are high profitable and growing and where our portfolio is today not completely filled in. and the last thing I want to say is not necessarily a gut feeling strategy. It is really our M&A strategies about buying amazing brands with amazing potential that we can leverage thanks to our great R&D and global reach and create global brand Alamak also in the future.","That\u2019s what we are looking for. We are scanning the global market continuously for opportunities and we want to keep the flexibility to engage in these activities when the opportunity arises.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital Markets.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Good morning. I was hoping to get some detail on what is going on in China. Could you tell us what the same-store sales growth did in the fourth quarter in the Tier 1 cities, and why the sales growth in China picked up overall? Sounds like it was above 10% in the fourth quarter; is that right? Also, what is the status of Osiao? Is it out of test and into full distribution yet?","Fabrizio Freda","Okay, so China in the fourth quarter net sales were up 20% and for the year it were double digit and about 13% so very solid performance overall in China across the year.","The like door the same door sales in the quarter was actually plus 0.1% so flat and this is a big improvement versus the decline of the overall prestige market same-door in China and our pervious performance in the previous quarter was mine 2.3% so an improvement trend. What is driving that in China again I explained that the big cities because of the developmental of the online, because of the saturation of the market are not growing are not growing anymore same-door sales for sure.","While the big expansion is in secondary in Tier 3, Tier 4 cities and online basically expanding the reach of the many interested Chinese consumers have been able to sell to them, that\u2019s what we are doing and that\u2019s why we are successful. We continue build the reach. So we get new consumers into our brands, new Chinese consumers into our brand every quarter.","The other thing I said already I want to repeat the fact that the same-door sales are flattish should not scare because for example our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand has the highest productivity per door in the world in China. So as table says same-door does not have a significant impact on profitability.","The other positive of China that this new consumers that we are reaching expanding in secondary cities are also very good travelers and when they travel they are interest in our brands because they get to know them better and they buy more of our brands in travel retail or in the big capital travel like Paris, New York or whatever.","And thus the other big benefit that we are following up in our analysis and how to continue to build the China\u2019s market. So that's what's happening and as I said I have a big trust that China will continue to be growth driver for us in the future in the next three years on the plan that we are discussing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Sanford C. Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein","Hi, guys. I have two questions. The first one is -- so SMI this quarter, the shift is much larger than projected. So I wanted to use that as a jumping point, because we have seen a lot of, over the years, SAP going to companies; and I think we've rarely seen it be as long or drawn-out or unpredictable as the implementation of this SAP or SMI implementation.","So I am trying to understand: Why so many challenges? Perhaps more importantly, if we believe your guidance, whether it be operating margin guidance or even at this point the inventory guidance, it is hard to see what benefit you are actually seeing from SMI.","So can you help us unravel that a little bit and give us a sense of quantification of what you will be getting from SMI after all this pain? And is that included or incremental to your guidance? Then I have a follow-up.","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. I want to take the first part of the question and Tracey will take you through the benefits of SMI that we see in the next year, which by the way are significant, but the first point why we got high order was mainly our travel retail customers.","They decided to order more than we originally estimated because it's their decision how much they want to assess the risk of being under lever under-shipped in the months of July and they want to protect their business. because the business is doing well and so they want to protect and avoid the risk of outer stock because of SAP.","As you know many companies in the past had issues in executive SAP meaning that they have some periods where they cannot ship, cannot deliver product after their implementation. So that's why our customers sometimes decide to protect themselves because they have this bad experience from the past.","Now the good news is that first of all we monitor that and we don\u2019t double count that. Second good news is that we didn\u2019t give so far any issue to them so that we are really executing SAP with excellence and I believe we are one of the best companies in the way we are executing SAP and avoiding the issues that probably you have seen or volatility and consistency that come from the implementation in other cases. So that's as far as the volume orders.","Tracey Thomas","Ali. You are right. It has been a long journey. The good news is that this last wave that we just went through is our last major wave. We have a few markets left to go alive on SMI, but we think we can manage those within normal course of business. So the supply chain team, the finance team, the business team that have been focused on SMI implementation are now focused on value realization and really levering the benefits of the system where the organization has been focused on a long drawn out SMI implementation as you indicate.","The areas of improvement that I mentioned in my prepared remarks the improvement in forecasting capabilities area real and we are putting action plans together. We have good start to action plans to improve those forecasting capabilities that should help us in the areas of inventory. It will help us in the areas of margin. It will help us in the areas of freight. So as we look throughout the P&L we have to identify where saving opportunities will occur.","And as it relates to launches, some of the improvements that we expect to see in terms of some of the resources involved in launches, from some of the better visibility that we get with SAP indirect procurement savings. We have launched Phase II of our indirect procurement savings, which will deliver a meaningful amount of savings over the next few years.","As we look at over the next three years the SMI saving there are certainly some embedded within this fiscal year and in fiscal '16 and '17 even greater amount of SMI savings.","As it relates to this year and why you are not seeing more of it, one of things as a global company with lots of opportunities we pace the investment of that opportunities and right now it's based on some of the saving imitative that we we're generating from SMI and other initiatives. So where in the past we have had more benefit from a combination of saving activities and margin expansion, gross profit margin expansion, I think I have indicated in the past that more of our margin expansion opportunities will come in the cost saving areas.","So cost saving actions have actually become more contributing in terms of our ability to not only expand margin but also to reinvest back into business. So what you are seeing is the net impact of all of that, but Fabrizio mentioned R&D innovation. There are lots of areas this year that we are ensuring our foundation for not only this year\u2019s growth but the next few years of growth that allow us to be able to stay with a good degree of confidence based on our insight right now that we continue to deliver double-digit growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Thank you. I would like to go back to China if I might and just ask a couple more questions about that. The Chinese in travel retail, you mentioned you were optimistic because more people knew your brand and were traveling out of China. But did you actually see a pickup in Chinese purchases in travel retail of your brands?","And related to that, Korean brands appear to be doing very well in Korea, in China and globally and I am wondering if that's having a negative impact on you at all, or if there is perhaps an acquisition opportunity that you can look at, if there are any because it's been a while since you've actually found something you have been able to land of any scale. Is that on your radar, the Korean brands?","Fabrizio Freda","So first of all, travel retail, Chinese will continue for a long term to be one of the most travelers. In the last year, we didn't see -- we saw an increase of overall number of Chinese traveling and their destinations have changed dramatically.","The Southeast issues like turmoil in Vietnam or in Thailand or the Malaysia, unfortunate situations and they create for example a decrease in travel of Chinese in South East Asia. The Chinese now travelled much more in Japan and in Korea, some of these also influenced by currencies interest of the Chinese travelers, the Hong Kong situation, the Chinese traveling will be less to Hong Kong.","So it\u2019s a very volatile situation, more than volatile, dynamic situation where the overall traveling trend for Chinese continue to be strong, although growing at lower pace than in the last year, but continue to be strong.","Where they travel is very dynamic and so the companies that are able to better understand these, analyze it and make sure the trends are dynamically moved accordingly to their corridors are the companies that will do a better job and I think we\u2019re very good at that and we\u2019re following this carefully and as I said we value the flexibility of our model exactly because of this.","The second part of your question is Korean brands. Now clearly in Korea, Korean brands have done very well and as we said, we took a couple of years to understand how to more effectively compete. I think we\u2019re some interesting results. Some of our new brands like Jo Malone and Aveda they\u2019re doing fantastically well in Korea, so we\u2019re learning how to compete also with our new brands in this market and in other markets like China, we see Korean brands mainly in mass being very successful.","Frankly in prestige they\u2019ve not yet impacted in any way our trends to continue to be very solid as you see and in travel retail, in Korea, mainly in Seoul, Korean brands are significant. There\u2019s been significant frankly in our new -- been significant for the last three or four years. But around the world, it still is growing. You\u2019re right. But it's not to a pace where in any way is limiting our current growth but they are a formidable competitors.","They definitely are an additional formal competitor, which meant yes, we\u2019re looking and we\u2019re evaluating opportunities on how to compete or participate to this growth in a more efficient way in the future.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante of Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","","Good morning, everyone. I would like to go back to travel retail and perhaps, Tracey, if you could tell us, for Q4 specifically, what was your retail sales growth and your shipment growth. Because it seems to me that you ship ahead of retail sales, but it still fell below passenger traffic. And if you can tell us what is happening in the travel retail channel -- LVMH commented on very low conversion rates. What gives you confidence that sales in these channels are going to rebound? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","Just want to give you the data, our retail sales for fiscal year '14 in travel retail has been plus 8% and our net sales just a little bit higher than that and the traffic was about 5%. So just to keep the record straight, we\u2019ve been growing solidly ahead of traffic in term of retail sales and travel retail. Now Tracey will\u2026","Tracey Thomas Travis","And Javier, so in terms of obviously they went live with SAP. So we certainly advanced shift in Q4 in support of the first few weeks of go-live and they did increase -- our customers did increase their shipment as it relates to that.","We\u2019re starting to see passenger traffic pickup. One of the reasons why travel retail increased their orders was July is a very important travel period for travel retail. So it\u2019s a heavy volume period and to make sure that they had the product in order to support that volume period, if we had any issues they wanted to have a greater degree of certainty.","So we\u2019re starting to see passenger traffic pickup and as Fabrizio said, we\u2019ve continued to outpace passenger traffic in the last few years in our travel retail business. So we benefit from traffic growth.","We\u2019ve also been as John indicated earlier expanding some of our brands, particularly our luxury brands and other brands in the travel retail channel, which has been an accelerator on our travel retail growth and we continue to see opportunities and that is certainly in our plans this year to continue to have travel retail be an outperformer in channel growth and our overall growth.","Operator","","We have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga of Piper Jaffray.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","","I want to thank John upfront for spending so much time on his brands. He's had a fantastic career at Estee Lauder; it's great to hear from him.","For retail, I want to ask you a little bit more of a philosophical question around distribution in this digital era. So as consumers are migrating more online for both their search and purchase behavior and activities, obviously essentially landing people directly to your brand sites -- so I am just wondering, hypothetically speaking in the future how is the role between Estee Lauder and the retail and distribution partners, how is it going to evolve in this digital era? Any insights you can share with us? That would be helpful.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah, frankly my point of view is that the digital area will strengthen our relationship with our retail partners and we are constantly working side to side with them to support their eCommerce and their digital expansion of activities. So all the customers, which have the retail partners which have the best dot com activities are also the one which delivers the strongest brick-and-mortar sales.","There is a clear strong connection between success of the retailer online and success of the same retailer in brick-and-mortar. So we are participating to the development of the business of our retail partners both in brick-and-mortar and online and we\u2019re very supportive including putting our capabilities in cooperating with them in developing this business because this Omni channel approach, that many of the global retailers that we partner with are taking I believe is the future. It is the right future.","So it's true that we\u2019ve also some of our brands with strong direct sites, which we sell direct to the customer like it's true that we have some of our strong brands with great freestanding stores where we sell our brick-and-mortar direct to the consumer as well. So we see our direct size like our freestanding store M-A-C for example and they used to penetrate the markets where our retail partners are not or to create flag-shipped brand equity building activities and show creativity and strength or to complement high traffic areas.","But they never used in competition with our retail partners. So all the move to direct online and in brick-and-mortar is actually -- is a great move for accessing the consumer around the world and to develop the brand equities and our wholesale business is actually benefiting from these activities in a big way. So my view is very positive and very constructive.","Operator","","That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.","Rainey Mancini","Good morning. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges, the net gain on liquidation of an investment in a foreign subsidiary, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, changes in contingent consideration, the finalization of provisional charges related to the U.S. tax line active at the end of calendar 2017 and the new accounting standard for revenue recognition, which benefited our results this quarter.","All net sales and EPS gross numbers are in constant currency and exclude the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. During the Q&A session we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call.","And now I'll turn the call over to for Fabrizio.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Rainey and good morning everyone. We delivered another quarter of outstanding results, thanks to strategic investment in our best opportunities combined with creativity and data-driven insight that fueled our innovations.","Our double-digit constant currency growth in both sales and earning per share came from being well diversified across categories, brands, geographies and channels, our multiple engines of growth, all while staying 100% focused on prestige beauty, one of the fastest growing consumer areas worldwide.","Our net sales growth accelerated to 12%. We continued to gain global share. We invested some of the savings generated from our Leading Beauty Forward initiative into targeted advertising, which helped support our increased sales and leverage our cost structure.","Our diluted earnings per share rose 17%. As you recall, when we reported last quarter, we were cautious in our outlook as it related to several macroeconomic and geopolitical factors around the globe. These includes a prudent stance on the United States, given the industry slowdown in December. We also anticipated that the uncertainty surrounding Brexit would continue to dampen consumer spend in the UK.","Lastly, we factored in a gradual moderation of growth in China and travel retail due to trade tensions and economy slowdown risks. While some of these risks materialized, particularly, the softness in the U.S. and the U.K. markets, slower growth in China and travel retail did not happen, which contributed to our over achievement in the third quarter.","The key areas that had been driving our strong performance this year continue to be vibrant. They included; the Asia Pacific region, the skin care category, The Estee Lauder, La Mer, and Tom Ford Beauty brands and several other brands and the travel retail and online channels.","In addition, most emerging markets grew, in particularly, we continue to attract and retain consumers in India and Russia with locally relevant products and compelling social media.","In total, our strategy is working and produced again exciting results. Skin care continue to be our largest and best performing category, which reflected global trends. With increasing demand for skin care around the world, we devoted more resources to this area. And our sales rose sharply.","Our makeup business climbed solidly with strong results across many brands in our portfolio. And our fragrance sales were healthy, driven by our high-end artisanal and luxury brands.","Having confirmed the strength of our business this quarter, we are raising our full year sales and EPS guidance. We now expect sales growth of 10% to 11%, well above our long-range goal and the industry and EPS growth of 18% to 19% for fiscal year 2019.","During the quarter, three of our four largest brands grew globally, demonstrating the popularity of established loyalty-driven brands, offsetting high quality products, backed by decades of science and creativity. Our largest brands continue to enjoy strong repurchase rates for their hero products by also attracting new younger consumers with compelling innovations and digital storytelling.","One of our stronger brands was our namesake Estee Lauder, which has now delivered eight consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. This quarter increase was the strongest one yet. Estee Lauder sales rose in every region. And its skin care, makeup, and fragrance business each grew double-digits globally.","Estee Lauder had terrific initial success with a new product, Micro Essence with Sakura Ferment, which launched in Japan, before rolling out globally. The idea for this innovation came from local insights in data analytics and was created as a watery lotion that provides a strong skin foundation for a translucent glow. The formula and benefits are locally relevant to that target Asian consumers.","In the lotions first month on counter, sales of the Micro Essence franchise more than doubled and lifted entire brand. Importantly, the lotion attracted younger consumers. We estimate over 30% of the new consumers buying the product in the first six weeks were millennials. It is now rolling out in the rest of Asia and in key traveling corridors.","Clinique overall own sales declined slightly. However, its skin care category increased globally, driven largely by Clinique ID, an important innovation that has successfully attracted new consumers, younger and multi-ethnic consumers and it has performed particularly well in the specialty multi-channel, making it a big win. Clinique ID strengths the brand dramatically different moisturizer franchise, enabling users to customize a moisturizer with one of five treatments, creating a truly personalized experience.","In addition, the brand's social media activity around the world won webby award. In makeup, Clinique introduced a new foundation, Even Better Refresh, which incorporates repairing and hydrating skin care benefits and in the U.S., it helps increase sales in its entire Even Better franchise, which is one of its core hero lines. For MAC brand, our MAC brands grew globally on the strength of its international business, driven in part by terrific consumer response in travel retail, where it launched its first campaign specifically for the channel across all regions.","MAC China sales soared and it was the number one prestige makeup brand on Tmall. Several new pure play platforms in Europe, including ASOS or Lookfantastic contributed to its strong e-commerce sales. MAC also continued to make progress in specialty-multi and opened in Sephora in Canada, where it quickly became the number one lipstick brand.","Our four brands with annual sales over $1 billion is La Mer, which grew rapidly and gained share in many markets, including France, Italy or across total Asia. Recent innovations and engaging social media programs recruited new and younger consumers. As an example, La Mer relaunched one of its core products called The Concentrate.","During the first four weeks in China, sales of The Concentrates grew by 60% and more than half of the consumers were new to the brand, driven in by successful digital marketing. La Mer also enjoyed one of the highest repurchase rates and that trend continued with large base of loyal consumers who are devoted to the brand and to its products.","Our two fastest growing channels continue to rapidly expand. Travel retail delivered outstanding results. And its growth drivers were well diversified. We had a double-digit net sales gain from each one of our top five brands. The two largest geography regions within the channels and the skin care and makeup categories, we strengthened our leading position in prestige beauty, in travel retail.","We developed many activities with focus products that capitalize on higher traffic during the Chinese New Year. Our Estee Lauder brand, for example, opened pop-up locations in key airports, even outside of Asia to reach traveling Chinese consumers. Our retail sales growth during the quarter was far ahead of passenger traffic growth, a trend we expect to continue, as we bring more brands into more airports, increased conversion, leverage our increased brand investment in local markets. Our sales were also boosted through our accelerating online pretailing business which more than doubled.","Another fast growing channel, our global e-commerce business continued to thrive. And for the first time, half of our sales came from mobile devices, with the highest penetration in Asia Pacific. Tmall continued to be a large contributor to our online sales in China. We recently successfully launched Tom Ford on Tmall, now our 10th brand on that platform, and our strongest launch on Tmall so far.","We see terrific runway ahead of our online business expand. With many more brands to rollout in dozens of countries, MAC for example, became our first brand online in Vietnam, launching on LAZADA with a store-in-store online model followed recently by Clinique.","Looking at our geographies. Asia Pacific, continue to be the major contributor to growth. Nearly, all countries grew led by China, Hong Kong, and Japan as well as Southeast Asia, particularly in emerging markets. This performance strengthened our number one position in prestige beauty in the region.","Skin care, makeup, and fragrance, all grew more than 20%. Our net sales in China rose sharply, with across the board gains in categories and channels and virtually all brands grew by double digits. Retail sales also increased strongly.","In total, our emerging markets grew double-digits. India, while still small had excellent growth. We strengthened our number one position in prestige beauty also there. Recent launches of our Aveda brands a make-up collections from Tom Ford contributed to the country's growth.","Clinique and Estee Lauder have signed Indian Brand Ambassador, as they make a bigger push in the market. Clinique new spokesperson, a Bollywood actress, will promote the brand globally. We continue advancing our strategy in North America, which includes increasing our presence in fastest growing channels. And our retail sales rose in specialty multi and online.","The Estee Lauder brands retail sales improved, helped also by a successful Gift with Purchase program at Macy's. The brand sales rose sharply during the event, even with fewer doors than in the past years, reflecting strong desirability and social media engagement.","M.A.C retail trend is improving. It continue expanding in specialty multi as mentioned. Our innovation continue to resonate strongly with a greater focus on strengthening, our most important brand franchises. This fiscal year, sales from our new innovations tied to our hero product, comprised nearly 40% of our total innovation, up over last year.","Our innovation toolbox includes data analysis, rich insights about global and local consumers, and the long history of scientific discovery and connectivity that we combine to capitalize on big, fast growing and new opportunities.","Our strategy to create fewer bigger launches is working beautifully. The average size of our top 30 product launches is 30% higher than last year. In addition, our speed-to-market is faster. In the third quarter, we had 17% more products in skin care, makeup, launched under 12 months than in the previous quarter - year quarter.","Products launched with the last year are expected to account for 30% of our sales in fiscal year 2019, a new record. Among our latest innovations launching now is Clinique Moisture Surge eye concentrate, which expands one of the brand's large hero franchises.","In makeup, M.A.C is extending the shade range of its new Powder Kiss lip collection that was created by using analytics to understand consumer needs, combined with creativity for the brand's makeup artist and runway trends. The results is a unique formula, a moisturizing lipstick with a matte texture, that we are supporting with advertising. And in the new development, consumer can now buy these lipsticks and order M.A.C products directly from the brands Instagram's post. M.A.C is our first brand to use this technology, which simplifies shopping through social media.","During our Investor Day, we spoke about the importance of our social impact in charitable activities. And today I want to highlight, the incredible work of our M.A.C brand. This is the 25th Anniversary of its VIVA GLAM campaign, which has raised nearly half a billion dollars to help people affected by HIV and AIDS in more than 100 countries. Every penny of every VIVA GLAM lipstick sold goes to the cause, which is a vital part of the brand DNA and actively supported by its makeup artist and consumers alike.","In the last nine months, we achieved outstanding results while continue to transform our business to adapt to a changing global landscape and competitive beauty environment, and to be always well positioned to leverage the biggest future opportunities. Without losing our advantages of scale and scope, we are instilling a more entrepreneurial mindset to ensure we stay agile and act decisively. This gives us the best qualities of a well-financed structured organization with the challenger spirit of a start-up. This is unique positioning and is just one of the many characteristics that makes our company distinctive.","We are proud of our performance this quarter and fiscal year, and confident we are well positioned in the biggest and best opportunities, to keep advancing our strategy winning model. We have an amazing portfolio of diverse and desirable brands. We are the prestige beauty leader in two of the fastest growing channels, travel retail and online and our wide geographic footprints enable us to invest where we see the greatest rewards.","Our innovation has never been more robust and our hero franchisee in still high loyalty and attract new global consumers. All of this is made possible by our talented employees, led by our exceptional leadership team, who many of you met during the Investor Day. Our results this quarter proved, once again, their ability to execute so effectively.","The diversity among our leaders and the breadth of their ability make them the best in the industry and they are essential to our success. As we wrap up fiscal year 2019, we are mindful of ongoing geopolitical risk, yet confident in our ability to continue executing with excellence across brands, countries, and channels that we have demonstrated throughout the year.","In closing, long-term prestige beauty has strong fundamentals, backed by positive demographic trends. Even if an economy slows, we believe that our industry will be less affected than most consumer goods businesses, as we have shown in the past.","Prestige beauty is an affordable luxury and our aspirational brands have high consumer loyalty, an enviable pricing power, putting us in a unique position as the best diversified pure-play to deliver long-term, sustainable and profitable growth.","Now, Tracey, will discuss our financials.","Tracey Travis","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2019 third quarter financial results, and then I will discuss our expectations for the balance of the year. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of this call.","All net sales growth numbers that I will discuss are in constant currency and using comparable accounting methods, unless otherwise stated. Also as a reminder, we adopted the new accounting standard for revenue recognition, ASC 606 this fiscal year on a modified retrospective basis.","For the quarter, the impact increased our sales growth by 3 percentage points, our operating profit growth by 21 points and our diluted EPS by $0.27. I would encourage all of you to look at the bridges that we've included in the press release this morning, as we do have a lot of adjustments. But I will talk to the adjusted numbers as I go through the quarter results.","Net sales for the third quarter rose 12% with growth in our international regions and all product categories. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia Pacific region had robust net sales growth this quarter. Net sales rose 27% with all major categories rising double-digit.","More than half of the markets in the region saw double-digit growth, led by a sharp increase in China, reflecting the continued strength of prestige beauty. Nearly every one of our brands rose strong double digits in China, as did all distribution channels.","Among the larger markets in the region, Hong Kong rose double digits, Japan grew high single digits, and both Korea and Australia delivered solid mid-single digit increases. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 20%, led by strong double-digit increase in our global travel retail business, which Fabrizio just described. The EMEA region also benefited from growth in emerging markets, led by India and Russia.","Growth in Western European markets was mixed. Modest increases in markets like Italy, Greece and Switzerland were essentially offset by modest declines in France, Benelux, and the U.K. Net sales in the Americas declined 6%, reflecting a deceleration in prestige beauty in brick-and-mortar retail in North America. We continued to achieve solid growth online across both retailer.com and brand.com site. Latin America sales declined overall, as growth in Brazil and Mexico was offset by declines in other markets like Chile and Venezuela.","Skin care, again, led product category growth this quarter. Net sales grew 21% with very strong contributions from the Estee Lauder and La Mer brand internationally. Estee Lauder sales were driven by continued success in hero franchises, notably Advanced Night Repair, Nutritious, and Revitalizing Supreme, as well as preliminary sales from the launch of its Micro Essence with Sakura Ferment in Japan.","La Mer saw success from its Arrive Hydrated travel campaign and its New Year holiday program in Asia. Our Origins brand also delivered terrific results in Asia and travel retail, reflecting the strong performance of its Dr. Weil Mega-Mushroom franchise.","Net sales in makeup grew 7%, led by strong demand in Asia and travel retail. Key drivers of the growth included Estee Lauder's Double Wear and Pure Color franchises, La Mer's Luminous Cushion foundation, Tom Ford's Beauty Lip and eye makeup and M.A.C's locally relevant activation, Strike of Kings and Tmall Super Brand Day in China.","Fragrance net sales rose 5%. Higher net sales of Estee Lauder, Tom Ford, Jo Malone, and Le Labo fragrances were partially offset by declines in certain designer brand fragrances. Our hair care net sales rose 1%. Higher net sales from Aveda's recent launches in Asia and targeted expansion in EMEA were partially offset by soft sales from Bumble and bumble.","Our gross margins declined 160 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. The new accounting standard negatively impacted our gross margin by 135 basis points. Favorable mix impacts and pricing were offset by higher obsolescence, negative currency and tariffs.","Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 410 basis points or 70 basis points, excluding the impact of the new accounting standards and currency translation. Increases in digital advertising to support innovation were more than offset by savings in selling and other expense areas. Operating income rose 28% and operating margin increased by 260 basis points. Excluding the impact of the new accounting standard, operating income rose 6% and operating margin contracted 30 basis points, entirely driven by negative currency.","Diluted EPS of $1.55 increased 33% compared to the prior year and grew 40% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.09 of unfavorable currency translation. Diluted EPS, excluding the impact of the accounting change was $1.28, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year or 17% in constant currency.","During the quarter, we liquidated investments held in a foreign subsidiary and realized a net gain of $71 million before-tax, which was reported in other income in our GAAP financial statements. This equates to approximately $0.15 of EPS. Also in the third quarter, we recorded additional impairment charges of $52 million for goodwill and other intangible assets related to the Smashbox brand. This reflects the continued softness in the brand's makeup sales driven by slower than expected growth in key retail channels for the brand.","For the nine months, we generated $1.76 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, below the prior year, due primarily to higher inventory levels to support international growth and the timing of payables and receivables. We invested $441 million in capital expenditures and we generated $1.22 billion from the liquidation of investments discussed a moment ago. We continue to return substantial cash to shareholders as we repurchased $1.34 billion or 9.7 million shares of our stock and we paid $453 million in dividends. We are obviously pleased with our third quarter result.","Now let me turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. Global prestige beauty is a vibrant category that is currently growing above historical rates. With the outstanding performance we've seen year-to-date, we're again raising our full year guidance. However, we are mindful of a number of macro risks that remain concerning. These include uncertainties caused by political tensions and instability, as well as soft economies in certain markets.","Given the strong performance to-date, we are raising our expectation for full year net sales growth to 10% to 11% in constant currency, excluding the impact of a new accounting standard. Currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 3 percentage points, reflecting rates of $1.14 for the euro, $1.297 for the pound and 6.808 for the yuan for the fiscal year.","We expect the full year impact of the new accounting standard to be immaterial to net sales growth for the full year. We are raising our EPS expectations to a range of $5.15 to $5.19 before restructuring and other charges. This reflects approximately $0.22 of dilution from currency translation and $0.06 accretion from the new accounting standard. In constant currency and with comparable accounting, this reflects EPS growth of 18% to 19%.","For the fourth quarter, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 9% to 10% in constant currency and using comparable accounting. Currency translation is estimated to dilute sales growth by approximately two percentage points, and the accounting change is forecasted to dilute an additional point. Therefore, we expect reported net sales to grow between 6% and 7%. We expect to increase investments substantially behind advertising and promotion to leverage our strong momentum and support our successful new product launches, as well as to increase investment behind recruitment in the US. This investment should also provide us with a strong start to our fiscal 2020.","EPS is forecast to be between $0.45 and $0.49 before restructuring charges. This includes an approximate $0.04 dilution from currency and $0.04 from the new accounting standard. With two months left in the fiscal year, we remain encouraged by the momentum in global prestige beauty and our ability to effectively execute our strategy to generate profitable growth.","Our outstanding performance represents continued investment behind the greatest opportunities in our business as well as our commitment to long-term sustainable growth. The additional financial flexibility we have gained through our Leading Beauty Forward program, the increasing strength of our operating cash flow and the greater returns we are achieving from our advertising investments position us well for continued success.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess I was hoping to understand a little bit more about what you've been seeing in the North American market. I mean, the down 6% was worse than I think a lot of us were expecting. So, maybe if you can unpack some of the drivers whether you're still seeing Bon-Ton, maybe it was the pressure of government shutdown? ","And then relatedly, could you talk a little bit more about what specifically you're seeing in the specialty multi-channel here in North America and then where are your investment as you think about Q4 kind of being driven? Thank you.","Tracey Travis","Okay. Erinn, let me start as it relates to the Americas and really the U.S. prestige beauty market. So the prestige beauty was soft in the quarter. Actually, the share results that we get suggested it was actually down in the quarter. So -- and I think it's a combination of the things that you mentioned. Obviously, we're anniversarying the tax rebates. There was a lower level of promotion, which we believe is healthy, but clearly effects sales growth in the quarter. And we saw a bit of -- from our business, we saw a bit of destocking, but our business really trended with the market in terms of the performance in the market.","Specialty multi globally was up, was up about 6%, and so we are still seeing good growth from that channel. Fabrizio, if you want to add anything?","Fabrizio Freda","I just want to add that as you mentioned also Bon-Ton was still in our number the previous year so that's still one -- probably last quarter in which we have an impact of Bon-Ton.","What I want to add is that at the end, the market was really down, the major market. There could be some part of the market -- actually in makeup that was in the non-major market, but at the end the major market and particularly brick-and-mortar was a tough quarter.","Now we are pretty confident of our improvement plan in North America. And in fact, in quarter four, we are going to invest behind some exciting innovation that we believe will attract new fresh traffic. We are going to continue spending in the fast-growing channels, specialty and online particularly. We've just completed the field restructuring that will improve our ability to go-to-market. And we will start executing with excellence. The new consumer is targeting a granularity on marketing that we presented to them in the Investor Day.","So, there are a lot of opportunity to first stabilize and then bring back to growth, also the U.S. market in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys, congrats and thanks for all the detail here today. Let me follow Erinn's question I guess a little bit with -- it looks like in the Americas, the operating income in the quarter -- it looks like the negative number is almost fully explained by the Smashbox, decision you made on the impairment. Could you maybe give us a little bit more of your thinking on Smashbox and you've obviously taken some accounting to that to try to right-size the brand in the financials here. But what do you think the brand needs going forward? And are we getting to a point where it can stop being as much of a drag to those U.S. numbers? It looked like they're quite a bit better when we exclude that.","And then separately, I was wondering if you might be able to give us a little bit more behind your comment that -- I know you said you've got some new innovation coming that drives recruitment. Can I take that to mean that in the U.S. within the negative 6%, the new customer acquisition numbers have slowed as well? Any idea what the diagnosis looking backwards is there and what the epiphany is that you think you can spend back against to help reverse those trends in the fourth quarter?","Fabrizio Freda","I'll start answering the second question and then we'll clarify the Smashbox thing is. No, actually, the consumer acquisition is -- what we are bringing back up, particularly young consumers and millennials. That we are making progress on most of the brands in acquiring new millennials and Gen Z consumers in the United States as well.","As Tracey mentioned in this last quarter, there was a less promotionality on average and an overall lower market mean, it was just less traffic in the stores. But in term of our brands acquisition is pretty -- is improving. And as all my comments about our intention in quarter four and next year is actually to accelerate that. And we have a lot of tool, the granularity of targeting, the new innovation, the better exposed to growth channels and all the other elements we are putting -- including extra investment in advertising that we are putting in our United States turnaround plan. So we are pretty positive on the mid, long-term impact of those activities also in consumer acquisitions.","On Smashbox, I want to clarify that the Smashbox is not the main reason for the decline. Smashbox is a relatively small brand in our total portfolio.","Tracey Travis","From a sales perspective, right?","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah.","Tracey Travis","From a profit perspective, you're right that the impairment certainly did impact the profitability of the Americas segment. But from a sales perspective, as Fabrizio mentioned, it's not the main driver.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you. Good morning. I actually wanted to touch on your skincare margins in the quarter, which were still very strong. So hoping you guys could bucket maybe some of the key drivers for us in a bit more detail and then help us understand what the contributions might have been from the fast growth in certain geographies such as Asia versus maybe improvements you're seeing in the product mix from some of your innovation? Thanks.","Tracey Travis","So let me start. Again, the margins on skin care are so strong, I would say first because the skin care category was up 25% in constant currency. So when you've got that kind of growth in the category, we see tremendous leverage across the board. That would be the first driver. Clearly, we're seeing great success as we called out in APAC and travel retail and leveraging that success in those regions, certainly helps from a margin standpoint as well. But it really when we've got a category growing at 25% that certainly justifies the kind of margin expansion that we're seeing in the skin care category.","We've also had some terrific new innovations in the skin care category this year that we're quite excited about. So our innovation has continued to step up every year and this year in Estee Lauder and La Mer and Clinique, we've had terrific, terrific innovation and Origins as well. So all of our skin care brands are doing quite well, globally and certainly the strongest impact being in the Asia-Pac and travel retail region.","Fabrizio Freda","And the only think I want to add is that our improved focus on hero products, meaning on the main proud, the main SKUs on every brand is also driving profitability over the medium, long-term, because it creates bigger products that can be better leveraged and better optimized and this trend will continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.","Javier Escalante","Hi, this is Javier. The question has to do again with North America, if you can help us understand the channel mix now in the U.S. with all the brands that you bought that tilt toward specialty channel. So basically if you can help us understand how important department stores is? What was the impact of Bon-Ton in the U.S., whether you can give us a sense of what was the growth in U.S. department stores ex-Bon-Ton? And also basically, how you are doing in the specialty channel? What is exposure? What is the growth rate? That will be helpful. Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","Any other question?","Tracey Travis","So, Javier, department stores are still about half of the business in the U.S. And obviously, the growth that we're seeing is primarily in online and in specialty, but about half of the business is still in department stores -- little over half of the business is still, in department stores in the U.S. So still an important channel of distribution for us. The segment would have been negative without Bon-Ton. Bon-Ton was about $16 million of revenue in the quarter last year and obviously no sales this year. So that's the situation in the U.S. as it relates to the sales growth.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah, and I just want to add, today, we have 75% of our business outside of the United States and we are super well diversified by channel, category, brands. And another thing I want to clarify, because I think we are definitely looking at markets like the United States, the U.K., China, and we have segmentation by geography. But if you look at our results this quarter by channel, globally every single channel has been growing. So you were asking about specialty-multi. Specialty-multi, we grew 6%, 7%. Department store globally, we're growing 2%. And TR and online and freestanding store and the way we look at, which is direct-to-consumer, which is a mix of brand dot-com and freestanding store, all growing double-digit -- at a very strong double-digit.","If we look by categories, we've been growing every single categories, skin care, makeup, fragrance, hair care and within skin care as the previous question, every single subcategory of skin care like moisturizer, serums, everything is growing double-digit. In term of by brands, 80% of our brands, the exception is Smashbox and GLAMGLOW, but all our brands are growing more than double-digit, the large majority of them. So there is a lot of different engines of growth going on in our business in this moment. Segmenting the business, the way we segment it, also the way we operate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks, good morning.","Tracey Travis","Morning.","Lauren Lieberman","One of the things I wanted to ask, I'm sorry because I know Fabrizio you were just now emphasizing that U.S. is 25% of the business today. But I was still curious, I'm sorry about channel mix, because the mention of the sales restructuring struck a chord with me. I think for a few years I've sort of been thinking about your investments in the U.S. is being to sort of fully support traditional brick-and-mortar, being both your freestanding stores and department stores, while at the same time investing well ahead of the revenue build in kind of specialty-multi and online in totality.","And with mentioning the sales restructuring, did suggest to me that all this kind of call it newer channels have reached scale to where you can perhaps start reallocating resources in the U.S. in a way that better suits the future growth. So I want to just I guess ask, one, is that a reasonable way about thinking where we are in terms of long-term channel mix shift?","And then secondly, brand performance in the U.S. within those faster growing channels and versus the channels where the traffic isn't. What's your feeling on market share performance for your brands in those faster growth channels versus the more struggling part of the market? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","You're welcome. First of all, speaking about channel mix. As I said, we are -- Tracey just mentioned, we are 50% today we are in department stores and the remaining is in the fast growing channel. So we are tilting on a better balance or diversified by channel also in the United States, that's our strategy. This will continue to be. We are now better penetrated in specialty. We are in a very strong online across different both in retail dot-com and in brand dot-com.","Our freestanding store are a significant channel in the United States. And obviously, department store continue to be an important part of our business. And in some areas we are growing and some department store are making some significant progress on the business.","The real difference is brick-and-mortar versus online, so the brick-and-mortar are now growing and the online is growing. Even online in department store, online in retail dot-com. So all the online is continue to accelerate and that for us is very positive, because we see good market share in this area. Our brands are very successful in this area.","So your other question was, are your brands successful in these new channels? Absolutely. I would say that our brands are even more successful in the new channels. Anyway, that's true in the United States, but that's true globally. I think in the Investor Day, we demonstrated our success in new channels like online globally, Tmall, travel retail, specialty-multi globally is really happening and we are definitely capable to drive these brands.","Now we have a very big portfolio of brands, so some brands are better tailored to win in specialty, other brands are better tailored to a typical more department store environment. And finally, some brands are more prone to win online, and we manage this portfolio actually also to make sure that we always match the right brand, with the right channel, and with the right consumer target. And that's an art. That is not an average behavior. It's really a segmented way in which we manage our portfolio brands. That's why portfolio brands is a big competitive brand.","Last comment -- your comment of our field sales force restructured. Absolutely. It was time to restructure our investment in field, in order to match and to go in parallel with a new distribution strategy, and with the new balance of the different channels. And absolutely, this is -- as part of this plan, we are increasing the resources and the focus and importantly, the skills on the new channels, in order to make our performance also in the new channels as strong as our historical performance is and has been in department stores.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies.","Steph Wissink","Thanks, good morning everyone. Fabrizio, I just had a question for you on your comment on trailing 12-month launches that are 30% of sales, which I think you mentioned was the highest level. Can you give us some context of how that number has trended over the last few years?","And how that connects to the advertising spend that you're doing kind of have fewer bigger launches with more focused advertising? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. This is a great strength that we've evolved in the last years. And is the fact that we have now multiple brands and every brand has its own innovation program, and the fact that we innovate in skin care and makeup and hair care and fragrances. And within every of this category, like skin care, we have very clear innovation programs by sub-category, example, moisturizer rather than masks, et cetera.","So our granularity or our granular ability to look at opportunities make us now innovating across all these multiple global segments. That has increased the percentage of successful sales that we do via innovation. This strategy combined with hero product strategy, meaning, bigger innovations and fewer innovation and leveraging our historical franchises like Advanced Night Repair, [indiscernible] Clinique, the combination of those two strategy is making our innovation stronger, more abundant, and at the same time more profitable and efficient. And that's what I'm trying to say is the magic of our new innovation program.","How this is linked? By the way, how was in the past? Last year was 20%, this year would be 30%, and when we started our strategy nine years ago, we were around 10%. So, we have tripled our innovation power in the last nine years. And how this -- and by the way this is indicated also by our results I believe. And how this is linked to our advertising investment is, the advertising -- what has changed with the arrival of the lot more digital advertising is that in the past we had few advertised brands. Clinique, Lauder, some fragrances and that was it.","The other brands will live out of word of mouth and other activities and in store and obviously a lot of store activation. Today, every single brand is advertised. And that's what is creating also the acceleration. And so, our advertised brands -- our advertise investment today touch all our brands. And all our brands are reaching scale and levels to justify a part of their budget in advertising. And that obviously is a top-line accelerator, particularly when combined with innovation. And last, which is probably behind your question, yes, a lot of our advertising is focused on our innovation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good morning, guys.","Tracey Travis","Good morning.","Dara Mohsenian","So, Fabrizio, it's rare to see this level of corporate top line growth that you're expected to post this year. It's even rare to see it continue in subsequent years, when you cycle more difficult comparisons. So, I'd love to hear your viewpoint on sustainability of the strong top line growth, as we look out to next year? And specifically are there any signs of a potential slowdown in some of the key momentum areas that have been driving your business?","And then also, just from a longer-term perspective, can you talk about how you've managed the business this fiscal year to sort of take advantage of the top line growth, and use it to propel longer term growth as you look beyond this year? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah. The idea of growing ahead of market is definitely sustainable. We believe, we will continue to grow ahead of market and continue to build global market share. And the reason why this is a sustainable long-term view for us is assertive. Many will think I was just planning is because we are exposing our business to the fastest growth currents of the world. Thanks to Leading Beauty Forward, we have changed a lot in fixed costs and created variable OpEx.","And these variable expenses, we can tailor them where the biggest opportunity at the speed of light. This was not possible in the past. So the first thing that make us sustainable that we can invest and allocate resources very fast with a lot of agility wherever the opportunity is. And so even in a world, which is more volatile and where the opportunity changes faster than in the past, we have now the agility to react with the same speed. And so this ability to match resources to opportunities is our strength.","In this moment, the biggest opportunity, China, we are able and willing to invest in China in a great way. This has to change someday there will be other opportunity as we have demonstrated in the past where we will invest more. In this moment, our priority is to around the United States. We are going to invest in the United States and within the United States on the biggest opportunity, which are in the channels, by category, by channel, and by consumer segment.","So this ability to granularly look at the opportunity and invest allocate resources on them is a sustainable long-term capability that we have built in our business that I believe will continue to drive our business ahead of market for many years to come. Do you want to add anything to it?","Tracey Travis","No, I mean, the only -- couple of things that I would add, Dara is clearly, if you look at our history, over the past few years, you see that the fourth quarter is our lowest operating margin quarter, and it is somewhat related to the timing of some of our big innovation, and also related to, once we have seen how innovations perform during the course of the year, we take the opportunity to invest more behind them. And that provides us, has historically -- at least our experience provided us with a strong start to the next fiscal year.","As Fabrizio said, we do expect that we will continue to grow ahead of market. The market last year, based on our information, grew around 7%. As we communicated at Investor Day, we do expect that the market will settle down at some point in the 5% to 6% range. So, we do expect that growth that we've seeing, the double-digit growth over the last few years in the next few years would slow as we expect that the market would slow. But we, in all cases, believe that we will continue to grow ahead of the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the terrific results.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you.","Tracey Travis","Thank you.","Dana Telsey","As you think about your categories and just the makeup category, can you talk a little bit about how you see that progressing on the makeup side? What would change the direction of operating income there? Is there anything -- whether it's products, whether it's channels, geographies where there's a differentiation and how it's performing? Thank you.","Tracey Travis","So let me start, Dana. Obviously the makeup category is impacted by some of the challenges that we discussed with Smashbox. We are seeing the M.A.C brand pickup, but obviously the M.A.C brand had been slow in the last year or so, so that has impacted the profitability of the makeup category.","And fundamentally, again, when you think about the architecture of our P&L, growth drives a lot of margin expansion. So, to the extent that we see the makeup category growing globally, which we are growing relatively in line with the makeup category, but to the extent that we see that category pickup, certainly we'll see operating margin pickup.","We expect operating margin will pickup anyway, given some of the innovation that we've got planned for some of our makeup brands like Too Faced, like M.A.C and some of our other brands as well, BECCA, et cetera, in the next few quarters. So we do expect that that will an improvement. But we do have some brands struggling in the category that's dragging the operating margin down.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah. And our strong brand, whether it's growing the demand, the operating margin is very, very attractive. And so it's a matter of mix of brands that we'll correct over time. But also I wanted to clarify the market of makeup, is we go up and down.","I mean, now is the skin care moment. But two years ago was the makeup moment. And by the way, this is different by region. In the U.S. clearly makeup is not a growing segment in this moment. But in Asia it is the fastest growing segment.","Just to be clear, makeup in China, in the last quarter grew faster than skin care. And I'm not speaking about our business only; I'm speaking about the market. And so, makeup is a very strong category with a lot of future.","And, when reached certain level of growth, we'll have the same positive impact on allowing us to leverage our cost structure that skin care has.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Q \u2013 Mark Astrachan","Thanks and good morning everybody.","A \u2013 Fabrizio Freda","Good morning.","Q \u2013 Mark Astrachan","I wanted to revisit the U.S. again and maybe ask the question in kind of a bit of a different way. How do you think about the brands and the channel mix today? Obviously department store is still half the business.","Do you think you have what it takes to improve performance as it is? Is it just -- you mentioned increasing spend, but is that enough, do you think you need to do more selectively if available to go into different brands, channels, M&A that would buy things that could help you in that?","Do you think maybe expanding into more active areas, things that maybe a bit more on trend from a consumer standpoint? And then just more broadly, when do you anticipate U.S. gets back to growth?","A \u2013 Fabrizio Freda","Yeah. As we said, but we believe we have a great plan, as I said. The plan is about continuing get exposing different brands through the right channel, in the right target group.","As you said, by brand, certain brands are really playing well in specialty. And they're playing well with the specialty customers. Other brands are perfect for department stores. It will continue to be exposed in the majority of the department stores, which are very important channels.","And all of these brands are doing fantastic online and that we are continue building their specific targeting online. The innovation and the new exciting innovation that attract consumers, is going to be a key driver, continue to be a key driver of acceleration.","And the other be segmentation, the ability to speak in a granular way to different segments of consumer, including multi-ethnic consumers around the U.S. is our plan.","And we believe this mix of distribution, activation, innovation and granularity of marketing and the new area of segmentation, combined with a better field sales force; better focus by channel is our answer to restart growth.","Obviously, we need to assume that the market overall will start growing back again. And that's what we also expect that the market will go back to growth. And when this will happen, which we believe next fiscal year, we do have the potential to go back to growth\u2026","Operator","Our\u2026","A \u2013 Fabrizio Freda","The last thing, sorry, I want to say. I want also to clarify that even that if that's happened, the impact in the short term on the overall trend of the total company is not very big. The real total -- the significant impact of the company is not in that turnaround from slightly declined to slight growth.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Q \u2013 Olivia Tong","Thanks, good morning. Want to talk a little bit about the operating expense, because excluding the change of the accounting impact there was quite a nice movement there.","Did Leading Beauty Forward had an inflection point, because historically you've reinvested a significant portion of that, so maybe it's just timing but normally you don't flow that much of it through, so just trying to understand that a little bit better? Thank you.","A \u2013 Tracey Travis"," No, we did have a great quarter of leverage, Olivia, in the third quarter, you're right. And Leading Beauty Forward absolutely contributed to that. So, as we had announced previously, we actually have increased our expectations for the program given the number of programs that have been added to the Leading Beauty Forward.","And it is giving us more flexibility in our expense base. So we did see more leverage in some of the areas outside of advertising and promotion than what we had expected. And so, yes, we have more flexibility.","We are still investing, though, a good portion of the savings of Leading Beauty Forward. Fabrizio mentioned, digital advertising, the digital capabilities in order to be able to do digital advertising.","So the talent, the technology that we are investing in, to be able to both create the digital advertising as well as investing a lot more in our analytics capability as well.","So we are using some of the savings to reinvest back in the business, to build capabilities that we need to have continued growth over the next few years. And that's working out well for us in the short-term, and we believe in the long-term as well.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.

And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio now.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our new fiscal year is off to a terrific start. We delivered an outstanding financial performance in the first quarter, powered by multiple engines of growth across our business. Both sales and earnings per share rose double-digits, and all of our regions and major categories advanced. Our 13% constant currency sales increase exceeded our forecast, and we leveraged the incremental top line results into excellent earnings growth, aided by cost savings and efficiencies.","We accelerated the momentum that we experienced at the end of fiscal year 2017 by continuing to focus on fast growing brands, channels, and countries, and fueled these areas with additional resources and investments. We targeted new consumers as we expanded our reach, especially with millennials, and they were drawn to our innovative, high-quality products. More influencers' attention, sophisticated social media programs and a digital-first mindset across our brands helped drive our success.","With an encouraging start to the year and continued confidence in our outlook, we are increasing our full-year sales and EPS guidance. In constant currency, we now expect our sales to rise 8% to 9% and earnings per share growth of 12% to 14% in fiscal year 2018. At the same time, we are mindful of external geopolitical and economic issues that could pose challenges to our business.","Looking out our categories, makeup has been strong for several years and continued to be robust across many of our brands. Too Faced and BECCA contributed significantly along with Tom Ford and Est\u00e9e Lauder. What stood out in this quarter, however, was our skin care performance which rebounded strongly, a trend we are seeing in the industry. Our improvement stemmed from strength in existing products and successful recent launches from Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, and GLAMGLOW, as they captured many new consumers.","Our fragrance categories growth came largely from our luxury and our artisanal brands, which are gaining traction worldwide and have developed into a strong growth engine. Nearly all brands in our portfolio advanced globally. Our flagship Est\u00e9e Lauder brand generated double-digit global growth with positive results in every region, led by particular strengths from Chinese consumers and global travelers.","Aligned with the company's strategy, Est\u00e9e Lauder has developed multiple engines of growth across its categories, channels, and geographies. Much of the brand's momentum stemmed from an acceleration in skin care on top of continuous strength in makeup. This was reflected in the success of these powerful hero franchises, including the Advanced Night Repair and Re-Nutriv skin care collections and Double Wear and Pure Color makeup lines. This marks Est\u00e9e Lauder's fourth consecutive quarter of solid sales growth, in the last two quarters, up double-digits.","Our M\u00b7A\u00b7C brand grew modestly on a global basis, thanks to excellent gains in Asia\/Pacific, particularly in China, where its business more than doubled. Growth also came from travel retail, where its sales climbed double-digits. M\u00b7A\u00b7C has successfully captured new consumers, helping to deliver sequential improvements also in North America.","Our luxury brands continued to enjoy strong worldwide demand. La Mer, Jo Malone, Tom Ford each grew double-digits in every region. And our newness brand are performing well, and we build their equities and broaden their reach to a targeted consumer base.","To stay in the lead in prestige beauty, we continued to successfully pivot to the high-growth channels, where more consumers are shopping. Our sales in travel retail, specialty-multi and online each grew strong double-digits. Sales gains in travel retail reflected higher passenger traffic, a greater number of Chinese travelers to Hong Kong and Macau, compelling offering and a wider exposure of some of mid-sized brands.","All of our brands benefited from the positive trend. Tom Ford, Jo Malone, and La Mer were standouts while most of the portfolio had healthy gains, including Clinique, which rose sharply on strong demand for its moisturizers. All regions grew in travel retail. Asia\/Pacific led the growth with Chinese consumer traveling in greater numbers within Asia as well as to key tourist destinations in Europe. We continued rolling out some of our newer brands in major airports, including By Kilian or Le Labo.","For the fiscal year, we expect our travel retail business to remain robust based on expected strong passenger traffic growth, increased conversion of travelers into buyers and sustained demand for our products, particularly from emerging market consumers. We plan to invest more in China and other emerging markets this fiscal year to further build awareness and demand for our brands. We should benefit consumption in both the local market and several travel corridors.","Our strong online business was led by third-party and retailer sites. Globally, our metrics improved across the board, including higher traffic, conversions, and orders. We continued to garner new consumers throughout our business on Tmall in China, where our sales more than doubled, fueled in part by M\u00b7A\u00b7C's successful launch in May. In the recent quarter, M\u00b7A\u00b7C also successfully launched on a large online platform in Southeast Asia owned by Alibaba called Lazada with a brand building distribution model similar to Tmall, where we control the look and the content of the virtual store. We expect to expand on the platform in more markets and with more brands starting this quarter.","We continue to broaden our global online footprint with new site launches and retailer distribution expansion. In the quarter, we added more than 100 sites. The majority were retailers and most of them in the European region, demonstrating the scalability of our digital model.","Spurred by the growth of social media and technology advancement, mobile is the focus of our digital strategies. In the recent quarter, mobile accounted for 70% of our global online traffic. We are seeing the results of our investment in mobile, as it is an important factor driving first time digital consumers in emerging markets and increasing the frequency of purchases in more developed countries.","We also continue to strengthen our position in specialty-multi retailers globally. Many of our brands expanded their target reach as they pushed younger consumers drawn by the channel. M\u00b7A\u00b7C roll out in ULTA Beauty in North America has resonated strongly, as approximately half the consumer who purchased M\u00b7A\u00b7C products were new or lapsed users of the brand.","M\u00b7A\u00b7C has become a best-selling makeup brand in the large majority of ULTA Beauty stores where it opened. And based on the strong initial performance, we plan to accelerate its expansion there. By opening in more specialty-multi stores globally, M\u00b7A\u00b7C will continue to balance a meaningful presence in all major channels, department stores, freestanding stores, specialty-multi, online, and travel retail.","Internationally, we are strategically expanding our newest brands, Too Faced and BECCA, in the specialty-multi channel which is their primary distribution focus. We have entered certain European markets through Sephora and other retailers and are highly ranked. Several brands are actively expanding in specialty-multi in Korea where sales has been excellent. For example, Clinique and Origins each added more than 50 doors of Olive Young.","Turning to our geographies, our sales in China soared. Virtually all our brands there grew double-digits, while some, notably M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Tom Ford, and Lab Series, more than doubled. Our makeup business in total doubled for the second consecutive quarter while skin care accelerated. Our luxury fragrance brands also performed beautiful.","Our brands have strengthened our position with Chinese consumers, and our analytics show that much of this growth is coming from consumers new to our brands. Our retail sales accelerated sequentially from last quarter, and importantly, we gained share.","The surge in consumption for luxury beauty in China is due in part to stronger demand from millennials in lower prices as a result of import tax reductions which have given consumers more purchasing power. We foresee continued strong interest in luxury products by Chinese consumers and plan to continue investing in the country.","Hong Kong delivered strong gains as tourist traffic increased and local demand improved, contributing to increases across categories. More investment in digital and social media helped drive awareness.","We have been strengthening the portfolio of our newness brand by providing R&D and supply chain capabilities. We are also identifying new distribution opportunities where we see strong consumer interest. As a result, we launched several of our new luxury fragrance brands in European flagship department stores that have significant tourist traffic.","In the U.S., we are committed to collaborating with department stores to drive growth both in store and online by exciting consumers with product innovation and better services. This quarter, our sales from many of the stores' online sites were robust, and although our business in brick-and-mortar continued to be challenged, we saw early signs of progress.","We are encouraged that our organic sales in North America department stores showed sequential improvement for the quarter, despite the impact of hurricanes that affected our business for several weeks in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. This speaks to the breadth and strength of our portfolio, as well to our channel mix. On a more personal level, we are proud of the work that the company has done to help our affected employees and their families in the areas disrupted by the storms.","Fueling our success across channels and geographies was an array of exciting products that captivated consumers. We continue to focus our innovation on our biggest franchises, striving to make our hero products in every brand even more valuable, introducing new products with an important franchise brings it more attention and increases sales across the key areas of our business. Through effective social media, our brands are inspiring more trial of core product lines, which more often lead to repeat purchases and brand loyalty.","For example, Est\u00e9e Lauder introduced a new eye serum under Advanced Night Repair line, the ANR Eye Concentrate Matrix. It was highly successful worldwide and helped drive sales of the entire franchise. Likewise, Clinique newest Moisture Surge product, a supercharged concentrate, boosted the collection and created the halo effect on the moisturizer's sub-category, which is a strategic focus area for Clinique. Moisture Surge sales have increased significantly for the last two years globally and, in the recent quarter, rose more than 30% as retail in the U.S. Clinique plans to bolster the Moisture Surge franchise with additional products.","As we promote our wide array of beauty products, we are focusing our marketing spending on digital to allow how consumers are seeking communications and information. Each of our brands has adopted a digital-first mind-set with an emphasis on mobile. With a tailored approach, each brand continuously decide which platforms and messages are most effective in reaching their target consumers.","Another important piece of our digital strategy is social media, especially the use of influencers, who have proven to help our brands standout. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand recently named a new global beauty director, who is attracting younger consumer and collaborating on product development. Clinique uses hundreds of local influencers all over the world, who promote its products in culturally-relevant ways. Clinique China business was solid this quarter, due in part to improved consumer engagement.","Looking to the holiday season, we believe our compelling programs will drive traffic to stores and support our overall business. Clinique has developed desirable sets that will be competitively positioned, while M\u00b7A\u00b7C's Snow Ball collection reflects current fashion trends. We continue to invest in capabilities and talent. Our performance is the reflection of our terrific teams across the globe who were able to quickly pivot and execute change smoothly. We continuously developed our bench strength to ensure that our business leaders are in the best positions to perform with excellence and advance our strategies.","Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative is enabling us to cut expenses, become more efficient, and create great leverage of our sales growth. This will allow us to invest more in best growth opportunities by also expanding our operating margin.","We are maintaining some flexibility to allocate further resources to our biggest opportunities with the potential to spur momentum. We plan to devote greater resources to our strongest growth engines; China, global digital commerce, product innovation, and travel retail, to advance our industry leadership and sustain our growth above global prestige beauty. We are gratified to be starting this fiscal year on such a high note, which is a testament to our winning strategy, to the agility of our talent and to our execution capability. We are optimistic about our future and excited about the global opportunities that lies ahead while remaining mindful of potential macro risks.","Now I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2008 first quarter financial results and then cover our expectations for the second quarter and for the full year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges and adjustments primarily related to our Leading Beauty Forward initiative.","Net sales for the first quarter were $3.27 billion, up 13% in constant currency compared to the prior-year period. Incremental sales from Too Faced and BECCA contributed approximately 4 percentage points of this growth, as expected, which means our organic growth accelerated this quarter to 9%, exceeding our expectations.","Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 18% in constant currency, driven by a strong double-digit increase in our global travel retail business. Travel corridors in Asia led much of the growth and they were fueled by strong demand in local markets that drove solid passenger traffic, exceptional like-door growth, and some additional points of sale outside of travel retail.","Business was more mixed in the region's other markets. Our sales in the Balkans, Turkey, and India grew strong double-digits and we had solid increases in Italy, the U.K., and Switzerland. These gains were partially offset by declines in Germany, the Middle East, and South Africa. In the Asia\/Pacific region, sales rose 17% in constant currency, driven primarily by the accelerated momentum in China. Sales in China rose almost 50%, with broad-based growth across brands and channels. Hong Kong also accelerated, rising 14% off of a very soft performance prior year.","We also achieved solid sales growth in Taiwan and Malaysia. Net sales in the Americas grew 7% in constant currency. Excluding the incremental sales from the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA, the region's sales declined 3%. The U.S. had continued strong growth in specialty-multi, retail and online, including department store online sites but remained challenged in much of the mall-based brick-and-mortar stores. Canada also declined slightly due to softness at Sears Canada, which is liquidating. And Latin America sales fell moderately in the first quarter.","Our gross margin declined 90 basis points compared to the first quarter last year due primarily to the impact of the fiscal 2017 acquisitions and the associated inventory step-up. The mix of sets of new products largely offset favorable category mix and efficiency gains.","Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 360 basis points, primarily due to lower selling expenses due to our sales channel mix as well as continued expense controls. We also benefited from a change in the timing of stock compensation expenses due to a new provision in our equity award agreements, which will adversely impact OpEx in the second and third quarters, offsetting the first quarter benefit.","Operating income rose 34% and operating margin increased by 270 basis points. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 22.3%, reflecting the impact of the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement related to excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. In our first quarter, we recognized $23 million of excess tax benefits as a reduction to our income tax provision. This benefit, which flowed through stockholders' equity prior to the change, reduced our effective tax rate for the quarter by 420 basis points and added $0.06 to our EPS.","Diluted EPS of $1.21 increased 42% compared to the prior year and grew 41% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.02 of favorable currency translation. EPS was higher than expected due primarily to the outstanding results delivered by our China and travel retail businesses, stronger overall growth in skin care and continued disciplined expense management. Given our strong results, we plan to maintain the flexibility to redeploy some of these funds to further support areas of momentum over the next few quarters.","Our Leading Beauty Forward efforts are going very well. We have great momentum with approximately 60 initiatives identified and approved, and we continue to uncover further opportunities. For example, we are optimizing our go-to-market selling and education areas and providing employees with digital tools to better and more efficiently serve our retailers and our consumers.","We established a new global shared services organization called 1Source (23:30), which is designed to efficiently deliver fundamental services to the company. Initially, 1Source (23:35) will provide select finance, legal, and HR services and, over time, will expand its offering to generate even more services. And our brands are building locally-relevant consumer engagement capabilities with increased investment in digital assets and experiences.","We are very pleased with the progress we've made and the hard work of all of the employees involved who have embraced Leading Beauty Forward with The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' competitive spirit. During the quarter, we generated $93 million in net cash flows from operating activities and we invested $116 million in capital expenditures. We used $111 million to repurchase 1.1 million shares of our stock and paid $126 million in dividends. We also announced this morning that our board approved a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.38 per share.","Now, let me turn to our outlook for next quarter and for the full year. We've had a terrific start to our fiscal year and yet we do recognize that a variety of macro risks, including the UK's anticipated exit from the European Union, political instability in many areas around the world, and soft economies in certain markets create an ongoing level of uncertainty in many parts of our business. Additionally, I want to remind you that comparisons will normalize more in the second half of the year when Too Faced and BECCA will be in the base year, and we are more closely lapping more of the sequential improvements we saw throughout fiscal 2017 in China, Hong Kong, and travel retail.","That said, we are raising our sales guidance expectation to 8% to 9% in constant currency for the full fiscal 2018 year. This estimate includes approximately 2 points of growth from the incremental sales of Too Faced and BECCA. Currency translation is expected to benefit reported sales growth by 2 percentage points, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.18 for the euro, $1.34 for the pound, and $112 for the yen for the fiscal year.","The strength of our first quarter performance allows us to both raise guidance and to maintain some flexibility to invest in areas of strength to propel momentum and help protect against downside macro risk. Supporting the strong performance we have in the Asia\/Pacific region remains a priority, as does accelerating the rollout of our newest brands.","We are raising our EPS expectations to a range of $4.04 to $4.12 before restructuring and other charges, including approximately $0.16 of benefit from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 12% to 14%.","At this time, our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 26%. While this guidance includes the first quarter impact of the new accounting pronouncement for share-based compensation, we are not forecasting the impact for the remainder of the year given the level of uncertainty in estimating how the stock market will perform, as well as uncertainty with both the timing and level of employee stock option exercises.","For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 10% to 11% in constant currency, reflecting early confidence in our holiday assortments, new products, and expanded targeted consumer reach. Currency translation is estimated to add approximately 3 to 4 percentage points. Too Faced and BECCA are also forecast to add approximately 3 points to sales growth for the quarter. As I mentioned before, by the end of the second quarter, these two brands will have lapped their acquisition dates and will be part of our organic growth in the back half of the fiscal year.","EPS is forecast between $1.38 and $1.41 before restructuring charges, and this includes about $0.07 benefit from currency. We are, obviously, pleased with the momentum we saw in the first quarter and with our progress, executing our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. We remain focused on delivering another successful year of solid top-line growth, margin expansion, and double-digit EPS increases.","And that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question today comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning folks. Congratulations on a strong start to the year.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","You're welcome, and thank you for letting me ask a question. I guess I wanted to delve a little bit deeper in terms of the swirling tide of what's happening underneath the hood of beauty growth overall, prestige beauty growth. You mentioned skin care getting better, makeup slowing. We've also seen in some of the measured data out there a bit of a slowdown in some of the small brands that have encroached upon the territory in the last couple of years. It's raised some consternation of what it means for the sustainable growth of some of your recent acquisitions.","I'd love to hear you weigh in on what you're seeing, and what you expect from Too Faced and BECCA as they roll into the base? But, maybe as importantly, if not more importantly, weigh in with what this shift may mean in terms of your stronghold in skin care, the implications for your market share overall, and the implications for margins on the Forward?","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Wow, this is one question. But yes, basically, prestige market we believe will continue to grow 4% to 5%. In this moment, it's pretty solid. The drivers of the global prestige market, frankly, are not changing, and they are the higher consumption of prestige from the millennial consumers. The higher access to luxury and prestige businesses in emerging markets, particularly in China. And the continuous \u2013 the higher level of usage, particularly on makeup, of the millennial consumers versus previous generations.","The recent improvements of the trend is in skin care where the millennials are also entering more than skin care business. Now what is the consequence of us of this is frankly a better balance of the growth between makeup and skin care is favorable to us because our skin care margins are better than the overall makeup margins, but I want still to remind that, within makeup, there are certain categories like face or foundation, which are also very profitably like many other skin care categories. So it's a very good positive.","In term of the impact of this trend on Too Faced and BECCA, makeup is growing. Now the new news is the acceleration of skin care. Frankly, I don't see any big issue with deceleration of makeup, also because makeup continues to grow internationally in a very strong way, and we are, in fact, deploying Too Faced and BECCA more internationally.","So what is our expectation for Too Faced and BECCA? Obviously, after we have finished to add them \u2013 when we will add them in the base, we plan to continue growing this brand double-digit and, as part of this, the internationalization of these two brands will be an important step.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. My question had to do with the U.S. business. Tracey, I think you threw out a number of the U.S. business being down 3% ex the acquisitions. And I know that's just sort of a reflection of tough times in department stores, et cetera, et cetera. But what's your outlook there? I mean when does the specialty-multi distribution become big enough so that it really offsets your exposure to the department stores so that we can see positive growth in that core organic U.S. growth? Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Well, I'll start and then perhaps Fabrizio will pipe in. So we do expect, Wendy, to your point and spoke about the fact that we do expect to roll out more brands in specialty-multi this year. We've rolled out Bumble and bumble into specialty-multi. We continue to rollout M\u00b7A\u00b7C into specialty-multi. So we now have a good representation of brands in specialty-multi, and are doing quite well as we said in our prepared remarks.","At the same time, Fabrizio reinforced the fact that we are also partnered with our department store customers to try to stabilize some of the declines that we've seen in their brick-and-mortar business \u2013 again, the retailer dot-com business is growing quite nicely, but in the brick-and-mortar business and a lot of good dialogue and discussion there, and we hope to see some improvement in that area.","Those two things combined, we expect to come out of this year in a much better position as it relates to the U.S. market, both in terms of us having diversified our distribution more with our brand portfolio and hoping for some stabilization based on the activities of ourselves in combination with our retail partners in department stores and brick-and-mortar.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yes. And I just want to underline the point that we are working very closely to our department store partners to look for accelerating and finding a better way to attract higher traffics also in the brick-and-mortar malls \u2013 stores, and we see some promising signs that some of the activity we are testing and learning about has a stronger effect on consumers than what we have done in the last couple of years.","So we will keep focusing on that. But to Tracey's point is the balance (34:30) is being where the consumer is. And I want to underline where the consumer is, is more and more online. And so our strength online including our strength online with our department store partners is a big part of this mitigating impact of the change of traffic in the country.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So I have an admittedly two-part question about your guidance. So first on top line, the back half of the year implies organic sales growth decelerating from, call it, 9% roughly now to below the 6% to 7% organic sales growth number. So can you talk through that organic top line deceleration a bit? And what's your expectation on comp store versus distribution growth? And then similarly in guidance, so your SG&A this quarter was down 380 basis points it looks like. Can you talk about the drivers of that specifically? How much was mix? So channel, product, geographic, so how much was mix? And how much is actual apples-to-apples cost reduction? And all that's really tied together, but trying to understand the run rate going forward for you guys, especially in the back half of the year. Thank you.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Sure, sure. So let me start with the cadence of the year in terms of organic growth. As you'll recall, Ali, we are anniversarying a fairly soft quarter last year. Our organic growth last year was 2% \u2013 a little over 2%, and so the 9% is on top of the 2% from last year from an organic standpoint and obviously not having Too Faced and BECCA in our numbers.","We saw sequential improvement throughout the year, particularly in the second half in terms of our organic growth. So we started to see the pickup largely in our Asian markets, so certainly in China, in Hong Kong, as well as in our travel retail markets and that would be global.","And so we are anniversarying that. And when you look at the second half of the year, both the combination of having Too Faced and BECCA embedded within the second half of the year still growing double-digits for both of those brands but also anniversarying that sequential improvement that we saw in our Asia and travel retail markets last year, that's where you see the organic growth starting to mitigate a bit in the second half of the year, still meaning that we have a terrific year that we expect to well outgrow the industry and gain share.","As it relates to the SG&A in the quarter, I did talk about one timing issue that was embedded in that number, and that was a change in our stock comp plans that actually just caused a timing shift in the recognition of some of our stock comp expense. This is not the tax accounting change, but this is actually embedded in our expenses. So we had a little over 100 basis points of impact of that in terms of favorability in the first quarter that we'll see reverse out in the second and third quarter.","The balance of the favorability was, to your point, a combination of mix as well as expense controls, and I would say it's about 50-50 in terms of the balance of between mix and expense controls. After that shift, that timing shift.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. I was curious if you could talk a little bit about GLAMGLOW. It's been about two years since the acquisition and you just called it out as an outstanding double-digit growth in the release. So I was just kind of curious about, I guess, one would be how the product line has expanded, two, any international expansion that's going to happen that maybe kind of slipped beneath the radar screen for me? And just over kind of outlook for that business, particularly now that the skin care category's accelerating. Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. No, GLAMGLOW is doing extremely well. It's continued to grow in the U.S. and is expanding internationally, is, in this moment, very successful in the U.K., for example, and is expanding in other markets. The target that we are hitting is the younger consumer. So millennials really like GLAMGLOW. The strength of the GLAMGLOW, in this moment, skin care proposition, are several, but two standouts in my opinion. One is that the glow overall promise of the entire brand, the benefit of glowing skin is one of the most desirable benefits in the market in this moment and, importantly, is the most desirable benefit for younger skins, which is behind a lot of the growth we are seeing in skin care around the world, which is driven by that target group.","The second strength is the fact that this brand is focused on masks, and masks is the fastest-growing product category in skin care in this moment in most of the global regions. And third is that this brand is, as you said in your question, expanding into other categories beyond masks. And every single very careful decision we have taken to expand the category is working and is giving great results. It is coherent from a consumer standpoint. And finally, as I already said, the internationalization of the opportunity. So again, a good acquisition, a good promising start of the acceleration of this brand, and a lot still do to in the next years to make this brand one of our mid-size and then one day very big brands in our portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, and congratulations from me. I'd like to know a little bit more about your online growth. You did talk about how strong it was in China. Can you talk about other markets; what you're seeing in terms of growth rates online? Are they accelerating or declining in any of your big markets, specifically the U.S.? And is your market share, as far as you know, bigger or smaller online?","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So our online business is still growing very strong. We were up 33% in quarter one. And our online by now represent about 11% of total sales now globally, but the penetration is much higher than 11% in some of the top markets where online is very strong. We are growing our online business this quarter in general in our estimate for the year. We have growth in our brand dot-com, in our retail dot-com, and in platforms. So all the three segments are growing very strongly.","This quarter, particularly brand dot-com remain very strong, but we saw a tremendous acceleration of platforms, namely Tmall. And as we said in the prepared remarks, the beginning of our investment in Lazada in Southeast Asia. And we saw amazing progress in retail dot-com across the world. So growth in department store retail dot-com in the U.S., growth in the specialty-multi retail dot-com and growth in many retail dot-coms around the world. Actually, the exception is China where in China is now retail dot-com driven but is Tmall driving the growth. So very strong and, as we said also in the prepared remark, clearly scalable. We have opened 100 sites just this quarter in a very efficient way, scalable and agile, meaning where we see it works, we can invest more. Where it doesn't work, we can smoothly change and revise and review what we're doing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much. I guess bigger picture here, your operating margins were 17% in 2014 and your guidance has you about getting back there by 2020 and recognizing a lot of that in the Americas where you've had a big currency headwind. It's now a tailwind. E-commerce makes it seems to be a tailwind. Why shouldn't you be able to get back towards peak margin in that segment, which would mean peak margin across the company and beyond that? And what are the margin drivers that are still going on with the Americas right now that sort of limit that now that you have these mix factors and maybe a little better performance in department stores happening? Thanks very much.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I think that in terms of the currency headwinds that we've had in the past, it's beyond the Americas, right? So, certainly, in the last couple of years, we've had negative currency that has offset quite a few of the initiatives that we've had in terms of cost-savings initiatives. When we guided the year, we said that we expect over the next few years to have on, average, 50 basis points of margin improvement. When you strip out all the noise from last year, we actually had 100 basis points of margin improvement. So \u2013 and we certainly have, in addition to continuing with some basic cost-saving programs, have the Leading Beauty Forward initiative, which is expected to deliver a fair amount of savings and allow us to leverage our organization in the next few years.","So I believe that we will certainly get back to the historical margin and then some, given all the initiatives that we have over the last few years \u2013 over the next few years. But right now, our guidance is, on average, 50 basis points a year. And, as you know, we'll update that at the beginning of every fiscal year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. First, just a quick detail question. Tracey, can you give us a sense of your A&P spending year-over-year as a percent of sales in Q1 and how that compares versus the balance of the year, just given the SG&A performance in Q1? And then, the real question, Fabrizio, is you had this tremendous sales momentum in China in travel retail the last two quarters. How sustainable do you think that momentum is as you look out longer term? Tracey mentioned those areas should slow a bit in the second half with more difficult comparisons. So just want to get some more detail on the key drivers behind the recent strength and how much they extend longer term from your perspective? Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So I'll start with your question on A&P. In the first quarter, we did see quite a healthy increase in A&P spend. It did not grow as fast as sales that we saw a slight amount of leverage in our A&P spend, but we actually expected to deleverage for the year. Again, we are making investments in several areas that generate momentum for the organization. And so we ultimately expect that it will \u2013 the A&P spend will grow faster than what we're projecting our sales growth to grow for the full year, which is a nice increase for us in terms of investment in markets that are growing quite fast.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. On the other two questions, so the short answer, and then I'll give you more detail, is that we believe that a double-digit growth is sustainable. Now, the 50%, 40% are \u2013 may happen again by quarter depending on volatility, but I could not define (47:17) them as sustainable model, obviously. The double-digit growth in China and double-digit growth in retail over the long run should be sustainable trends.","Let me go one by one. In China, we are seeing, in this moment, an amazing results, but also in like-door we have 33%. And that's super strong, we are growing market share. And interesting, this quarter we saw these amazing results without increasing the number of cities, but just increasing the number of doors in the cities where we need to be more penetrated, where we need to put more brands. So it's about more establishing our strengths rather than further expanding the number of cities this quarter, which, again, shows the power of online in city \u2013 in China, where the cities where we're not expanding brick-and-mortar yet, because it's not yet efficient, we still can reach the city with online. So the model is pretty interesting, pretty sustainable, and has power.","The second thing I would like to say on China, the market continued to grow. So we are growing above the market and building market share, but the market was about 30% growth, so very strong. It's about new consumer. It's about new access, as I said in my prepared remarks.","The other important thing in China is we are growing in every single channel in China: department stores, Sephora, freestanding stores, online. They're all growing double-digits. So there is a really well spread. And then in every brand in our portfolio, we are growing. We are growing in makeup. We are growing in skin care. We are growing in fragrance. So it's broad growth, and so it's sustainable, in our opinion, on a more or less double-digit trend.","On travel retail, travel retail has been very strong. We have seen this quarter an acceleration of travel retail in the retail \u2013 at retail levels, so a retail acceleration. And this is driven by trends which are sustainable, some trends are the market, meaning the traffic of travelers is very solid.","But a lot of what's happened is driven by us. One is about conversion, meaning today we estimate that 15%, depending on airport region, of people entering in airport shop anything. So it's just driving the conversion from travelers to shoppers is an enormous opportunity to continuous traffic growth, and this isn't the end of the brands because this has a lot to do with investments we do in the current (49:45) or in the market of all regions.","So the fact that we are investing more in China, we are investing more in Brazil, we are investing more in Russia, et cetera, this is the reason why our countries in travel retail is working better and better, because our conversion in travel retail thanks to the marketing work that our teams do in every one of these countries is working better and better thanks to the assortment we choose in these places is getting better and better.","So it's not only about traffic, it's about what we do and what we invest in every single country. And that's why we believe that this is sustainable of more or less a double-digit trend in the long term.","The other reason why it's sustainable is very broad. As I explained, it's not only Asia. We grew in travel retail in EMEA, in Latin America, in the U.S., in Asia. Obviously Asia has been particularly strong, but it's broad-based the growth that we see in this moment. And we have developed a strategy where we really can follow the consumer across traveling corridors, and we can make sure also our innovation speaks to them in a coherent way between current country or regions (50:56) where they travel. And so, in summary, strong and sustainable, but not at the levels we have seen this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies.","Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Our question relates to skin care margins. We saw a very, very strong increase year-over-year and just generally I think the strongest skin care margins we have in our models going back a couple of decades. I'm just curious if you can talk about sustainability within the margin profile of skin care. And then, Fabrizio, to your comments on the millennials, are you seeing anything trend-wise that would give you confidence in that margin structure in that category? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Okay. Skin care \u2013 and now, Tracey, please add any perspectives. Skin care has strong margins structurally in our business. However, when there is a beat of skin care sales where the extra skin care sales versus our original forecast comes without a lot of expenses, this margin gets boosted in the short term. So I will not consider the quarter one margins as sustainable, but definitely we can count on stronger than average skin care margins in the future for the growth of skin care.","And in terms of millennials, the millennials are obviously getting more and more in skin care in what I define in summary, instant benefits. Before I was speaking about GLAMGLOW and the glow benefit, there are other benefits which are instant, which is about preparing the skin for makeup, is about benefits for the day.","So not only traditional anti-aging but instant benefit for the skin are very popular with millennials around the world, and this will continue also because we are driving it and, frankly, the industry is driving that. So I believe this can be an interesting medium-term trend. Tracey?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","No. That's good.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about how to think about your thoughts on the 4% to 5% category growth. It seems like some conservatism there. Just wanted to explore that a bit more and maybe, put differently, why is company share accelerating if the 4% to 5% category growth is correct? And if you couple your performance with peers like LVMH and L'Oreal, that trio collectively is growing something like three-times what you believe the category is actually growing at. So is it share gains amongst the big three? Is it sustainable as a result of that or what is just driving it? Or, as I said, part of it could be that you're just being a bit conservative with the category growth. So maybe any help there would be appreciated.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. No, frankly, this is the number that we see, we estimate for the year. Now, could be more 5% than 4%, absolutely, this first quarter was very solid. But you need to look at the \u2013 this is a global estimate. Now the retail in the U.S. is not super strong. The retail in Continental Europe is not super strong. U.K. is softening in term of market. The Latin America market is not super strong. So what you see today is actually an acceleration in Asia, absolutely. But you don't see in terms of total market every single region accelerated.","So in total, with plus and minus, we still believe a 4% to 5%, probably more in the 5% area is what we see today. Which bring me to the second point that is, yes, we \u2013 I cannot speak for our competitors but from the number I see, I would agree with you, the big three are strong and are delivering market share growth overall, and we definitely are. We are growing market share in a significant way. And I think this is explainable in many ways but one way maybe I want to add as far Est\u00e9e Lauder Company are concerned.","The big amount of the small brands and new launches, innovation that's happening in the market has created a much more competitive trial environment, meaning consumer buying new products, try new products, being able to access many more new products. But repurchase is continued to be driven by high-quality products at brand they trust. So while the trial game is more competitive, the repurchase game is still in the hands of the hero franchises, the big brands, and these brands continue to deliver very strong repurchase.","Remember, a lot of the profitability is in repurchase because trial, most of the time, is an investment. And so what you see is the power of product quality, the power of prestige experiences into play, and that in this very competitive market out there, still strong brands, great quality products, and fundamental superior experiences remain the reason for success.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Congrats on a great quarter, and thanks for taking my questions. I was curious to get additional thoughts on the U.S. beauty backdrop. Some of the specialty-multi players have called out softening trends in the cosmetics category within the U.S. market. So I was just curious, from your perspective, the dynamics currently playing out in the market, is it a shift more to skin care, less newness, or other factors at play? Thank you.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So I think that there has been a bit of softening in the U.S. market, again, mostly in, in brick-and-mortar. As we spoke about, certainly, we've seen a lot of strength in online. So we are certainly continuing to see that. The other thing that's happening in the U.S. \u2013 and Fabrizio was talking about online and how we play in various areas of online, but there are beauty brands that are direct-to-consumer that are online-only that bypass any retailer. And these are some of the indie brands as well. And we see more of this phenomena in the U.S. market than in some of our global markets as well. So I think that, too, is impacting some of the results of some of the retailers. They're not captured in the retailers' dot-com business because they're actually \u2013 it's a brand to direct sale, things that come to mind like Kylie Cosmetics for instance.","Operator","We have time for one more question. That question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to circle back on M\u00b7A\u00b7C, I just have a couple of questions. It's positive that M\u00b7A\u00b7C in total grew in the quarter, but I guess I was hoping you could drill down further on M\u00b7A\u00b7C's performance in North America specifically. Could you talk about your standalone M\u00b7A\u00b7C stores and how they're performing relative to your own online sales for M\u00b7A\u00b7C? And then when do you expect M\u00b7A\u00b7C's performance, particularly in your own M\u00b7A\u00b7C stores, to start to improve in North America? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So M\u00b7A\u00b7C North America, specifically, as we said, is continuing to decline in the brick-and-mortar part of the business, meaning the department stores and our freestanding stores, and had a tremendous acceleration online and is performing very well in ULTA \u2013 in the store of ULTA as we had explained. So that's the mix. So in total, there is a sequential improvement of the trend of the brand.","Also, the innovation of M\u00b7A\u00b7C is planned to improve gradually across the fiscal year to be more in tune for the key trends in the United States of what has been in the past.","So our expectation is that the brands, in total, will stabilize over time thanks to the distribution balance, the drive of online, the improved innovation program, and having then in the base the periods that the brand had in the last year. So this gradually will put the brand in a condition to stabilize and then in the longer term grow again.","As I said, in many other markets of the world, the brand is flying, and in China even doubling. So, in total, we continue to expect the brand to have the power to grow. But in North America, this will take a little bit of time to stabilize.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.","During the Q&A section, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for the call.","And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio now.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Dennis, and good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, sales grew in line with our forecast and earnings per share growth exceeded our expectations, due to more prudent expense management, as we navigated through some of the macro uncertainty in the quarter. Across our business, many brands, countries and channels achieved double-digit sales gains. Our strongest performance were our small and midsize brands, particularly those in the luxury tier, many European markets and the online, specialty multi and travel retail channels. Yet, as we had anticipated, our strong gains were partially offset by challenging market and economic condition in certain countries.","In constant currency, our sales rose 2% and adjusted EPS increased 5%. We manage our business with a full year perspective. So even though the first quarter top-line growth is starting off at a slower than usual pace, we are confident in our ability to achieve the solid sales and earnings growth we forecasted for fiscal year 2017.","Our first quarter growth was slower primarily due to ongoing challenge in U.S. mid-tier department store caused by lower traffic, the market slowdown in the Middle East and difficult comparison in France and Germany and a continued negative trend in Hong Kong. All these challenges were anticipated, and plans are in place to gradually accelerate our sales growth quarter by quarter and position us to deliver our full fiscal year plan.","Despite headwinds, there are expected \u2013 we expect to continue in some areas \u2013 but, sorry \u2013 despite headwinds are expected to continue in some areas, we have plans to further leverage our stronger brands, channels and countries. We have robust holiday programs and a strong innovation pipeline, exciting opportunities to reach new target consumers and geographies, especially with our fast growing brands and compelling programs to better engage shoppers.","By being well diversified and having multiple engines of growth, we are able to activate the drivers that we believe will fuel stronger sales. These are expected to include a number of international markets, the makeup and fragrance categories and target distribution opportunities. We are reaffirming our previously stated goal of constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% for fiscal year 2017. This will come from a combination of factors.","Our organic growth is expected to accelerate, mainly in makeup and fragrance, fueled by strong innovation in the second half and supported by greater social media initiatives for improved consumer engagement. We should have easier comparisons in several markets since external events that impacted our results last year will be in our base. Also contributing to growth will be new points of distribution globally for our fast-growing high productivity brands with a higher concentration coming in the second half as well as planned price increases. Additionally, the planned acquisition of BECCA will provide incremental sales. As a result, we are also reaffirming our goal of adjusted constant currency EPS growth of 8% to 10% for the full year.","In the past several months, we have continued to make excellent progress on our strategic objectives. We believe that the industry's strong growth in global makeup sales will continue, so we are focusing on building and strengthening our makeup portfolio. In the quarter, we achieved solid makeup growth in several brands. However, the total category was affected by declines in M\u2022A\u2022C in the United States, owing to fewer foreign tourists, particularly in New York City and Florida has lowered traffic in department stores. M\u2022A\u2022C is a powerful and authentic brand that speaks to all ages, races and sexes. And we expect its U.S. business to deliver stronger results through the rest of the year.","As of October, M\u2022A\u2022C U.S. sales started to improve, thanks to the launch of its successful Selena makeup collection and the new range of lipstick called Liptensity. The Selena collection was inspired by the late singer and her huge fan base and accounted for the highest online traffic in one day on the brand's site. M\u2022A\u2022C will bring back the Selena collection in January to meet continued demand. It has other exciting collaboration and plans including The Nutcracker themed holiday collection and compelling social media programs that will leverage M\u2022A\u2022C rapidly expansion \u2013 expanding fan base, which now includes 16 million global Facebook fans and 12 million followers on Instagram. The brand also has an active presence on YouTube, Twitter and other popular digital platforms by now.","M\u2022A\u2022C's international business grew in line with the global prestige makeup, fueled by double-digit growth in most European and Asian markets. Internationally, we expect M\u2022A\u2022C to grow double digit in the fiscal year and gain share, driven by continued organic growth, stronger innovation program, expansion of social media and new opportunities to reach target consumer that don't yet have access to the brand.","Today, M\u2022A\u2022C is sold in a relatively small and select number of doors in each market, and there is an opportunity for us to further build its presence where it is underrepresented, primarily in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in the EMEA region and in China. M\u2022A\u2022C doors are among the most productive of the entire industry.","Smashbox, our pure-play makeup brand generated double digit global growth for the quarter, and we expect to deliver strong double-digit increases for the fiscal year. The brand is focused on winning in the specialty multi and direct-to-consumer channels and recently redesigned its U.S. e-commerce site for greater consumer engagement.","Our Tom Ford brand had an outstanding quarter with its makeup business nearly doubling, led by its popular new lipsticks. Makeup is expected to continue to be a major growth driver, and the brand should benefit from upcoming color collection inspired by the designer's runway fashion. Fragrance represents the majority of this luxury brand business and continues to generate strong momentum.","La Mer, our luxury skincare brand, just launched its innovative skin color collection, which includes 15 shades of foundation, a growing sub-category, blast powder (8:26) and concealer. These products incorporate the brand's signature, Miracle Broth, and are expected to capitalize on growing demand for product that bridge skin care with makeup. The collection has increased traffic to the La Mer counters and websites, and the brand anticipates it will attract new consumers and provide incremental sales to its core products of moisturizers, eye creams and serums.","We are also building on our global leadership in prestige makeup. Two weeks ago, we agreed to acquire BECCA, a prestige makeup brand with a unique positioning that is complementary to our other makeup brands. BECCA's strengths is in foundations and complexion products, which are a high loyalty areas. It has grown rapidly by offering a broad and balanced range of shades that appeal to multicultural consumers, along with a strong presence in fast growing North America specialty multi-retailers. It also is active on social media and attracts a diverse and loyal fan base. We also see great opportunity to strategically expand the brand internationally as well as in travel retail and online, which are key growth areas for the company.","Strong gains in fragrance this quarter were again led by our luxury brands which are experiencing rapid global growth. Our newest fragrance brands are experienced and crafted to our authentic point of view, similar to our makeup artist's brands and are resonating strongly with the new consumers. For example, we have continued to build out our seasonal Le Labo brand to reach more of its target consumers by opening select high-growth department store doors and freestanding stores globally.","At the same time, the brand has had strong like-door growth, leading to exceptional sales increases. Jo Malone superior growth was reinforced by its travel retail business, which benefits from increasing awareness of the brand in key local markets. Jo Malone is capitalizing on growth opportunities by opening new store formats in the travel retail channel. After many quarters of strong growth, Jo Malone rose three places in the rankings to become the third largest women prestige fragrance brand in the United States in the first quarter. This is especially noteworthy, given the brand's limited distribution in only 250 doors in the entire United States. Jo Malone is the second largest prestige fragrance brand in its home market, the UK and growing double digits. Yet, it has just one-tenth the number of points of sales compared to the market leader. We are anticipating on our high-end fragrances will perform well in the holiday season, with enticing gifts offering and new classic scents. And we expect that momentum to carry into the second half of the fiscal year.","In skin care, natural products are growing in popularity and we are well positioned with our Aveda and Origins brands. Aveda's new Tulasara skin care line which creates glowing skin inspired by an ancient healing art of India, led to the brand robust skin care sales growth worldwide, exceeding its expectations. Aveda plans to broaden the franchise in the next few months with masks for the face and eyes centered on the theme of weddings. Origins strengthen its leading position in facial masks and its skin care sales climbed double digits in every region. This includes a new line of face and body masks, infused with tea that provides immediate benefit and feature desired by today consumers.","Many of our brands are enhancing their distribution in the fastest growing channels to reach target consumers where they're shopping today. Our brands continue to successfully penetrate the specialty multi-channel globally. In the U.S., Clinique continued its rollout in ULTA. And in September, Est\u00e9e Lauder introduced a greater selection of top-selling skin care and makeup products in 30 ULTA doors and on ulta.com Clinique, Origins and Bumble and bumble added location in several stores inside JCPenney. Our brands are also further penetrating the channels in foreign markets. For example, in Germany, GLAMGLOW successfully partnered with Douglas to target core consumers throughout all of its locations.","Likewise, when Smashbox entered Finland this quarter, it reached its target consumer by launching in the specialty retailer KICKS. Our travel retail business was vibrant in the quarter, as our net sales growth far outpaced passionate traffic growth, despite some difficult markets including Hong Kong, Japan and Latin America. Our smaller and midsized brands as well as M\u2022A\u2022C are in high demand in the channel. They all increased double digits at retail with very solid like-door growth as we continued to accelerate their rollout.","Geographically, Asia-Pacific was the best performer in travel retail and the makeup, fragrance and hair care categories grew sharply. We expect to continue our strong sales increases in travel retail, fueled in part by passenger traffic growth, which is projected to rise during the next three quarters.","Our online sales this quarter were once again very strong. Mobile continues to be the fastest growing area in E&M commerce and trend also reflected in our business. In the quarter, m-commerce represented 41% of our online global sales, up from 37% last year. And sales from mobile devices grew 23%. In the recent period, we opened approximately 100 new sites, mostly with international retailers.","Looking at our heritage brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique have remained stable. Importantly, in the quarter both brands grew in makeup globally. They have generated makeup growth for several quarters, and we expect each of them to accelerate their makeup business in the second half of the year.","Est\u00e9e Lauder's international makeup sales were vibrant with a particularly strong performance in the UK following the Brexit vote. When a drop in the pound increased in a wave of tourists, the brand sold especially well in department stores favored by foreign visitors, such as Harrods where Est\u00e9e Lauder retail sales grows 20%. Est\u00e9e Lauder Double Wear Foundation was a strong seller worldwide, fueled by its innovative Cushion Stick applicator.","In skin care, Est\u00e9e Lauder had global success with Advanced Night Repair, another powerful growth engine for the brand. Est\u00e9e Lauder continued to see strategic opportunity to accelerate its business this year by fueling these two core pillars with new products and compelling digital assets, as it targets a wider consumer base and increased penetration in higher growth channels.","Clinique business in North America increased in makeup and skin care, driven by higher sales in specialty multi retailers, online and in select department stores. Clinique also had solid growth in makeup internationally. With strong results for its new foundation called Superbalanced Silk Makeup. It has started a redesign of some counters and stores in the United States and Hong Kong. And as a result, sales climbed in those locations. Clinique expects to broaden its reach in high-growth channels, particularly in North America, and at the same time work with department store to increase traffic at counters and accelerate its growth.","Improving productivity is a focus for our entire organization. Through Leading Beauty Forward, our multiyear initiative, we aim to increase our efficiency and reduce costs to achieve both leverage and for re-investment in growth drivers. Additionally, we will improve our speed to market and agility. We are making good progress. Much of the organizational design work and several projects are underway.","In closing, we continue to deploy the strategies to drive our sustainable and profitable long-term growth. Our diversified business is fueled by multiple engines of growth and our financial agility enables us to quickly move resources to take advantage of changing consumer demand and new opportunities. This year, we will further accelerate our stronger growth engines, reinvigorate slower areas and create more resources to invest in opportunities and capabilities as we adapt to the changing dynamics in prestige beauty.","As we discussed in our August call, our sales profile this year is weighted to the second half and is rolling out as we had anticipated. We expect that fiscal year 2017 will be another successful year that will advance our financial performance and strengthen our leadership.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2017 first quarter results, and then I will cover our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges, primarily related to our Leading Beauty Forward program. Net sales for the first quarter were $2.87 billion, up 2% in constant currency compared to the prior year period.","Incremental sales from By Kilian contributed approximately 20 basis points of this growth. From a geographic perspective, Europe, the Middle East and Africa saw the fastest growth again this quarter. Net sales rose 7% in constant currency, with double-digit growth from the travel retail channel, developed markets like Italy and Spain, as well as most of the region's emerging markets. Sales in Germany and the UK were also solid.","Last quarter, we called out two issues that we predicted would put some pressure on our first quarter sales in EMEA. As we anticipated, sales in France declined due to a significant drop in tourism against a tough comparison with an exceptionally strong first quarter of last year. Net sales in the Middle East fell sharply as distributors in the area significantly rebalanced inventory levels to adjust to weaker retail traffic due primarily to the impact of lower oil prices on the overall macro environment.","We do see some traveling luxury consumers from the Middle East taking advantage of the weaker pound and buying more in the UK. Excluding the Middle East, the EMEA region grew 10%.","Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was led by Korea, which grew low double digits followed by strong growth in Australia, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan. China grew in line with the overall region. Sales in Hong Kong continued to decline. Excluding Hong Kong, the region grew 7%.","Net sales in the Americas declined 2% in constant currency. Latin America grew 15%, led by strong growth in Mexico while Brazil remains challenged. Canada rose low single digits and the U.S. declined mid-single digits. Our sales through both online and specialty multi channels again rose double digits. However, we saw continued declines in the brick and mortar business of mid-tier department stores as well as tourist-driven freestanding stores.","Additionally, the U.S. had a tough comparison to the prior year, which included some major new product launches in department stores. Net sales by product category were led by the 10% constant currency growth in fragrance for the quarter, reflecting the success of our strategy to focus on the higher margin, top-tier segment of the category. Jo Malone was once again the largest contributor to our overall fragrance growth. The launch of Basil & Neroli, strong comp door growth and expanded consumer reach drove a strong double-digit increase in sales. By Kilian contributed incremental sales, adding about a point to the fragrance category growth, and Le Labo also grew rapidly.","Makeup sales rose 1% in constant currency. Tom Ford delivered exceptional growth, nearly doubling its makeup business this quarter. Smashbox rose double digits, and Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique innovation in makeup also drove the category as previously mentioned. And as Fabrizio discussed earlier; M\u2022A\u2022C continued its strong double-digit trends in most international markets. However, the brand's U.S. business continues to experience lower foot traffic and tourism in its core channels of distribution, constraining overall makeup growth in the quarter.","Hair care sales increased 1% in constant currency, primarily due to growth from Bumble and bumble.","Skin care sales grew less than 1% in constant currency. Double-digit growth, supported by strong innovation from La Mer, Origins and Aveda was mostly offset by lower sales from Est\u00e9e Lauder, which had a major launch in the prior year period, and from Clinique, reflecting continued softness in Asia and in EMEA.","Our gross margin declined 30 basis points from the prior year, due primarily to unfavorable currency and a slightly unfavorable product mix. Operating expenses as a percent of sales increased 10 basis points. Higher store operating costs and selling expenses associated with our retail store growth, along with the accounting for stock compensation expenses, were mostly offset by favorable currency transactions and a gain on the sale of a fixed asset as well as more prudent expense management. As a result, operating income fell 1% and operating margin decreased 30 basis points.","Net earnings increased 2% to $314 million, reflecting a lower effective tax rate. Diluted EPS rose 3% to $0.84 or 5% in constant currency.","Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.02 of unfavorable currency translation. EPS was higher than anticipated due primarily to more prudent expense management. As you are aware, we have seasonally higher working capital requirements in our fiscal first quarter as we build inventory to support the holiday selling period. During the quarter, we used $150 million in net cash flows from operating activities and we invested $85 million in capital projects. We used $222 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares of our stock and paid $111 million in dividends. We also announced this morning that our board approved a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.34 per share.","Now, let's turn to our outlook for next quarter and for the full year. As Fabrizio mentioned, we continue to expect sales to grow 6% to 7% in constant currency for the fiscal 2017 year. This range includes the expected contribution from BECCA as we plan to close the transaction this quarter. On a preliminary basis, we estimated that BECCA could add approximately 30 basis points to sales growth and dilute EPS by $0.02 in fiscal 2007 (sic) [2017] (24:58), which won't affect the range of our forecast. Currency translation is expected to depress sales by less than 1%, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.10 for the euro, 1.22 for the pound and 105 for the yen for the fiscal year.","Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.38 and $3.44 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.08 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 10%.","For the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 5% to 6% in constant currency, reflecting new product launches and holiday promotions as well as easier comparisons in the U.S. and France. The Middle East and Hong Kong are expected to continue to weigh on sales growth until the second half.","Negative currency translation is estimated at approximately two percentage points. Our most recent acquisitions could add approximately 50 basis points to sales growth for the quarter. EPS is forecast between $1.10 and $1.15 before restructuring charges. This includes about $0.05 dilution from currency. The acceleration in EPS growth implied in the second half of the year is directly related to the sales growth trends.","We are pleased with the performance we made on our strategic initiatives in the first quarter, and we remain focused on delivering another successful year, despite the volatile political, economic and currency environment.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. The first question is more short-term. In your release, you changed the expected full year top line outperformance versus the category to more than 1% from 2% previously, along with the 4% to 5% beauty category growth. So given that commentary in Q1 came in at the low end of the range, Q2's still expected to be below the full-year FX-neutral sales growth rate. Should we expect the sales growth to be more at the low end of your 6% to 7% range now? Is that reasonable?","And then the second question more longer term is last quarter, you announced you were expanding more of your business into ULTA and Sephora. As we look out over the next few years, I was hoping you could discuss conceptually how much further distribution expansion you'd expect to see in non-traditional retailers versus your historical footprint and if bringing more brands into those retailers over time is part of your plans. Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So let me take the first half of that question in terms of the range. It's still pretty early in the year, which is the reason why we give a range for the full year. So at this point, we're not prepared to say that we're going to be at the low end of the range. And certainly, the second quarter is a big quarter for us. It's holiday. And obviously, the second half of the year is big for us for all the reasons that we spoke about in our prepared remarks. So at this time, it's still very much within the range.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. And the answer to the fact that we will continue increasing our penetration in win in China, the answer is yes. That's part of our program. There are several winning channels around the world in this moment in the area of luxury and prestige. One is definitely specialty multi, and we will continue increase not only distribution but success and continue to increase brands which are tailored to this channel in the future around the world. We will also continue to increase our penetration of the online channels. And we will continue to increase also our penetration of travel retail and distribution in these areas, among others.","Operator","Your next question is from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. Just following up on Dara's question, if you're not taking the high end off the table, then what are you seeing to make you confident that the second half can accelerate to essentially a double-digit pace in the second half in order to get to the high end of your outlook? But really what I wanted to ask more about was M\u2022A\u2022C because \u2013 what are you doing to remedy some of the things that are going on in the U.S.? I guess part of this is an appeal to tourists and less travel and the impact of that. But how much of this is just how much more competitive the makeup category has become, particularly with the younger consumers that M\u2022A\u2022C has captured for so long?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","All right. So, Olivia, thanks for your questions. Let me start off with the expectations again for the second half. We talked a bit about the innovation that we're expecting in the second half. We talked about pricing, and we also talked about an acceleration of consumer coverage for many of our smaller brands. As you're aware, we most recently acquired a number of smaller brands that are in expansion mode, brands like Jo Malone and Tom Ford and others have quite a bit of expansion opportunity as well ahead of them. And so they are certainly much of that distribution growth is planned for the second half of the year.","If you were to think about the second half in terms of the building blocks that we typically talk to you about for the full year, 2% is roughly \u2013 a little over 2% is roughly the pricing expectation that we expect to get in the second half of the year. New distribution would be about 3% to 4%, so a bit of a step-up versus the first half of the year. And then our existing and new business including our newer acquisitions are another 3% to 4%. So that's how we get to the numbers for the full year that we guided to in terms of 6% to 7%.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. And as far as M\u2022A\u2022C is concerned, is first of all, I said in my prepared remarks, M\u2022A\u2022C is still growing double digit in many of the global markets where there is equally new \u2013 equally tough in new competition than there is in the U.S. And M\u2022A\u2022C internationally has been growing in line with the very fast growing market, continuing to well compete with mass and all the mass brands, despite some of them are now using prestige codes, they continue to grow on average less than the prestige brands. So M\u2022A\u2022C continued to be one of our most successful brands and a fast-growing brands and we will count on this for the future.","In the U.S., there is the specific two issues in the short term that we have already commented on, which is obviously M\u2022A\u2022C is very concentrated and focused on high internal distribution presence in high touristic areas and in mid-tier department stores. And in the traffic in both of these areas has been lower, significantly lower than in the past. And so M\u2022A\u2022C will need to react to that.","The second is the programs. And you're right, there is new competition. There are some very successful brands. We have acquired one of them, BECCA, and there are many other successful brands, particularly in specialty multi, which are a new competition among the millennial generation. And M\u2022A\u2022C is stepping up their activity, their innovation, their collection, their social media and their penetration of this new target group with new activity. That's why in our prepared remark we brought up the example of the Selena and what's happening there when M\u2022A\u2022C speaks to this target group more directly. And we plan to do those much more also in the second semester of the fiscal year. So net, we expect M\u2022A\u2022C to continue to be one of our strong growth brands in the long-term.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. I actually want to take a step back and think about your long-term algorithm because within that algorithm, I know you've got objectives to grow the top line while also expanding operating margins and improving free cash flow. But it seems philosophically as though maintaining the top line at 6% plus really dominates the other two. And arguably, that's not wrong, assuming the 6% plus growth is there. But I guess as we hear questions today related to the top line, what would it take for you to see whether in your business or in your end markets where you'd say, you know what, we're going to throttle back just a bit on top line investment and seek to generate similar profits, maybe improve free cash flow by going more after margin.","I guess is \u2013 my concern is that you've been growing 6%, 7%, 8% in a market growing 4% to 5% for a while. And clearly, that can't go on forever, at least not without significantly higher costs. And I think the market's concern is that's what we're starting to see this quarter. And to that point, if you do happen to trend short of 6% in fiscal 2017, I think the market's fear is that you'll continue to spend as if you were still growing at that level, leading ultimately to deleverage and EPS reductions. So can you just help frame for us how you're monitoring top line trends and give us confidence that if the revenue does start to fall short, that the flexibility you've been speaking of the past few quarters can be applied to cost management to better protect bottom line and in the fact \u2013 even in the face of top line disappointment? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yes. I would like also Tracey to add on this. But first of all, our \u2013 in a market which is growing 4% to 5%, as I said, our long-term opportunity of growth remain between 6% and 8%. And again it's between 6% and 8%. It could be 8% in some years. Of course, there could be 6% in others, depending upon the external situation and in \u2013 of our internal innovation program and priorities and spending, as you mentioned. So I still believe the range for the long-term is the right range. And we are moving into that and continue to use this range as an opportunity.","The key areas' opportunities \u2013 we continue to have pricing power. So as we say, in our \u2013 for example, in our 6% to 7% this year, which is a representation of our long-term view, is two points are coming from pricing. And then 2.5% are coming from distribution and 2.5% from organic growth. So our portfolio of brands, as Tracey explained before, still offer a lot of opportunity of more distribution of at least half of our brands, which are high growth, high productivity and not at all available to the global consumers in many areas.","And this will be true for many years to come. As an example, even our recent acquisition, BECCA, has enormous opportunities for going also international, online, in travel retail and all these areas which will build value and today are not leveraged by a brand which is doing very well among its target group. And we have plenty example of this in our portfolio. The 2.5% organic growth in a market, which is growing 4% to 5% in prestige that continues to grow much faster than mass is frankly achievable if we get our plans together. So we still believe that the 6% to 8% range is achievable but also is possible that in some years will be 6% and not 8%, as we have demonstrated in the past.","In terms of your second question, which is our flexibility is actually the key point. Our financial flexibility is there, and we are regularly adjusting resources due not only to the overall growth level but also to the different priorities that we have around the world and to reallocating resources to the winning areas. That, I believe, is the most important element of flexibility we have demonstrated to have. Why this it important? Because in this moment, the markets around the world is very volatile and there is a lot of change going on. So the ability to adapt and to reallocate resources in an agile way is one of the biggest strengths that I think we can exercise to continue to succeed. And we are ready to do it. We are prepared to do this, and our Leading Beauty Forward program, among other benefits, is also the benefit of making us stronger in our ability to do exactly that.","So to close on your question, yes, we are committed to adjust and adapt cost to the future sales growth opportunity that we will have. Tracey?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Stephen, so the only thing I will add on to what Fabrizio has already said, some of the margin gains that we are achieving through our SMI program and other cost initiatives are in fact being offset by acquisition accounting and currency. So we are seeing almost an equal cost set in terms of some of the benefit that we're achieving from an organic growth standpoint with some of those factors.","As I had mentioned, I think, on our year-end call last year, that purchase accounting will bleed off over the next year or so, and you'll actually start to see some more of the margin flow through. One of the things that we also look at here obviously is EBITDA, given the fact that we have done a number of acquisitions in the last few years. And certainly you see more progression in terms of our EBITDA margin.","Operator","Your next question is from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Again, my question is around margins, and just \u2013 in your 2% or 2% to 2.5% organic long-term growth, are you factoring in the likelihood of a -- some years where two or three of your biggest brands are down in your biggest market, which is what we're seeing right now, and I think it would be helpful to understand why M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S. should get back to growth, separate from innovation. But just given where travelers are going, you're benefiting in the UK. Is it realistic that M\u2022A\u2022C gets back to growth, based on everything you are seeing right now?","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yes, it is realistic that M\u2022A\u2022C gets back to growth. But also the point that I keep making is diversification. M\u2022A\u2022C is a big global brand. The U.S. is less than 30%, three zero, of M\u2022A\u2022C volume. The rest of M\u2022A\u2022C growth around the world can be double digit, has been high single digit in the quarter we just closed and is projected to be double digit. So a brand that has double-digit power really demonstrated an enormous amount of opportunity, including extra distribution opportunity internationally, is a brand that can definitely grow and go back to growth very fast.","Now, in the U.S. specifically, the growth \u2013 to go back to growth, there will be certain actions that are required, including new successful innovation and some other activity in social media that I can understand you say they need to be proven successful before believing them. But we know what they are, and so we trust in them. But even in terms of mix, the power of the brands will allow a double-digit growth in the medium, long-term.","And then on the \u2013 what was the first part?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","It was really more \u2013 the big brands and then Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, and then stabilizing, which is what we spoke about happening. So that actually is progress.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","That's right. Sorry, I didn't get the Lauder\/Clinique part of the question. So then on Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, as we said, we have stabilized the brands. These brands have been declining in the past. We have stabilized them, and we have started growing consistently the makeup part. As we said, we have said that our program was to start growing from makeup, and now the quarter we just closed is one more quarter where this seems to be now sticking and we keep doing this well.","By the way, makeup is one of our priorities, and a lot of the growth in the second semester of this fiscal year as we anticipated will come from makeup acceleration. And Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique will be part of contributing to this makeup acceleration in the second part of the fiscal year.","Next, we need to address the skin care trend on these two brands. This has been slower than what we wanted, but in the situation with Hong Kong not really been declining and the traffic softness in U.S. department store, which are two of the biggest skin care contributors to these brands, has been tough. But we have now plans to also add skin care acceleration to the already achieved makeup acceleration.","In our \u2013 the last thing I want to say, in our plan we play the portfolio brands. And I said other times that we have one-third of our portfolio which is growing always double digit. One-third of our portfolio that could be just growing single \u2013 low single digit and one-third of our portfolio that is growing high single digit. And in this way, we delivered the total. And so, yes, we are not seeing the big brands have the role to drive the 6% to 8% on the high side. The big brands have the role to drive growth. But there are the other brands in the portfolio we are driving double digit and the portfolio mix is what driving our long-term algorithm.","Think of it like one-third pricing, one-third distribution, one-third organic growth and one-third small brand, high growth brands, one-third the medium size brands and then the big brands. And that's why this flexibility of managing through the different levers of growth and the different brands in the portfolio in the different countries make us a more \u2013 a less volatile, more reliable, more sustainable company than any other company. Today, companies that just count on one or two brands, given the volatility of the world and only one or two markets I believe are less reliable in the long-term than the model that we build.","Operator","Your next question is from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning, Bill.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Can you guys just bridge the gap for us between sort of the 7% to 8% makeup category growth and the 1% you reported? Because if I did the math \u2013 and I think Fabrizio just said that only 30% of M\u2022A\u2022C sales are in the U.S. So if you assume that international business grew 7%, in line with the makeup category, does that mean the U.S. was down 20%? So I was just sort of trying to figure out, like, what is the source of the volume or share losses? And how do you fix it?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah, so I'll start. I think we talked about three markets that were softer than last year, some due to macro factors. The U.S. was obviously one of those. France, which had an exceptionally strong first quarter last year, is softer for obvious reasons this year and the Middle East. I mean those are \u2013 and those are big markets for M\u2022A\u2022C and \u2013 for makeup in general and certainly for M\u2022A\u2022C. And we expect throughout the balance of the year, A, we won't be anniversarying \u2013 we'll be anniversarying some of the events. But in addition to that, we do expect a pickup in the \u2013 all of those markets throughout the course of the year.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah, I want to add that Hong Kong is also a decent makeup market. Brazil is a very big makeup market in general for us and has been declining. And so it's been a \u2013 but there are other markets like China where \u2013 give you an example, M\u2022A\u2022C has been growing 20% more. And there are other markets in the world where the \u2013 our makeup portfolio is growing 30%, 40%. So it's not as simple as just one market explain everything. But the average of our international market has been doing very well. But Middle East, Brazil, low base in France, I also said Germany in my prepared remarks and Hong Kong are other examples of market that are driving down, but down significantly the growth. Middle East had a very difficult moment. And so double-digit declines numbers that are impacting in quarter one, offset by other phenomenon.","So it's not only the U.S. But in the U.S. was specifically M\u2022A\u2022C. The rest of our portfolio in the U.S. has been performing well, as we anticipated also in the prepared remark, Lauder and Clinique makeup in the U.S. has been growing on both brands, for example. So that's the decision (47:53). How we fix it, I think I just said \u2013 just answered this question. We will improve the trend in M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S., continue to accelerate our distribution in that all of our makeup brands that have distribution opportunities internationally turn around our M\u2022A\u2022C organic growth in the U.S. and continue to accelerate our winning makeup brands around the world, also in the organic growth with more programs, particularly outstanding innovation and better social media plans. And we will activate the planned price increases in January that we plan to activate.","Operator","Your next question is from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Just housekeeping, specifically, can you give us the like-door growth in China in the quarter and the actual number for M\u2022A\u2022C? How much was M\u2022A\u2022C down in the U.S. and what was M\u2022A\u2022C's growth globally just for the quarter?","And then my bigger sort of conceptual question. I get and I understand the opportunity for distribution expansion for so many of the brands in so many new markets. And I see why that will drive a third of your growth, and that's great. But my concern is that you are gaining more market share, it seems, through distribution expansion as opposed to with your own innovation. And I look at your two really big new products over the last year: New Dimensions and Est\u00e9e Edit, which we heard about for several quarters before they were launched. They were supposed to be game-changers. New Dimensions was supposed to set off a whole new category. Est\u00e9e Edit was supposed to revitalize the brand with millennials. And both of those brands have fallen well short of your expectations. And I know it may take time, and Est\u00e9e Edit may be a slow build, and all that kind of stuff. But my bigger question, Fabrizio, and you even mentioned it at Barclays, that the company is changing its focus less from blockbuster home runs, successful new product innovations, and more smaller things. But I'm just wondering how big a change that is culturally. Does that change the cost to compete? Those kinds of things because that strikes me as a very, very different philosophy or approach to building your brands and launching new products than we've seen historically at the company. Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah, you raise a lot of questions. So China, China, this was again a quarter where China retail touched double digit. So we are very happy. China retail grew overall 10%. M\u2022A\u2022C in China grew outstandingly, and our same-door in China grew in 2%. And so that's the situation. So we have again good, interesting growth in China. By the way, this is also driven by our makeup brands in a big way and by the makeup part of our heritage brands as well. And M\u2022A\u2022C is a really strong driver of this growth in China among others.","Same thing in Korea. We are competing very well with Korea brands. We have another quarter in which in Korea we have been a very strong retail and continue to grow market share in the country of Korean brands, which make us very competitive \u2013 and again this has been driven by a lot of our makeup brands as well including M\u2022A\u2022C.","The second part of your question is the innovation plan. Yeah, definitely, New Dimension was below our expectation, and in fact by the way, the launch of New Dimension last year was in the first quarter. And part of what we see in skin care this year in terms of base is that we are anniversarying a base where there was the launch of New Dimension that although below our expectation was significant in terms of overall volumes of innovation.","And the future of our innovation is changing, as I explained in the Barclays Conference and the rest, meaning there are some very exciting innovation and less blockbusters. We believe this is much more in line with current consumers' expectations where consumer wants to try new products and have a variety of them. And the model is not \u2013 the breakthrough model assumed a lot of advertising before the product is in store. So in reality, it's higher risk financially. While the model where we use the growth, the innovation to attract new consumers and to engage them, and then when we see success we further accelerate and further leverage this innovation is the model that particularly in our midsized and smaller brands is much more manageable and allow faster and better financial results from these innovations than in the past.","So the idea, we are going to have a mix. We still are going to have some breakthrough technology innovation and some more commercial innovations, including product packaging, aesthetics, et cetera, innovation. The fact that a lot of the growth comes from makeup is increasing the percentage of innovation, which is not about breakthrough technology obviously, but this is still part of our portfolio. But the way in which we will launch even this breakthrough technology will be with less risky upfront investment and more gradual evolution of the winners. And that is a change in our innovation program and is a change that will be \u2013 is associated already with some great results where we have the right innovation and will be associated, I believe, with a lot of good success in innovation.","As we said before, last year, we went from 20% of our sales growth coming from innovation in fiscal year 2015 to 24% coming in fiscal year 2016 from innovation.","In terms of the cost of innovation, which was the last part of your question, frankly, I believe it's the opposite. This new improvement of our innovation program is decreasing the cost of innovation, because it's decreasing the risk of it. It's decreasing the amount of money that are put upfront on innovation that don't work and are allowing us a better agility in tailored resources where the consumers react positively to our innovation. So it's increasing the effectiveness and the rate of return on our innovation.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, thanks for the question. Fabrizio or Tracey, given the importance of the December quarter and the overall year, can you just maybe give us your overall macro undertones that you are kind of assuming in your forecast for the second quarter, just to kind of give us a feel on how much potential cushion or risk you are baking in, just given the environment right now?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So I'll start, Nik. It certainly is difficult to predict the environment, certainly most near term here in the U.S. But at least the election uncertainty will be over next week and we can move forward. I think that we are very pleased with the programs that we have to take advantage of the holiday season. And M\u2022A\u2022C has an incredibly strong giftable program this year. And so we're very excited about that. Certainly, we expect that that is going to drive a great amount of volume and sales for M\u2022A\u2022C. In terms of Jo Malone, many of our brands are fragrance brands. Obviously, we're well-positioned for holiday.","We are still mindful of the fact that there are many parts of the globe that are weak and certainly Fabrizio talked about some of those, Hong Kong, the Middle East. We're not expecting a big pickup in those markets in the second quarter and the holiday season. We expect the UK to have a bit of a pickup certainly given the currency favorability there. We do expect that that will be the case. And we were actually in the UK last week and certainly saw quite a bit of traffic in the UK in the shops. So I would say it's a mixed bag. I think we're very in tune with what's happening around our globe and certainly our regional presidents are as we migrate into this holiday season. And I think we feel we have an incredibly strong lineup across all of our brands including Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique for holiday.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. And the other thing I want to leave you with is about our assumptions. We do not assume Hong Kong to go back to growth this fiscal year. We do not assume Middle East to go back to growth this fiscal year. We do not assume U.S., depart \u2013 mid-tier department store big improvements in the course of the year. We assume they will not further deteriorate, but we do not assume big improvements. And the rest is we assume that we will be able to reallocate resources depending on the volatility we see in the other element of economical and political volatility around the world.","Operator","Your next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","The first \u2013 good morning. I just wanted to clarify, Fabrizio, what you just said about Hong Kong, Middle East, and U.S. department stores, that was \u2013 you are not expecting them to be positive for the fiscal year or for the calendar \u2013 like for the second quarter?","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","We \u2013 both.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So Hong Kong...","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Now, by positive, depending what you mean positive. I said I don't expect Hong Kong market to grow in the fiscal year and definitely not in the next three months. We don't expect Middle East will be positive in the fiscal year and definitely not in the next three months. And I said we don't expect U.S. department store to further deteriorate in the level of traffic for the remaining of the fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks and good morning, everybody. I'm wondering if you can comment on M\u2022A\u2022C growth, excluding new distribution outside of the U.S. and how sustainable current double-digit growth is. And sort of broadly, we've estimated M\u2022A\u2022C has driven somewhere around 20%, 25% of company sales growth in recent years. So if it's slowing, and I get the comment about international being called 70% of brand volume, but how much can the company make up with acquisitions or other, assuming that the rest of the portfolio doesn't accelerate? And why or why not is this a good way to think about that?","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So, the way \u2013 as I said before, the way you need to think about that is one-third of our sales will be growing single digits and one-third of our sales or our brands will be growing double digit and then one-third will be in the middle, as I said before. And this \u2013 you can make the same assumption by channel, by country. We manage the portfolio different growth levers. So specifically to M\u2022A\u2022C, M\u2022A\u2022C is internationally, so outside of the United States, M\u2022A\u2022C is a relatively untouched brand in terms of price and distribution in many countries. Take countries like China where M\u2022A\u2022C is really, really untapped, enormous opportunities only in a limited number of cities and a lot to go. And there are many examples like that.","And there are other places where M\u2022A\u2022C is well penetrated, well developed like the U.S. or the UK. So it depends by the mix. Each one of these brands have a very different mix in portfolio. That's why I don't think we are going to deploy every single brand and every single opportunity in price and distribution and organic growth brand per brand. And that's why I summarize with the one-third, one-third, one-third.","And then your \u2013 so this will continue. And the second part of the question is the role of acquisitions. Yeah, we have \u2013 in the fragrance business, the role of acquisition has been to create the engines of growth of this new high-end artisanal fragrance category where we want to lead and to drive growth. And I think this quarter you see for the first time a very significant sign of that and the potential of it in the long-term. We are doing fragrances what we did in makeup \u2013 past history on makeup. And then we'll continue to drive that.","In the other categories, acquisition will play a role like they always played and will continue to play a role to create the right portfolio brands and to create the right possibility of growing in areas where we have strategic opportunity or strategic gaps. And so you can expect us to continue leveraging acquisition and continuing analyzing the opportunities on your acquisition in the future to manage these strategic gaps or opportunities.","And last, we have also some minority investments around the world that could be very interesting in the long-term. For example, Dr. Jart+ in Korea, which is one of the fastest growing Korean brands where we have a minority investment, there could be an acquisition in the future as an example of strategic opportunities that we continue to monitor \u2013 to enrich our different engines of growth. And to close, I mean, we are building engines of growth, differentiated, different in many to diversify our opportunity for growth in the long-term. That's the key strategy. And frankly, we're making great progress on it quarter by quarter.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","And the only thing I want to add to that is internationally, outside of the markets that we've spoken about, M\u2022A\u2022C growth from a comp store standpoint is strong and is expected to be strong throughout the balance of the year. So the international M\u2022A\u2022C business is quite strong. The travel retail business is quite strong for M\u2022A\u2022C as well. So I just want to...","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","And the online is very, very strong.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","And online as well.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","One specific issue is U.S. distribution platform on M\u2022A\u2022C and the competition in the U.S. That's the specific M\u2022A\u2022C issue that we have addressed and we will address in the next months.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges, provision of one-time impacts of the new U.S. tax law, and other adjustments disclosed in our press release.

And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio now.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning to everyone. We delivered terrific financial results in our fiscal second quarter as our momentum accelerated. Our double-digit growth in both sales and earnings per share reflected broad-based gains across all regions and product categories.","Sales rose 14% in constant currency and we leveraged the growth into substantial earnings improvement, boosted by cost savings and greater efficiencies. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 23% in constant currency. Our sales grew at more than twice the rate of global prestige beauty, enabling us to accelerate our market share gains.","Fueling our success was a strong innovation program focused on supporting our iconic high-quality products and heritage brands that had demonstrated their power by driving strong loyalty and repurchase rates. Our performance caps a very strong first half. Based on these results and continued confidence in our prospects, we are again raising our full-year adjusted forecast.","Many factors contributed to our achievements. Beauty was popular for holiday gift-giving and performed well across a variety of categories and channels. Our prestige brands, respected for their high quality and authenticity, offered compelling products that resonated strongly with global consumers.","To fuel our performance in a balanced and diversified way, we focused our resources on priority areas within our multiple engines of growth. To expand our targeted consumer reach, we increased our investment in fast-growing countries and in channels where more and more consumers are shopping. We also further enhanced our digital capabilities and social media, created in-store displays that grabbed shopper attention, and implemented new technologies that modernize and enhance the consumer experience.","Strong execution by our talented global teams was crucial to our excellent results. Our winning strategy fueled many areas of our business. Brands representing 95% of our sales achieved gains this quarter, while brands that accounts for half of our sales grew double digits. Each of our three largest brand, Estee Lauder, Clinique, and MAC, posted highest sales, and combined they grew double digits. Estee Lauder had a standout performance and Clinique and MAC delivered solid global growth.","Sales increased in about 80% of our markets and in virtually all of our channels. Our strategy to focus on the best performing categories, leverage consumer shopping preferences, and offer innovative product and services, is clearly working. Both skin care and makeup, our largest and most profitable categories, generated strong double-digit growth, giving us two solid engines.","The resurgence in skin care, that began about six months ago, accelerated, making it our best-performing category. Skin care was led by our Estee Lauder and La Mer brands, which posted excellent growth in every region of the world.","We have driven our skin care growth by honing our research and development on innovations that support our hero franchises. We are creating products that provide instant benefits and long-lasting efficacy and appeal to large and fast-growing demographic segments, including millennial and ageless consumers.","Skin care had remained the priority for us, even as global consumptions lowered, because we anticipated that demand would rebound. We took steps to strengthen our offering in many key subcategories and now our brands are benefiting from renewed interest.","Our makeup strength came from several brands, in particular Tom Ford and MAC. Across our portfolio, makeup was strongest internationally. Our growth was also aided by incremental sales from Too Faced and BECCA, which we acquired near the end of the previous year's second quarter.","Our best-performing brands included our flagship Estee Lauder, whose sales growth accelerated, rising double-digit for the third consecutive quarter, making it a star in our portfolio. The brand sales grew across the board in every category, in every region, and in most markets, with particular strengths in online globally, in China, and in travel retail worldwide. Each success is due in part to executing a digital-first mindset and emphasizing social media strategy which has helped it reach more consumers, especially younger ones.","In addition, Estee Lauder's focus on hero franchises and iconic products has paid off beautifully. In the first six months of this fiscal year, seven of the brand's top franchises increased double-digits. Estee Lauder is a prime example of a heritage brand benefiting from continued consumer loyalty, as it successfully innovates around its core products and engages consumers in modern ways.","Although we continue to face strong competition or trial from upstart enemy brands, we believe many of them won't have the same power and the repurchase rate of our established brands and core products. Trial is often an investment, loyalty is the key profitability driver.","Momentum also continued in our luxury portfolio, whose products were in high demand worldwide. As global economies continue to improve, we expect our luxury brands will continue to ascend. La Mer, Jo Malone and Tom Ford, each delivered double digit growth online, in travel retail, and in European and Asian regions. Some midsized brands, such as Origins, were also among our best performance and helped boost the skin care category.","From a channel perspective, our online travel retail and specialty-multi businesses continued their rapid pace. Our sales in each climbed strong double-digits. Our online business rose sharply in every region, led by Asia-Pacific where sales nearly doubled.","Tmall now accounts for the majority of our e-commerce in China and our sales on the platform surged. This was MAC first holiday season on Tmall, which helped lift its online sales in Asia sharply. And La Mer successfully attracted many new consumers on Tmall on Singles' Day. We expect to launch more brands on Tmall this fiscal year.","In North America, the key periods encompassing Black Friday and Cyber Monday were important drivers of our online business, and sales on our brand sites and on retailer sites grew strongly. Mobile continue to be a key component, with sales rising more than 70%, and usage of mobile live chats was 5x greater than last year. With this key shopping period becoming a global event, our online teams in each market created locally relevant offers to drive growth.","We continue to roll out more brands online internationally. Our products are now available online in 38 countries, which approximately is one quarter of the market where we have brick-and-mortar presence, giving us plenty of opportunity for expansion and future growth.","Travel retail growth came largely from Asia as well as from our five largest brands in the channel, all of which rose strong double-digits. Our investment in emerging markets as well as a rise in the number of Chinese tourists helped fuel the improvement. Investment in the biggest local markets not only drives demand in those markets, but also results in demand in travel corridors. We gained share with Chinese consumer across all corridors, and also in skin care in the European region with the increasing number of Brazilian travelers.","We have continued to expand our less distributed brands into more airports, and a wider portfolio provides a stronger foundation. Even with greater distribution, the larger majority of our growth this quarter came from like-door increases.","We are benefiting from our efforts to increase conversion among travelers, which encourages more of them to be biased. To this end, we implemented several new capabilities. These included improved shopper insights, better merchandising, and enhanced digital marketing throughout a traveller's journey. We expect continued strong growth in the channel, both short and long-term. Solid passenger growth is expected to continue, particularly from Chinese consumers who are driving global luxury consumption.","This specialty-multi channel continues to enjoy strong traffic. Some of our brands are positioning themselves where a growing number of their target consumers are shopping. So they are entering select specialty-multi retailers globally, and we are broadening their consumer base.","Many of our brands, such as MAC and Estee Lauder, also have the power to bring new consumers to the channel, like what is happening for example in availability in the U.S. Our brands have had terrific success and they have expanded their targeted worldwide reach in the channel.","Some examples from the second quarter include Jo Malone which launched in Sephora in France and Italy, Clinique added more doors with [indiscernible] and Boots in Korea, MAC opened in MECCA in Australia, and Too Faced deepened its presence in Sephora internationally.","Our freestanding stores are growing internationally but results have been mixed by market. We continue to focus on productivity and open new ones where distribution options are limited. Some brands are experimenting with retail stores format in strategic new ways. Estee Lauder has continued to refine its store concept and experienced strong sales acceleration throughout Asia.","Recently, it debuted in a new store in Milan, it's first in Western Europe, as part of a selective rollout in the region to strengthen brand awareness. Tom Ford chose London as the location of its first beauty-only store, designing a space that combines luxury with technology, and it's had positive early results. In a new concept, MAC and Bumble and bumble created a full-service makeup and hair studio in Dallas.","Now, let me catch on our regional performance. Asia-Pacific posted the largest percentage gain. In China, we generated superb growth across categories and channels. Basically, every brand grew double digits in China, led by MAC and Tom Ford, whose businesses more than doubled. Estee Lauder is our biggest brand in China and it posted stellar growth.","Our business in Hong Kong continued to recover and we achieved double-digit sales growth, making our best performance for a second quarter in the last five years. This was driven by a strong rebound in local consumption as well as a greater number of inbound Chinese travelers. Successful holiday programs and hero products accounted for a large portion of purchases.","Most countries recorded growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and among the strongest was Italy where our sales grew at 5x the rate of prestige beauty. We also grew well in Benelux, the Balkans and the Nordic countries. We faced a slower market in the U.K. and challenges in Germany due to a decline in some brick-and-mortar stores. The Middle East continued to be disabled as lower retail sales caused the stocking.","In our emerging markets, investment we have made in distribution, digital marketing and other areas have been effective. In total, these countries grew sharply. The best performance outside of China included India, Turkey, Russia and Brazil. We will leverage our investment during the next phase of acceleration in these markets, which are poised to continue expanding.","Our sales grew solidly in North America, fueled by incremental sales from our newness brand, Too Faced and BECCA, and strong online results from retail sites and our brand sites. We are still challenged with the slowdown in U.S. brick-and-mortar department stores and although our business in them declined, there was improvement from the first quarter.","Our brands helped drive traffic to stores, with influencer appearances and special events. During holidays, our gift sets were well-received. At Clinique, thanks to desirable product at sharp price points, the brand recruited more consumers than the previous year and also drove basic business well. Estee Lauder annual Blockbuster gift set sold out in the U.S. before the end of the season.","Social media has become the most effective and significant vehicle for our brands to communicate with consumers. We are skilled at working with relevant global and local influencers to generate engaging content and drive traffic. Tom Ford, for example, launched a popular lipstick collection in Shanghai with an event for celebrities and influencers. This approach drove significant growth on the brand's digital channels, generated millions of engagements, and was featured on Vogue China online.","These sorts of activities across our brands have helped the Company to continue to lead in social media. For the quarter, we were again the top Company among prestige beauty brands in earned media value in the U.S., accordingly to drive dynamics.","Staying ahead of the curve, our brands are exploring new technologies to enhance the consumer experience. Estee Lauder collaborated with Google to offer voice-activated night time skin care advice over Google Assistant, extending High-Touch into their home. We are also bringing breakthrough technology into skin care and foundation products. Our innovations are accelerating and we are excited about scientific advances in new products that we believe will help fuel our momentum and continue our share gains.","Overall, global economies are healthy. We should held continue driving consumer demand. Asia and emerging markets are projected to show strength. With upcoming tax cuts, the U.S. economy is expected to accelerate. We should continue to benefit from greater consumer spending online, but believe brick-and-mortar retail in the U.S. will continue to be challenged. Against this global backdrop, we are also cautious about the potential risk of political and social challenges, including Brexit.","As we focus on driving growth, we are also intent on creating greater cost savings and efficiencies. Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative is on track, delivering initial positive benefit and allowing faster resource and talent reallocation to our biggest priority and pivots. By creating stronger leverage on our higher sales, we expect to sustain our earning progression.","In closing, I want to thank our global teams whose hard work, challenger spirit, and incredible performance have resulted in many successes to celebrate this quarter. We couldn't be more proud of our talented workforce and their passion for excellence in execution. The combination of our superb results and the new U.S. tax legislation give us an opportunity to invest in our workforce by accelerating benefit enhancements and other rewards to help attract, retain and motivate employees around the world. We expect to solidify our plan in the coming months.","As we look to the second half of our fiscal year, we are on solid footing. Importantly, we are optimistic about the state of global prestige beauty and confident in our continued leadership. To fuel our momentum, we plan to invest in the categories that are accelerating, continue driving our multiple engines of growth, and become even more efficient and productive as we embrace new global opportunities.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tracy.","Tracey T. Travis","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning everyone. Before we review the financial results and expectations for the balance of the year, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss the implications for our Company of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","We believe the legislation allows us to build on our strength. We are a significant employer in the U.S. and a net exporter, with our headquarters here in New York City, and manufacturing, research and development, and distribution facilities in Minnesota, New York, and Pennsylvania. The Tax Act will provide us with greater flexibility to deploy our cash more efficiently around the world and certainly here in the U.S. This further reinforces our already strong capital structure, high return on invested capital, and effective deployment of our resources.","The reduction in the U.S. statutory rate supports the continuation of the downward trend we have already seen in our global effective tax rate over the past few years. It will also allow us to realize better returns on our recent strategic acquisitions and minority investments.","In the second quarter, we recorded three one-time items related to the new tax legislation which we consider nonrecurring. The first is a charge of $325 million, equal to $0.86 per share, related to a tax on historical foreign earnings that have not been repatriated to the U.S. The effective tax rate is 15.5% for liquid unrepatriated earnings generally held as cash and cash equivalents and 8% on earnings that have been reinvested in foreign operations. The cash impact of this tax is payable over eight years.","The second is a charge of $51 million, equal to $0.14 per share, related to the re-measurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets at the lower statutory rate. The third charge of $18 million, equal to $0.05 per share, reflects the establishment of a net deferred tax liability for withholding taxes related to the expected repatriation of certain foreign earnings.","It is important to note that these charges, the combined impact of which is $394 million or $1.05 per share, are provisional and may require adjustment within the allowable one year measurement period. The tax bill is complex and the final impacts may differ from these estimates due to changes in the regulatory interpretation of the Tax Act.","Now regarding our global effective tax rate for fiscal 2018, it is estimated to decrease to approximately 24%. This takes into account the reduction in the U.S. statutory rate as well as our geographic mix of earnings and the year-to-date impact of the change in accounting for share-based compensation we discussed with you last quarter.","Additional provisions of the Tax Act become effective for us in fiscal 2019. We are continuing to review these impacts, which include additional provisions affecting taxes on our foreign earnings and the loss of certain deductions. Including these impacts, at this time we estimate that the fiscal 2019 effective tax rate could be between 23% and 24%.","Overall, we have a smaller effective tax rate benefit than some other companies. The increased flexibility in liquidity however provides greater strategic support for our long-term sustainable growth. We expect further clarification on the tax legislation as the remainder of the fiscal year progresses and we will update you on the expected tax rate for fiscal 2019 in August when we also provide you with our guidance for the next fiscal year.","As it relates to cash and cash investments, at the end of December we had $3.4 billion of cash and liquid investments outside of the U.S. The ability to repatriate our global liquidity when needed could provide additional financial agility to an already strong balance sheet. We will seek to maximize those repatriations in the most efficient manner, if not all of the cash is available to immediately repatriate to the U.S. As our cash needs in the U.S. generally exceed our cash generation, the greater access to our global cash reduces our reliance on debt to fund seasonal working capital, dividends, and other priorities.","Our strong balance sheet has provided us with financial flexibility to fund our growth opportunities and our capital allocation strategy has generated strong returns on invested capital over the past several years. Our priorities for capital deployment to drive shareholder value remain unchanged and include, first, investing in our business to support our profitable growth strategy, strategic acquisitions that we believe can earn a strong return on invested capital for our shareholders and enhance our global position in prestige beauty, and returning excess free cash flow to shareholders via a combination of share repurchases and dividends.","Now, I'll move on to our financial results for the second quarter. I'll remind you that my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges and adjustments primarily related to our Leading Beauty Forward initiative and the U.S. tax legislation which I just discussed.","Net sales for the second quarter were $3.74 billion, up 14% in constant currency compared to the prior year period. This outstanding performance was broad-based across our business. Every region and most countries contributed to growth, with exceptional performance in Asia Pacific and travel retail. Every product category grew, led by a strong resurgence in skin care, double-digit growth in makeup and fragrance, and solid results in hair care. Incremental sales from Too Faced and BECCA contributed approximately 2 percentage points of this growth, which means our organic growth accelerated this quarter to 12%.","Our gross margin declined 40 basis points compared to the second quarter last year. The unfavorable impact of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions was 55 basis points, which was partially offset by supply-chain efficiencies of 15 basis points.","Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 70 basis points. Higher investments in advertising and promotion expense were more than offset by lower selling expenses, which reflected both our channel mix shift and our ongoing success in reallocating resources through Leading Beauty Forward as well as productivity improvements and indirect procurement [indiscernible].","As we indicated last quarter, the change in the timing of stock compensation expenses adversely impacted operating expenses in the second quarter and is expected to have an additional impact in the third quarter. Operating income rose 19% and operating margin increased by 40 basis points to 20.9%.","Our effective tax rate this quarter before restructuring charges and the one-time charges from the tax legislation was 24.4%, a 450 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. The rate improved primarily due to a favorable geographic mix of earnings as well as the impact of the lower U.S. statutory rate.","Diluted EPS of $1.52 increased 25% compared to the prior year and grew 23% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.03 of favorable currency translation. The strong EPS performance reflected the continued outstanding results from our Asia-Pacific and travel retail businesses, our innovation success in skin care, and the momentum in expense management and cost savings programs.","We are obviously pleased with our first half result, with our net sales increasing 14% in constant currency and diluted EPS rising at more than double the net sales rate at 30% in constant currency in our first six months of the fiscal year. And our free cash flow nearly doubled as well as we generated $1.45 billion in net cash flow from operating activities in the first half and invested $263 million in capital expenditures. We used $398 million to repurchase 3.5 million shares of our stock and paid $267 million in dividends.","So now let's turn to our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. Given the strength of our first half performance, we are again raising our full-year guidance. We expect continued strong execution to drive performance in our second half as well, even as our growth comparisons become more difficult.","Too Faced and BECCA are now in the base year of comparison and will therefore be part of our organic growth going forward. We are also comparing to the strong acceleration in growth in China, Hong Kong and travel retail that began in the second half of last year, and we are slightly more cautious on the brick-and-mortar retail environment in North America and the U.K. And it is always worth noting that as a global enterprise, there will continue to be a number of macro and geopolitical risks, which are outlined in our press release and which Fabrizio referred to as well.","That said, we are raising our sales growth expectation for the fiscal 2018 full year to 10% to 11% in constant currency. This includes approximately 2 points of growth from the incremental sales from Too Faced and BECCA. Currency translation is expected to benefit reported sales growth by 2.5 percentage points, reflecting weighted-average rates of $1.19 for the euro, $1.33 for the pound, and 112 for the yen for the fiscal year.","Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative and our cost savings programs have excellent momentum and continue to evolve. For example, we continue to reallocate resources to strengthen our capabilities in global digital marketing, which amplifies our ability to connect more directly with consumers. We've also made progress streamlining some of our global functions. We expect to continue to maintain this flexibility to invest a portion of the sales leverage in savings, into our brands and markets where we have experienced strong momentum as well as areas of strategic importance, while also expanding our operating margin.","We are raising our EPS expectations to a range of $4.27 to $4.32 before restructuring and other charges and the one-time charges associated with tax legislation. This includes approximately $0.15 of benefit from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 19% to 20%.","At this time, our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% for fiscal 2018. This reflects the blended U.S. statutory rate of 28% from the new U.S. tax legislation, which was effective as you know January 1.","For the fiscal 2018 third quarter, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 9% to 10% in constant currency. Currency translation is estimated to add approximately 3 percentage points. EPS is forecasted to be between $1.02 and $1.04 before restructuring charges. This includes an approximate $0.06 benefit from currency.","Our expectations for double-digit growth in both sales and earnings per share for our fiscal year reflect the strength of the execution by our talented global teams and the investments we have made, focused particularly behind successful innovations. We will continue to support our abilities to invest in our growth priorities as we also continue to deliver cost savings and expense leverage with our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. All of these elements position us well in the context of accelerating economies around the world.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Altobello","[Indiscernible] that U.S. was down about 3% excluding acquisitions, and it sounds like at least in brick-and-mortar stores things are a little bit better but still not positive yet. So, if you can give us that number, what U.S. was up ex-acquisitions, that would be great. And then secondly, how fast is the market in China growing and how much are you outgrowing that market?","Tracey T. Travis","So the U.S. was slightly down ex-acquisitions, and we talked about some of the successes that we had in the U.S. with our holiday programs which we felt very good about and some of the challenges as well as it relates to brick-and-mortar in the U.S. Online was up strongly in the U.S. and globally as well. So, mixed results in the U.S. And again, our teams are working quite well with our retailers to try to accelerate growth in the second half of the year and beyond. China?","Fabrizio Freda","On China, China market was growing double-digit, the total market, and we are growing much, much stronger than the market, much stronger than the market. So we are gaining market share in China, and in quarter two was our strongest share market gain in a given quarter in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Congrats on the results. I was just following up, I understand the tough comparison that Tracey had mentioned, but embedded in your guidance for the fourth quarter it seems like you are decelerating EPS to about 6% at the top of the guidance. So, I was hoping to get some clarity perhaps on you reinvesting some of the gains that you had in the year into more advertisement or innovation, how should we think about the balance of profitability I should say, because definitely I understand the tough comparisons, so if you can elaborate I would appreciate. Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","As we say, we are delivering, we plan to deliver our margin growth goals for the fiscal year in total. But in the second semester, we are planning to invest on our strengths. And so you mentioned advertising, in absolute terms advertising will increase significantly, particularly in the digital areas in the influencer global strategies and with focus in the markets where there is momentum. So we are investing on strengths. And advertising would also increase a little bit, slightly in terms of percentage of sales.","But we are also investing in technologies which are driving our business drivers. We are investing in reinforcing our analytics, which are driving our ability to make choices on the business that I believe this quarter proves they are becoming sharper and sharper every time.","We are investing more in the key markets where we see momentum and in subcategories where we see momentum, and obviously on our key brands and hero products and the hero product franchise strategy that we are pushing, which is working so well. And we will continue to invest online where we see strong growth both in the area of our brand dotcom and in the retailer dotcom with all our partners.","So, we will continue to invest in our strengths and we plan to solidify and make sustainable the strong accelerated growth trends.","Andrea Teixeira","Fabrizio, this is very helpful. You mentioned digital. So the question that we all asked back in the last call was about Amazon. So you mentioned that it wouldn't be included, if anything, this fiscal year. How do you feel, like because you are increasing investments in digital, are you feeling that is going to be a decision that will remain independent, basically you will remain independent in your digital investments in terms of channel?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, we are not changing our strategy. We continue to invest in our brand dotcom, in our retailer dotcom, and in the platforms where we control our assets and our destiny.","Andrea Teixeira","On a first party basis, yes, okay. On a third-party basis, I'm sorry. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Russell Miller","This is Russ Miller on for Nik. We wanted to ask on Leading Beauty Forward. Are you seeing any specific new opportunities that perhaps you did not see initially?","Tracey T. Travis","Great question. Yes, we actually have seen new opportunities. So there's been relative to Leading Beauty Forward we launched almost two years ago now, and I think I have mentioned and Fabrizio has mentioned on previous calls, we've gotten quite a bit of engagement throughout the organization for the program and it's allowed us to move forward in a lot of areas as it relates to changing some of our organization structures to be a bit more efficient and more leveraged as well as bringing new capabilities into the organization along with reducing costs. So we have added some programs to Leading Beauty Forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Good morning and congratulations. I had a couple of questions. First, just trying to understand, on the BECCA and Too Faced in the quarter, they contributed a couple of points of growth. I think the plan initially was for 3 points. I know it's not significant, but was there anything that changed versus what you expected with the competition? And then, Fabrizio, for you, if you talk about reinvesting in expanding some of these newer brands like a Too Faced internationally, can you just help outline for us what the intermediate roadmap can look like there?","Fabrizio Freda","I think I can answer the two questions in one. Basically we are still in line with our plans on Too Faced and BECCA and we are very happy of how these brands are performing within our portfolio, and particularly they are filling one of our strategic priorities, which is to increase our market share in the specialty channel globally, and this is really, really working.","In terms of how the plan changes, the plan changes continuously, our big strength is the agility to adjust the plan when we see market variation. So in that sense, Too Faced has been growing less than what we originally thought in the U.S. and we have been accelerating on the contrary the growth internationally more than what we thought, and that's why in the short term it is likely different impact on profitability because the international expansion is slightly more expensive than the North America expansion. But those are variations of agility within the overall plan, which we are very happy with.","Erinn Murphy","Okay. And then if I could just ask one for Tracey on the gross margin, now that you are lapping acquisitions, could you just help us think about the back half outlook, what are you seeing in terms of input costs versus some of the supply-chain efficiency opportunity you've been delivering on?","Tracey T. Travis","So, it's a great question. We don't expect to see the year-over-year reductions and negative impact on our gross profit margin now that we are lapping the acquisitions in the second half of the year. We do expect some increases in input costs as well. There will be a bit of a delayed impact from that, but we certainly are mindful of fuel prices going up and the impact that that could have on us, as well as a few other input costs. But in general we are expecting slight favorability in our gross margin for the balance of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Maybe turning back to China, I was just hoping you could just compare the same-store sales trends that you saw in the second quarter to those that you saw in Q1, because I think they were up over 30% in the first quarter, I'm just trying to figure out how they compare. And more broadly, I'm just wondering if you would characterize demand in China as sort of comparable on a sequential basis or whether you are seeing actually signs of further underlying improvement, obviously adjusting for the seasonality, because I think we are all just trying to understand how sustainable the strength that you're seeing in China is when we normalize it out over the next 12 to 18 months. And maybe perhaps as you comment on that, you could just expand on how much benefit you think maybe the categories been receiving this year from the lower import taxes, and then Tracey, maybe just tactically whether you see any benefit in the third quarter of this year for maybe a later Chinese New Year?","Fabrizio Freda","I mean to answer your China expectation is a difficult question to answer in the long-term, but we believe that double digit growth is sustainable. That's basically the bottom line. Prestige beauty has been growing double-digit in China in the past five quarters, and to your question, is accelerating. We see the market in quarter two was stronger and our performance was stronger than previously, so the reason acceleration.","What is driving this acceleration, yes, there's been an impact on the duty reduction on the pricing in the country that we all have executed, and this probably is past what's happening in the market and building the consumption. And that is not only that, it is also the digital economy and the impact of social media is strong and is getting better and we are getting very good in executing this. Our team in China is executing in a fantastic way and a lot of the great results have to be attributed to their talent in executing our programs.","The other aspect is pretty simple, we are not increasing number of cities and we are not increasing distribution in quarter two in a very big way. The majority of the growth has been same-doors. And the other interesting aspect is that China is leapfrogging the model of many other big markets like United States. In which sense? In the sense that the department store, the brick-and-mortar is still very focused in high-traffic areas. For example, we are only in 170 cities. Today we serve consumers from 650 cities because the remaining cities we serve it via online. That's why in China online is already 27% of our sales in quarter two, which is making the growth in China pretty productive and the ability to make it sustainable in my opinion better.","So, in a nutshell, we believe that double-digit market growth should be relatively sustainable, obviously subject to shorter up and downs, and we believe we have a very solid position and this solid position should continue.","Tracey T. Travis","And regarding Chinese New Year, it is a few weeks later this year than it was last year. So we do expect to see slight, both from anniversarying a stronger acceleration last year as well as on a later Chinese New Year this year, a bit of a mitigated growth in the third quarter from China because of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong, Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Can you talk about how many countries some of these brands that are on fire in, like Too Faced, Tom Ford, how many countries are already in and how much more opportunity there is? And then in terms of e-commerce, how does the mix of your sales differ versus brick-and-mortar, is it more skin care heavy versus makeup, is it new customers or existing, or is it a consumer who is trying something new or existing who is replenishing, and as more consumers move online, how do you expect that mix to potentially shift?","Fabrizio Freda","I'll start from the second question. So, our online business is strong across, but the strongest categories are skin care and makeup, and the business has a slightly higher percentage of replenishment and repurchase than the brick-and-mortar, which means that is obviously that the growth on online of hero products or franchises that have good loyalty is very important, is very strong. Said in our way, a strong position online allow better loyalty and better repurchase, so allow brand to be stronger and more profitable over time. In terms of the global distribution of brands?","Tracey T. Travis","So, Olivia, we still have quite a bit of upside. Too Faced in particular is still largely a U.S. based brand. We have started the plans to rollout internationally, and given the potential that we believe the brand has, actually are accelerating those plans over the second half of the year and into fiscal 2019.","Our most broadly distributed brands are Estee Lauder and Clinique, and as we said, Estee Lauder has experienced double-digit growth in the second half. So, distribution certainly is a factor in growth, but also strong consumer engagement, strong innovation also can drive even a more broadly distributed brand to grow, as we are seeing with Estee Lauder and Clinique grew as well this quarter, as did MAC.","So we have with our 30 brands quite a bit of flexibility. We talk about multiple engines of growth and we've certainly built that over time from a Company standpoint, both brands, regions, and obviously channels, and we are executing against that, I think as you can see from our quarter results and our year-to-date results.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, but to give you a general perspective on digital distribution, some of our brands today are in one-tenth of the distribution of Lauder and Clinique, some other in one-fifth. So, if the benchmark will be Lauder and Clinique, there will be infinite opportunity for the distribution. But the reality is that we have a different distribution target by brand and some brands, particularly our luxury brands portfolio, will be eased and will continue to be less distributed and more focused and more selective than our broader distributed brands. So, it's a complex portfolio and it's very selected distribution by brand that is what we are aiming, but the key point is there is further opportunity of distribution in our portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason Gere","Nice quarter, guys. I guess one question that will kind of dovetail into the second, maybe if you could talk just about the working capital improvements that you saw in the quarter, the free cash flow, how we are thinking about that going forward? And then when we think about the proceeds of free cash flow while we are lapping Too Faced and BECCA, where do you see, and I wouldn't call them holes in the portfolio, but where you can continue to strengthen the portfolio including maybe opportunities if there are any tail-brands in the portfolio to divest, just how you are thinking about where the portfolio could be maybe a couple of years from now?","Tracey T. Travis","So, on the working capital, thank you for recognizing that we did have improvements in working capital, both in terms of our inventory days to sell and certainly payables also. So, we continue to have many strategies across the organization to improve working capital and we expect that to continue over the next few years, ongoing improvements in working capital.","As it relates to our capital allocation decisions, and I talked about some of that in our prepared remarks, but our M&A strategies, we certainly feel very good about the portfolio we have. We have identified some whitespace areas that if the right assets become available, we given our strong balance sheet and strong cash flow would certainly entertain those acquisitions if they have the right return on invested capital.","Fabrizio Freda","And our M&A strategy is pretty articulated and we have also minority investments that may become available in the next year, so which are already past of our articulated portfolio strategy. And so, our priority is fielding our strategic opportunities and doing it only with brands which are ready for doing that, which are strong enough for doing it, and obviously which are available at the right level of return on invested capital, and this will continue.","So how do we see our portfolio in the long-term? Stronger, better, and better covering all our key strategic opportunities to help us deliver the real ultimate goal of sustainability, which is a multiple engine growth, well-diversified portfolio which is covering the key long term opportunity that we analyze and envisage with our complex strategic process.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie.","Caroline Levy","Congratulations from me on an amazing quarter. On China, I was wondering how many consumers you think you are actually reaching, in the sense of how many are buying your product today versus five or six years ago, and how much of your growth do you think will come just from middle class Chinese increasing and entering into your price points? The second point on that is, for many brands we've seen local competitors get stronger and eat away market share, but it actually seems like the reverse is happening even with Korean skin care being maybe less fashionable than it once was, if you could just comment on that? And I'm sorry but a final one, what are you doing in bricks-and-mortar to renovate the stores, where are you having success with that?","Fabrizio Freda","So, a lot of questions. How many consumers in China? Frankly, our business in the last year has been growing exponentially, and so we touch probably 5x, 10x the amount of consumers that we've been touching two years ago, depending where you start the benchmark. So, the growth is exponential.","And what I want to \u2013 rather than a number that frankly will not be the right way to answer, but conceptually what's happening is two things. There are more and more consumers which are entering quality products among the Chinese consumers, they are going for quality. And going for quality they choose more and more many of our brands and particularly our hero franchises. And then there is a great repeat purchase which is increasing. So, it's not only more consumers, which was the heart of your question, but it's the same consumer using more of their total usage with high-quality products in our portfolio.","As you know, Chinese have a very intense regimen of products in skin care, and so they use depending obviously by person up to seven, eight products of skin care per day. So the more you can penetrate that regimen, the more the growth is there and exponential. So, we are acting on two levels, yes, growing the number of consumers, but also growing the penetration of the portfolio usage of each consumer.","The second thing is the growth of consumers in Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities, this is exponential. And the reason why it's accelerating, as explained before, because even if the physical distribution is not reaching these consumers, the online distribution is, and so there are more and more consumers, millions and millions of consumers get more and more access to our products via the online distribution, and this is very, very important.","And that's why we focus so much on quality of products, on safety of products, on the amazing hero franchises, because at the end it's not just conquering a consumer for one time, it's conquering a loyalty and a repeat purchase of satisfied consumers, and that's what makes the business sustainable in China like in any other emerging market.","Then you asked what we do on brick-and-mortar, what we do, we renovate. Tracey, do you want to cover that?","Tracey T. Travis","Yes, we are continuing to renovate our freestanding stones. In fact, as we said in the prepared remarks, one of the big focus areas for the Company is improving the productivity of our freestanding stores. So, in some of the MAC stores for instance, we have converted them to open style. We are testing out services in freestanding stores and investing in capital as it relates to that. So there is continued remodeling in addition to opening stores, new doors, primarily in EMEA and APAC, and really the focus on renovations in the U.S. in terms of some of the tests.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","I just want to confirm a few things to make sure I understood it correctly. The first one is on the top line implied guidance for Q4. It's about 5%. Are you okay with that or are you saying that you are going to invest more to boost that number? I understand a tough compare but I just want to make clear what you said. Secondly, BECCA and Too Faced, it was expected to be 3% of the growth, it was 2%. You kind of addressed this a little bit in one of the previous questions. But what is the underlying growth of BECCA and Too Faced today? Is it still in that kind of 70% to 80% range? And one more, maybe those two I'll let you answer and then I have one more.","Tracey T. Travis","So, in terms of Q4, you're correct that the implied growth is in the mid to high single digits for Q4, and we are anniversarying a very strong Q4 from last year, Ali. We will continue to invest in Q4 in higher advertising and promotion, more in Q3 than in Q4, but we have a tremendous amount of momentum as we have indicated in certain markets and behind certain innovation and we'll continue to invest for the balance of the year against that.","Fabrizio Freda","And on this I just want to clarify just the process that we go through. We analyze this, we analyze our risks, our opportunity in this 5%. There is a lot of our point of view on the base, as Tracey explained, the base period and the risks which are in front of us, including some risks specifically in the U.S., Bon-Ton announcement and many other things which are in this number. But any way, our teams are always charged to beat our estimates. That's just the way we work. So, to answer your question, are you trying to beat this number, yes, every time. That's exactly the way our organization works. We are trying to mitigate the risks and better perform on our implementation.","In terms of BECCA and Too Faced, no, they are not growing 70%, if that's the question, and they are growing more in line what the expectation will be over the long term. In the calendar year 2017, it was our first calendar, they grew double digit, and that was what we wanted. And then by month, by quarter, up and downs depending on competitive environment. I think that's why we are doing faster than what we thought also on these two brands the creation on multiple engines of growth, meaning the internationalization of the brands and the acceleration particularly of the online platforms of the brands where we have plenty of opportunity of improve and accelerate. So, we are going to invest and focus on creating more engines of growth also on those two brands in the next step, as was originally planned, but faster than originally planned.","Ali Dibadj","Okay, thank you. And then my last question was just around SG&A. Clearly it's good it's down again 70 basis points, I feel less down than it has been and I totally remember and get the share-based compensation comment, but if you could help us kind of figure out the components of that underlying the SG&A reduction, and in particular if it relates at all going forward to a comment you made just at the end, Tracey, of employee benefits and reward plan we are thinking about and we'll give more detail, you said that in your prepared remarks?","Tracey T. Travis","Yes, so clearly we are exploring some options, as Fabrizio said, as it relates to employee benefits and that is embedded within our guidance. But in terms of the full year SG&A, what I indicated was we are seeing a tremendous amount of growth from travel retail as well as online, so just mix obviously impacts our selling expense.","And beyond that, we have done a fair amount of work in terms of selling effectiveness, both to provide our selling teams with the tools to enhance their productivity as well as making sure we've got the right investment for the volume growth that we are experiencing across different channels that have selling in them. So that is the largest leverage, if you will, of expense. The other is employee productivity. So, we have also leveraged our G&A expense as it relates to employee productivity.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","I had a question on prestige beauty in the U.S. and the growth you are seeing currently and your outlook for the category as well as the consumer this year, and then if you guys could frame that for us given the slowdown we are seeing in mass beauty, that would be helpful. I guess I'm trying to understand if it's realistic to assume the prestige beauty category growth could accelerate this year and curious to hear how you think about the opportunities for increased purchases and possibly up-trading given the health of the consumer.","Fabrizio Freda","So, I'm not sure exactly what the question is, the U.S. growth, what we expect about prestige beauty in the U.S. So, the overall prestige beauty market in the U.S. is solid and we expect this to continue to be solid and possibly to accelerate because of the new consumption trend that the consumer is setting. So, the overall consumption is positive and accelerating.","Is more where the consumption is happening? And the consumption is happening more and more online. And so we see very good performance of the retail dotcom of most of our customers, including department stores which are having excellent performance there. We see a strong growth of our brand dotcom. We see some great performance in some specialty retailers.","But where we still see the traffic not picking up for beauty in the level we would like is the physical distribution of certain retailers, particularly in the area of department stores. And we see some potential changes, like the recently announced change of the Bon-Ton department store chain, that will impact store closures and reallocation of resources. So, the market is solid but the physical retail environment is subject to continuous evolution and challenges.","And so, since we have an over-proportion exposure to the physical department store distribution in the U.S., that's where our prudence on the estimate for that part of the market comes from, not from the consumption. The consumption is relatively solid.","Operator","We will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Tracey T. Travis","Thank you everybody for participating in our call. And again, we are pleased with our results and incredibly pleased with the performance that our teams generated in the first half of the year, and we look forward to the second half of the year.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, thank you, thank you to everybody and thank you to our teams.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"8624":["The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies (NYSE:EL) Q1 2014 Earnings Call October 31, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Dennis D'Andrea - Vice President of Investor Relations","Fabrizio Freda - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director","Carl Haney - Executive Vice President of Global Research & Development, Corporate Product Innovation, Package Development","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Executive Vice President","Analysts","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Neely J.N.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Carl Haney, Executive Vice President, Global Research and Development, Corporate Product Innovation and Packaging Development. Carl will give a strategic overview of our innovation program.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges. You can find the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website.","And I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio now.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to state that the fiscal 2014 is off to a strong start, as our strategy continues to fuel progress in many areas. During our first quarter, we had good global success from innovations, gained meaningful market share in Asia, China and the U.K. and continued to attract new consumers to our brands. Our sales rose 6% in local currency, in line with our guidance. Importantly, our growth came from every major category in every region, illustrating, once again, broad-based success, thanks to our diverse portfolio of brands and unparalleled High-Touch service.","Diluted earnings per share were $0.76, which was better than we had anticipated. Continuing a trend we have seen in recent quarters, our biggest winners were our luxury brands, as well as M-A-C, which were all up double digits. China and other emerging markets advanced sharply, as did our online and travel retail channels. Our fragrance business was also an important contributor to sales growth, thanks to increased launch activity, excellent innovation and robust sales in the ultra-prestige tier .","As we anticipated, U.S. prestige beauty was somewhat soft, driven by low traffic in stores in July and August, but it improved in September. Overall, prestige growth in the quarter was just about half the pace of a year ago and the environment was more promotional. Many consumers sought value at both prestige beauty products that were either advertised innovations or promotions. In this environment, our brand focused on driving innovation and did not increase their promotions.","In the U.S., we started gaining share in fragrance for the first time in several years. Also, 5 of our brands, mainly in luxury, increased their share of prestige beauty. Our products held 9 of the top 10 SKUs in prestige skin care and 8 of the top 10 in makeup.","Our performance in Europe, the Middle East & Africa was encouraging, led by continued strong results in the U.K. and healthy retail sales in emerging markets. Some Western European markets remained challenging for prestige beauty, but in several of them, we outperformed the general trend. In France, for instance, prestige beauty struggled, but many of our brands resonated well with consumers, which fueled good retail sales. The same was true in Germany, Italy and the Benelux countries.","Asia Pacific was our strongest region, led by sharp gains in Greater China. Retail growth in China was also strong and like door growth improved over the preceding quarter.","Results in Japan, again, were positive, posting local currency growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. And Australia showed signs of a turnaround as we generated mid-single-digit retail sales growth. Our business in Korea is stabilizing, but the difficult prestige beauty environment continued and our sales there declined moderately.","Driving our growth is a well-defined focus on product to service innovations as Carl would soon elaborate. As a global company, we are innovating for a diverse world, and 2 of our biggest launches in the quarter came from our 2 biggest brands. The cutting-edge technologies used in Est\u00e9e Lauder's new Advanced Night Repair Eye Serum helped to drive growth in the brands and our franchise in each skin care category. Retail sales of ANR products climbed sharply in Asia and North America during the quarter. Clinique's new blockbuster, Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+ met our expectation and had widespread acceptance globally, thanks to its enhanced technology and increased moisturizing benefits. For example, in the U.K., where Clinique is the #1 prestige beauty brand, sales of DDML+ rose strong double digits at retail during the quarter.","While these 2 products are among our most publicized and visible launches, our innovation spans our complete portfolio. Even though we are focused on creating more impactful innovations, all brands launched innovation that are meaningful relatives for their size. Innovation is integral to reenergizing our fragrance category to drive profitable growth, so we recently introduced several important new scents. Est\u00e9e Lauder rolled out Modern Muse to select countries in September, making its first new major fragrance in a decade. It quickly became a bestseller in Harrods in the U.K. and reached the top 10 in the U.S. for women prestige fragrances in September, its first month at counter, and has continued to climb since then. We have high expectations for this exciting fragrance during the holiday season.","Other successful fragrance launched include Michael Kors Collection, which helped drive our strong fragrance retail sales in North America. Additionally, Tory Burch launched, exclusively, in Bloomingdale's in the last week of September and has held the #1 spot in the retailer since then. Another newcomer, Zegna Uomo was well received and has been the top seller in booths in the U.K. since its launch 2 months ago.","In our ultra-prestige tier, Tom Ford fragrances have seen significant growth around the world and Jo Malone's new scent Peony & Blush Suede has been the brand's best-selling innovation ever. Many of our fragrances have been backed by strong advertising campaigns to build awareness leading up to their peak selling period.","Our business models for fragrance launches seeks to improve the success rate by introducing them, selectively, in certain markets and, often, after testing the waters. For instance, based on Michael Kors strong results in the United States in the first quarter, we plan to expand the new collection to Europe.","Our sales growth also stems from high-growth channels, which continue to advance rapidly. In e-commerce, for example, both brands and retailer sites had substantial gains, resulting in excellent double-digit sales growth. In the U.S., an increasing amount of our sales in prestige department stores are coming from their e-commerce sites, and that channel is also a key component of the retailer's growth.","Consumers in China are also migrating to shopping online, much faster than we anticipated. Even though e-commerce is a small percentage of our business in China, our online sales more than doubled from a year ago.","Turning to our travel retail business, our retail sales growth was more than twice the rate of passenger traffic growth. We saw a significant spike in Asia, most notably in Thailand, Japan and China, due in part to an increase in Chinese travelers. Our recent skin care innovations are selling well and our travel retail business should benefit from the addition of the new fragrances.","As part of the ongoing efforts to expand our brand presence in this profitable channel, we opened 27 doors in the recent period. We also invested in expanding our global network of freestanding stores, having opened approximately 20 new ones this quarter, nearly all in international markets.","Sales in our retail locations climbed double digits, with the strongest growth coming from international stores. In particular, M-A-C flagships in New York and Paris generated high average unit sales and items per transaction than other M-A-C freestanding stores in the U.S. or France.","In emerging markets, our expansion continued into smaller cities, which are providing the fastest growth. For instance, in China, we entered 5 new Tier 3 and 4 cities, and this strategy, also, is being successful in other countries like Brazil.","To support our growth, we increased our advertising merchandising assembly in the first quarter, using a mix of in-store, print, TV and digital, depending on what was appropriate for the product and the country. Importantly, we continue to invest in many capabilities to sustain our growth, including innovation and retail store operations and our SMI adoption continues to progress smoothly.","As we have said before, our main priority is to drive our top line and leverage that growth for continued margin expansion. Heading into the holidays, we are happy about our product offering and believe our retails sales growth will accelerate for several reasons.","First, our major innovations are succeeding globally and the marketing investment that we made in the first quarter and will continue to make should propel their momentum. Moreover, we have many other innovations on the horizon, across all our product categories that we expect to contribute to higher sales. Additionally, we are much better positioned to have a stronger performance in fragrance this year, thanks to our new launches and believe we will be able to gain share. Our brands' wide collection of desirable fragrances cover a broad range of tastes and price points and should generate higher sales during the second quarter and beyond.","Lastly, as the year goes on, the markets that have been challenging, including Korea, are facing easier comparisons. We continue to believe that global prestige beauty will grow 3% to 4% in fiscal year 2014. And our intent is to expand twice as fast. We are forecasting top line growth of 6% to 8% in local currency, even as we navigate several soft markets. We are confident we can achieve this ambition goal because more than 1\/3 of our business is growing by double digits and the rest can keep pace with prestige beauty, confirming the resilience of our multi-brand and multichannel strategy.","I want to thank everyone in our organization for their hard work and dedication, which has enabled us to start the year well. As we continue on our strategic journey, we carefully consider what paths to take. We are selective and pursue only the right opportunities, those we consider the most promising, that will enhance our leadership in global prestige beauty. Our creativity and imagination will lead with strong innovation will be key to our success in fiscal year '14.","And now, I'll hand over to Carl to give you more details of our innovation process and plans. Carl?","Carl Haney","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased join you today to share a few words on the research development, product and package innovation that is the backbone of the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies.","I joined the company nearly 2 years ago, following more than 25 years with Procter & Gamble, with previous responsibilities including male grooming, cosmetics and beauty care. Our R&D and innovation organization is composed of hundreds of industry-leading scientists, engineers and managers, working in 5 major research centers around 3 continents. These talented innovators partner with our brand and product development leaders to fuel our innovation pipeline to deliver short and long-term results, directly linked to our companies strategy and 10-year compass. We have a diverse and talented team with deep expertise focused solely on prestige beauty. Over the past few years, we've been reinforcing our upstream capabilities globally and have recently doubled our investment in Asia.","Our innovation centers have been designed to be close to the most demanding consumers we serve and are structured to drive local relevance for a diverse, multi-ethnic world. Our goal is to foster innovation in these centers to develop products for the largest and fastest growing categories and segments. We research, design and test where our consumers live and shop, giving us insight into their behaviors and desires. For instance, our R&D center in Shanghai taps into the personal customs and skin care requirements of the fast-growing Chinese market and provides valuable local insights. Local relevance is something you can expect to see even more of going forward.","Creativity and innovation is part of our DNA and drives everything we do. We complement our internal capability with a long-standing and growing network of external innovation partners. These include world-class labs, universities, suppliers and cutting-edge technology research centers.","We also leverage creativity and innovation from every chair, tapping into the latest trends and consumer insights from thousands of professional makeup artists, hairstylists and beauty advisers, globally. We are collaborating deeply with film, fashion and pop culture to develop innovative trends. Our product development, creative and brand leaders directly collaborate with top designers, celebrities, artists and experts to co-create inspiring innovations, such as M-A-C's Rihanna collections and Tory Burch's new fragrance. Together, we find ways to translate unique and creative points of view into beautiful products that our consumers love.","As a creativity-driven, consumer-inspired organization, one of our greatest strengths is our ability to give consumers around the world the products and services they crave, or will crave, even before they want or need them. We define innovation broadly at Est\u00e9e Lauder. We seek to innovate across many dimensions from idea-led product innovations and brand-led storytelling to service innovations. We design, plan and track innovation, by brand, by product category, by year, by region and by type of innovation, to ensure near-term and long-term sufficiency. Our strategy, in recent years, has been to focus on bigger and broader launches. In fiscal 2013, innovation and new products across all brands and regions grew to 16% of our sales. We've also made significant progress in developing bigger initiatives with increasing local relevance whilst maintaining productivity.","Let me take you briefly to our 5 types of innovations. Hero products are the pillars of our brands that provide truly transformational results. They delight existing consumers as well as attract new users. As Fabrizio mentioned before, these include products with new technology such as Est\u00e9e Lauder's new Advanced Night Repair Serum with patented Chronolux Technology and Clinique's new Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+, with improved clinical efficacy.","They also include launching entirely new products, like Clinique's Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector, which introduced a new breakthrough technology to the market, creating a new segment in Skin Care. These patented and proprietary skin care technologies and ingredients were developed with our basic science research and skin care labs in Melville, New York.","We also designed new hero products to be incremental to the brand, with new forms and textures, or adding incremental categories. Additional examples of this are La Mer's Moisturizing Soft Cream that brought a new generation of consumers to the franchise and our new La Mer Treatment Lotion with a Revitalizing Ferment in a watery essence, which is the preferred form in Asia and was developed, in partnership with our skin labs in Melville and Shanghai.","Finally, we also create hero products inspired for regions, like Est\u00e9e Lauder successful Revitalizing Supreme Global Anti-Aging Creme. This patented multi-benefit product and texture was developed for and tested extensively on European women by our European team based in Paris. Having been broadly accepted in Europe, we're now launching it in North America this January.","Sustaining innovations are upgrades and extensions to our core franchises and segments. They are a way to reengage consumers and extend our franchises to new categories and new users. A good illustration is how we are continuing to build out Clinique's groundbreaking Even Better franchise. Taking selective ingredients of the original Dark Spot Correcting Formula, we've extended the franchise to encompass a full collection, consisting of an eye cream, hand cream, facial moisturizer and foundation. Most recently, we created Even Better Essence Lotion, with a unique blend of ingredients and sensorial texture of a watery lotion geared towards Asian consumers. Surprising new trend innovations allow us to respond to emerging trends in ways that engage and delight consumers, as well as driving in-store traffic. These innovations create news, excitement and interest like M-A-C's over 40 collections and collaborations a year, that leverage our Color Innovation Center in Toronto, with expertise in optics, polymers and pigments. For example, the RiRi Hearts MAC campaign, co-designed with global pop superstar, Rihanna, drew 18 million visitors in 1 day, during the exclusive online launch of RiRi Woo lipstick, a key part of this collaboration.","Launch and leverage innovations allow us to make our major launches even bigger over time. These include developing idea-led storytelling, leveraging claims on existing products, creating new regimens and expanding to new geographies. Launch and leverage also allows us to efficiently bring news to our hero products by exploiting our rich portfolio of existing and dormant assets such as claims and clinical studies. We leverage these assets with consumer relevant stories, cutting-edge insights and imagination to efficiently fuel our initiatives.","Service innovations are designed to create High-Touch services that enhance the shopping experience and are tailored for locally relevant needs. Bespoke gifting at Jo Malone, Bobbi Brown's Pretty Powerful makeup lessons and Origins Sampling Bar are all examples of service innovations. We expect our innovation to be fully sufficient across our key metrics and I am personally very excited by the depth, breadth and balance of the pipeline of new technologies, formulations and products we plan to launch in fiscal 2014 and over the next few years.","I would like to close by thanking all the innovators across our brands, regions and functions worldwide, as well as our partners who are creating these exciting product and service innovations that will continue to fuel our growth.","Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Thank you, Carl, and good morning, everyone. I will briefly review our fiscal 2014 first quarter results and then cover our expectations for the remainder of the year. My commentary on the financial results excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges.","As Fabrizio mentioned earlier, our sales for the first quarter were in line with our expectations. Net sales rose 5% to $2.68 billion. Excluding the impact of currency translations, sales grew 6%. Net earnings and earnings per share each decreased 3% to $301.6 million and $0.76, respectively. EPS was above the top end of our expectations, reflecting more favorable exchange rates and more disciplined management of cost.","Every region contributed to sales growth in the quarter. Sales in our Americas region increased 2%, in local currency, with low-single-digit growth in North America and strong double-digit growth in Latin America. The strongest performance in North America came from double-digit sales growth through online, as well as high-single digit increases at specialty multi-brand stores and our freestanding stores. Mid-tier department stores were challenged, but their online businesses grew strongly.","In the Europe, Middle East & Africa region, sales increased 7%, in local currency. We achieved double-digit sales gains in the U.K., Turkey and Switzerland, and our sales in the Travel Retail channel rose 9%. Among the more established markets in Western Europe, Germany and France rose mid- to high-single digits, while Liberia and Italy were essentially flat.","Our sales in the Asia Pacific region rose 11%, in local currency. Our business in virtually all markets grew, and we saw a particularly strong double-digit growth from Greater China. Distribution expansion continues in China, where we added 30 new doors in 5 new cities during the quarter. Retail sales growth remains strong at approximately 16% and like door growth was mid-single digit. Thailand, Japan and Australia were also contributors to growth, while Korea remains challenging, as sales there declined 5%.","Our gross margin increased 80 basis points to 79.7%, which largely reflected the impact of both positive mix and pricing. Operating expenses, as a percent of sales, grew 280 basis points to 62.8%. Advertising and marketing investment, primarily drove the increase, reflecting the planned support of major product launches.","Operating income fell 7% to $450.7 million and operating margin decreased 200 basis points to 16.9%. Net interest expense declined 15% to $13.5 million, primarily due to lower rates, and our effective tax rate was 30.8%.","During the quarter, we generated a $155 million improvement in cash flow from operating activities, primarily through improved working capital in receivables and payables. Inventory days to sell rose to 195 compared with 177 days last year. The higher inventory was due, in part, to the size of our new product launches, as well as an increase in safety stock to meet customer demand. We expect to reduce this inventory level throughout the second and third quarters, and we are working on finalizing a long-term plan to address further improvements in working capital.","We invested $86 million in capital projects to support new counters, technology and retail stores. We repurchased approximately 0.9 million shares of our stock for $59 million and used $70 million for dividends to stockholders. And we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents.","With the first quarter behind us, let's now turn to our outlook for the second quarter and for the full fiscal year. As we outlined last quarter, for the full fiscal year, we plan to grow at approximately double the rate of global prestige beauty, which is expected to rise between 3% and 4% this year. Our main growth drivers continue to be enhanced global and local innovations, some of which you heard from Carl this morning; accelerating growth of our small and medium-sized brands; expansion and growth in developing markets; and continued focus on skin care and makeup with a greater contribution from fragrance as we renew our commitment to the category.","Sales for fiscal 2014 are still expected to grow 6% to 8%, in constant currency. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 1% to 2%. Our estimate assumes weighted average exchange rates for the full year of 1.33 for the euro, 1.58 for the pound and 100 for the yen. The combined benefits of gross margin expansion and operating leverage are expected to drive operating margin expansion by 40 to 50 basis points for the full year.","Continued cost discipline allows us to invest for sustained growth and efficiency. This year, we plan to further strengthen our capabilities and consumer and shopper insights, innovation, retail stores, supply chain, human resources and information systems. We expect advertising, merchandising and sampling to remain fairly consistent, as a percent of sales, for the year, but we have flexibility to invest incrementally behind activities that demonstrate good momentum. We will invest more heavily in the first half since supporting both major skin care fragrance launch -- franchise launches at the beginning of the year, as well as new fragrance launches which distort more at holiday.","Our fiscal 2014 tax rate is planned at 30% to 32%.","With a good start to the year, we are comfortable raising the low end of our guidance for full year EPS to a range of $2.80 to $2.87, which effectively increases the midpoint of our expectations range.","Depending on the magnitude of exchange rate movements, the approximately 1% to 2% negative currency impact on our top line equates to about $0.07 of EPS.","As a reminder, the next wave of our SMI rollout is scheduled for July of 2014 and will include our North America Order to Cash process, our Travel Retail division, Japan and the Middle East markets, and represents approximately 18% of our sales. As has been the case in previous rollouts, we expect retailers will increase their orders in advance of the go live to mitigate any potential disruptions from the transition. The impact of this potential shift in orders will be to increase sales in our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and full year. We plan to provide an estimate of the shift as we get closer to the date and have a better indication of the needs of our retailers. The guidance we are giving today does not include any shift in these incremental sales and profits in fiscal 2014.","Regarding the second quarter. Our sales are expected to grow 3% to 5% in local currency. Translation could contract growth by approximately 1 percentage point. The support of major product launches, particularly in fragrance, should drive higher sales growth, as well as higher marketing investments. We anticipate that EPS will come in between $0.99 and $1.04.","There are a few items impacting comparability to the prior year quarter that you should keep in mind. You will recall that we also had an SMI shift last year and that some of our customers increased orders ahead of the SMI rollout last January. That resulted in a shift in sales from our third quarter to the second quarter of last year of $94 million or $78 million in operating income and $0.13 in EPS. Adjusting for this shift, our sales growth is expected to be between 6% to 8%, in local currency, for the quarter.","Last December, we recorded $21.3 million in other income related to the August 2007 sale of Rodan + Fields. This added approximately $0.04 to EPS in last year's second quarter.","And lastly, I want to remind you that the holiday selling period is shortened this year due to the late Thanksgiving.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just talk about -- it's not just an Est\u00e9e thing, it seems like, but if you look some of the NPD data, some of the mainstream brands, which obviously includes Est\u00e9e and Clinique, seem like they have slowed recently. And so, why do you think that's happening? Is there anything you can do to sort of accelerate your relative growth in that respect?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. In NPD, first of all, Bill, one clarification. NPD North America covers about 60% of our business. There is all the freestanding stores, the online, some specialty there, outside of this or this. Anyway, in NPD, there are some specific reason why that's happening. We say, we call it, heritage brands. And Lauder and Clinique where the initiatives that we supported have been very successful. But the base business, especially in July, August, was softer than we expected. And this was because the environment, first of all, there was low traffic in store, lower traffic in store than what we expected. As I said, improved dramatically in September. And second reason was that the environment was very promotional and our brands where, any moment, where their focus was on the innovation. So that was, clearly, not a competitive level of promotions during this period. Now we believe that our promotion, our competitiveness, during the holiday season will be dramatically improved. Our programs are much stronger, in this sense, however, we do not plan to increase promotions for the long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Fabrizio, can we talk a little bit more about fragrances? It sounds like that continues to be a major initiative for you guys. Could you just help us contextualize kind of the size and scope of the family fragrances that you have and maybe who you expect to kind of be some of the newer ones that could become the bigger ones? And just clarify, related to that, is that really kind of based on global point of distribution, is that how you're kind of thinking about it, because obviously, Jo Malone is going to be more prestige and premium than maybe even a Michael Kors. But just help us understand kind of how big some of these fragrance families could be.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, sure. I think we will grow our fragrances substantially in this year and the next few years. Our fragrance portfolio is, first of all, very strong and they're very high-end, meaning Jo Malone, Tom Ford, these fragrances are, first of all, is profitable business and is growing very fast, more than double-digit or more and is growing globally. For the moment, very strong in Europe and North America and with a lot of future potential also in Asia. The second group of our fragrances are the fragrances which are part of our cosmetic brands, namely Clinique and Lauder fragrances. In this portfolio, this year our most important launch in this part of the portfolio, our more important launch is Modern Muse of Est\u00e9e Lauder. We believe this is a very strong fragrance. Our test and our early acceptance in the market is outstanding, has been going #1 in Harrods and is already #10 in the U.S. after a few weeks of launch and continue progressing and climbing the ranking as I said. And we have also a pretty solid promotion level in fragrance, as I said, during the holiday season, including the Clinique brand. And then the third group of -- in our portfolio, the designer fragrance, like Michael Kors, Tory Burch, DKNY, et cetera. And this portfolio particularly includes 2 very strong and important new launches, 3 actually. One is Michael Kors, that I said has been very successful in the launch in the United States and this is why we will expand in Europe soon. Tory Burch, for the moment, is exclusive to Bloomingdale in the U.S. and is the #1 fragrance there. And Zegna, which is being a global brand, launched from the beginning where the super-high aesthetician are actually in Asia because of the high position of the Zegna brand, particularly in China. And we believe that these combinations of activity will drive our growth in fragrance. We will go back growing market share in fragrances. We will improve our retail -- travel retail business in fragrances, which was one of the key goals, which is very profitable. And each one of these new fragrances that will be launched will carry high profitability versus our historical fragrance profitable model.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I've got one follow-up question and one bigger question. I think you indicated that you think that your U.S. performance in department stores will be better in the December quarter than the September quarter because you're doing more, I guess, planned promotional activity. Could you just comment on whether that's the case? And then the other question is, you are guiding to margin expansion, operating margin expansion for the year. In -- which are the business segments that are going to lead that? In other words, will skin care be up the most and fragrance margins be down? Or where are we going to see the margin expansion for the year by business segment?","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. I'll take the first one, which is, yes, you understood correctly. We believe that our trend in October, December in department stores in term of market share will improve, and will improve, first of all, because our innovation and the investment behind our innovation that we did in July, September will have an impact and our innovative product will continue growing. And second, because we will invest behind the fragrance launches, which will hit the holiday season. And third, because our promotional competitiveness will be stronger. I also want to remind that 60% of the fragrance sales in the United States happen during the holiday season. That's why we are focusing our fragrance investment and promotions in that period this year, and we have expectation to make. In term of the -- what will drive profit margin, I'll let Tracey comment on that.","Tracey Thomas Travis","So we typically obviously don't guide by product category. So we do expect from a total portfolio standpoint to have the margin expansion. I would comment, though, on fragrances and remind you that we have a number of new fragrance launches this year, so it is a heavy, heavy investment year for fragrance. In light of those launches, which will continue to build not only in terms of the doors that we've launched them in, but we're also phasing the rollout of some of these fragrances so they will continue to build distribution as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to focus in on the organic sales growth in a couple of areas that seemed a little bit light to me versus my expectations. One is in travel retail. 9% looks like a decent headline number but not really when you contemplate the easy comparison and the lapping of the destock that hit the 2-year deceleration is pretty stark. So I was hoping you could help me understand maybe the drivers of that. And similarly, this is a rare quarter when your Americas like-for-like growth actually lags what was reportedly measured in NPD. Was there something anomalous about that as well?","Fabrizio Freda","So speaking about travel retail. Our retail in travel retail was 13% growth, and our net sales were 9% and this was also driven by time of launch of many initiatives like Advanced Night Repair and DDML. So our travel retail business is actually growing double-digit. And in fact, we forecast, we guide to continue driving double-digit in the next quarters and is very strong in this moment, as I said in my initial comment, particularly in Asia. On North America, I didn't completely understand the question.","Tracey Thomas Travis","It was the difference between our net sales and then the NPD growth, which obviously NPD does not measure all of our sales channels. But on the other thing that I would remind you of is a small amount, but in order to support some of the skin care fragrance launches that we had at the beginning of the quarter, we did ship in product at the end of June in order to support the July launches.","Operator","Your next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","My question is why you're so confident in the margin expansion in the back half, because it's going to require a really major recovery across the board or maybe it's not in fragrance, it sounds like fragrance may stay down for the year to support the launches. But you're expecting tough comps in this coming quarter because of the lack, I understand that completely, but what gives you such confidence that you can continue to grow 6 to 8 top line if you cut back A&M [ph] in the back half to be flat as a percent of sales for the year, which I think you had guided to last quarter?","Fabrizio Freda","The first thing I would like all of you to notice that anyway, we are delivering 2\/3 of our profit in the first 6 months. So in the second 6 months, we have an equal amount of sales and, historically, 1\/3 of our profit. So clearly, as Tracey commented on, we have the flexibility in the second quarter to invest and support our business and to deliver the profit growth that we want to deliver. And the way the quarters have been historically built, been very, very heavy in the first 6 months and lighter in term of profit in the second 6 months. This is also dependent by calendarization and by many other aspects. So we are calendarizing our initiative and our investments, I believe, in a more appropriate way this fiscal year. But most importantly, we are calendarized based on the consumer needs and the kind of innovation we have rather than just working on last year or previous years' comparisons. So all in all, we are confident in the overall fiscal year. We are confident that we can accelerate margin in the second 6 months of the year.","Tracey Thomas Travis","And the only thing that I would add to that is even though certainly we have some soft environments that we are managing in, EMEA and certainly North America, the fact that many of our very strong large innovation launches happened at the beginning of the year, we expect that those products will continue to build momentum throughout the year, which certainly should help the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Wu with Telsey Advisory.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","I just have a question for Carl. Can you perhaps talk about how you envision skin care innovation to evolve really over the next 5 years? Just given the demographic shifts with the aging baby boomers, as well as the new millennials as a new customer base. And also just given the changing consumer trends that you're seeing whether it's increasing use of beauty tools or sort of fusion products into other categories such as with CC creams?","Carl Haney","Sure. Our innovation is balanced and competitive in product development across all our categories, including skin care. And as I said, we use a number of types of innovation against that. And our future pipeline is even more robust, it's bigger and broader. We leverage -- launch leverage. We are locally relevant. We're focused on the specific segments of growth and we're creatively driven and consumer inspired. So that's a long-winded way to say that we've developed capabilities to target consumer opportunities in fast-growing segments. The aging consumer is a large and fast-growing opportunity and we've developed innovation pipelines against those targets. And I won't get into specific details on them, but we a have very robust pipeline against those consumer targets.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just I guess on fragrances. 2 things, Fabrizio, 1 is, how do you think about the incremental margin on the growth of the business going forward with a greater focus on fragrance as opposed to skin and makeup? And I get that the fragrances that you guys are launching are higher profitability fragrances, but I suspect still lower than the broader portfolio. And then secondly, obviously, mass is -- well, share the prestige in most categories more recently, probably less so in fragrance. Do you think going forward that prestige will source a big portion of its growth from mass over the next 6 to 12 months especially with your initiatives in fragrance?","Fabrizio Freda","So on profitability of fragrances. As I said, fragrances improved profitability in the last 5 years within the organization and within our company, and that was that one. Second, our new fragrance launches will have ongoing better profitability. Third, our portfolio is within fragrances as a mix, which is toward higher profitability fragrances like our high-end, like Jo Malone, which I already mentioned. And third, the growth on fragrances will allow us to leverage productivity and all the rest across the organization, across the entire Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, and this will be a positive factor. So that's why we believe that the growth of fragrance would be anyway creating value for us in the future. Said this, fragrance will remain a lower margin than skin care and makeup in our portfolio. You'll need to have one category which is less margin than the others anyway in any portfolio, and that's the reality of what we have. On your second question, which is the question on sourcing for mass, I would like to say, that's been our strategy now for 4 years, and this is probably the key idea behind our success in the last 4 years in term of accelerating growth is being that on top of competing for market share we deem prestige. We put ourselves as category builder, as the only company in cosmetic completely -- or big company in cosmetic completely focused on prestige and without any other mass business. And so, as great partners for our retailers, they want to build a category in prestige around the world. And with this strategy, we have been working in sourcing from mass in skin care and makeup. And as you have seen in the United States, we succeeded. And even in this last quarter, the prestige market in the United States, although softer than last year because as you've seen below 3.2% versus 7% last year, has been growing faster, decisively faster than mass. Now, we believe that this could happen also in fragrances in the future and this could be a trend that we will see also in the fragrance business. Although for the moment, in the fragrance business, this trend is being less remarkable that has been in skin care and in makeup.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just had a quick housekeeping and then a little more fragrances actually. And the housekeeping was about, Tracey, if you can help us quantify the impact of currencies. It seems like it's better than you anticipated and how much of that was driving your increasing EPS over the course of the years? Can you help us quantify that? And then -- and I do want just a little bit more on fragrances because the pushback I'm getting from some investors is that is this the best ROI that Est\u00e9e Lauder can find? So why don't we go into more tier 3, tier 4 cities in China for the same money, or more e-commerce or, in fact buying back more stock than investing in fragrances. So it feels like folks are thinking, well, maybe they're stretching a little bit into margin dilutive areas to grow, and what's your response to that. And also kind of in that context talk a little bit more if you could about the dividend raise, which seems a little bit lower than it's been in the past and how that should make us think about the priority we give to that versus M&A or other uses of cash?","Fabrizio Freda","So I'll take the fragrance part and Tracey will cover all the others and then comment also on the fragrance part the way she thinks. On fragrances, I want just to remind you that the role of having a strong fragrance business is not only about the value creation and margin creation. It's also in certain parts of the world, the fragrance are such a big part of the business that in order to create the critical mass of the company, that then will absorb all the reds, being able to serve retailers and cover the market appropriately. In absence of a strong fragrance business, this is going to be very costly and skin care and makeup can be much less profitable because of this. Example of this are many European markets, example of this is Latin America and there are many other example in Asia. Then second point is, fragrances are attracting new consumers to counters in many cases. So for example, on our Est\u00e9e Lauder Clinique brands, a strong fragrance business is also a source of customers for the counters. And then these people buy also skin care and makeup, and so it's the driver. So fragrance can be profitable, can be value creating and can be an enhancer of critical mass of the company and finally, of building or bringing new consumers to our brands and sell our entire portfolio. So they're an integral part of our strategy even if skin care in China in the long-term may create more value, still there is space for a strong fragrance business in our portfolio, but never detracting priority level from skin care and makeup, however. Tracey?","Tracey Thomas Travis","Regarding currency, as we have taken up the midpoint of our range, a small portion of that certainly is related to the improved outlook in currency. As I had mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did initially expect that currency would impact us by about 2% from a top line standpoint. We now expect that it would impact us negatively 1% to 2%. The euro is doing slightly better. Others are doing slightly worse, and we certainly saw that in the first quarter from a netting standpoint. So from a full year standpoint, there could be a $0.07 differential in EPS. But our decision to take up our guidance is somewhat related to currency, but the other is to be in the first quarter related to performance as well. In terms of dividends, you asked about that and our increase in the dividend. We look at, along with the board every year, distribution to shareholders, and the mix of distribution to shareholders between dividends and share repurchases. And what we were comfortable with, given our plans this year, is very similar to prior years in that the free cash flow that we deliver this year is almost 100% delivered to shareholders and in the mix of share repurchases and dividends. So through discussions and analysis and prudent planning with the board, this is the mix of distribution that we've decided is appropriate for us as a company this year. But it is a heavy focus of us -- of ours in terms of distributing back to shareholders what excess cash. We still, obviously, have a pretty very strong balance sheet, both from a debt capacity standpoint and from a cash standpoint. So we believe that any acquisitions that we might be considering, we can certainly fund with our balance sheet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Follow up on the travel retail question. Is it your sense that you are gaining share in travel retail, and maybe if you could specify if you think it's travel retail globally or are you gaining share in Asia travel retail or maybe not in Europe. So if you could clarify that? And then the second question, Tracey, just a follow-up on the inventory days, 195 seems really, really big to me. And I would've thought that I know you've got a big whatever holiday planned with fragrance, but at the same time, I would've thought you have already done a lot of that ship in. So had you anticipated 195, because it just seems like that number is getting higher and higher on -- and that maybe as you bring that down or work through that excess inventory, there's going to be a negative margin impact?","Fabrizio Freda","So in travel retail, we are definitely building market share and we are building strongly the market share. The market share build is very strong in Asia, a little bit in Europe and we are now building in this moment market share in the U.S. part of travel retail. That's the split. And we are actually accelerating the market share buildup in the Asia part of the business.","Tracey Thomas Travis","And in terms of the inventory days, you may recall that we did carry higher levels of inventory post the group 3 go live for SMI, as we had some stock issues that we were working through. So we ended the year higher. I would say that we were not expecting quite as high a level in the first quarter as we had. But the inventory is current, and so it is certainly salable throughout the second and the third quarters, as I mentioned. We never were relaunching new products or launching new products, in the case of our fragrances. We want to make sure, depending on what the sell-through is, that we have enough inventory. So that will provide some level of variability to our inventory levels when we have big launches like what we had in the quarter. But we have, to your point, shipped some holiday and are certainly shipping more as we speak.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm curious about your thoughts of using gift repurchase for this holiday season, sort of just broadly how you're thinking about that and then more specifically, is that amount could be higher or lower this year versus, call it, a year ago level?","Fabrizio Freda","So we have -- as I said, we have a group promotional activity in the holiday season, which is not only gift repurchases, it's also relative to all the fragrance activity that happen there. And we believe we have a competitive gift repurchase program in the period of October, December. However, in the quarter where we just closed, the July, September, as I said, we were actually declining if we purchased versus the past. We were continuing our program, and that's one of the reason I was saying we were not competitively promotional in that quarter. In term of our program, we plan to improve our gift repurchase quality and activities in the future to make sure they work better and better with the consumers. And we are working with it. We have seen this and already in September, we have seen, for example, a very, very strong gift repurchase activity on the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, it was particularly successful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just first one point of clarification on advertising spend, you mentioned it would be up for the December quarter. Can you just say in terms of absolutely or as a percentage of sales that you expect it up because correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that there's quite a bit already in the base. And then on the inventory levels, obviously higher from your standpoint, but how does your inventory levels, how do your inventory level at retail look?","Tracey Thomas Travis","So our advertising is -- for the second quarter is deleveraging about 40 basis points as a percent of sales. So that's the increase in the spend in the second quarter, the advertising promotion and marketing. And in terms of our stock-in-trade, it really varies around the world. But in general, I don't think we have a situation where we have lots of -- an abnormal amount of stock in any area of trade.","Operator","Your final question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Quick, 2 things. One would just if you could comment on Russia, because there's no mention of that made last quarter, but perhaps it was starting to stabilize. I just curious on trends there. And then the second thing was just longer-term on hair care. No, I won't keep asking about fragrance in the strategic importance. I think within prestige beauty, it should actually be pretty clear. I think hair care, given both the margin structure and hair care size in global prestige beauty is actually been more interesting long-term strategic question. So could you talk a little bit about how do you think that evolves over time and sort of the near-term kind of returns in profitability goals for hair care, because I noticed a lot of advertising on TV this quarter for Aveda and you mentioned specifically in the release that Bumble had some new specialty distributions?","Fabrizio Freda","So on Russia -- Russia as, I said, is stabilizing and is stabilizing because we read some parts of the retail was going well. Anyway, we have stabilized the relationship with the retailers that was not going well and because we have started an aggressive distribution change in Russia with more freestanding stores of the brand that carry freestanding stores and good online business. So it's a mix of stabilization and diversification of our distribution that is giving to us more confidence about us being able to go back in the future years to grow our business in Russia. In term of hair care, we are having a very successful moment in hair care. Aveda has a huge momentum. Aveda is growing momentum with salons, which remains the critical and key channel for Aveda in the United States and in other countries of the globe. And Invati is driving the success in Aveda freestanding store, and importantly in Aveda salons. And we -- yes, you're right, you're seeing advertising on Aveda on Invati, which is basically our activity to drive and support the best innovation and build on strengths and drive initiative where we see that is an enormous consumer traction and consumer reaction. And also, we continue Aveda expansion around the world and most important in the travel retail channel where particularly in Asia, we are seeing great traction for the brands, which has a very positive impact also on profitability.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Fabrice Weber, President, Asia\/Pacific. Fabrice will give a strategic overview of this fast-growing region.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Except when noted, our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges. You can find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website.","And I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we continue to constantly steer our strategy on a successful course through varying market conditions. This resulted in solid sales growth at the high end of our -- of the range we provided.","Sales grew 7% in local currency, while diluted earnings per share were better than we anticipated. Around the world, prestige beauty continues to grow but at a slower pace than a year ago. While this reflects the reality of the markets, our brands and high-quality products are winning with consumers, thanks to our diverse portfolio that gives us a presence in a full range of prestige channels. With effective advertising that promotes our outstanding innovations, we pull consumers to our counters, and then generate sales with High-Touch personal service.","In the recent quarter, all 3 of our geographic regions contributed to our highest sales, despite some soft market and specific challenges. Sales in all of our major category also rose. Continuing a recent pattern, the fastest brand growth came from the high end of our prestige portfolio. The affluent consumer is spending freely for a product she desires. As a result, our luxury brands including Jo Malone, Tom Ford and La Mer are striving, each up more than 20%. We believe these brands have terrific growth potential, and we plan to continue to invest in them over the next several years, so they become more formidable players in the beauty landscape.","Our emerging markets continued to deliver the most rapid growth. Sales rose 24% in the quarter, and they accounted for 40% of our total business. In China, our largest emerging market, our retail sales climbed 28%, enabling us to gain market share. We continue to push into new cities and add counters for our brands and also increase our advertising on TV in advance of the Chinese New Year. We foresee further expansion opportunities into smaller cities in China for several years to come.","Other emerging markets showing strong local currency sales growth included South Africa, Turkey, the Middle East and Brazil. And many of our brands in those countries gained share, thanks in part to their success in being locally relevant. Our brands continuously seek to reach new consumers, and one way is being -- expanding geographically. M-A-C, for instance, is deepening its presence in Sub-Saharan Africa. It recently began selling in Zambia, Nigeria and Botswana.","In Russia, ongoing distribution challenges continue to impact our 2 largest brands, yet our luxury and makeup artist brands are growing very fast and resonating with consumers. To compensate for the overall soft results, we are working to accelerate our innovation, marketing and online opportunities.","Turning to our established markets. We enjoyed a solid sales increase in North America as prestige beauty growth continued to outperform mass brands. In the past, our performance in our core market was largely dependent on our biggest brand. But this quarter, it was also due to healthy sales for several of our smaller and midsized brands, especially luxury and specialty ones. For example, gains in Bobbi Brown stemmed from successful products and special events.","From a distribution perspective, in North America, our fastest-growing channels were e-commerce and special [indiscernible]. Sales of our products in prestige department store outpaced mid-tier ones. Our North America results were positive despite the impact of the Hurricane Sandy tragedy, which affected a large portion of the Eastern U.S.","Several challenging markets in Europe, particularly Spain, Italy and Greece, impacted our overall results in the region. Still, our sales rose high single digits, as compelling advertising attracted consumers to our counters for the latest launches and other best-selling products. As a result, we gained share in several well-established countries. In France, our brands grew faster than competitors in the key skin care and makeup categories. In the U.K. retail sales were healthy, led by e-commerce, Jo Malone and M-A-C.","We are proud that our Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer brands won the prestigious Marie Claire Prix d'Excellence award that honored the most innovative products of the year for the Revitalizing Supreme Anti-Aging Creme and The Moisturizing Soft Cream, respectively.","Our total business in Asia\/Pacific expanded nicely, driven by double-digit gains in skin care. This region posted the best sales growth this quarter. However, Korea remained a difficult market where sales declined. But we are aggressively working to remedy the situation. Fabrice will elaborate on our Asian business in a few minutes.","During the quarter, employees across our regions prepared for the next wave of our Strategic Modernization Initiative in advance of the January 7 launch. The latest implementation occurred in China, Hong Kong and France, among others markets. It also involved several business processes. I'm very proud of the dedication of our SMI teams and the strength of our organization. The preparation went smoothly and the go live was a success.","As more continued countries and function [ph] starts using SAP, the overall initiative should unleash further efficiencies and thereby, cost savings in the coming years, particularly in cost of goods, indirect procurement and advertising and promotional spending.","Currently, approximately 75% of our company sales are SMI-enabled, and we continue to gain better visibility into all facets of our business. Leveraging our SMI capabilities is a major priority to create further value and enhance our growth.","Looking at our categories. Innovations continue to drive the growth of skin care. Globally, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand focus on skin care continues reaping benefits, with skin care sales up 14%, driven by new products, strong core businesses and continued robust demand in China. La Mer global sales rose an outstanding 25%.","In the United States, our skin care sales grew solidly, and we gained share after adjusting for facial cleansing devices, demonstrating our strengths in this category. Our brands held 17 of the top 20 prestige skin care SKUs in the quarter as measured by NPD.","Our makeup business grew on the strengths of our makeup artist brands. M-A-C opened 42 new doors globally, including a flagship on Fifth Avenue, which has surpassed its Times Square store for the highest average unit sales in New York City. Bobbi Brown sales increased double digits globally. And we expect Katie Holmes, its new celebrity spokesperson, will continue to increase brand awareness and sales. Smashbox also had strong double-digit gains, fueled by more than 200 new doors opening globally. We are aggressively expanding the brand distribution, confident that it has strong global appeal and fantastic potential, particularly with young consumers.","Our luxury brands drove our fragrance business. Jo Malone and Tom Ford generated strong double-digit sales due to organic growth, successful launches and new distribution. Contributing incremental sales this quarter was the introduction of Coach Love, which initially rolled out in Coach boutiques.","In hair care, Aveda Invati line, which was launched about a year ago remains a success. Aveda used TV for the first time beginning in September to promote the franchise, and the investment paid off. A 3-product Invati set was popular for the holidays.","Looking ahead, using our successful launch-and-leverage approach to major product introductions, we have additional Invati product planned, and Aveda intends to run TV commercials in the U.K. in the second half of fiscal 2013.","Our brands grew online and our e-commerce business continues its double-digit advance again this quarter. Cyber Monday was our biggest day ever for online sales in the U.S., up 17% over previous years. Holiday sales from our brand size grew much faster than overall online sales in the U.S., and retailer sites gained as well.","We continue to develop our important mobile commerce business, and we were encouraged that in our home market, our m-commerce sales more than doubled. We were also extremely pleased that the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand earned the top ranking in a recent Digital IQ Index for the China beauty market by L2, a leading research group that explores digital innovation. The study measures the digital competency of 20 global beauty brands based on websites, digital marketing, social medias and mobile. It said that Est\u00e9e Lauder brand has established itself as a digital leader in China.","Our retail sales in the travel channel continued to climb double digits, driven by a surge in China. The destocking issue we had been experiencing primarily in Asia\/Pacific and Americas slowed towards the end of the quarter. Our travel retail net sales rose high single digits, exceeding the growth of air passenger traffic, which remained strong. Our sales were up sharply in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, driven by emerging market travelers. Clinique in particular benefited from a new campaign featuring products from its Even Better franchise.","To support innovation and key brands, we increased our advertising, merchandising and sampling by approximately $75 million, with a large portion spent in some of our biggest markets to capture the most promising opportunities.","In China, advertising on TV is helping us to attract thousands of new middle-class Chinese consumers, who come to our counters when they start buying their first prestige beauty products. Clinique's TV campaign behind the launch of Even Better Clinical in China helped fit -- lift the brand sales there more than 30% at retail in the quarter.","We have many exciting developments across our brands coming in the third quarter, including M-A-C's newest flagship that will open this month on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris. The store in high-traffic shopping destination popular with tourists should fully express the brand and build further awareness.","In terms of anticipating the products and drawing on our strategy of being locally relevant, M-A-C is introducing a makeup collection for Chinese consumer called the Year of the Snake to coincide with the country's New Year's celebration. And 2 brands are extending best-selling franchises. Est\u00e9e Lauder recently launched a new eye serum as part of its Advanced Night Repair line, and Origins is adding an antiaging cream to its Plantscription collection. Both products should generate further interest in the brands.","Additionally, our Aramis and Designer Fragrance division has a busy season planned with the launch of Marni and Zegna Essenza collection and the further rollout of Coach Love.","On January 1, we introduced an enhanced organization structure to recognize our top executives, expand senior leadership positions and prepare us for future growth by providing [indiscernible] resources for growing brands. We believe these strategic changes will strengthen our company and provide additional development and career opportunities for current and future leaders.","Our dynamic organization is constantly evolving. And to be competitive, we must be agile. Our people and our brands are our greatest assets. By realigning responsibility, we believe we'll continue to leverage the company's amazing strengths across our world-class brands and more of our most talented leaders. This organizational design should enable us to be more locally relevant, better focused on global opportunities and strongly positioned for sustainable profitable growth.","This year, we are rebalancing our marketing spending. In the second and third quarters, we led the biggest increases. In the past few years, the highest amount of incremental investment occurred in the fourth quarter. The different cadence this year is skewed to the launch dates of innovations and determine the best times to invest in growing markets and support our business in soft markets.","The combination of the advertising rebalancing, the SAP shift and the changing dynamic of global markets makes it very difficult to read trends by quarter. More than ever, we encourage you to focus on our full year performance.","For fiscal 2013, we expect the macroeconomic climates to be mixed with continued growth in many countries, such as United States and China. But challenges will remain in several international markets, including Southern Europe and Korea. We expect recent trends in the demand for global prestige beauty to continue and our company growth to exceed the industry once again.","For this reason, we reaffirm our top line local currency growth of between 6% and 7% for the full fiscal year. And at the same time, we are raising our full year earnings per share forecast to between $2.51 and $2.59.","Now I will turn the call over to Fabrice, who will discuss our Asia strategy.","Fabrice Weber","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I have worked in the beauty business for over 25 years and joined the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies 12 years ago. For the last 6 years, I have led the Asia\/Pacific region and previously served as President of our Aramis and Designer Fragrances division and oversaw our travel retail business.","Our company began selling products in Asia\/Pacific in the early '60s. And soon thereafter, we opened our first affiliates in Australia, Japan and Hong Kong. Today, we sell in 13 countries and our brands have a presence in travel retail locations in 24 markets. The region is very wide geographically and extremely diverse in terms of cultures, ethnic groups, consumer expectation, skin types and beauty regimes and routines.","Asia\/Pacific closed fiscal '12 with net sales of $2 billion and achieved compound annual growth of more than 15% over the last 5 years. In Asia\/Pacific, we estimated we are the leading prestige beauty company in our distribution, and the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is the #1 brand in each distribution after several years of significant growth. We currently sell 20 of our brands in the region, although not all are sold in every country, so we still have expansion opportunities.","Our travel retail business in Asia\/Pacific has also grown significantly in recent years, and today comprises over 50% of our global travel retail sales. Due to the high demand for skin care products in this part of the world, the category represents 62% of our region's total sales, twice that of makeup. Fragrance comprises 5% of sales and hair care, 2%.","Distribution formats vary across markets, but 86% of our sales are to department stores. We have been rapidly expanding into beauty specialty stores and freestanding store formats in most countries over the last few years, and e-commerce is the fastest-growing distribution channel.","Let me now say a few words about 3 of our largest countries in the region, namely Korea, Japan and China. Korea has the most prestige-centric beauty markets among the large countries of the world, with prestige representing nearly half of total beauty.","Prestige beauty is nearly exclusively sold in department store. And historically, our company has a leading position, with 24% share in our distribution at the end of fiscal '12. Korean prestige beauty has experienced a sharp reversal during the last year as consumers have been cautious with their discretionary spending due in part to excessive mortgage debt. This has had a significant impact on prestige beauty, with a noticeable trend of young consumers trading down.","However, Korea remains a critical focus for us, as Koreans are passionate about high-performance beauty products, luxury brands and the quest for flawless skin, making this market a driver of innovation and product competitiveness. In this challenging climate, we're investing in innovation and focusing our in-store execution on High-Touch experience. We are cautiously optimistic that Korea will stabilize or rebound as it has done before following periods of uncertainty.","In Japan, the beauty business remains challenging. And in fiscal 2012, prestige beauty is estimated to have grown only marginally in our distribution. Fiscal year-to-date, prestige beauty remains relatively soft, although we are encouraged by our recent performance, with growth across most of our brands and share gains in our distribution in the last few months.","Japan remains a strong strategic focus for our company because we believe that the country will remain the largest worldwide for prestige skin care and makeup combined 10 years from now. It is also home to the most educated and discerning skin care consumers, leading to innovation in product performance, services and package design. We have the largest share among foreign prestige beauty companies, although Japan remains dominated by local brands with significantly wider distribution. However, a credible network of prestige beauty specialty retailers is developing in high-traffic train station and malls, offering younger consumers open-sale shopping with assisted sales service. We are very encouraged by this recent development as it will help strengthen our ability to recruit new consumers.","We created our own affiliate in China slightly over 10 years ago, although we have been a presence in the market since the mid '90s with the Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique brands. We now sell 14 brands in China and have over 3,000 local employees. China today represents about 30% of the region's business, and has grown an average 33% annually over the past 3 years.","The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is the largest prestige brand in China in its distribution. And our combined portfolio had a 26% share in fiscal 2012, an increase of 340 basis points from fiscal 2009 according to external sources.","Beyond the expansion of our brand portfolio in China, we are increasingly capturing consumers eagerness for prestige beauty brands and services across new distribution channels like Sephora, freestanding store and e- and m-commerce. Online capability spans about 350 cities. And both this geographic reach and our online sales are expanding rapidly.","Since fiscal 2009, we have doubled the number of Chinese cities where we have a brick-and-mortar presence, from 33 then to 66 cities to date. This has come from department stores, the fast-expanding Sephora distribution and increasingly, our own freestanding stores. In fiscal 2012, our growth in China was 8% inorganic, like-door sales, while an additional 16% was contributed by distribution expansion.","Large numbers of emerging consumers are entering the prestige category in secondary and tertiary cities, while consumers in tier 1 and mature tier-2 cities migrate increasingly towards buying online and when they travel. Traveling Chinese consumers will remain a strong source of growth for our business across Asia, in many other high-street destinations around Europe and North America, as well as throughout our global retail -- travel retail network.","In the second quarter, our retail business in China remained healthy, with like-door growth of 6% and total growth of 28%, including distribution and expansion. This performance also reflects increased TV advertising behind key franchises for Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique as part of the company's commitment to continuously invest in important growing markets.","The Este\u00e9 Lauder Companies is focused on winning with consumers in the Asian markets. Skin care and face products command the lion's share of prestige beauty consumption, with an estimated 80% of the prestige beauty sales in the region. This is clearly a priority and one of our strengths. Our significant capabilities in product development and blue sky innovation, particularly at our R&D centers in Tokyo and Shanghai, are focusing on creating more products in these segments, with a strong emphasis on local consumer relevance backed by increased investments in consumer insights.","Although we started long ago offering Asian consumers specific products that meet their unique beauty regime expectations, like brightening and spot correcting solutions, we have reinforced this commitment by significantly increasing the depth of our Asia-centric product assortment across all our brands.","As an example, in fiscal 2012, 20% of the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand's Asian sales came from franchises developed for the region, such as Nutritious and Cyber White. And more recently, we went a step further by creating a locally researched and produced premium skin care brand, Osiao, which was launched in Hong Kong this fall.","The predominance of our demonstration-led distribution model in the region offers us another strong opportunity, namely to leverage our expertise in High-Touch and in-store experience especially against mass competitors.","Asian consumers have taken the lead in adopting the digital space to actively engage in social media and beauty blogging, as well as buying online. We are currently the leading beauty company in terms of the number of marketing, e-commerce and mobile sites across Asia. Also, our brands are actively connecting with consumers via Facebook and Twitter and also on local social media sites.","Over the last few years, we've greatly expanded our regional capabilities. And we believe our proficiency in R&D, product development, consumer insights, High-Touch service and retail expertise positions us well to capture a greater share of future growth. We're focused on our biggest opportunities, with a clear priority on pursuing various prestige channels of distribution, emerging middle class consumers, geographic expansion to mid-tier cities, locally relevant innovation and new ways of connecting with younger consumers.","We also remain focused on hiring and retaining regional and local talent, and we want to become the employer of choice in Asia\/Pacific. We believe the focus on talent is critical to succeed in this highly promising part of the world, just as much as we have historically done in our home market.","Our strategy in Asia\/Pacific closely mirrors the company's priorities. So by winning in critical, high-growth areas, we will help the company achieve its financial goals. Asia\/Pacific's particular focus on skin care innovations, China, emerging market consumers, travel retail and fast-growing channels will benefit some of the most critical, global, overarching strategic goals.","Over the long term, we believe we are optimally positioned and well prepared to continue to fully capture the massive growth in demand forecasted in this part of the world for prestige beauty products. With rapidly growing emerging markets expected to drive extraordinary growth in Asia, coupled with our strong leadership team and strategic vision, we expect to win across consumer segments, geographies, brands and categories.","Thank you. And now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Thank you, Fabrice, and good morning, everyone. As a quick reminder, my commentary on the quarter results and the outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year excludes restructuring and other charges.","As Fabrizio mentioned, we delivered sales growth during the second quarter at the high end of our expectations. Reported net sales were $2.93 billion, a 7% increase over the prior year period. The effect of foreign currency on total net sales versus the prior year was de minimis in the quarter. Net earnings increased 14% to $457 million compared with $401.1 million in the prior year quarter and diluted EPS was $1.16. Our EPS was higher than our previous expectations, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange impact on EPS, a higher-than-anticipated SAP order shift into the quarter and a nonrecurring gain associated with the settlement of the remaining terms related to the 2007 sale of Rodan + Fields, one of our product brands at that time.","As we anticipated, some retailers accelerated their orders into our second quarter that otherwise would have occurred in our third quarter, in advance of the January launch of our third wave of the rollout of SAP, which is part of our overall Strategic Modernization Initiative, as you're well aware. The impact of this shift in this year's second quarter was an additional $94 million in sales and $78 million in operating income, equal to approximately $0.13 per share. The prior year second quarter also included an SAP impact and reflected a pull forward of $30 million in sales and $23 million in operating income with the same quarterly timing effect on the third quarter.","Excluding the SAP-related order shifts in both this year and last year, local currency sales would have grown 5% in the second quarter and the related EPS would have also grown 5%. Please refer to the schedule included in today's press release for more details of these shifts by both region and product category.","Sales of skin care products rose a robust 10% in local currency, and we generated strong growth in every region. New product launches from Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and La Mer, in addition to continued strength in our core franchise skin care products, supported this category growth.","In makeup, local currency sales rose 7%, driven by solid growth from our makeup artist brands, as well as new and existing products at Clinique.","Our fragrance business rose 5% in local currency. Double-digit growth in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region drove the overall increase with new product launches and expanded distribution of our higher-end fragrance brands.","In hair care, sales rose 9% in local currency, as Aveda benefited from the continued success of both the new products that Fabrizio mentioned earlier, as well as expanded distribution.","Regarding our geographic performance in the quarter. Sales in our Americas region increased 6% in local currency. And within the Americas, the United States rose 6%, while Canada and Latin America each grew double digit.","From a channel perspective, our North American sales to department stores grew mid-single digits. Online sales and multi-brand specialty stores rose strong double digits. Salons and spas grew in line with the overall region and our own stores grew low-single digits.","In the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, sales increased 7% in local currency. We achieved double-digit increases in France, Switzerland, the Nordic region and several developing markets. This growth was partially offset by continued economic difficulties, primarily in Spain, Italy and Greece, as we've mentioned previously, as well as continued declines in Russia.","Our travel retail net sales rose 9%, as trade destocking in the channel began to subside and retail sales growth rose to solid double digits in the channel, driven in part by passenger traffic increasing within the quarter.","Our Asia\/Pacific region sales was 9% in local currency. Fabrice just shared with you some of the highlights of this region. But during the quarter, China grew sharply, driven by accelerating same-store sales growth and new distribution.","During the quarter, our brands added 17 doors and entered 2 new cities in China. Our business rose double digits in Hong Kong, while Japan growth accelerated to mid-single digits. We continue to experience weakness in Korea, as challenging economic conditions impacted sales across most of our brands.","Our gross margin increased 80 basis points to 80.7%. The increase came primarily from 40 basis points related to favorable pricing and 40 basis points related to manufacturing variances, favorable mix and other items. The gross margin also reflects savings of $10 million from our cost-reduction programs.","Operating expenses were flat in the quarter as a percent of sales, primarily as a planned increase in advertising, merchandising and sampling expense of 100 basis points was offset by a decrease in general and administrative costs and the impact of an out-of-period adjustment of 70 basis points combined.","Foreign currency transactions were 30 basis points favorable in the quarter. And our cost-savings initiatives reduced expenses by $16 million in the quarter.","Operating expenses rose 11% to $667.7 million, and operating margin rose 80 basis points to 22.8%. We realized total savings of $26 million in the quarter from our cost-savings programs and still expect to save $50 million to $75 million for the full year.","In December, we recognized $21.3 million in other income, which effectively represents the sale of our contingent interest from the 2007 disposition of the Rodan + Fields brand. This was not included in our original guidance for the quarter.","We recorded $14.6 million or $0.02 per share in restructuring and other charges during the quarter, as we identified and finalized new activity under the program. The restructuring program closed as of December 31, 2012. For the full fiscal year, we now expect to record charges of approximately $25 million.","For the 6 months, net cash flows generated by operating activity increased 7% to $655 million compared to $610 million last year. We invested $205 million in capital expenditures, $327 million to repurchase approximately 6 million shares of our stock and paid our shareholders $280 million in dividends, which was $76 million higher than the prior year. As we have previously mentioned, we transitioned to quarterly dividends beginning with the current third quarter.","Days sales outstanding increased to 47 days compared to 45 days at the end of the second quarter last year. Inventory days to sell rose to 163 days compared to 148 days last year. The planned increase reflects the inventory that was anticipated to maintain service levels in advance of the SMI go live in January. And that concludes my remarks regarding our second quarter and year-to-date results.","As we turn to our outlook for the balance of the year, we do expect to experience continued market weakness in certain Western European countries and Korea. However, this should be more than compensated by the strong sales growth we are experiencing in other markets.","For the year, we continue to forecast local currency sales growth of 6% to 7%. We now estimate a negative currency translation impact of about 1% on our full year sales growth. Our estimate assumes weighted average exchange rates for the full rates for of 1.28 for the euro, 1.59 for the pound and 84 for the yen.","The benefits that we will continue to experience from pricing, cost savings and operating leverage are expected to drive operating margin performance improvement of approximately 70 to 90 basis points for the year. Therefore, we are raising the full year non-GAAP EPS forecast to reflect the nonrecurring gain related to the Rodan + Fields settlement. We now expect EPS will come in between $2.51 and $2.59, equal to growth of 11% to 14% versus last year. Our EPS range excludes the charge of $0.03 related to the repurchase of debt, as well as $0.04 for restructuring charges.","For the year, we continue to expect to generate more than $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations. We still estimate our effective tax rate will be between 31% and 33%.","With the impact of our order shift, the third quarter sales growth is forecasted at 3% to 4% in local currency. The foreign currency translation impact on this sales growth is expected to be minimal. We anticipate EPS for the third quarter to be between $0.28 and $0.32.","As a reminder, this third quarter sales growth comparison is affected by the SAP-related pull forward of $94 million in orders that we spoke about earlier into the second quarter this year, and of $30 million in orders with the same timing last year. These shifts are expected to reduce normal third quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points. EPS for the current year quarter will be impacted by $0.13 due to this year's sales shift versus a $0.04 impact in last year's third quarter.","We recognize that these shifts related to both EPS as well as the cadence -- SAP as well as the cadence of our quarterly advertising spending this year make year-over-year quarterly financial comparisons difficult. We believe our full year outlook in terms of both sales and EPS growth is a better reflection of the overall trends of our business.","And that concludes my prepared remarks on the quarter and the guidance for the balance of the year. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Our first question today comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two questions. First, travel retail destocking. I'm encouraged by what you guys said about it abating throughout the quarter. Do you think that's at an end?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. We see it abating in the quarter. I think that soon retail sales and net sales will get aligned again. That's our expectation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one housekeeping was I think Fabrice said that China was 30% of Asia. I was curious if that includes travel retailers, such as -- as reported China number. My real question was more about launch activity. And I know that the strongest growth was coming from the ultra premium brands of the super high luxury. But is innovating and spending more money on those brands versus on Est\u00e9e and Clinique, is that less impactful overall? Because the halo effect of a hit product in Tom Ford is going to be smaller than the halo effect of having a big winner in Clinique or Est\u00e9e brand.","Fabrizio Freda","I'll first answer the second question and let Fabrice answer then the first question. No, we will continue to focus on Est\u00e9e Lauder brand and Clinique as much as we can. We have a fantastic innovation program for both brands in the future 3 years, which is leveraging our compass analysis, meaning the areas of fastest growth in the world and leveraging our best technologies. So there is no -- in no way our investment in building Tom Ford, Jo Malone, La Mer to the next level will dilute our focus on Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. Fabrice?","Fabrice Weber","Yes. Lauren, the 30% was actually excluding travel retail. We were talking China domestic sales only.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Fabrizio, I was hoping you could give us a review of your market share performance in the U.S. during the holiday season. It looks like some of the share gains from the last couple of years dissipated a bit based on some of the market data. So wanted to get your thoughts around holiday performance and also what you're expecting in the back half of the year from a market share standpoint in the U.S.","Fabrizio Freda","Sure. So first of all, our -- if you look at the calendar year '12, we continue to grow market share in skin care in a very solid way, and that's been our main focus. Obviously, you need to exclude devices from the way the market is reported by NPD because it's like putting electronic brushes in the toothpaste market. So looking at skin care, we are growing skin care, and that will remain our focus. Looking at makeup, we are also growing in makeup very solidly. Because, again, in the market number you see, they're not included all our online business and all our freestanding store that represents a big and fast-growing part of our M-A-C, particularly, business. So we are very satisfied with makeup. And we continue to grow skin care and makeup in the future and to grow market share. Yet a positive aspect is that the prestige in general is growing faster than mass, so we'll continue to grow market share versus mass, meaning market share to the total market. On our fragrance business, we had a tougher year in term of market share. This was in part designed because we had focused on improving the model and profitability of the sector and also reduced the promotional level in a very big way in order to improve profitability. This is particularly tough in the October-December quarter because as you probably know, the October-December quarter is the quarter of the year in the U.S. where fragrances are the biggest part of the market. While in the other 9 months of the year, skin care and makeup are much bigger proportion of total cosmetics. So yes, growing market share without a strong fragrance innovation program and eye promotion in October-December is tougher, and we have experienced that. But in next fiscal year, we have an outstanding fragrance program and we plan to come back with a more important ability to grow fragrance as well on the new better profitable way.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The first question for Fabrice. Can you give us a sense, the 6% like-door growth you saw in China, is that the right run rate for the business, do you think? Because I know it's been a little bit weaker than that over the last couple of quarters but maybe that's just China specific and macro-related. So was 6% a good run rate for us to forecast? And then, I guess a question for Tracey. The guidance for the third quarter, I think everybody assumes, is pretty conservative. But if we take you at your guidance, that implies, I think, like 10% or 11% organic growth or like-door growth or whatever, local currency growth in the fourth quarter, which seems high given the tough comp. So are there a particularly strong number of new products launching in the fourth quarter that's going to make that quarter so good?","Fabrice Weber","Wendy, let me first remind you that the 6% like-for-like growth in Q2 comes after 2% in Q1. We certainly expect to see on average the like-for-like sales remains single-digit range. And the rule [ph] that the growth is clearly expected to come from new consumers in new cities across the country, that's simply the reflection of the fact that the mature cities in China, tier 1, if you want, actually are very close in terms of consumption per capita with what you see in neighboring countries, like Korea, which are very developed in terms of beauty industry. So consumers are also, in those markets, starting to shift towards e-commerce and the travel consumption as we have noted before.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. On the total business, I just want to say that we believe the number is absolutely our goal in the last quarter, and is doable. First of all, in the last quarter, we have a easier base period last year because our 2 biggest problem, which are Korea and Russia, were already in the numbers at the point in time of the year. Second, because we have a very strong initiative program and great new launches on our main brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique in the period. And third, again, the increased advertising spending that would also continue in the third quarter, we believe, will impact strongly the last quarter of the year, where in the past, we were increasing advertising also in the last quarter. There would be also further impact in the first quarter of the year after. I don't know, Tracey, if you want to add.","Tracey Thomas Travis","No, that's it. Your assumption is correct, Wendy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Guys, I had a question related to the pull forwards in a couple parts. First is just to get a sense on the level of confidence you have in kind of estimates for the pull forwards. Because it's often underestimated, it seems, and I'm trying to understand whether that's actually bad or could that actually be interpreted as good? And in fact, if your level of confidence is high -- but I do want to go back to this share question, the 5% underlying top line growth. Because actually they'd be at best maintaining share, but likely losing share globally versus your peers. And I'm trying to get a sense of whether that's a shift in luxury competition or a shift between mass and prestige growth rates. And then the second related part to this pull forwards is -- and Tracey, you mentioned this, there's the chart that is at the back. I think it's like the fifth from the back of the table that talks about the company's top line and EPS, excluding returns and charges and as well SAP adjustments. It was in -- it's in this quarter. It wasn't in the last quarter. It was in the quarter before. And this quarter it says, \"Look, 5% EPS growth is what we believe the underlying growth is.\" A couple of quarters ago, it was 0. And absolutely get it that you're not a quarter-by-quarter company. I totally get that. But I'm trying to understand when that actually normalizes. So when should we expect that to be at a normalized run rate going forward? So lots of stuff in there, but if you could help on any of those that would be helpful.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Okay. I -- that was definitely more than one question. But let me take the pull forward questions and -- because we certainly can appreciate, as we said earlier, that it can get a bit confusing, especially since this is the second year in this quarter that we've had this phenomena. So as it relates to the pull forward and the pull forward actually being more than what we had originally anticipated, so it was indeed above the high end of our range. That actually is a good thing, I think, especially since, as Fabrizio said, the SAP go live thus far has gone quite smoothly. So the fact that our customers were willing to take advance orders from us and we were able to get those shipments out, I think is certainly a good thing. It speaks to the relationship that we have with our customers both -- and many of those orders actually were in Fabrice's region, in the Asia\/Pacific region, some in Europe and then some here in the U.S. So I think that was a good thing. And the fact that the SAP go live went well, we are now bringing down the inventory levels related to some of the extra inventory that didn't get shipped out in the quarter that certainly will be shipped out over the next few months. We do have another go live next year, so -- unfortunately, it won't be as big as this year's go live in terms of advance shipments. But it is the last major wave for us of SAP, what we call release 4. So you will see this phenomena one more year. The normalized, as we mentioned, is really the full year. So looking at the second and third quarter is very difficult. And again, we can appreciate that. The full year, I think, gives you a better indication of the normal growth rate of the company, and the same will be true next year as we have this phenomena again this -- next year.","Fabrizio Freda","And I would just -- to add one point as Tracey said, normal is the full year, which is 6% to 7%. And we estimate the global market to be in this moment about 3% because there are many markets which are actually declining. To be very clear, France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal and Germany have been on a declining trend and Korea as well as we explained. So yes, we believe the global market in this moment is at 3%. We are growing at 6% to 7%. So we are definitely continuing to grow share.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","My question is can you update us on the outlook for your ad ratio for the whole year and your selling ratio? Will those ratios be up, flat or I assume not down for the year?","Tracey Thomas Travis","We don't have that information handy and we typically don't speak to that information. So if there's another question that we can answer for you as it relates to advertising, we're more than happy to. I'm not sure if -- the base of your question is related to the shift in the advertising spend that we've had, which follows a different cadence of innovation and promotions this year. But we typically don't...","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Well, I'm trying to smooth out that shift and see if your advertising ratio is actually going to be up for the year overall. And if your -- maybe you could talk longer term, if your idea is to generally increase your advertising ratio and more than offset that with your perhaps stability improvements?","Tracey Thomas Travis","Okay. So our advertising spend will be up this year, and I think we had communicated that that was the intent at the beginning of the year. What has changed this year slightly is just the timing, the double-digit increase in the second and third quarter that we're having in advertising spend which will not be -- which will be more normalized, again, when you see our full year results in terms of advertising spending. But it will be up this year for sure.","Fabrizio Freda","And I will -- just to add that as we said several times in the last years, we are doing a lot of work to eliminate cost, we do not add value in the company, and to reinvest custodies [ph] in improving our advertising and our ability to influence the consumer. And on top of what we're doing this year, we are focusing this advertising spending on the biggest growth opportunity in the world, namely some categories in the U.S., China, mainly growth in emerging markets. And building share in some of the important soft markets around the world like France, where the market is declining, we are growing 8%. And so that's what we're doing. And so the answer is yes, we are going to keep investing in absolute, more in advertising as we take other cost out of the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just following up on that last question there. So the investment levels are going up. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint? So on an absolute basis, spending is higher. Do you think that you're increasing your share of voice in the category at the same rate maybe as you were before? Or are we seeing a bigger increase from your competitors? And then one housekeeping adjustment. Tracey, I believe you mentioned something about an out-of-period adjustment in the SG&A for the quarter. Was that material? Or can you give us just a little bit of color on that.","Fabrizio Freda","So first of all, we believe we are increasing our global share of voice on average in [indiscernible] with the market. But there are some of our competitors which are also increasing their spending. And so the competition is pretty tough, particularly in the big, growing markets. So this increase of advertising spending is essential. However, I want to verify [ph] that independently from share of voice. The real important thing that we see in the business is just the ability to spend because this is bringing new consumers and transfer [ph] people from us to prestige, and in turn is what is behind the growth of the entire prestige sector in the main markets we operate in. So share of voice is not necessarily the key measure of the success of advertising that we're using in this field. Tracey?","Tracey Thomas Travis","And the out-of-period adjustment, we've had a few this quarter obviously, Rodan + Fields. But the one that you're referring to was related to an accounting adjustment, and it was about $0.02 in EPS.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just want to try to squeeze in 2 questions here. I think you said you were going to spent $80 million of incremental advertising in the quarter originally. And then I think in the prepared comments, you said that advertising is up 100 basis points. So that's $30 million. I just want to make sure that's correct and maybe why you decided to push some of them forward, if my math is right. And then just on a housekeeping item, just the sales growth x SAP for Clinique and Este\u00e9 Lauder brands in the quarter?","Fabrizio Freda","I'll take the first one. So the -- no, we said we spent $75 million advertising extra in the second quarter. So not $80 million at the end but $75 million. So your math on the $30 million is wrong. I don't know where this came from, but happy to reconcile it later with Dennis.","Tracey Thomas Travis","And while we don't disclose specifically Clinique and Este\u00e9 Lauder, in the press release, we do show adjusted growth numbers by category i.e. skin care, makeup, et cetera, excluding the impact of SAP. We also show it by region. So I will refer you to that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","If I heard you correctly, you said that the restructuring program closed on December 31. So could you give us what the total cost in savings of the program were and how much they exceeded the going in expectations? And also what the benefit of the savings you've gotten out of that program, how they will affect 2014?","Tracey Thomas Travis","So we will still incur some restructuring charges in the balance of the year. I called out in the guidance that -- what the third quarter impact would be and then the full year will be $25 million. So we only incurred a portion of what we had identified in the second quarter in the financial results for the second quarter. The total restructuring charges under the now closed program will end up somewhere between $325 million and $350 million. So that is consistent with what we have discussed previously. And our restructuring savings related to that program are still in the area of $7.60 million to $7.85 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a clarification and then another question. So the clarification is can you talk about what China's growth was? I think the numbers you cited, maybe you said retail, maybe I got that wrong. But what was China's growth x the SAP adjustment? And I mean, selling not necessarily retail takeaway. And then can you just talk about some of the Western European markets? Obviously, there have been pockets of weakness there. Can you talk about the cadence there? Are those pockets of weakness getting weaker, getting stronger, have they stabilized? And then have the places that have been more resilient in Western Europe, have you seen any deterioration there at all? Or are they staying strong?","Fabrice Weber","I'll just take the China net sales growth. You're right, that I was actually referring to retail sales. So taken as net, the actual growth is 23.6% and this is adjusted excluding the SMI impact.","Fabrizio Freda","In term of the -- sorry, what was -- the second question was about European markets?","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Talk about how they've progressed. Like, the weak markets, have they stabilized? And then the markets that have been more resilient on an x SAP basis, have they remained resilient? Or are you starting to see some of those markets get a little bit weaker as you move through?","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. So in term of the markets that -- I need to divide into 3 blocks. So the Southern European market, the European market, the markets are definitely getting weaker. The markets in the October-December has been negative. Many markets, France, Italy, Germany, Greece, et cetera. And so the markets -- we have been growing in most of these markets with the exception of Spain and Greece. And so we are gaining market share. Now the best example is France, which has been a market on the negative in total, where we've been going 8% basically based on Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique great successful trend and our smaller brands successful trend. So we are doing well. The key idea here is that we seems to be able to grow and progress also in soft market and not only in strong markets. Now the exception to the story is Russia, where the market is strong, and we are not doing well because of distribution issues. And we are -- we believe we have a plan to come back and restart positive trends in the next fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Would love to just think about the dynamics going on in China with online and the potential for that to be much, much bigger than it is in other parts of the world. I'm trying to understand the margin impact. Is it purely positive? Is there any expense in building that out that makes the margin anything less than stellar? And also, just to understand if same-door sales are negative in the first tier and some second-tier cities, what the impact of -- on returns and margins is from that? And finally do you have any sense of how many consumers you're reaching in China?","Fabrizio Freda","There's a lot of questions. I will give you, first of all, the -- start with online and let Fabrice answer the rest of the question. So our online sales in our own sites in China is growing and is an important asset to penetrate more than 300 cities, as Fabrice explained in his prepared remarks. And we believe this has a strong future. We'll continue to grow. But to be clear, we are strong, growing fast, but it's the beginning of the journey. It's still a relatively small part of our sales in China at this point. Fabrice?","Fabrice Weber","Yes, I just like to add that we are already 6 brands that in China are active with our own e-commerce sites. This is e without m. We are actually working on launching m as well. But the point that Fabrizio made is correct. We have seen a very, very active expansion of the demand to the channel. Regarding your point about the tier 1 negative retail growth, we actually have a fair amount of brands with positive retail trends in tier-1 cities. So I don't think we should go that far in terms of cataloging tier 1 as a declining market. It's just not growing as fast as the rest of the country. Because basically, as I said before, it has reached levels of maturity, which are very close to neighboring countries. So that's expected. In terms of the audience we reach, I can maybe share with you the fact that through our CRM activities and our willingness to create loyalty and work harder at retaining consumers in a market where they're still educating themselves very, very rapidly but still educating themselves in the industry, we think that annually, we're looking at 7 million to 8 million women and a few men, we hope, buying our products across the country in the domestic context. Remember that we sell probably twice as much to Chinese people outside of China in terms of value, certainly.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Your last question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm still trying to reconcile the fourth quarter guidance. What gives you confidence that increased ad spend can drive that kind of acceleration on the top line? And then maybe sort of related to that, what are your expectations for category growth? Is there something underlying that in terms of an anticipated acceleration? Or do you anticipate still at the low end of that 3% to 4% for the year?","Fabrizio Freda","As I said is yes, as the increased advertising spend in the third quarter, it should happen in the fourth quarter. But it's also the fact that we have a very strong initiative program in the fourth quarter on our core brands and on all our brands. And because the fourth quarter, some of our softer markets started being soft actually in that quarter a year ago. So we have easier base on this one to beat. And finally, we know there are some markets which are started recovering, and we see an accelerated growth that we are also planning to exploit at best. Tracey, you want to add anything?","Tracey Thomas Travis","No, other than category, without giving specific information, I mean, the -- what is driving the bulk of that growth from a category standpoint and giving us confidence to Fabrizio's point is skin care and actually, fragrance. So we talked about some of the strength of our fragrance launch performance, as well as some of the newer products that are continuing to expand and grow with Jo Malone and Tom Ford. So those 2 from a growth standpoint are driving a good chunk of the growth in the fourth quarter.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Karen Buglisi, Group President of our M-A-C brand. Karen will discuss the evolution of M-A-C and its future opportunities. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Except when noted, our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges. You can find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone. Before we discuss the quarter, I want to acknowledge how terrific it is to be sitting here and holding this call on schedule beyond the difficult situation in the New York area this week. I am proud of the dedication of our employees who have enabled it to take place. I also appreciate all of you, taking the time to hear our discussion, where you may have more pressing matters. I hope you and your families are well and safe.","Now I want to officially welcome our new Chief Financial Officer, Tracey Travis, to her first Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies conference call. Tracey will review the quarter financials in a few minutes. I am pleased to report that our fiscal '13 first quarter sales in local currency were on target with our expectation, while diluted earnings per share came in slightly better than we anticipated.","Sales grew 6%, a solid performance, following a 14% sales gain in last year's first quarter and worse than expected market challenges in Western Europe and Korea. Sales rose solidly in each of the 3 biggest brands and increased in our top 5 markets and emerging markets in general.","In China, our third largest market, sales were again exceptionally strong, even against a tough comparison to last year. Additionally, our North America department store business continued to thrive, thanks to well-received product launches, effective advertising programs and excellent personalized service.","Many of our brands and channels that have been growing rapidly in recent quarters maintained their momentum. Our luxury brands, including La Mer, Jo Malone and Tom Ford, continued strong double-digit growth, as did channels that tend to attract young consumers, mainly online and North America specialty retail.","On reported sales -- our reported sales rose 3%, which was higher than we forecasted because currency movements were not as negative as we had expected. EPS rose 12% to $0.79, demonstrating how our winning business model leverages our sales growth into even greater profitability.","We are encouraged that fiscal 2013 is off to a healthy start and our strategy continues to be successful every season. By focusing investment in the fastest-growing opportunities across our diverse brands, categories and geographies, we are able to increase sales even when faced with pockets of weakness and lower consumer spending.","This quarter, we achieved share gains in several emerging markets including China, Turkey and in Brazil. Many of our brands gained share in established markets, including some in Western Europe. Since we have a lot of activity going on around the world, let me provide further details on our business by region.","This quarter, our strongest sales growth came from the Americas, led by the United States, where our business was buoyant. U.S. prestige beauty continued to outperform mass during this quarter by 4 percentage points. La Mer increased its ranking to become the fourth largest prestige skin care brand on the strength of its new moisturizing soft cream, which is expected to be its biggest launch and account for a sizable amount of its global sales the first year.","Our company's brands now represents 3 of the top 4 prestige skin care brands in the United States. We stepped up our commitment to the Canadian retailers about a year ago, and our combined efforts paid off with a high-single digit sales growth. Higher sales in Latin America were led by Brazil due to our initiatives to further establish our prestige presence.","All told, we did well in Asia Pacific, but the region showed a sharp divide, with business rising in some markets, sliding in others. In China, our sales climbed 32%, primarily from reaching new consumers through expansion into Tier 2 and 3 cities. As we said in our last call, more of our growth will come from broadening our geographic presence. We took our brands into 6 new cities, bringing the total to 64, and opened 78 counters. We expect the new consumers to also purchase our products in airport shops in international destination when they travel.","We were pleased to see modest growth in Japan, driven by success in foundations, which comprise a large portion of the makeup category and leverage our skin care technology. Our biggest challenge in the region was Korea, which we cited as problematic in our August call. In Korea, prestige beauty has been hit hard by inroads from local mass brand and weak retail environment, and our sales declined sharply there. These conditions also negatively impacted our travel retail business in that country.","While our sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa region improved overall, markets in Western Europe and the travel retail channel were weaker than we had expected and affected our results. That said, we still grew in certain key markets such as U.K. or Germany, backed by the strengths of our innovation and focus on local relevance, as well as strategic brand expansion. We also saw continued success in the Middle East, South Africa and Turkey.","Sales in our travel retail channel increased, but at a slower rate than in recent quarters. Retail sales of our products in the channel rose nearly 11%, more than twice the 4.5% gain in passenger traffic. But our net sales growth was constrained by select retailer destocking and the weakness in Korea, which is our second largest country in terms of sales in travel retail. We expect retail sales to continue at the current base throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.","Our online business again grew strong double digits, fueled by new e- and m-commerce sites and solid growth from our brand and retailer sites, particularly in the European region. Our strategy is focused on channels with the best growth potential, in keeping with our brand equity and we expanded accordingly.","M-A-C and Clinique, for example, were our first brands to begin e- and m-commerce in Spain, as Smashbox entered Boots pharmacies in the U.K. Also, Aveda opened a shop in the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport, its first foray in the travel retail channel in North America, with an eye on further expansion. Est\u00e9e Lauder began a 24-store test in Sephora in North America, and Bobbi Brown opened a temporary pop-up store in New York City Grand Central terminal, which has been very successful.","Each of our product categories rose in constant currency, but we were especially pleased with our success in hair care. Driving the growth was Aveda Invati collection for thinning hair, as well as greater salon distribution globally. Aveda began advertising Invati on TV and saw a quick response through its retail and online channels.","Bumble and bumble sales increased as it expanded its specialty store distribution into 30 Boots doors in the UK. It's also growing in Sephora in the U.S. and we expect this retailer for us to bring great awareness to the brand and help drive also consumers to salons.","Skin care, a key focus of our strategy, grew solidly as we continue to excel in creativity and innovation. Clinique North America skin care sales rose 10%, driven by the launch of Even Better eyes. Est\u00e9e Lauder's latest Perfectionist serum was a hit and the brand continues seeing strong skin care growth in Asia. La Mer has been enjoying strong growth in Asia, and this quarter, its U.S. sales also rose significantly, more than 25% on the strength of its new moisturizing soft cream.","Many brands have put an increased focus on makeup with good results, especially Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. We also launched the first makeup line for AERIN, in upscale doors in North America and the U.K. The luxury beauty brand has created -- was created by Aerin Lauder, and it's receiving great media attention. Smashbox grew double-digit as it is expanding internationally, and is an excellent addition to our portfolio. Also, within makeup, M-A-C enjoyed solid global growth and did well in the U.S. and in emerging markets. A standout was the Middle East, where it created lipstick shades for consumers there, another terrific example of our commitment to local relevance. Karen will describe M-A-C and its business more fully in a few minutes.","In fragrance, local sales were essentially flat. On a positive note, Jo Malone and Tom Ford, our high-end brands, continue to do well, but they were offset by lower promotional sales from Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. This year, our hair retardant [ph] Designer Fragrances are continuing to improve their business model. Starting in fiscal year '14, we expect to resume greater fragrance launch activity for existing brands and new ones, such as Tory Burch and also Zegna, which will give us the opportunity to expand in the growing men's fragrance business.","Fueling our global growth was an increasing advertising spending at the end of fiscal '12. We continue to increase our magazine advertising globally and accelerate our TV and digital ads. TV has become an extremely effective way to promote products and bring consumers to our counters. Some brands, like Aveda, have just started using the medium, while the others, it's now part of their overall media campaigns. Clinique for instance, ran commercials in numerous countries in the quarter for several products.","For the remainder of the fiscal 2013, we will continue to pursue the most promising opportunities on a regional and local level, drilling down to appeal to groups of consumers with specific tastes and customs. These opportunities will likely be in the high-growth areas driving prestige beauty that we defined in our 10-year compass. Digital, specialty retailing, emerging market, traveling consumers and locally relevant innovation.","There are many exciting developments underway in our second quarter, including the recent launch of our newest brand, Osiao, in Asia. This skin care brand, developed over 5 years in our Shanghai skin Institute, illustrates our deep commitment to Asia and China in particular. And Osiao shows how we develop products closest to our most demanding consumers. The brand debuted a few weeks ago in 2 Lane Crawford stores in Hong Kong, and we expect to launch it in China in the future.","Heading into the holiday season, we feel positive about the programs and promotion our brands will offer, which target consumers from the value conscious to the high end. Aveda will begin selling in 15 Nordstrom doors later this month, which marks its first entry into North America specialty department stores. We expect the Nordstrom test will refer consumers to Aveda's large and important network of salons. Aveda remains deeply committed to ongoing success in the salon channel, and strengthening its presence within it.","Zegna, one of our newest fragrance brands, will announce a major launch later this month and Marni, another new design fragrance brand is expected to roll out in February. Currently, we are preparing for the next phase of our Strategic Modernization Initiative, which is planned to take place in January. It will affect 10 business units in markets including China, France and Hong Kong. We anticipate a large shift of orders into the second quarter from the third, by retailers to avoid potential business disruptions.","To date, all of our SMI implementations have gone relatively smoothly. We operate in more than 150 countries and territories worldwide, and at any given time, there will be ups and downs, a situation that we see today. This year, we expect to see continuing strong demand for prestige beauty in the U.S. and China, offset by weak markets in Korea and certain European countries. We believe the global prestige beauty will climb about 3% this year, and we expect to grow at twice that rate, or 6% to 7%.","At this time, we are also raising the lower end of our diluted EPS range for fiscal year 2013.","Throughout our history, we have demonstrated our ability to manage successfully through various economic environments and use the opportunity to strengthen or expand our business. Our Board of Directors continues to show its confidence in our strategy and our strong fundamentals.","This morning, we announced we are raising our annual dividends by 37%, to $0.72 per share. We also said that beginning in calendar year 2013, we will transition to paying dividends quarterly instead of annually, deliver value to stockholders throughout the year.","In addition, the board increased our share repurchase authorization by 40 million shares. The fourth year of our winning long-term strategy is successfully underway, and we are confident in our ability to achieve our goals. I want to thank our strong organization and our valued employees for their ability to drive the business and react quickly, even in soft economies, while continuing to build long-term capabilities. Finally, I want to note that all our employees are safe following the recent storm and our facilities were not damaged. We hope to resume normal business operations shortly and appreciate the efforts of our employees during the past few days under difficult circumstances. At this time, we are in the process of estimating the impact of the storm on our business and we'll know more in the weeks to come. But we don't expect it to be material. Now I will turn the call over to Karen, to tell you what's in store for M-A-C.","Karen Buglisi","Well, thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I started in the beauty industry more than 20 years ago and joined M-A-C in 1998 when Est\u00e9e Lauder took full [indiscernible]. In 2010, I was honored to become the brand's global President.","M-A-C was founded in 1984 in Toronto as a professional makeup brand. Staying true to our makeup artistry and fashion heritage has enabled us to agree [ph] great success and enhanced brand equity. And we are proud to say that M-A-C is #1 in prestige makeup in many countries, such as the U.S., U.K., Canada and Mexico, as well as in emerging markets like Brazil, the Middle East and India.","M-A-C is the third biggest brand in Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' portfolio and one of the most profitable. Which is impressive when you consider that about 95% of our business is done in just makeup. Our strength in this category is even more pronounced given that we trade in less than 2,000 doors in just over 80 countries and territories globally, compared with many of our competitors that are in at least 3x as many doors. This speaks to the fact that M-A-C's economic model is based on highly productive doors.","Over the last 10 years, M-A-C has quadrupled global sales and profits. Our largest region is North America, where M-A-C is the second largest brand in the company, growing at an average annual rate of 12% over the past 10 years. By staying true to our brand credo, All Ages, All Races, All Sexes, we have as many consumers under 25 as over 45 years old, and we have plenty of consumers in every age in between, and over 40% of our consumers are non-Caucasian.","Since this is a more established market, we grow by recruiting new consumers into prestige beauty through limited traditional advertising like print and outdoor, in tandem with disruptive digital content as well as through enhancing our unparalleled High-Touch in-store experience.","Currently, M-A-C's international business makes up just over half of our sales, up from 23% 10 years ago. Its average annual growth rate of 25% over the past decade was driven largely by the U.K. and continental Europe. International will continue to be M-A-C's growth engine, led by these markets and a growing emphasis on emerging markets, Asia and travel retail.","One of our most important emerging markets is Brazil, where we launched in 2002. M-A-C was the trailblazer there and continues to be the leader in prestige makeup. However, over 97% of the market is in mass and masstige, so our growth potential lies in continuing to convert customers to prestige, as well as capturing the growing middle-class and traveling consumer.","There are often no high-end department stores in emerging markets like Brazil and India, but M-A-C has been able to introduce the brand like through our stand-alone stores, an important point of differentiation for many of our competitors. Freestanding stores allow the truest expression of the brand, and M-A-C's retail concept is proven, productive and profitable.","Currently, we operate about 300 freestanding stores globally, which represent almost a quarter of our business. Freestanding stores bring greater brand awareness and with street locations, mall locations and flagship stores like Times Square in New York, which is now our #1 door globally. We are opening our second flagship store in New York City on Fifth Avenue this month, and a third is planned to open on Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris next February during Fashion Week.","Another point of differentiation is our High-Touch makeup service model. M-A-C artists are our #1 customers and active brand ambassadors. We employ over 10,000 artists globally, giving our artists a career with M-A-C, which leads to higher loyalty and lower turnover. We have the largest number of most highly skilled makeup artists in the world working for us, which allows us to provide advanced artistry and expertise to our consumers. We will continue to prioritize artist recruitment, retention and development to maintain and enhance our superb service offerings.","Another aspect of our unique business model lies in our constant innovation. We launch something new, a product color story collaboration or regionally relevant collection every week, making newness our advertising and promotion. This pulls in consumers looking for something new and fresh, and provides ample content for buzz building, where it amounts support for the brand.","Despite all this activity, only about 15% of our sales come from new launches, although over 75% of our total global editorial coverage is on new collections and collaborations. Much of this coverage is in digital media. M-A-C already has a strong digital and social media presence, and the brand received the highest digital ranking in beauty from L2 last year.","We are the #1 cosmetic brand on Facebook with 4 million fans, and Facebook is the third biggest driver of traffic to our e-commerce site. We are also the #1 subscribed luxury brand on YouTube with over 6 million video views. We have over 270,000 followers on Twitter through our M-A-C brand handle and senior artist, and our tumblr site is constantly updated with makeup looks from the 850 global fashion shows we support every year.","For us, social media is the evolution of the word-of-mouth advertising that's built this brand, and we plan to continue fostering these online communities through engaging content and consumer participation programs. This fiscal year, we are expanding our 11 global e-commerce sites with 5 more, and plan to launch in Belgium, in Spain, in Italy, Poland and Turkey, as well as introduce local sites in all e-commerce markets.","Lastly, the heart and soul of M-A-C is the M-A-C AIDS Fund and Viva Glam. The M-A-C AIDS Fund was established in 1994 to support men, women and children living with HIV and AIDS, and is financed by the sale of Viva Glam products around the world. 100% of the sales of these products is donated to the fund, and since its inception, over $270 million has been raised, which makes M-A-C the biggest corporate donor for HIV and AIDS in the U.S.","Viva Glam has also proven to be a powerful loyalty driver for M-A-C artists, M-A-C consumers and I can say the M-A-C President. I'm happy to announce the M-A-C AIDS Fund Board of Directors approved today our Hurricane Sandy relief fund of $500,000.","We have come a long way from our humble beginnings 28 years ago, and we are committed to sustaining our leadership in prestige makeup category and driving our growth by fostering our core markets, expanding internationally with a focus on Asia, emerging markets and travel retail, growing our freestanding store distribution and retailing expertise, expanding aggressively our e- and m-commerce business, evolving our High-Touch artistry experience, launching innovative and regionally relevant products and leveraging our fashion heritage and visual expertise. And given the brand's relatively high profit margins, M-A-C's future success will also benefit the entire corporation. Thank you. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As a quick reminder, my commentary on the quarter and the outlook excludes restructuring and other charges, which is consistent with the way we have reported results in prior quarters.","As Fabrizio noted in his remarks, we delivered sales in the quarter in line with our expectations while managing increasingly challenging economic environments in some of the markets where we operate, and while anniversary-ing strong sales growth results in our prior-year quarter.","In local currency, net sales rose 6% with all regions and product categories contributing to growth. Net earnings for the quarter increased 11% to $312.1 million compared with $281.5 million in the prior year, and diluted EPS came in above the top end of our expectations at $0.79.","Sales of skin care products rose 7% in local currency, and we generated growth in all of our regions. New product launches from Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and La Mer, combined with continued strength in China, helped the category grow this quarter on top of the 20% local currency growth we experienced in the prior-year quarter.","In makeup, local currency sales rose 6%. Results were driven by solid gains primarily from new and existing products at Clinique and M-A-C.","Our fragrance business rose very slightly in local currency. Double-digit growth from our luxury brands was offset by lower promotional sales from Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. In hair care, sales rose 12% in local currency. Aveda benefited from the success of the new Invati product line and other product launches. All 3 of our hair care brands expanded distribution, including Aveda and Bumble and bumble, adding new salon customers to their network.","Geographically in the quarter, sales in our Americas region increased 8% in local currency. Within the Americas, the United States, Latin America and Canada each rose 8%.","From a channel perspective, our North American sales to department stores and in our own freestanding retail stores grew 6%, while sales in multibrand beauty stores, online and salons rose double-digit.","In Latin America, sales in Brazil grew 25% driven by the strength of the M-A-C sales and expansion that Karen just shared with you. In the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, sales increased 2% in local currency. Our travel retail sales, which are represented within the EMEA region also grew by 2%, as double-digit retail sales growth in the channel was mostly offset by trade destocking as well as challenging business conditions in the Korea travel retail channel.","Several Western European countries, including the U.K., Germany and Austria grew mid-single digit while Turkey, the Middle East, South Africa and our Nordic markets all grew double digit. This growth was partially offset by continued softness in other parts of Europe, primarily Spain, France and Greece.","Our business in Russia also remained difficult in the quarter. However, our comparison should begin to ease next quarter as we anniversary the deceleration of shipments in Russia that began last year. Switzerland also remains weak, as the relative strength of the Swiss franc compared to the Euro, encourages some cross-border shopping.","Asia Pacific region sales rose 7% in local currency. China grew sharply, primarily from the expansion of brands, doors and new cities. Our business was also strong in Thailand and Hong Kong, and we were pleased that Japan was up 2%.","We experienced weakness across all channels of distribution in Korea, as challenging economic conditions impacted retail sales and some consumers traded down to lower-priced local brands.","Our gross margin increased 50 basis points to 78.9%. The increase came from favorable mix and pricing of 90 basis points and favorable currency of 10 basis points, partially offset by a foreign transactional tax provision, manufacturing variances and obsolescence of 60 basis points. We leveraged operating expenses in the quarter as they declined 90 basis points as a percent of sales to 60%, primarily due to a 70-basis-point drop in general and administrative cost, and a 40-basis-point drop from favorable currency.","Both marketing and selling costs were lower by 20 basis points each, and our previously discussed cost savings initiatives reduced expenses by $17 million in the quarter. These improvements were partially offset by higher stock-based compensation cost and higher IT investments of 30 basis points each.","Operating income rose 11% to $482.4 million, and operating margin rose 140 basis points to 18.9%. In August, we issued $500 million of long-term senior notes at very favorable rates. In September, we used $230 million of the proceeds to redeem 7 3\/4% senior notes that were due next year. Net interest expense was essentially flat in the quarter.","We recorded a pretax expense on the extinguishment of debt of $19.1 million, equal to $0.03 per share. Charges associated with restructuring were negligible in the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.3%. We used $125 million of operating cash flow this quarter, which is typically when we are seasonally constrained by working capital requirements ahead of the peak selling holiday season.","Days sales outstanding increased to 57 days compared to 50 days at the end of the quarter last year due to the timing of collections. Inventory days to sell rose to 177 compared with 163 days last year. This inventory level has been adjusted for approximately 18 days of promotional material such as samples and testers, whose costs flow through operating expenses rather than cost of goods. The increase in inventory reflects the anticipated inventory support to support near-term sales growth as well as additional inventory to maintain service levels in advance of the SMI Go Live in January.","For the year, we expect inventory days to remain in line with fiscal 2012 at approximately 165 days post-SMI implementation.","We spent $96 million for capital projects this quarter, as we continue to invest in counters, information technology and retail stores. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares of our stock for $165 million, and this morning, we announced that our Board of Directors has increased our buyback authorization by 40 million shares, which brings our total outstanding authorization remaining to purchase to 52 million shares.","We are overall pleased with our first quarter results. I would like to now share with you our outlook for the second quarter and for the fiscal year.","As we have stated previously, our stated goal is to grow our top line at least 1% faster than the growth in global prestige beauty, which we believe will be 3% in fiscal 2013. Our full year sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 7% in local currency, or double the prestige beauty rate, including approximately 2 percentage points from pricing.","Based on current exchange rates and the forecasted strengthening of the dollar over the course of our fiscal year, we now anticipate a negative currency translation impact of about 2 percentage points on our full year sales growth. Our estimate includes weighted average rates of $1 25 for the euro, $1 55 for the pound and $0.80 for the yen. Our cost savings initiatives are expected to save between $50 million and $55 million for the full year.","We will continue to increase investment in advertising, merchandising and sampling efforts, as well as to build capabilities within our organization to enable our strategic initiatives. That said, we continue to expect operating margin expansion of about 70 to 90 basis points for the full year. Our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate is estimated at 31% to 33%. We are raising the low end of our guidance for fiscal 2013 and now expect diluted EPS to be between $2.47 and $2.56, an increase of between 9% and 13% compared to prior year. Excluding a $0.06 impact of foreign exchange, our EPS is expected to increase by a strong 11% to 15%. Both of these EPS ranges exclude the onetime charge of $0.03 related to the repurchase of debt, as well as $0.01 for restructuring charges.","For the fiscal year, we expect to record restructuring charges of approximately $5 million, equal to the $0.01 per share.","Our second quarter sales are planned to grow 6% to 7% in local currency. Currency translation could negatively impact our reported growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points. As part of our SMI program, we plan to go live with SAP at our next wave of affiliates in January, and as a result, we expect retailers will advance some of their orders into our second quarter. While the timing is consistent with last year, we expect the potential shift in orders to be much higher, ranging from $70 million to $90 million versus the $30 million we experienced last year.","Additionally, we are increasing our marketing investments in the second quarter in support of both our launch calendar and to support our strong existing products in certain markets. Our cost savings initiatives are expected to generate $15 million to $20 million in savings for the second quarter, and EPS for the quarter is estimated to come in between $0.97 and $1.03, which includes a negative currency effect of approximately $0.02.","As Fabrizio mentioned, I want to note that our current expectations do not take into account the possible impact of this week's storm that passed through the New York metropolitan area. Thankfully, and mindful of the considerable damage experienced in the region and with the tremendous commitment of our employees to resume normal business operations, none of our facilities have experienced property damage and despite some power disruption, we do not, at this time, anticipate the impact to be material on our business results.","And that concludes my prepared remarks on the quarter and the guidance for the balance of the year. Before I turn the call back to the operator, let me say that I am pleased to join the Est\u00e9e Lauder call this morning as we report our fiscal 2013 first quarter results. I've been warmly welcomed by the organization and I'm proud to join a team that has built both an outstanding portfolio of brands and has demonstrated its ability to leverage opportunity and create significant value for its stockholders and its customers. I do look forward to continuing to build on the strong efforts of the team by working closely with Fabrizio, the entire leadership team and my finance and other teams to focus our resources to support the strategic growth initiatives that have been developed, take a fresh look at our Strategic Modernization Initiative, SMI program and the next potential areas of profit-enhancing initiatives, and partner with the brands and the supply chain group on inventory optimization and the disciplines necessary to accelerate further cash flow generation and further margin improvement.","And in addition to Fabrizio's acknowledgment of the extraordinary events and efforts that occurred this week, I would like to particularly thank the finance and investor relations teams for their commitment this week to reporting results this morning, as many of them were personally impacted by Hurricane Sandy.","And that does officially include or conclude my prepared remarks. At this point in the call, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator, can you assist us with that?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So just want to dig a little bit in, now that we have Karen on the call this morning on M-A-C and some of the opportunities for M-A-C. Could you just talk a little bit more about Brazil and dot-com for us? Could you offer some insights as to how Sephora, assuming you go through some of the Sephora doors down in Brazil, what maybe some of their expansion plans are down in that region, or how far penetrated you are with Sephora, down in Brazil? And then from a dot-com perspective, I'm just trying to size up the dot-com relevancy to the M-A-C brands and maybe how that index is relative to Est\u00e9e as well as Clinique.","Fabrizio Freda","This is Fabrizio, before giving the word to Karen, I just want to say that we are not in Sephora, Brazil with M-A-C, at this point in time. But I'd like Karen to answer the question.","Karen Buglisi","Certainly. I would love to talk a little bit about Brazil, because it's probably the most important emerging market that we have. Currently, as I stated, we are the leader in prestige makeup there. We have about 30 points of distribution. We plan to double -- we're in 11 cities. We plan to double our distribution in the next 3 to 4 years and double the number of cities that we're in, so we will continue to trailblaze for the prestige beauty market there and recruit customers into beauty, into the prestige market. Secondly, dot-com offers a great opportunity for us, especially m-commerce. Right now, our m-commerce is 12% of our overall e- and m-commerce, so we think there's a great opportunity for us to continue to maximize those channels.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nik Modi with UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Fabrizio, can you just frame kind of you -- the longer-term opportunity in China. Just trying to understand kind of, as a percentage of the total distribution you could potentially have, where are you today and kind of how do you see that investment and that strategy playing out over the next couple of years?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. As we say, we are today, in 68 cities in China. We believe there are at least 100, 120 cities that already now will be ready for the distribution. If, from a consumer standpoint, if the distribution network will be available. So our plan is to continue to expand into Tier 2 or 3 cities, is continue expand, particularly our most successful brands, the brands which are more ready for the expansion. Our plan is to continue advertise and build awareness for our brands in China and basically to continue expansion in this way. To be clear, if you look at the -- what's happening in China in this moment is that the market in Tier 1 cities in our industry is growing less aggressively than in the past, in term of comp growth, particularly. And -- but the potentials of continuous expanding into new cities and attracting new consumers is enormous. That's why, this quarter we grew 32% in this situation. The other thing that is part of the plan is to continue working on what we call the traveling corridors for China's consumers. We know today that there are a lot of consumers that are traveling, and this consumer traveling are coming actually, from these Tier 2 and 3 cities where we are just launched recently or where we are not yet in. Which means that the expansion in Tier 2 or 3 cities, in turn drives also the expansion in travel retail and in what date by when they travel. And the other thing we know is today, 70% of our online sales in China come from cities in which we are not distributed, indicating that the consumer demand is already there and we need just to continue accelerating the distribution. So that's it.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Wu with Telsey Advisory. The question has been withdrawn.","Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Tracey, maybe this is an unfair question, given that you've only been there, let's say, it's your first quarter. But can you just talk about your view on the balance sheet? I mean, the dividend increase is great, but can you talk about, in general, the status of the unlevered balance sheet and how you feel about that, right? I mean, do you think there is a path to more aggressive use of it and what do you see for M&A opportunities?","Tracey Thomas Travis","David, that is an unfair question after 2 months, but I'll do my best to respond. So I think, obviously, our capital structure is something that we discuss on a regular basis with our Board of Directors, and that includes our dividend issuance, our share repurchase activity and the amount of debt that we hold as a company. I think right now, given the increase that we announced this morning, as well as the additional share repurchase activity, we are certainly, and the board is certainly committed to returning cash to shareholders, that we deem to be excess at this point in time and increase shareholder value. In terms of debt, we obviously did most recently take on some additional debt, some of that was to retire old debt. But we do have slightly higher debt than we had previously on our balance sheet, and I think we're very comfortable with that at this point in time. It has been discussed previously that we certainly are open to appropriate acquisitions to enhance our portfolio, and I think we'll make those judgments at that time with respect to how we fund those acquisitions. But at this point in time, we think we're pretty comfortable with our capital structure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","My question is about your guidance for organic sales growth for the year, it's 6% to 7%. It was 6% the first quarter, and then if you take out the accelerated shipments in Asia, above and beyond what you had last year, it looks like your organic sales growth in the second quarter is 4% to 5%. So that means it sounds like you're expecting accelerating organic sales, adjusted for these timing issues in the second half. Can you explain why that's the case?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. As we said before, we believe we will grow 6% to 7%, which is double the market. And in this moment, the market, our estimate is we grow about 3%. Just to be fair, this is different what we felt in August. In August, we felt 3% to 4% would have been the market growth. And the reality, what we have seen, particularly in some southern European markets which are now on the negative market trend. And in Korea, which is flattened, while it was a very strong growth market in the past, we had to readjust our point of view on the global market for the fiscal year. Then in term of our plan, we continue to grow market share and to grow, both in great markets like China or North America in this moment. And frankly, we continue to grow and grow market share in many of the weak market that we are seeing, yes. For example, in places like Italy, we continue to grow well ahead of the market trend, the same in France. So it's good results. The reason why we believe we will accelerate as or generally are twofold: First of all, we have an initiative plan, and an innovation plan, which is very strong there; second, we have a strong innovation plan supported by extra advertising in the second quarter this year. We will spend $80 million more advertising in the second quarter of the year versus last year, which we believe will add a good, a very strong influence on the third quarter sales and results, and obviously, also on the fourth quarter. So this year, because of the calendarization of our innovation, and because of the -- our intention to push our best opportunities as soon as possible in the fiscal year, we have an anticipated increased advertise through the second quarter. As you remember, this was happening mainly in the fourth quarter in our previous year. And I think this will be beneficial to the further acceleration in the last 6 months. So in a nutshell, is calendarization of initiatives, key opportunities by market and the impact of our advertising behind us, and the innovation plan, that we believe will further accelerate the sales growth. Lastly, keep in mind that we have a very high base in the first 6 months of the fiscal year from last year, and we have an easier base to beat in the second 6 months of this fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Actually I just have one follow-up from a previous question and then another one. So just to get underneath this kind of spending, and impact on margins, I mean, one of the bigger stories that has been very positive about Est\u00e9e Lauder, is the margin expansion and as we look at gross margins, as you look at SG&A opportunities this quarter and going forward, it's still a little bit more detail. I know you try every once in a while, but just a little bit more detail about where the opportunities lie, going forward. And how much of the investment has to be increased investments to just grow the way it used to grow? And then tied to that a little bit, but a part of the other question is, if you could give a little bit more detail about Europe and how that may figure into it. So how much of the European issues we're hearing are really impacting the consumer versus just retailers and inventory, and how should we think about that going forward? So part of that's for 2 questions, but hopefully, you can help.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, and I'll try to answer both, Ali. And Ali, I'd like then Tracey to add on, on what I say on this question. So let me start with Europe. So what we see in Europe is that the markets are, in [indiscernible] in Italy, in Spain, in Greece, in Portugal, and now also in France, are start being tough and negative, frankly more than what we expected, the markets. We are doing well in these markets, but the markets are very, very tough and there is less consumers buying than what we originally expected, which is understandable, given the very tough economical situation. What happens in this case, when you have a worsening of the market in Europe, is that trade start destocking as well. And this happens because, as you know, the retail stocks in Europe are pretty high. So Europe is a market where, where we see a deceleration, deceleration is actually increased by the combined trade destocking. At the same time, when we see an acceleration, the acceleration is increased by the trade restocking. So that's what you should expect in Europe, that's why you see this -- the variation. Now what we expect in Europe for the future, our estimate in this moment is that the negative markets based in south of Europe will continue for the fiscal year. And then I believe they will stabilize and then probably start bouncing back in the '14 and '15 years. But for the moment, we assume they will stay bad for the remaining of the fiscal year. To answer your second question, is -- we are continuing cutting cost, and we are continuing improving gross margin. We are continuing reducing promotions and particularly, we are continuing to drive our mix of initiative, very strongly toward the most profitable and the most important and the most potential. Thanks to these leverage points, we are generating the possibility of advertising more. And also, you should know, that in the company we have developed, what I believe is the best innovation program that we probably have had for the next 3 years. So we want to be able to finance these innovation launches to exploit a best, the great asset of this company, which is our great brands, our great innovation program for the next years. So what does it mean, it means that we will continue to increase advertising spending in absolute term. This doesn't mean that we will continue year after year to increase the percentage of money in advertising, sorry, in total AP spending. And also we, deem the [indiscernible] spending total, we will continue to look for a way to make it more efficient, and to make it more efficient will include winning more money from promotion and push activities into brilliant pool activities in the key markets. And the last thing I want to add to this, we do this with enormous agility, at a gate [ph] part of our way to work today is that when we have, like now, market like China or U.S. having a particularly strong opportunity, we are able to move funds and push our wins in this market with much more agility than what we could do in the past, which in turns, make our advertising spending more effective. And then, we are trying to drive our more profitable mix channels. The reason why we have been introducing in this call, try the retail some time ago, then online, today M-A-C, is basically to make you more familiar with what are the strong volume and profit drivers in our organization at this point. Tracey?","Tracey Thomas Travis","Yes. I think Fabrizio summed it up well. The only thing that I would add to it is the company has laid out a number of cost savings initiatives and expense leverage initiatives, which I think you're all familiar with, that have really helped and support a lot of the things that Fabrizio laid out over the last few years, helping to increase advertising expenses or expenditures in a very strategic way, while increasing or expanding our margin. We are certainly focused on continuing to identify projects and programs within the organization that allow us to better leverage expenses. One of the things that I know has been discussed quite a bit on these calls has been the Strategic Modernization Initiative, and the SAP implementation, which will certainly allow us to improve some of the areas like inventory optimization, which can -- will have tremendous benefits with respect to cash flow improvement, as well as expense and margin improvement as well. So we're pretty excited about the next few years with all of the capability building that's happened in the last couple of years, to be able to continue to leverage expenses and continue to grow with the innovation that Fabrizio indicated.","Operator","Your next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Question on the SAP impact to sales and earnings in the second quarter. If there's any way you can quantify that and how that would compare to the SAP impact from the year before. So is it more, adding more to sales growth and earnings than it did a year ago? And then also, if you could just elaborate a little bit on the trade destocking in travel retail in particular. So the difference between retail takeaway of up 12 and the up 2 that you reported and when you expect that might normalize.","Tracey Thomas Travis","So why don't I answer the SAP shift, and then Fabrizio can answer the second part of your question. As I said in my prepared remarks, you're absolutely correct, the impact this year, given the number of affiliates that we have rolling out in January, is greater than it was in the prior year's quarters. So this year, we're expecting approximately $70 million to $90 million in sales to shift between the third quarter into the second quarter, and that compares to about $30 million last year. So that's what the impact will be in the quarter.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. And on travel retail, is -- the destocking has been mainly in Asia and in the Americas, and was the result of a change of rhythm of increased traffic in July, particularly, and then adjusting in August. And some of the retailers decided to destock. We don't believe this will continue. We believe that the overall net sales will gradually align to the retail sales in the remaining of the fiscal year. And I explained in my prepared remark, the retail sales increase in travel retail globally, has been about 11%, despite a tough quarter in Korea, which is 15% of our total global travel retail business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just to follow up on the SAP pre-buy. I mean, I think in years past, it was like a 70% to 80% operating margin on those sales, pulled forward? So just when we model it, do we assume those same kind of margin levels? And then, the -- my real question is, if things really start to get dicey out there, do you guys have sort of a contingency plan in place that can preserve earnings, meaning that, are there some investments you could pull back on, or are you just going to invest straight through, because it's sort of better for the long-term health of the business?","Tracey Thomas Travis","Okay. So to answer the first part of your question, yes, you can assume the same type of margin on those, that -- on that sales shift in the quarter.","Fabrizio Freda","And the second question's yes. We have a pretty sophisticated contingency system, as you have probably seen in the last 2 years, where every brand has an element of contingency and flexible spending. In the course of our year this contingency of flexible spending is then flexed to profit protection or to further investment on our winners, depending how the markets and our fiscal year goes. So we have the opportunity, in case things will get worse in some markets, to protect our plans. To be clear, the way we protect our plans is not necessarily protecting on the profit, but the best way in which we protect our plans is to be agile enough to move resources to our winners, and to be able anyway to protect also our top line growth in the course of the year, wherever we can. So when things get tough, we can protect profit, but most importantly, we can direct our resources where things are not tough, actually are good. And to be clear, the strengths of our portfolio is that our many brands, many channels, many countries, our broad approach in the world offer always, frankly, a possibility to find areas which are growing fast, which are solid, and which is worth investing in. So it's a balance of being able to protect and agile enough to be able to leverage what is working.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess on advertising, we're just trying to get a better handle on sort of the incremental spend. So is the absolute amount that you're planning to spend for fiscal '13 the same as you pulling forward some of that into this December quarter? And then, more broadly, I know you've talked a little bit before about AMS spending moderating as a percentage of sales over time, maybe give us a bit of an update in terms of how you're thinking about that now, particularly as it may seem like there seems to be an increasing correlation between that spend and your sales growth.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Okay. So our advertising full year dollar expenditures are expected to increase this year. As Fabrizio noted, the calendarization of the spend is a bit different this year than last year, so we're seeing a fairly heavy spike in the second quarter, which will be offset by a decline in the fourth quarter as it relates to our plans this year. But full year, we are expecting to increase the advertising spending we have. As we had mentioned before, a tremendous launch program this year that we certainly want to be able to support. We are, however, this year, expecting to leverage advertising and promotion expense. So it will not be deleveraging on our margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser with Caris & Company.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","I know you made some comments about Russia, but maybe you could give a little bit more color -- just Oriflame on their call the other day mentioned that they felt that the traditional retail channels were gaining share from direct selling in beauty in Russia and that they said there -- they felt there was a very high level of promotion in the regular retail channels. Could you comment, is that more of the mass cosmetics or is that prestige too? And can you just give a little more about the market dynamics in Russia? And also, can you give us some idea as to what size it is for you guys, what percentage of sales, roughly?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. Russia is a small percent, it's a very small percent of our sales. It's around 2% of our sales. The -- what's happening in Russia, the market is growing double-digit overall, the prestige market in Russia, and we are growing double-digit or more with most of the retailers we work with in Russia. But there is a retailer with which we don't have an agreement for the plan forward, and we are discussing with them. So the reason why we, in this moment in time, we are not fully exploiting the growth of the Russian market and we are delivering results in Russia which are below market growth, which is unique, because in all the other emerging markets, all the world in this moment it's just the opposite is happening, meaning we are growing much faster than the market. In this market, the reason why it is happening is because we don't have yet a final agreement with one of the retailers. And so we are evaluating what will be the right strategy in the future to continue growing in Russia at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering if you could sort of take your category growth comments and then your targets and sort of put them in the context of what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint. Because it seems as though the incremental spending is just about trying to get more out of your marketing budget for fiscal 2013, as opposed to an increase in spending. So do you think that just simply moving the support forward is enough to, I don't know whether you're accelerating your market share gains, or at least sort of maintaining your market share gains? So can you walk through the incremental spending in the context of what you're seeing out there, competitively?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. No, we are intentionally growing double than the industry, so we are growing market share globally and our estimate is the market will grow at about 3%, and we are growing -- we will grow 6% to 7% in our estimate, so we will definitely continue to accelerate global market share. In terms of our main, biggest competitors, we have been growing stronger than them every year, and the most of the quarters, if you look to our history in the last 3 years, it would be only a few quarters where some of our competitors have been growing faster than us, and this is normally associated with the calendarizations of events, rather than with a strategic change. So we are a fast growth company, we have defined fast growth as at least 1% ahead of market every year. So when the market grow 4% to 6%, we will grow 6% to 8%. In a year, where the market seems to grows 3%, particularly because there are some big markets in the world, like the south of Europe, which are negative. When this happens, we may grow 6% to 7%, like we are saying this year. But anyway, is always the same logic, is growing double than the market, much better than the industry, and normally with, again, with the exception of a few quarters, we will believe we'll be ahead of competition in term of growth.","Tracey Thomas Travis","And the only thing I would add to what Fabrizio was saying in terms of our spend this year and the reason we can get a little bit more leverage out of it, we're far more targeted in the spend this year, in terms of the products that we're supporting, and the markets that we're supporting as well, which is allowing us to get tremendous leverage on the dollars.","Operator","Your last question comes from Victoria Collin with Atlantic Equities.","Victoria Watson Collin - Atlantic Equities LLP","Fabrizio, I apologize if you said it already, but I wonder if you could give the same-door sales figure for China, please. And then also maybe a little bit of color on the Q2 guidance, particularly in your key markets. What are you expecting for the holidays, something more buoyant than last year, presumably, for the U.S.? And maybe just the detail on whereabouts in the market you expect to see that?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. The same-door sales in China's been 2% in the quarter. And in term of the holiday, we frankly have early indication of a very solid holiday season and we have great programs out there, some of our programs appeal to value consumer, to consumer which are interested in value, and some of our program appeal to the high-end consumer. We believe we have very balanced programs and very promising. And the first indications, that should be good and we get this indication from online. We have a very strong beginning of online activity linked to holidays, so we are pleased with the first reaction to our programs, and we are encouraged by what we see for the holidays.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would now like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.","Rainey Mancini","Good morning. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you will find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges, goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, changes in contingent consideration, the finalization of provisional charges related to the U.S. tax law enacted at the end of calendar 2017, and the new accounting standard for revenue recognition.","All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our Web site. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call.","And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Rainey. Good morning everyone. We delivered excellent results in our second quarter, as multiple engines of growth drove cost of currency double-digit gains in sales and earning per share, led by strong advances in our product categories, brands, countries, and channels.","We strategically invested in the most promising opportunities and our rich digital content engaged consumers, attracting then to our high quality innovative products. Overall, net sales grew 11%, and therefore the first time exceeded $4 billion in a quarter. We achieved this milestone despite an extremely challenging and volatile environment, which included softness in two of our largest markets, the U.S. and the U.K. and global trade tensions. This is a testament to our strategic resource allocation, superb execution by our talented employees, and improved capabilities throughout the organization. We leveraged our strengths where we had the greatest growth opportunities, including China in travel retail. And we further broadened and diversified our growth engines with strong results in the rest of Asia and emerging markets, in our fast growing channels, and in most brands.","The benefits from our leading Beauty Forward initiative allowed us to deliver savings and selectively increase our advertising spending, which in turn supported our strong top line growth and enabled us to leverage our cost structure. Diluted earnings per share rose 25%, more than twice our sales pace. Importantly, we accelerated our share growth in Global Prestige Beauty in the quarter, which confirmed that our strategy has enabled us to gain share profitability. With an outstanding first-half and ongoing confidence that we will continue to effectively execute our winning strategy, we are raising our sales and EPS guidance for the year. We now expect sales growth of 8% to 9%, and EPS gains of 14% to 16% for fiscal 2019.","In the recent quarter, we benefited from many growth engines throughout our business, supported by strong product innovation and effective marketing which was informed by improved customer insights and data analytics. Our innovation program is getting stronger. We have developed more advanced data and are using it to focus on top priority areas and create highly desirable products. The proof is evident in sales from new launches. We have reached an all-time high of nearly 30% of our business. And we become even more sophisticated marrying analytical insight with our innate creativity. We believe our innovation has the potential to reach new heights, also thanks to the improved speed to market.","Over time consumer demand for different kinds of beauty products fluctuates, and skincare is currently the fastest growing category globally. With agility we deployed more of our resources into this area. Our skincare sales grew sharply, while our makeup and hair care categories also posted healthy gains. Our luxury and artisanal fragrance brands were stars in the fragrance area, but the category declined slightly because of some designer fragrances. Estee Lauder Beautiful Belle was a popular new scent during holiday gifting season. Three of our largest brands grew globally, validating consumer loyalty to powerful authentic, well-established brands, especially when supported by compelling innovation and strong hero products.","Momentum continued in our Estee Lauder brand, which climbed double-digit for the seventh consecutive quarter. The brand delivered double-digit increases in every region, and a stellar performance in both skincare and makeup, led by it's hero franchises. MAC gains were led by a strong international showing, and it continued to pivot to fast-growing channels with great penetration online and in specialty multi. La Mer continued its superior results and gained share in every region in luxury skincare, fueled by growing consumer loyalty to its beloved products, and effective digital campaigns they recruited many new consumers.","Clinique continue to make good progress. Although it's overall results were impacted by the clients in North America brick and mortar department store, including the closure of Bon Ton. Nonetheless, Clinique skincare sales rose globally on the strengths of several key franchises, and we are optimistic about its skincare growth in the coming quarters, reflecting expected strong performance from recently-launched innovations.","Clinique new hydrating jelly and it's dramatically different moisturizer franchise achieved terrific results across the globe. The brand newness innovation, Clinique ID is a breakthrough product lineup that is custom fit for consumer needs by offering 15 combinations of different moisturizer and treatments. It launched in the last week of the quarter, and is off to a very encouraging start, exceeding our expectation in many markets. Clinique ID has the potential to become one of our company's most exciting launches, and addresses consumer growing desire for more personalization.","Looking at other brands in our diverse portfolio, our comfort luxury brand resonated very well with consumers, and fragrance brands, Jo Malone London, Le Labo, Frederic Malle, and By Kilian achieved double-digit growth to face further expanded internationally, it remained highly ranked in the U.S. specialty multi-channel. A key strategy via our brand success is creating a significant base of profitable repeat business from devoted consumers by attracting new users with compelling innovations in marketing, and then, the quality of our products turn them into lifelong fans. Many of our brands strive in a broad range of markets with diverse consumer needs, showing the power of that global appeal layer it with locally relevant insights. We have developed robust analytics, and are using the data to help inform our innovation and our communications. Together, with compelling storytelling, macro influencers and digital advertising, we can now better engage the consumers through our product offerings and marketing.","Asia-Pacific continued strong growth at a double-digit rate. China led the advance, Hong Kong and Japan had solid gains, and our sales in Korea accelerated. Virtually every brand generated higher sales in the region both at net and retail boosted by the hero product and successful locally relevant innovations. Luxury brands have been in high demand in China, and our sales mirror that trend as they increased strongly. We continue to be share as prestige beauty further accelerated in the market, and every brand category A major channel grew double-digits.","Makeup has been gaining favor among Chinese consumers. It now represents nearly one-third of our mix of business there. Within prestige makeup, Estee Lauder, M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Tom Ford were especially popular, it gained significant market share. Online has been growing sharply for many quarters. It now accounts for more than one-third of our sales in China. We had superb results on Timo, and with the growing interest in makeup, M\u00b7A\u00b7C was the number one prestige makeup brands on Timo during the entire calendar 2018 and has became number two in prestige makeup in the total market.","Demand for prestige beauty from Chinese consumer has remained strong, in spite of macro issues and potential risks to the economy, including higher tariffs as our next month's a more oversight on Chinese travelers who buy goods offshore for re-sales domestically. So far, we have not seen any impact and remain optimistic about the long-term health and resilience of prestige beauty in China. The industry will be driven by favorable demographics and we are confident that the largest growing middle-class in China will remain passionate about high quality beauty products. We note also that other actions such as the announced tax cuts have the potential to sustain consumer consumption over the next few years.","Beyond China, our success in Asia was widespread as we further diversified our growth engines in the region. Our strategy in Japan is to broaden our target consumer reach beyond our primary department store channel. We made excellent progress, further penetrating specialty multi and online and had rapid growth in those fast-growing channels. With strong fragrance growth in Korea, we gain share led by our high-end brands By Kilian, Tom Ford, and Germano.","Our business advanced in the Europe Middle East and Africa region with Good underlining momentum in most markets. We had gained the most emerging markets with large improvements in the Middle East and delivered increased in the group of developed Western markets. Even though prestige beauty in North America was challenging during the last month of the holiday season, the influence also by the government shutdown in a week store market that impacted consumer sentiment. There were several a bright spots in our business. Several brands expanded further in ULTA, where we have seen strong growth, including Estee Lauder, M\u00b7A\u00b7C Clinique and Bumble and Bumble. Many of our brand's holiday sets were popular, including Estee Lauder blockbuster, which sold through early on. We saw strong retail sales on department store and specialty multi e-commerce sites as well on our own brand sites.","Our global digital agenda is working well and is a key enabler of our company strategy. We continue to support our brands we compare the social media programs, technology advances, and growing online initiatives. Across our e-commerce business, our orders, a conversion increased and the $125 million global visit to our brand size during the quarter made them highly valuable media assets.","Sales on our brand sites, retailer sites and third-party sites, all grew double-digits. Several brands had record breaking days online during the holiday period in North America for example, Estee Lauder, La Mer generated sales record on their sites on black Fridays and Cliniques Cyber Monday event was his largest ever.","In China single day activations boosted many of our brands on Timo. Sales on our brand stores on Timo, on that day November rose, nearly 80%, and Estee Lauder and M A C were among the top five performance in total prestige beauty. In Europe, with speed and strong demand for our products on third-party sites, including Asus in the U.K. and Zalando in several markets in Europe.","Our global travel retail business remained robust. 13 of our brands grew double-digits at retail all categories grew, and light door sales were strong. Our retail sales rose several times more than the pace of global passenger traffic growth, and we lifted our business with successful exclusive products La Mer, for example, leverage the opportunity to reach travelers who arrived in the U.K. or new flight from China. As a result, the travel retail business in the U.K. skyrocket.","Traveling consumers are showing an increased interest in the convenience of ordering products online before departing on their trips. Our online travel retail business known as retail sales increased dramatically. It's starting to account for the meaningful share of our business where it is available and is increasing conversion of travelers into buyers.","In addition, we are working with travel retail partners to develop alternative online selling models into the channel. To build on these exciting opportunities, our brains are now developing digital campaigns specifically for travel retail. International passenger traffic is expected to continue to increase in the next two quarters and we have plans to expand our brand presence in airports. For example, we plan to open more doors for our newness artisanal fragrance brands in our new millennium focus was makeup brands like Too Faced in makeup.","In closing, we are very pleased with our progress this quarter, and in the first six months of our fiscal year. Many of our key brands in counties delivered terrific growth, China remained a very strong. Middle East improvement and our momentum expanded in other that emerging markets. Our two fastest growing channels online and travel retail kept up their rapid pace globally. Our innovations were highly successful and our hero franchises continued to support growth across the portfolio. We are proud of our financial results and share gains in global prestige beauty, and are increasing our guidance even while recognizing certain geopolitical and economy risks in the short term.","At the same time, I want to emphasize that historically prestige beauty is being less sensitive to economic downturns because it is affordable luxury driven by repeated repurchases and loyalty. Long term, our industry has strong fundamentals including favorable democratic demographics they should drive solid growth for years to come.","In the next two quarters, we plan to invest more behind our innovation to further build our share to continue fueling our innovation success. We expect to invest behind important new product launches such as Clinique, upcoming innovations in popular products. And that leveraging our brands during Chinese New Year, we robust advert in dollars in beautiful dedicated products. We're also locating additional resources to strengthen our capabilities throughout our business.","Our strategy is to further build our global share and drive long term profitable growth. We are very well positioned to succeed. Over the last few years, we have streamlined our organization to better capitalize on global opportunities. We have unleashed savings from Leading Beauty Forward and other programs that we plan to invest in the most exciting opportunities to strengthen our leadership and to continue driving profitably. We operate our business with a long term view and their upbeat in our outlook. Thanks to our diverse brand portfolio, wide global reach and talented employees who are successfully executing our winning strategy. We believe the fiscal year 2019 would be another year of exciting sales gain in double digit EPS growth.","Now I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Travis","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning everyone. First I will review our fiscal 2019 second quarter financial results and then cover our expectations for the third quarter and for the full year. As a reminder my commentary today includes the adjustments that were mentioned at the beginning of the call by Rainey.","All net sales growth numbers I will discuss are in constant currency and compatible accounting methods unless otherwise stated. Also as a reminder, we adopted the new accounting standard for revenue recognition ASC 606, this fiscal year on a modified retrospective basis. For the quarter, the impact decreased our sales growth by two percentage points, our operating profit growth by seven points and our diluted EPS by $0.11.","And now for the quarter results, net sales for the second quarter rose 11% with broad based growth across most regions and product categories. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia Pacific region had robust net sales growth this quarter. Net sales overall rose 20% with many markets experiencing double digit increases. ","Sales in China and Hong Kong grew very strong double digit with most brands categories and channels contributing to growth. Our sales in department stores in China continue to grow strong double digits and other channels especially online rose even faster. We also achieved excellent mid-single digit sales growth in Japan and Korea, with growth across all channels including department stores specialty multi and online. And other markets such as Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia also contributed to the region's growth with our sales in Australia declining slightly.","Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions rose 16% driven by strong double digit increases in both our global travel retail sector and other emerging markets in the region. Double digit like door growth across most brands drove the majority of the increase in travel retail and expanded consumer reach for brands such as Jo Malone London, Tom Ford and M.A.C also contributed to growth. Outside of travel retail, the Middle East, Turkey, and Russia are emerging markets growth in the EMEA region. Western European growth was mixed with Greece and Italy particularly strong and Germany more challenged. Our UK business declined 2% as macro issues dampen consumer spending including the uncertainty over Brexit with the greatest impact felt across brick and mortar distribution. ","The online business remained a brighter spot as consumers continue to shift their spending time online. In online we had solid growth across most retailer and third party site. House of Fraser, one of our largest department store customers in the U.K. has been reorganizing under new ownership, and we therefore reestablish trading with them in November.","Net sales in the Americas decline 3%, excluding $22 million in prior years sales to Bon Ton, the region sales would have declined 1%. North America continues to achieve solid growth online with strength across both retailer and brand site. While much of brick and mortar sales in North America softened in December. Net sales in the specialty multi- channel continue to grow particularly ULTA. Latin American sales were flat overall as growth in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina was offset by a decline in Venezuela.","Skin care again led product category growth this quarter. Net sales grew 22% with very strong global contributions from the Estee Lauder and La Mer brands. Both brand had successful new products as well as growth in existing franchises. Our Origins brand also delivered a terrific performance in Asia and travel retail reflecting increasing demand for the brands key product line.","Net sales in makeup grew 6% led by strong demand for Double Wear foundation in Asia and travel retail as well as the greater focus on makeup in our US holiday offering. M.A.C and Tom Ford continue to resonate with Chinese consumers and BECCA saw double digit gains from its holiday program and other new products. Net sales of fragrances declined 1% as declines in designer and Estee Lauder fragrances offset gains in luxury and artisanal brand. Our hair care net sales rose 6% primarily driven by Aveda's recent launches and strong online sales.","Our gross margin declined 250 basis points compared to the second quarter last year, due entirely to the impact of the new accounting standards which negatively impacted our gross margin by 240 basis points through the reclassification of samples, testers and collateral to cost of goods from operating expenses. Additionally, favorable mix impacts of 85 basis points were mostly offset by adverse foreign currency and obsolescence.","Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 280 basis points. Major drivers of the improvements include 180 basis points related to the new accounting standard for revenue recognition, 130 basis points from lower selling cost and 90 basis points of savings in general and administrative cost. We reinvested a 120 basis points more in any AMP to drive the business and still realized expense rate improvement. Operating income rose 8% and operating margin increased by 20 basis points. Excluding the impact of a new accounting standard operating income rose 15% and operating margin increased 120 basis points.","Diluted EPS of a $1.74 increased 14% compared to the prior year and grew 18% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.05 of unfavorable currency translation. Diluted EPS excluding the impact of the accounting change was a $1.86, an increase of 22% compared to the prior year or 25% in constant currency.","For the six months, we generated $1.27 billion in net cash flows from operating activities which was slightly below the prior year due primarily to invest in inventory to support our international growth and some timing differences and payables and receivables. We invested $292 million in capital expenditures and we returned significant cash to shareholders. We used $1.13 billion to repurchase 8.2 million shares of our stock, and we paid 297 million in dividend, essentially doubling the value of stockholder distributions this year, compared to the first six months of last year.","During December, we took impairment charges of $38 million for goodwill and other intangible assets related to the Smashbox brand. This action reflects the slowdown in the brand's makeup sales driven by increased competitive activity and slower-than-expected growth in key retail channels for the brand. The charges represent less than 20% of the carrying value of Smashbox's goodwill and other intangible assets.","Now let's turn to our outlook for the third quarter and for the full fiscal year. We had an outstanding first-half, which would reinforce confidence in our full-year guidance. However, there are still a number of macro risks and opportunities encompassed in our outlook for the second-half. These include uncertainties caused by political instability and soft economies in certain markets, including the U.K. and Europe with the Brexit deadline impending shortly, saw January retail trends in some areas of the U.S. also influenced by the government shutdown, strong but somewhat moderating growth in China in travel retail, the impact of expected additional tariffs in China and comps in the U.S. easing as the impact of Bon Ton sales in the prior year decline in our second-half.","As Fabrizio mentioned, given the strong first-half performance, we are raising our expectation for full-year net sales growth to 8% to 9% in constant currency, excluding the impact of the new accounting standard. Currency translation is expected to negative effect reported sales growth by three percentage points, reflecting rates of 1.147 for the Euro, 1.283 for the Pound, and 6.874 for the Yuan for the full fiscal year.","We now expect the impact of the new accounting standard to be immaterial to net sales growth for the full-year. We are raising our EPS expectations to a range of $4.92 to $5, before restructuring and other charges. This reflects a slightly lower effective tax rate estimate of 22%, approximately $0.22 of dilution from currency translation, and $0.01 dilution from the new accounting standard. In constant currency, and with comparable accounting, we expect EPS to rise by 14% to 16%. For the third quarter, net sales are expected to increase approximately 8% to 9% in constant currency, and using comparable accounting. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact growth by five percentage points and the accounting change is forecasted to add two points to growth. Therefore, we expect reported net sales to grow between 5% and 6%. EPS is forecasted between $1.26 and $1.28, before restructuring charges. This includes approximately $0.09 of dilution from currency and $0.18 benefit from the new accounting standard.","With a strong are-half of fiscal year behind us, we are focused on investing further behind key launches, digital outreach, and brand expansion to support future growth in North America, and continued strength in other markets. We have the flexibility to make these investments in our second-half, while delivering another successful full-year of solid top line growth, margin expansion, and double-digit EPS growth, as reflected in our increased guidance for the year.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start on China, because the growth there obviously continues to be fairly impressive. First, if you could talk about the overall environment, because some of your luxury peers are also saying that they haven't seen a slowdown yet, but in terms of your outperformance, how much do you think has the environment has held up better than it appeared versus the actions you are taking, growing market share, positioning yourself in faster-growing channels, wanting more brands, more online initiatives, all these things. And can you give us a sense of where your comp growth is versus what's come from new brand launches into either the market or also online. Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","Okay, so the environment of prestige beauty, I want to be clear, is strong. Actually, as we said in our prepared remarks, the prestige beauty market in the quarter has further accelerated growth. And our performance within that market is very, very strong because we continue to build market share even in an accelerating market. So, to answer directly your question, our program is working very well, and we are very satisfied, so there is a lot of our specific activity which is working, that's why we are growing market share. But the market also remains solid. This is the prestige beauty market; it's not necessarily the total economy, which is different, which shows that prestige beauty is particularly resilient in China versus the total market.","And this comes from the passion of consumers for the category, for the growth of the middle class, and very importantly from the role of young people in the overall Chinese consumer base. China is a very special market where the young generation is consuming more than their parents in many areas, but particularly in prestige beauty, where the market share of prestige and luxury in the young generation is bigger than the market share in prestige and luxury in the more adult consumer, that's why prestige beauty in this moment is doing well and is also in general more resilient than other categories in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research.","Ali Dibadj","Hey guys. So, wanted to better understand and maybe help quantify what is actually in the expectation or in your guidance particularly along three dimensions, one is North America. Can you talk a little bit about that by channel? It looked like specialty multi slowed a little bit. Want to get a sense of growth there by channel. Two, as again, just on China, Tracey, I think you mentioned quote unquote moderating -- solid but somewhat moderating in China. Just want to understand what you've put into your guidance there. And then anymore you can give us about the return on those investments you're making in the second-half, try to help us understand the expectations you're setting on guidance. Thank you.","Tracey Travis","Okay. So, I'll start in terms of the Americas in the second-half. In general, we are expecting slightly improved performance in the second-half from the America region and in particular in the U.S. for a couple of reasons. One, obviously, as we mentioned, we are not anniversarying the Bon-Ton shipments from the first-half of last year. So that will represent some improvement. At the same time, we're cognizant of the fact that January, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, Ali, has been quite soft. And everything from weather related issues to obviously the government shutdown I think has impacted consumer sentiment in the U.S. in the third quarter.","We also have very strong innovations that, as I mentioned, we are supporting globally, Clinique iD being one of them and really focused on our largest brands, some of which will be announced later. And that will, also, we expect those to do quite well, and we are investing incremental advertising in the second-half in North America behind those programs. So, from a channel standpoint we expect some improvement in department stores, some continued good performance in specialty multi in particular with the traction we've seen in Ulta and Shoppers Drug Market in Canada and a few others. And online, online continues to grow nicely across all of the channels of distribution, retailer.com as well as our own brand.com site.","In terms of the return on the investments that we're seeing in the second-half, we obviously have a tremendous amount of experience, and Fabrizio suggested in his prepared remarks the improvements that we've made internally in terms of our data analytics, so we have lots of information to inform not only the new products that we're launching in the second half of the year, but how to communicate and what to invest behind in terms of marketing those products, and what generates the highest return. So that is a continual area of increasing improvement for us. And obviously, as we have seen in the first half we've showed that we actually had good return on the investments that we've made in that area.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi, good morning\u2026","Fabrizio Freda","Good morning.","Wendy Nicholson","-- can you talk about the margin on the skin care? I mean, it's phenomenal, and I guess, if you can unpack that a little bit, is it more driven by channel, is there less promotion in that, is that a function of Leading Beauty Forward, is it the growth in China and you just have to spend less to support the brands there, just trying to get a sense for a 30% plus operating margin in skin care, how sustainable is that going to be going forward? Thank you.","Tracey Travis","So I'll start and Fabrizio may add to it, Wendy, but thanks for the question. So skin care grew at 22% in the quarter, and that's a combination of great innovation, the investment that we put behind skin care in all markets, but in particular where we saw the greatest momentum, which was in Asia, as well as in travel retail, and we saw the benefit from those results. So that really is the predominant driver of the better margin in skin care.","Skin care is also benefiting from the investments in Leading Beauty Forward. Both in terms of lower cost as well as some of the investments we've made in digital and social capability internally that's allowed us to market these skin care products in a better way. So I mean those are all contributing factors to skin care.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, and I'd just like to add that the profitability is also improving in skin care because of the strong growth is leveraging our cost base in an amazing way, and the strong growth is generated by our much more accurate ability via the use of data to identify target groups and ways to reach the target group be it a channel or an investment in advertising and digitalization. So then the new model we are developing, which is more data based is making the growth stronger and the stronger growth is leveraging our construction better. The other thing is -- the second point is a Leading Beauty Forward is really transforming our P&L structure and taking money from fixed costs to advertising.","And within advertising and promotion to be clear, the entire increase is advertising. Promotions are flat despite our strong business growth. With that dynamic, advertising is much more flexible. Advertising is the resource that you can move from a working initiative, from taking down initiative, which is now working in very fast front in market which has a good momentum or out of a market that doesn't have a good momentum. So we have basically made our resources much easier to allocate with speed to the biggest opportunity around the globe. And this improved agility is increasing return of our resources and this is very evident in this moment particularly on skin care.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Yes. Hi, can you hear me okay?","Tracey Travis","Yes.","Steve Powers","Okay, great, thanks. So I actually wanted to follow up on Fabrizio's comments there surrounding Leading Beauty Forward, both for an update on the benefits you're achieving as well as for more perspective on the cost of achieving them. I think if my math is correct and my records are correct, since the start of the year, you've raised your anticipated restructuring cost now by about 50% at the midpoint.","So again, just hoping you could elaborate on what initiatives are driving that increase, what portion of those costs are cash, and whether we should view this as your point forward program costs and benefits or whether this is in effect an increase in the overall program both in terms of the cost to achieve, but also hopefully the benefits also, thanks?","Tracey Travis","Yes. So I'll start and then Fabrizio might add to this. We did raise the expected benefits as well as costs of the program at the beginning of the year. So we're now expecting the full program costs to be $900 million to $950 million and the benefits to be $350 million to $450 million, once the program is complete, the full annualized benefits from the program. So yes, you are seeing higher charges this year related to that increase. The increase is driven by adding more programs to Leading Beauty Forward. We launched it in 2016, this is the last year of charges for Leading Beauty Forward and then we realized the benefits from the ongoing programs execution. So, so that's the reason why you're seeing higher cost from the program.","In terms of the elements of the program, we have a number of supply chain initiatives in the program to increase agility and reduce inventory levels and speed to market. we have supported an accelerated transformation in our digital and social capability through the Leading Beauty Forward initiative and have incurred restructuring charges related to that. We've established shared service operations in the organization and that has allowed us to leverage a growth, which you saw certainly this quarter in our sales much more effectively and flow more dollars to the bottom-line. We have investments and savings from our procurement programs and that has allowed us to achieve more savings in our indirect procurement spending, which we expect to continue going forward.","So there are many different areas under Leading Beauty Forward that we've invested behind in the program over the last two and a half, almost three years now that we've been managing the program in order to drive the kinds of results that we're seeing now and expect to see in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great thanks. Good morning. I guess my question for retail is for you on the comments you made on pre-tail travel retail sales. It sounds like that's become more of a sizable portion of the overall business. Can you just share a little bit more about that? And how do you think about the expansion plan for pre-tail and then I guess any comments on what you're seeing from a customer base with Clinique iD if it's reactivating a lot of consumer bringing in a new customer? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, so pre-tail is as I explained in my prepared remarks is basically the possibility when you have a ticket, you're making a journey, you could instead of buy in the airport you could buy online before coming to the airport and then you will get the products at the airport in some cases on the share your airplane and that's today is mainly in Korea and I would say is only significant in Korea. So it's the beginning of the learning about this area but in Korea where this has started is becoming a significant part of the business.","We believe it is a pretty good idea. First of all, it's a good service to the consumers that can decide to shop while traveling even without investing the time to go to the store, so it's a good convenience process for the consumer but interestingly as an impact in improving conversion because we know that you know, we estimate between 10% or 15% of the travelers by anything. Obviously, if you had the possibility more conveniently to buy yearly online and taking your time to choose this can increase the amount of conversion. So this can be overtime in other booster of the overall market potential in travel retail in our opinion because it can be conversion boosters over time, but to be very clear for the moment is a Korean mainly a Korean reality.","Second question is a Clinique iD, we see very promising initial results from Clinique iD. The consumers are very interested, they are trying the product and by the way the advertising spending behind the brand is just starting and we will see more in the next months and the large majority actually will be in quarter four, so there is a lot of great programs that in the next six, eight months will then hopefully bring Clinique iD to the levels that we believe has the potential to go, as I explained in my initial comments is that the idea of personalization and is very much appreciated by the consumer and the personalization opportunity together with the high tax services the Clinique provides in every touch point with the consumer together with the data, the information that we have, what are the concerns that people have and our ability to focus the personalization on the most promising concerns that Clinique can address the combination of these factors we believe they are strong potential.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Nik Modi, RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi","Yes, thanks. So just a quick housekeeping and then the real question just on the cash flow I see for the first-half of the year cash flow has been lagging operating profit quotes. So just wanted to get some context around that, and then the broader question is, when you really think about how much your channel mix has been diversifying. I'm just curious if you're finding opportunities on the sampling line. My understanding is that that's a decent size nugget in the P&L and so I'm just curious if you're finding opportunities to save money in that area? Thanks.","Tracey Travis","All right, Nick. So on the cash flow, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks that our cash flow was a bit less than last year, really primarily related to working capital, given the strong growth that that we've had two years running now, we certainly are staging quite a bit of inventory to support growth going forward. So, that combined with we had some very aggressive programs last year as it relates to payables. We're still seeing improvement and payables and receivables but less improvement than we saw last year which was as you recall a record year for us in terms of cash flow growth, so that's really what's happening in the cash flow so still quite strong as it relates to cash generation strong enough that that obviously we purchased a fair amount for own stock in the first half with the excess cash that we had.","Nik Modi","Sampling?","Tracey Travis","Yes so sampling in terms of the channel mix and the samples with the growth of online that does require some sampling in certain markets, so certainly in venues in Asia and in the Tmall in particular it -- we do have a lot of samples in that venue, less, so in travel retail and in and a bit more mix in specialty multi but certainly as we see the shift out of department stores, I would say samples in general the cost has comedown but certain channels do require more samples than others but overall sample cost is coming down.","Fabrizio Freda","And the only thing I want to add is that we have done some great work in the cost per sample, but the idea is to invest more in more samples in the future because trial is when you have a high quality products with the kind of rapacious rate we have been able to create a early trial with the proper the sampling is a great opportunity and so we will continue to invest in the number of samples particularly on our new upcoming very promising innovations that we are reducing the cost per sample.","Tracey Travis","And are being more targeted in terms of the products that we're offering sample then.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rosie Edwards with Berenberg.","Rosie Edwards","Yes, good morning. And just a quick follow-up on China and you emphasize prestige a number of times when describing the market conditions and do you think that they're the share gains of prestige versus other channels in China have increased, largely the mass market here. And then, just very quickly, no mention of France at all, am I right in thinking that for those no disruption from the yellow vest rights that we saw in Q4? Thanks.","Tracey Travis","So I'll take the second question. In terms of France, we did see growth in France, obviously, a bit slower given some of the protests, as you mentioned, but we did see growth in France. So I talked about Western Europe had mixed performance but France was one of the markets that actually did grow.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, now France was good. Your first question on China, yes, well, what we mean is that again, the phenomenon of the young people in China and the middle class in general to trade that to high quality products is continuing and is actually accelerating, so our view of the market is that high quality is paying out and they trade that to quality is continuing even in a situation where there are more economical concerns than in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, guys, so the comments on North America\u2026","Tracey Travis","Hi, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, how are you?","Tracey Travis","Good.","Dara Mohsenian","So the comments on North America were helpful in terms of the week holiday season and obviously the January issues but for retail, I was hoping for more of a longer term perspective sort of setting aside January and moving past that, do you think North America can get back to consistent growth going forward as you look out the next fiscal year and beyond, particularly with the growth in specialty and online and maybe just preempt tonight's speech a bit and give your own state of the union on North America and thoughts there and then also on the margin side obviously we've seen some large compression last few years, so can that reverse at some point going forward or do you expect to see continued investment there ? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","I'll start with the trend in North America. Absolutely, we believe we are on the process of turning around our North American business and we believe that we will go back to growth in North America and to put again more perspective on the last quarter and the quarter was pretty solid in November included and the December has been a very soft month and then as Tracey explained also the beginning of January continue that trend, we attribute at least part of that to the government shutdown to the overall consumer sentiment was not a easy moment to spend a lot of money in December.","But our performance in November was very, very positive. So we -- when we look at the quarter results in the U.S., particularly the market was flat. Now, the market before was growing 5%, 7%. So all the difference that we see in our performance in the U.S. in the quarter is frankly, is the market is not what we are doing in the market for the long-term. So our agenda for the long-term is unchanged and what is it is first of all, we are investing more money, we will have more advertising power on the right priorities in the U.S. and we will see some of it taking place in the next six months, particularly in quarter four behind some great innovation that with the helpful data has been tailored to the American consumers even more than the past in many aspects.","Our analytical efforts have also helping our U.S. team to have a much more granular analysis or what are the opportunities by group. For example, we are focusing our existing hero products more on the Hispanic target group where we didn't have sufficient market share as an example. And our field restructuring that will be fully in place by the end of this fiscal year will allow us to execute this part of the tailoring by American region and groups in a much more accurate way that we ever been able to do in the past.","And then, to your point, the expansion in the fast-growing channels is accelerating and we are going to be in a situation where the majority of our business will be in fast growing channels in the percentage we further increase and obviously this will help the people and I want to underline we are still working very collaborative with our department store partners to restart growth in department store, which we believe is absolutely a possibilities also thanks to the very encouraging results that in e-commerce are happening in our department store faster with our department store partner. And so, it's a combination of factors that we believe will bring U.S. again to growth in the future and then when this will start in fact the we also depend from the overall market in the U.S. and how the overall market situation will evolve and how the overall consumer sentiment in the U.S. will evolve but for the long-term, we are absolutely focused on that. Margin?","Tracey Travis","Yes, they are and then on margin. Just a reminder that our America sector does include a portion of our corporate expenses, so in terms of what happened in the quarter, we the Smashbox impairment that we mentioned was charged against the Americas segment. The revenue recognition impact from a profit standpoint was $21 million as it just states in our press release. And then we had some of the investments that we made in IT and few other areas that also impacted the Americas segment. We certainly expect that when the Americas segment returns to growth that we will start to see the impact from a margin standpoint. And the Americas region itself is strong from a margin standpoint but because we have some of these other items in here, it does suppress as it always has some of the margin result and certainly as the sales growth has softened in the Americas we're seeing that impact in the quarterly results currently.","Operator","Your next question comes from Caroline Levy was Macquarie.","Caroline Levy","Thanks so much and good morning. I'm going to pivot back to China and just ask you for your perspective on the changes that might happen amongst Daigou, the resellers who buy in travel retail who I think are now required to have a tax ID to resell in China. So just to talk about whether you think there is an impact has been an impact, will be an impact and then you mentioned tariffs and we also know that there's some lower import taxes I believe in the beauty segment. So putting all these different things together, how do you think each of them play out?","Fabrizio Freda","Let me just comment on the Daigou phenomena. First of all, our travel retail business has not seen the impact from the stricter enforcement generally. So we don't see the impact so far. Is also important however to remember that we add Estee Lauder companies have a long standing policy, the limit, the numbers are products that is single consumer can buy at any country in our travel retail globally since ever. So we were never benefiting from lot of the guys do business because of our strict policies to avoid that any phenomenal ID's and obviously to limit any of these markets around the world. So this policy that is being restricting us in the past is turning probably to be an advantage today because we see less of the difference, that we believe would see less on the difference whatever will be the implication of these new legislation.","Typically as far the moment we do not see any impacts. And the other important things is that we believe in general, the items of prestige beauty at the end affordable luxurious. So people can still buy even the new regulation something which is lower price and still makes purchase again within our policy. And so this will we continue being good more actionable on low cost items than on very expensive items. And so I believe there will be also these differentiating factors overtime.","And then we continue to focus our efforts also on the drivers of our travel retail business for the long term independently from the Daigou issues. So continue to target get to the international passengers and to the rising middle class working when our corridor, we continue at really increase the distribution of our new brands, we continue the conversional travelers into shopper as I explained before also helped by the potential in the long term of the prepaid system. We continue to deliver more services in exclusivity through the channels also in terminal exclusive products. So all these great actions they we had do in the travel retail for the long term I believe as their potential to more than offset whatever would be the limitation of created by that by phenomenon. ","So that's the aspect of -- sorry, was it\u2026","Tracey Travis","And then Caroline, as it relates to China as we mentioned any expected tear offs that have been discussed we've included within our guidance. So that's certainly in our second half expectations both as it relates to the margin and in expenses. And as it relates to the import duties, yes, certainly over the last few years now, there has been a steady increase in import duties and as we stated previously we have passed their savings on to consumers. We do believe that has stimulated some of the growth in China for sure, for all of the prestige beauty players who have who have done the same. And in addition to that with some of the tax cuts that Fabrizio mentioned in our prepared remarks and that are expected to benefit Chinese consumers this year income tax cuts. That also is another stimulus that we think will support continued growth in prestige beauty.","Fabrizio Freda","And the last thing I want to add is on travel retail particularly is that, the impact of our increased advertising investment in the key countries where the big populations that travel or origin is frankly the biggest driver for travel retail. The travel retail business is driven by our ability to create demand and aspiration for our brands and our great products in the country of origin of the travels.","The travel retail business without these investments, without these great brands and great product obviously we will not flourish just because of whatever system and whatever promotion or whatever price or duty discounts. So the key idea is that what we are seeing in our travel retail business is also the results at the end of what we discussed before, meaning the Leading Beauty Forward system liberating more resources our ability to invest these resources in advertising, in the key markets and improved innovation programs that goes with it. All of this is the main driver for travel retail and we should not forget that.","Tracey Travis","And that's the main driver in China, we seen the same in Russia, Brazil and other markets that have large traveling consumers purchasing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks, good morning. I just want to ask something about the Middle East. And so that a business it's you call that is very strong I know it's been super choppy to say the least given distributor route-to-markets. So if you could just kind of give us an update on any changes you've made in the route-to-market, anything you've been able to do or maybe not to kind of smooth out in a shipment versus demand and manage that business differently then maybe than the case in two years ago.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, I do say what we have seen today is just the beginning of the plan we have to reinforce in the Middle East in many aspects because what we have seen today is more of really adjustment of the stock. If you remember when there was the biz slow down all of it sudden there were two high stocks in the market and when because of the sudden slowdown the stocks went very high, in the long chain that you just described that what happens is that people don't buy the new products first because they have stocks of the old products. In these low down even the ability to create more consumer interest, so we had been breaking these negative cycle and we have gone back to add more reasonable level of stocks which means more orders of the new and more ability to involve the consumers which is at the end what really counts on the power of our innovation and power of our brands. And doing that we have seen that an improvement off trends.","So that's the current situation. In the future, we will make further improvements that we had brands that have very high potential they can be far the leverage we have regions with Middle East which has high potential they can be far the leverage of that and we have obviously get beat it to and there is more enough sizing on the new innovation. That to be clear this is not yet in the results we have published so far but has the potential to be in the next couple years in the Middle East.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks so much.","Fabrizio Freda","You're welcome.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded and webcast. ","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D\u2019Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D\u2019Andrea","Good morning. On today\u2019s call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you\u2019ll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","Our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges, including the re-measurement charge related to Venezuela. In addition, we will generally discuss the results before the impact of accelerated retailer orders that took place in the fourth quarter of last year due to the July 2014 implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative. We will also explain the impact of the shift in sales on our fiscal 2016 first quarter and full year comparisons. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website.","And I\u2019ll turn the call over to Fabrizio.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m proud of our strong financial performance in fiscal 2015 which validated the soundness of our business strategy. We achieved very strong results which were fueled by our multiple engines abroad in all regions, despite significant currency headwinds and other unusually strong challenges and volatility.","We delivered these results by having developed a more balanced and diversified business over the large years, across brands, geographies and channels. These important characteristics have become the key pillar that will help us continue to deliver long-term sustainable profitable growth. This balance and diversity are important factors that have made our performance more reliable this year, even in the face of external situation that arose and were out of our control.","Our fourth quarter constant currency sales growth was strong, up 7%, ahead of the industry trends due to the broad global appeal of our prestige brands, and their highly coveted beauty products. That performance capped an excellent fiscal year with constant currency sales growth of more than 6%, and earnings per share growth of 12%. We are celebrating many other achievements as well.","One of our most important assets is our prestige brand portfolio, which we continue to strengthen and evolve. Our brands successfully posted fast growing markets and channels, created desirable products and attracted new consumers. Makeup is the fastest-growing category in beauty in this moment as it appears consumers are seeking for gratification of instant results.","As the global leader in prestige makeup, we are capitalizing on this trend, in our brands that are focused on makeup group sales. M\u2022A\u2022C outstanding performance was driven by its constant creativity and wider distribution. Smashbox, which is strong in the specialty multi-channel generated exceptional double-digit growth, driven by a successful array of product launches.","Bobbi Brown expanded its makeup lesson in counters globally, which served to highlight its unique products and philosophy and supported its growth. Many of our mid-sized small brands generated strong gains, especially those in the luxury tier. Jo Malone and Tom Ford fueled exceptional growth by adding a terrific range of products to their successful lines of existing fragrances, while La Mer and Origins showed solid growth in skin care. Within these categories, our brands innovation was a key contributor to our success. Sales for new products accounted for nearly 20% of our business. We launched products that resonated strongly with consumers across the board, including in fast-growing subcategories such as masks and white spaces areas for us like contouring.","Emerging markets remain a major growth engines and had become 14% of our business. Excluding China, sales in emerging markets grew 26% with the strongest performance in Brazil, Russia and Turkey. Our China business grew 6% with every one of our 14 brands there posting gains. We now had a presence in nearly 100 cities, having added 18 new cities during the year. We continue to expand our digital presence in China, further penetrating the largest market for e-commerce in the world.","Our e-commerce sales there more than doubled. And we expanded a number of brands, sites on Tmall to Ford by launching Origins and La Mer. Bobbi Brown plans to join Tmall next month. Our best performing regions was Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where sales growth greatly outpaced prestige beauty growth, allowing us to gain share in all markets and in most brands. Our UK business grew double digit for the second straight year.","The EMEA region\u2019s success came from implementing key corporate strategies such expanding emerging markets, smaller brands and direct to consumer channels to broaden our reach among a wide array of consumers. Globally, our direct-to-consumer channels are increasing, resonating with shoppers and contributed to our strong performance. Maintaining strong momentum, e-commerce grew nearly 30% and was vibrant around the world, reflecting higher traffic and conversion.","During the year, we opened 130 freestanding stores across several brands with the majority of these openings for M\u2022A\u2022C. We now operate over 1,000 freestanding stores, which provide a more complete brand immersion and their sales also rose double digits. And we have another 360 freestanding stores operated through distributors.","We successfully completed the last major wave of our Strategic Modernization Initiative one year ago, which allowed us to more fully focus on realizing value from the additional capabilities. The program delivered the working capital improvements we achieved this year, particularly in inventory and payables. Looking at our bottom line, a lower tax rate and share count reduction for our stock repurchase program also helped drive our EPS performance. These were the major elements that led to our results in fiscal year 2015.","We also looked toward our future growth and expanded our portfolio by acquiring four brands, a complete and certain fast-growing subcategories of beauty we identified. We have begun to nurture and integrate them into our business. I believe they have terrific potential for the long-term growth.","We achieved our performance while navigating a number of micro challenges that included considerable currency fluctuations which cause the shift in travelers\u2019 buying patterns, a lingering downturn in Hong Kong that curtailed travel by high-spending Chinese visitors continue its lower economy growth in China, and a sharp drop-off in travelers to Macau. The travel retail channel was negatively impacted by these factors, as well as the MERS outbreak in Korea.","There were also fewer high-spending consumer travelling particularly, Chinese, Brazilians and Russians. This global issue had a more significant impact on two of our largest brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, which represents over 40% of sales. They were also affected by softness in certain department stores in the U.S. and China caused by lower spending.","The balance of our portfolio collectively grew double-digits allowing us to generate excellent constant currency growth in both sales and earnings per share. We expect continuous strong growth trends in fiscal year 2016. But the growth engines will continue to evolve. We have updated our 10-year compass to position our brands in the most promising and fastest-growing areas for the near and long-term. By being agile, we will allocate our resources to where we expect the best returns on our investments.","Global prestige beauty is dynamic and highly competitive. It is undergoing unprecedented changes involving how and where consumers shop, and where they learn about the kinds of products and experiences they desire. Our strategy is working precisely because we anticipated many of the opportunities stemming from this environment and invested in the fastest-growing areas to capitalize on this new shopping patterns and habits.","This is an exciting time to be a major player in global prestige beauty. The industry is expected to grow again by 4% to 5%, driven by favorable demographics, a growing middle class that aspires to prestige beauty products, and a constant stream of increasing launches.","As an industry leader with an unparalleled portfolio of authentic aspirational brands well suited to consumers around the world, we are uniquely positioned to capture a larger share of consumer beauty choices. We believe that emerging market consumers will continue to be one of the best growth drivers, both in local market and as they travel along key corridors.","As a result, we are accelerating our expansion in key countries such as Turkey where we are building on our growth and adding seven new freestanding retail store for M\u2022A\u2022C, Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Jo Malone in the first quarter alone. In China, we also plan to continue strengthening our brand portfolio as well as accelerated our makeup and fragrance businesses. We expect to enter about a dozen new cities this fiscal year, expand distribution across all our channels and lever us our organization infrastructures and capabilities. Our heritage markets are an essential contributor to our growth plans. Our UK business is expected to remain robust, fueled by continuous trends in our portfolio including gains from our largest brands, as well as the expansion of new brands in the market.","We expect solid increases from department stores which have been a strong channel and we will accelerate our digital initiative and selectively increase our penetration in smaller cities with freestanding stores. We are also opening stores in high traffic location that aren\u2019t typical retail venues such as our interactive pop-up shop in the Piccadilly Circus tube station.","In the U.S., we are evolving the consumer experience and service model through exciting in-store merchandising in higher traffic location. They will distort and enhance our brand messages to resonate with consumers and drive the greater conversion. We are working with our department store partners to bring more traffic in their stores to the beauty floor. When we attract consumers to our counters, we expect to convert more of them into buyers by featuring our newest products and personalized High-Touch services.","Additionally, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is launching special collection of makeup and skin care developed for the North America Sephora stores, and their millennial consumers. Called the Est\u00e9e Edit by Est\u00e9e Lauder, the collection is designed for this consumer and channel and will be supported by digital marketing and social media. The Est\u00e9e Edit, along with Est\u00e9e Lauder best-selling skin care products will launch in March over 250 Sephora stores in the U.S. and Canada, and on sephora.com.","Regarding our channels globally, our online sales are projected to continue growing strong double digits. We also plan to accelerate our freestanding store opening around the world both directly operated and through distributors. We expect to add more than 250 store this year, mostly in foreign markets for M A C, Jo Malone and Bobbi Brown. As we expand our retail store footprint, we are building capabilities to improve our operation and omni-channel initiative as well as our efficiency and productivity.","To continue our growth in specialty multi-retailers, we are selectively expanding our distribution by adding the brands with the best fit in the retailers that are winning around the world. In the U.S., Bluemercury is expected to open more stores and location inside select Macy\u2019s. Our luxury brands are well-represented in Bluemercury, and we expect to benefit from the chain expansion.","Another way we are increasing our presence in specialty-multi is by acquiring new brands that are strong in the channel such as GLAMGLOW. Newness has always been paramount in beauty, and in today\u2019s crowded beauty aisle, it is even more critical. We believe this environment favors our respected brands that place a premium on creativity and quality. Our innovation pipeline is strong, and we are emphasizing new sub-category, speed to market and products with widespread consumer appeal. Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique had exciting plans underway to generate improved results this year, and that involves balancing their innovation across categories and demographics.","Est\u00e9e Lauder recent launches of its New Dimension franchise of contouring products is an initiative in a white space area for the brand. The collection rolled out in North America in late July and will be followed by all other markets in September. This fall, in Est\u00e9e Lauder top-selling Double Wear foundation franchise will be introducing an innovative new compact called Double Wear Makeup To Go. And to build on its successful Modern Muse fragrance franchise, the brand is introducing Modern Muse Le Rouge. The launch will be supported by TV, digital and print campaign featuring the brand\u2019s newest model, Kendall Jenner. And we plan to leverage her substantial social media forum.","Clinique has launched a new global campaign named Face Forward to introduce Clinique icon in best-selling 3-Steps product to millennials. The campaign focuses on young women influencers who are dynamic, accomplished and on the cusp of greatness. These influencers inspire young women and they can face everything in life, and with Clinique, they can face forward. Clinique has several initiatives underway to reinforce its authority in the entry price point of prestige beauty and its position in makeup, which go hand-in-hand and should help fuel its total business. Early results are encouraging. In the last two quarters of fiscal 2015, the brand\u2019s makeup sales increased. Clinique is focusing on several of its winning makeup franchises and extended them this year with new products. This includes 3-Step, Beyond Perfecting, Chubby Sticks and Clinique Pop Lip Colour and Primer.","Clinique is also striving to establish its strength in skin care with key launches, including new moisturizer under the successful Smart franchise. We believe the combination of exciting makeup and skin care launches compelling market and target to millennial consumers and focused distribution expansion will work to turn around this large important brand. M\u2022A\u2022C again expects to post double-digit growth by sticking to what the brand is and what it does best, a fashion trendsetter that creates fun, unexpected and edgy collaborations and products with a highly talented group of makeup artists in its stores and counters.","Our mid-size brands had a strong trajectory ahead. We have an enviable track record of developing small brands into sizable ones. In the last five years, Jo Malone had tripled in size and La Mer sales more than doubled, becoming our fourth largest brands. These success stories inspired our recent acquisition and the potential we see in them. In our four newest brands, we are connecting the creativity with our extensive industry knowledge as we develop new products, expand distribution and strengthen their digital platforms and communications.","Digital marketing and social media clearly continue to grow in importance. Across our brands globally, we are devoting capability building resources to strengthen our talent in the digital space, creating our ability to further grow via new technology that enhance our storytelling and maximize consumer engagement. Our brands are also leveraging key influencers online and developing real-time content to create ongoing communication with consumers.","The implementation of our SAP platform is enabling greater visibility into various aspect of our business, such as indirect procurement, advertising and promotion and corporate services. This allows us to analyze our expenses to determine efficiencies and effectiveness and take actions where appropriate. Benefits derived from this area built into our profitability forecast, while continuing to allow for a portion of the savings to be reinvested in additional growth capabilities. This should give you a good sense of the many plans we have underway to maintain our momentum in fiscal year 2016.","We are well positioned in a vibrant industry that continues to expand even in volatile times. We remain confident about our ability to deliver strong and reliable results. Thanks to our well-diversified business and successful strategy. We expect to continue to outpace global prestige beauty growth by at least 1% point annually due to the far-reaching consumer appeal of our brands around the world, and the exceptional quality of our products.","Thanks to our multiple engines of strong growth in numerous countries and channels, coupled with the excellent momentum in many of our brands, our goal this year is to again deliver superior sales growth, double-digit EPS gains and greater stockholder value. Our company made tremendous strides in fiscal 2015. Most importantly, we demonstrated by being both well diversified and agile, we can quickly alter our game plan when needed to react to changing market conditions and still achieve our goals. For this, all our employees deserve credit, and I thank them for their dedication and hard work. Together, we have produced another year of excellent results and look forward to a bright future ahead.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Travis","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I will briefly review our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter and full year financial results, and then share with you our expectations for fiscal 2016. Please note that my commentary excludes the year-over-year impact of restructuring and other charges primarily the Venezuela re-measurement charges. Also excluded is the impact of the acceleration of retailer orders that otherwise would have occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 related to our July 2014 rollout of SMI. The impact of that shift was $178 million in sales and $127 million in operating income, equal to approximately $0.21 per share. This shift created difficult comparisons for the first quarter, the fourth quarter and the full year of fiscal 2015, and will also create comparability issues for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2016.","Now, for the fourth quarter, net sales came in at $2.52 billion, which was 7% growth in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed 50 basis points of this sales growth. Net earnings were $153 million compared with $175.2 million in the prior-year quarter reflecting increased door openings, investments in information technology and in R&D and product development.","Diluted EPS of $0.40 came in above the top end of our expectations primarily due to continued disciplined expense management. Reflected in the EPS for the quarter was approximately $0.02 of dilution from acquisitions, and currency translation was unfavorable by $0.07.","Looking at our business by region for the quarter, net sales in the Americas increased 12% in constant currency. We had strong double-digit growth in Latin America which came primarily from the continued great growth of M\u2022A\u2022C in Brazil and also in Mexico. We also had a high single digit increase in North America, which reflected good sales growth in both the U.S. and Canada, and was led by the online and specialty multi channels as well as improved sales to department stores.","In the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, net sales increased 3% in constant currency. Many markets in the region benefited from increased tourism, largely due to the weaker euro. We achieved double-digit sales gains in the UK, the Balkans, Benelux and many emerging markets including Turkey, Russia, and South Africa.","The larger markets of France, Germany and Italy collectively grew low single digits, while we saw softer results in Spain. Our sales in the travel retail channel declined 4% despite strong retail sales, primarily reflecting the impact of the MERS outbreak on inbound travel to Korea, continued weakness in travel to Hong Kong and Macau, and the related customer destocking and currency-driven softness in other travel retail locations such as Hawaii and Brazil.","Sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose 4% in constant currency, led by double-digit gains in China, Australia, New Zealand and Thailand. Japan contributed solid growth as we anniversary the impact of the VAT increase last year and benefited from higher tourism due to the weaker yen, while Korea grew low-single digits. Hong Kong remained weak, reflecting the decline in tourism and Taiwan sales declined on weak \u2013 a continued weak retail trends. Net sales by product category rose double digits in most categories for the quarter.","Skin care was the exception with sales declining 2% in constant currency. Increases from La Mer and Origins and incremental sales from GLAMGLOW reflected in part the continued growing popularity of sub categories like masks. However, these gains were more than offset by the declines in skin care at Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique across serums and moisturizers. Sales in the makeup category rose 10% in constant currency, led by the continued strength of M\u2022A\u2022C, Smashbox and Bobbi Brown. The expansion and growth of Tom Ford Beauty also contributed to the category.","Both Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique posted modest growth in makeup in the quarter as they benefited from some recent new product launches and marketing activities in the category. Sales of fragrance products jumped 26% in constant currency. Continued strength in high-end fragrances from Jo Malone and Tom Ford combined with incremental sales from our recent acquisitions were the main drivers. The category benefited also from initial shipments of the new Michael Kors Gold Collection which launched in July.","In hair care, sales rose 10% in constant currency. Aveda launched thickening tonic and new products in its Be Curly line. The brand increased distribution across channels in the UK and Asia and delivered strong salon sales in Western Europe. Bumble and bumble is also seeing continued strength in the specialty-multi and online channel.","Our gross margin increased 30 basis points to 80.7% primarily related to favorable currency in some channel mix. Operating expenses as a percent of sales rose 110 basis points to 71.6%. The primary driver was higher selling and store operations cost of 100 basis points to largely to new store openings in the quarter related to our retail store expansion strategy. As a result, operating income declined 9% to $228.3 million, and operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 9.1%.","Turning to the full year, as Fabrizio indicated, we delivered strong full year results while navigating a number of challenges most notably the significant strengthening of the dollar, and its multiple impacts on both translation and consumer travel. Net sales rose 2% to $11 billion. Excluding the effects of currency translations, sales grew more than 6% even without the acquisitions, which contributed 30 basis points.","Net earnings grew 2% to $1.18 billion, and diluted EPS increased 3% to $3.05, which includes $0.05 of dilution from the acquisitions. Unfavorable currency translation impacted EPS by $0.24. In constant currency, diluted EPS rose 12% for the year. Once again, our sales growth was broad-based across regions and product categories.","Gross margin increased 20 basis points to 80.5%. The increase came primarily from favorable pricing, currency and channel mix, partially offset by the higher cost of some new product introductions. Operating expenses as a percent of sales rose 40 basis points to 64.6%. The increase was primarily due to the impact of higher retail store operations cost reflecting the increase in the number of company-operated freestanding retail stores, acquisition costs, as well as investments in information technology. These increases were partially offset by approximately $100 million from our cost savings initiatives and leverage in our overall marketing and advertising cost, reflecting the rapid growth of brands with less traditional marketing spend as well as the shift of media investment from traditional to digital.","Operating income rose slightly to $1.74 billion and operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 15.9%. Our operating margin was unfavorably impacted by 30 basis points from acquisitions and 40 basis points from unfavorable currency. Excluding these factors, our operating margin would have expanded by 50 basis points. Net interest expense improved 10% to $45.7 million, primarily due to higher interest and investment income this year.","Our effective tax rate for the year was 30.3%, a 60 basis point improvement from fiscal 2014, driven primarily by a reduction in the effective tax rate related to our foreign operations. All major elements of working capital improved in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year. This was largely driven by the continued progress in our supply chain service initiatives which helped improve inventory days to sell by eight days at 190 days to sell at year-end.","The decreased days were also driven by favorable currency translation, which was partially offset by higher inventory to meet demand for our sales objectives for the fall season and increase in the number of freestanding retail stores and the addition of new inventory from our acquisitions. For the fiscal year, on a reported basis, we generated approximately $1.9 billion of cash flow from operating activities, an increase of 27% or $408 million versus the prior-year period.","We invested $473 million in capital projects, principally in counters, new retail stores and information technology. We used $241 million for acquisitions and given that the bulk of our remaining cash was overseas. In June, we took advantage of the favorable rate environment, and issued $300 million of 30-year senior notes at 4.375%.","We returned more than 90% of our reported free cash flow to stockholders during fiscal 2015 through dividends and share repurchase activity. We repurchased approximately 12.4 million shares of stock for $983 million, reduced our diluted shares outstanding by more than 7 million shares from the prior year period, we also used $350 million to pay dividends to stockholders, which reflected a 20% increase in the quarterly dividend rate, and a payout ratio of nearly 30%.","The combination of our increasing dividend and strong stock performance this fiscal year delivered total stockholder return of 18.1%, significantly higher than the average of our peer group, and more than double the 7.4% return of the S&P 500 over the same period.","Looking ahead, our strategic view of opportunities remains unchanged even as we evolve our tactics based on the learnings of the past year. Our goal remains to exceed global prestige beauty sales growth by at least one percentage point annually, and we expect to achieve that goal with top line growth of 6% to 8% annually in constant currency.","As Fabrizio said, we achieved above-industry results through the strength of our brand portfolio, investing behind the fastest consumer growth areas and distinctive new innovation.","Geographically, we continue to expect rapid expansion in emerging markets, reflecting the increasing disposable income of a growing middle class. In developed markets, we plan to optimize our brand portfolio and selectively increase penetration in smaller cities. Looking at our distribution channels, we continue to see great momentum in E&M commerce, travel retail, freestanding retail stores, and the specialty multi-retailers. We expect omni-channel initiatives to evolve the way consumers experience brands across all channels and drive higher sales as a result. And importantly, our superb brand portfolio allows us to deploy the right brands with the right products for each channel, geography or demographic opportunity we see.","We are working to stabilize and grow our Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique brands, continue the rapid growth of our makeup and luxury brands, and expand our newest brands. We remain open to further acquisition opportunities and continue to target an average of 1% point of sales growth from acquisitions over the three-year time horizon.","Flexibility, agility and the strength of our execution are crucial for our company to compete in a rapidly evolving dynamic industry. This means that in any year as we have done, we must be able to allocate resources to tools and capabilities to evolving and dynamic geographic, brand, product or channel opportunities. At the same time, our goal is to produce double-digit EPS growth in constant currency each year.","Sales growth is an important driver of our long-term growth and value creation, and it is expected to account for more than half of our expected EPS growth over the next three years. We will continue to annually progress margin expansion and combined with share repurchase and effective tax rate reduction, we will deliver our EPS goals.","When we set our three-year margin goal last year, the currency assumptions were much different than they are today. As I mentioned earlier, adverse currency movements curtailed our fiscal 2015 operating margin by 40 basis points and will also have an impact in fiscal 2016. Additionally, the four new brands we acquired are expected to be slightly dilutive for the next few years.","Over the next three years, we will further leverage our investments in SMI to accelerate cost savings while investing in capabilities needed to increase our competitiveness. We see three major areas contributing to operating margin expansion. About one-quarter of the improvements are expected in gross margin from a combination of pricing, channel mix, and SMI-enabled cost of goods reductions. About two-thirds of the improvement are expected to come from our SMI-enabled cost savings initiatives including indirect procurement, A&P effectiveness, and other programs targeted to improve the efficiency of our operations, and the remainder is expected to come from productivity.","These benefits will be partially offset by investment to turn around our Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique brands, further expand and support our retail stores, further develop our digital and omni-channel tools, and build capabilities and talent across all of these areas. With these factors taken into account, we now expect further cumulative operating margin expansion of approximately 90 basis points to 130 basis points in constant currency through fiscal 2018. The annual improvement may vary by year based on both the momentum of the business and the opportunity for investment to drive profitable growth.","Working capital improvement is another goal enabled by SMI. Today, we have greater visibility into our inventory globally and the SMI program, along with other tools, assists us in improving turnover through better forecasting and demand planning, which should also help to reduce out of stocks.","At the same time, we are often getting the fastest growth from countries that are more distant from our production facilities and therefore require longer lead times for transit. Still, we have already begun to see the net benefits begin to accrue from our SMI efforts, and we are targeting inventory days to sell improvement to approximately 155 days by the end of fiscal 2018.","While inventory is the largest area of opportunity, we expect improved performance across all of our working capital drivers. If we achieve our goals over the three-year time horizon, we expect to free up approximately $300 million to $400 million in additional cash from our accounts payable, accounts receivable and inventory level, which will greatly accelerate our growth and cash flow from operations.","Now, let me discuss our outlook for the fiscal 2016 full year and first quarter. The sales shift related to last year\u2019s SMI rollout will impact comparisons to the prior year in both the first quarter and full fiscal year. I\u2019ll discuss our expectations, adjusting for the impact of the shift.","Our forecasted growth rates both before and after the shift impact are available in today\u2019s earnings release for your reference. For the full year, sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 8% in constant currency. All regions are expected to contribute to that growth, led by EMEA; and all product categories are forecasted to grow, led by fragrance and makeup. Pricing is expected to contribute between 1.5% and 2%, continued distribution expansion for most of our brands is expected to contribute between 2% and 3% of growth. Last year\u2019s acquisitions will add an incremental 50 basis points, and the remainder is from sales growth and existing distribution as well as new innovation.","Currency translation is estimated to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 3% to 4%. Our estimate assumes weighted average exchange rates for the full year of $1.07 for the euro, $1.51 for the pound and $1.26 for the yen. We are leveraging SMI to create value for the organization through greater efficiencies and cost savings. We have a strong governance process in place to support our value creation team efforts and ensure continuous cost improvements.","In fiscal 2016, we will generate expense leverage through our value creation initiatives which are expected to garner over $200 million in savings primarily from indirect procurement, A&P optimization and cost of goods efficiencies. And we continue to look at opportunities that will produce progressive cost savings. To support and sustain our long-term growth, we will reinvest a portion of the savings behind the turnaround of our Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique brands, further expansion of retail stores, R&D and innovation, information technology and talent. We will continue to be nimble with our resource allocation which impacts the quarterly cadence of our spending.","For fiscal 2016, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 29% to 30%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.10 and $3.17 including $0.05 of dilution from acquisitions. Compared to our fiscal 2015 EPS of $3.05, before charges and the accelerated orders, EPS is expected to grow between 2% and 4%. The projected three percentage to four percentage points of adverse currency translation on sales in fiscal 2016 equates to about $0.18 of EPS. In constant currency, we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 10%.","In fiscal 2016, on a reported basis, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $1.8 billion. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately 5% of sales, which will primarily support consumer-facing investments in counters, retail stores, and online site development as well as systems, facilities and manufacturing.","We will review our capital structure annually \u2013 we review our capital structure annually with the board, and we do not expect any major changes in our philosophy for this fiscal year. We prefer to maintain strong credit ratings, which gives us flexibility to access cash at favorable rates. We have distributed an average of 100% of annual free cash flow to our stockholders over the last four years through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We have room to grow our dividend while maintaining a sustainable payout ratio, and as of June 30, we had approximately 28 million shares remaining on our buyback authorization.","Looking at our first quarter, we expect sales to rise approximately 6% to 7% in constant currency. Translation can hinder growth by approximately six percentage points to seven percentage points. We will support a strong start to the new fiscal year by making choiceful investments in our first quarter to achieve this. We expect incremental investment behind new product launches, notably Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s New Dimension, store expansion, and our new brands. We also will make further investments in Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique turnarounds and in information technology.","The initial impact of the MERS outbreak in Korea during last fiscal year\u2019s fourth quarter is continuing into our first quarter and pressuring our profitable travel retail business. Also weighing on profits this quarter is continued weakness in some other areas including Hong Kong and Macau, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation [ph] vesting and acquisition-related expenses. At this time, we anticipate that EPS will be between $0.66 and $0.69. The adverse currency translation on sales for the first quarter equates to about $0.09 of EPS.","In closing, let me reiterate that we are pleased with the performance we delivered in fiscal 2015 and with the opportunities we just shared with you and with the business that is increasingly more balanced and reliable than ever, we intend to continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth.","So that concludes our prepared remarks and at this time, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good morning. So on the long-term margin targets, clearly FX and acquisitions are pressure points, but I was hoping you could comment a bit on your ability to generate some incremental productivity internally to at least bridge some of that gap from these external issues. And given your efficiency in margin gap versus peers, why there's not more of a sense of urgency in attacking the productivity to deal with some of those external issues. Thanks.","Tracey Travis","So, when you look at the margin guidance, the cumulative margin guidance that we gave over the next couple of years, if you take into consideration both the foreign exchange impact from last year as well as what we called out for this year in terms of impact and the initial dilution from our acquisitions, which should mitigate in the 2017 to 2018 timeframe, but 2015 and 2016 we\u2019re seeing dilution. We are actually relatively close to where we had guided to at the end of last year on that 17.5%. So, we do think that given both the currency impact that we\u2019ve had and the acquisitions that we chose to do, we are in line with our prior guidance.","Since that guidance, a few other things have happened. Clearly, the strength or the strong foreign exchange impact has impacted some of our channels like travel retail. The MERS impact is having us start off this year with a bit of a softer impact and we feel it\u2019s very important for us to invest in Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. So the balance that we have, which is why we\u2019ve actually increased our cost savings plans in order to do some of the funding that we need to support those programs and that\u2019s important for us in terms of long-term growth.","Fabrizio Freda","I would like also to add one thing to this question, to this answer is that as you\u2019ve mentioned sense of urgency, there is an enormous sense of urgency in the company to continue to grow margin and we are fully committed to it. The \u2013 already in the 17.5% that we communicated at that time, there was a lot of cost savings included.","Second, we have increased them, and as Tracey has explained, we will continue to look into that and maybe find even more opportunities but there is commitment to that. The point is, however, that also investment needs and investment opportunity also had been increasing. And our decision is to make sure that we keep focused on the long-term growth and sustainable growth of the company. And so we are leveraging cost savings but also continue focusing on the investment needs and opportunities to keep the company growing the best possible way.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray.","Steph Wissink","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Tracey, a question for you. When we were sitting at this point last year and you had guided to 2015, I think you had guided to 5% and 6% top line growth constant currency and EPS growth of 7% to 10%. If we compare that to your growth going forward for 2016, 6% to 8% top line and 8% to 10% bottom line, can you just help us characterize the differences in that top line guidance and the relative flow-through to EPS looking ahead versus hindsight looking to the prior year? Thank you.","Tracey Travis","Yeah. I mean, the growth levers that we have in fiscal 2016 are much like they were in fiscal 2015. So, one of the things that we saw in fiscal 2015 that we just spoke about was the tremendous strength of the makeup category. So, we certainly expect continued strong growth out of all of our makeup brands. One of the other things that we saw was more softness in skin care. And that certainly affected Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique and we are expecting better performance in skin care in fiscal 2016 than we saw in fiscal 2015 and therefore better performance for Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique.","In terms of the flow-through to profit, with all of the mix impact that we have from channel mix and category mix, we don\u2019t expect a tremendous amount of gross profit margin expansion, but some. So, that \u2013 the leverage that we will get will be in the expense area. And as I indicated, certainly over the next three years, we expect a one-third split between margin expansion and gross profit margin and two-thirds coming from expense leverage.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, guys, I just wanted one clarification and a real question. The clarification remains around the cost cutting plan, which even if you take out the currencies and take out the impact from acquisition, it just doesn't seem like SAP is allowing you to accelerate much at all whether it be from margin or whether it be from inventory. So if you just take another shot at helping us out on that that would be helpful. ","The other question is to try to get a better understanding on the channel diversity strategy which has certainly helped and I guess I have questions around three areas. One is the travel retail impact from the Chinese luxury tax change. Two is how we should think about your ROIC and margin given the ramp-up significantly now to 1,000 of freestanding stores? And then three is how have you guys analyzed the brand risk of Est\u00e9e Lauder into Sephora? Thanks for all those.","Tracey Travis","Well, that\u2019s a multi-part question. So, let me start with the SMI savings. Ali, we believe this year based on what we\u2019ve communicated, we had very good results from SMI. As you know, we went live in July of this year. It does take some time for the team to get familiar with really optimizing SMI and our biggest markets went live in July. So, the fact that we were able to generate $100 million of cost savings and we are doubling that next year, we believe is very good progress. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we believe that there is more savings out there to gain over the next few years. So, our internal plan call for increasing levels of savings every year related to SMI-enabled programs.","As it relates to working capital, going from what was 200 days to sell to 155 days to sell is in the timeframe that we\u2019re indicating is pretty great progress. And so, we certainly, as we always do, will try to exceed those levels of improvement. But being able to free up $300 million to $400 million of cash over this timeframe is obviously very good for us, very good for our shareholders, and allows us the opportunity to either invest in more ROIC-driven projects or return more to shareholders. So, that\u2019s a good thing. So, I think we believe that we\u2019ve got a very strong program and we certainly, to Fabrizio\u2019s point, are committed to continuing to look for even greater savings.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah. And in answer to your other 3-in-1 questions is on, TR we believe there is enough price differential in the TR channel to continue growing the part of TR business which is driven by price differentials. I want also to underline that a lot of the TR business is driven by conversion and marketing and error reports and other activities, particularly true for makeup where the absolute price differential is much inferior to fragrances, skin care and is growing actually in this moment faster than skin care. So the impact on TR of the tax difference in China we believe would be moderate and anyway there are other growth drivers in TR, which have the potential to more than offset that. ","The second is the freestanding store \u2013 the impact of freestanding store expansion on margin and ROIC, we believe [ph] you should look at the total business, meaning that some of our freestanding stores are very, very productive, particularly the one on market Jo Malone for the time being. In this case, the impact actually is positive.","But also you need to think that the overall margin of online is higher, travel retail is higher. Some of the more productive freestanding store is higher; part of the specialty multi around the world is higher. So the combination of all these factors makes actually the channel mix favorable rather than unfavorable if we continue to drive our strategy the way we are.","The last question on Est\u00e9e Lauder in Sephora, we believe this is an important step forward for the brand. I personally don't believe there is a risk, actually this is very good news for the ability to modernize, rejuvenate the brand in front of the millennial consumer. That is a specific goal of this action. Sephora in the U.S. has an excellent penetration on millennial consumers and the ability of the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand to tailor its activity to this consumer will have also a positive halo effect on the entire brand nationally in our opinion. So all good, we are pretty excited about this move.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thank you. I want to talk a little bit about the staying power of the impact of brand strength because it looks like your outlook implies that you're expecting local currency sales growth to accelerate as the year progresses, even though the benefit from acquisition lapse and the pace of investment spend also decelerates, clearly have a much bigger delta and investment spend at the beginning of the year and less so as the year progresses. So can you talk about the staying power of the impact of brand spend and if your expectations have changed relative to what you've seen in the past and if so what are the key drivers behind that?","Tracey Travis","So, one of the things that we\u2019re seeing is quite a shift in terms of how we spend relative to brands. So, we\u2019ve talked a lot, Olivia, about the fact that the brands that are growing right now are the non-traditional advertised brands. They\u2019re the brands that have an in-store presence. They have a strong digital presence. And then from a category standpoint, as we said, makeup but also fragrance is growing in this moment. ","What we are seeing even in our more traditional advertising brands is the impact of TV moderating, still important but moderating, and the impact of digital growing. So, we have looked at balancing our investment spend across television, print, digital and in-store for those particular brands. There are also different channels that are growing. So we, too, have looked at balancing the channel mix for our brands. So, I think the strength of brands is still quite strong. We\u2019re seeing, given the online strength of digital marketing, a lot of smaller brands gaining in strength because of the channel, that channel of communication with consumers gaining in strength.","Fabrizio Freda","And on the staying power question, I'd like to add that this fourth quarter we've been growing 7% which is faster than the industry, faster than most of our competitors. And this has happened despite some important challenges for us. We spoke to it but I want to underline that Hong Kong and Macau or Korea are very important areas for us, areas where we have high market shares, where we have profitable businesses, where particularly our skin care brand and skin care category is enormously focused and then we were able to deliver ahead of market 7% strong growth despite these headwinds on top of the currency one. And then this shows actually, in my opinion, staying power and stability of our growth model even in the presence of unexpected challenges which are out of our control, like MERS as an example in the month of June which had a big impact and also in the beginning of July. So there is a lot of staying power and to Tracey's point, the rebalancing of the media spending actually is in my opinion going to increase the staying power rather than diminishing it.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","Good morning. Hey, a couple of questions. The first is, have you considered maybe just pulling the margin targets entirely? Because it seems like there's so many growth initiatives. And I think for investors top line growth and EPS growth is probably more important than a margin ratio, especially given the magnitude of some of the money you could spend to build out stores in some of the other channels, et cetera. ","And then my second question is on Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder has the world changed? Because it seems like every five years or six years the brands go through a big growth challenge as you spend a lot of money, you get them fixed again and they start to struggle thereafter. So is that 40% of sales for those two brands like a number you want to stick to? Because as they slow, it seems like the natural margin mix of the business improves pretty dramatically and I do not know the answer but it seems like just given what's happening in the prestige cosmetics world broadly speaking everything is lifting up and to the right and it's hard to take those two brands there. I'm sorry for the long-winded question.","Tracey Travis","So let me take the first part of that, Bill. As it relates to the margin guidance, the reason we\u2019ve transitioned to cumulative margin guidance is for the very reasons that you mentioned. The fact that in any given year, if we have the opportunity to invest in more freestanding stores or invest behind our acquisitions that are going to actually continue to drive above-industry sales growth and above-industry EPS growth, then that is the right strategy and decision for us, and it\u2019s the right strategy and decision for investors. So, having said that, to transition from giving annual margin guidance to EPS guidance is a bit of a transition. So, we\u2019re happy to be transparent with respect to what we\u2019re thinking and the fact that we absolutely understand we have margin opportunity and we are progressing forward on that with our cost savings initiatives and other initiatives.","Yet at the same time, there are some investments we\u2019re making that are going to be more margin challenging and others that will be quite margin accretive. We may have a year where we have an 80-basis-point margin expansion and we may have one that we have 20 basis points. But what we are saying is we will have double-digit EPS growth, so your comment is well taken.","Fabrizio Freda","And also on this one, I want to add that in this volatile world which is in front of us it is where agility is a key driver of success. We wanted also to ensure we had multiple drivers for our ultimate goal of double-digit EPS growth. And so the multiple driver is certainly growth is important, margin will continue to be important, but we have other taxes, we have the share repurchase and share count. So we have different drivers that can deliver more constantly even in a volatile world. So we are stronger and we believe our point of view is becoming actually stronger and more reliable every year.","On your question on Lauder and Clinique, Lauder and Clinique are very important brands for us and they are excellent brands with a great equity around the world. We can share the equity results of these brands, there are brands that huge appreciation and penetration among many different consumers around the world. So, those are important assets of the company and we want to continue to build on these assets. However, they are very big brands and so they have big brands with broad distribution and a very broad distribution. So, I believe the most important thing for these brands that they are more exposed to the new volatilities of the world than the smaller brands which have limited distribution and very specific consumer groups that like them.","For example, in this moment, what we have seen in the last year meaning the crisis in Hong Kong, the crisis in Macau, now the flu in Korea and the slowdown of the growth of China, all these factors had a tremendous impact on Lauder and Clinique. And particularly on the skin care business on Lauder and Clinique which is very visible. And frankly these factors which are external have a bigger impact than what one innovation can do in the course of six months. So, these brands are \u2013 have been more difficult to turn around than the small brands because they are so broad in distribution and so big. But anyway we remain determined to drive them and to leverage the great assets that their equity represents for the company.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy","Hi, there. Good morning. I'm just wondering on pricing given the devaluation we have seen some companies take more pricing, you're sticking to the 1.5% to 2% as a global number and I'm wondering if you see any upside to that. And then how many stores \u2013 standalone stores could you envision on a four-year to five-year basis if [indiscernible] company operated to date that would be very helpful. Thank you.","Tracey Travis","Okay. So, in terms of pricing, as we\u2019ve shared in the past, Caroline, we have and you know we have a pretty sophisticated pricing process. In any given year, we look at all of our markets. We look at our traveling corridors and we adjust pricing either up, mostly up. But in some cases, we actually adjust it down if \u2013 for currency reasons, et cetera. So, this past fiscal year, we actually did take pricing up in some markets like Venezuela, Russia and other markets as well. And we did adjust some prices down as we indicated also. ","So, the 1.5% to 2% represents a combination of price adjustments both up and down, most up obviously given the net for the fiscal year. But we absolutely do look at currency competition and many other market factors when we establish pricing for all of our markets.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah. And on freestanding stores, we will continue to drive freestanding store on some of our brands. Not all of our brands are designed to have a winning and successful freestanding store model as part of the total model. But in general, we are continuing to expand. And particularly, we are continuing to expand where there is not sufficient high-quality distribution in specialty or department store or other models. And the important thing is that the other [ph] evolution will be on the channel, meaning the ability to connect the stores with the online.","And so, wherever there is not good alternative distribution freestanding store well-connected to online are proving to be an enormous opportunity to make the brand successful even in absence of high-end prestige distribution available. A typical example of this has been Brazil where without the freestanding store and the online business of M A C, M A C today could not be the market leader there in absence of the typical counter distribution that in Brazil is not available. So, freestanding store, we continue to increase, again, we are not in a condition to give you a specific number but it continues to increase and will make our ability to reach the new consumer of the world much stronger than it was in the past.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Powers with UBS.","Steve Powers","Thanks. I just want to go back to the margin guidance and just make sure I have my facts straight. So you used to be at 17.5% for fiscal 2017 and now it sounds like off an adjusted fiscal 2015 base of what I think is 15.9%...","Tracey Travis","Right.","Steve Powers"," \u2026 it sounds like you're guiding to basically 17.2% at the high-end one year later. So annually, you've gone from a 50-basis-point run rate to 30 basis points to 40 basis points. So, I guess just going back to the earlier discussions, how much of that gap is really just the differing FX environments versus something more structural? It sounds like you're investing more in advertising, in new channels. It sounds like brands like Clinique and Est\u00e9e are not quite where you want them to be. So, I'm just trying to figure out the gap there. That's my just clarifying question. ","And then, Tracey, the working capital improvements that you target, how much of those will accrue to the U.S. versus overseas markets? Because I just want to gauge how much of that cash will be accessible without tax implications versus just building on the balance sheet? Thanks.","Tracey Travis","Okay. So as it relates to the margin, you are correct that the starting point is 15.9%, and as we spoke in our prepared remarks, currency between 2015 and 2016 accounts for about 70 basis points. Acquisitions accounts for about 30 basis points. So that kind of bridges some of the difference between what \u2013 where we were at previously and where we\u2019re at today. It\u2019s primarily currency and the acquisitions, which were not foreseen when we obviously gave the three-year guidance previously at 17.5%. And so that\u2019s that explanation.","As it relates to working capital and where cash is generated, we called out and as you\u2019ve seen from our results, we\u2019ve got strong growth overseas which we expect that that will continue. Our working capital improvements will be across the board. So, some of them certainly will be in the U.S. We have our largest manufacturing operation here in the U.S. and some of them will be overseas as well. So, it will be a combination of both. I can\u2019t give you a precise split at this point in time. You certainly have seen that our tax rate has come down this year and is expected to come down next year also. And so I think the combination of all of the strategies that we have in place will be quite favorable from a company standpoint and from a shareholder standpoint.","Operator","Your next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Tracey Travis","Good morning.","Lauren Lieberman","I just want to \u2013 good morning. I just wanted to understand a bit again about year because I've heard and I think in the press release it was a little confusing, Fabrizio in his quote and on the call has talked about a goal of double-digit local currency earnings growth and then for fiscal 2016 on that basis you're looking to do 8% to 10%. So is the reason it's not solidly double digit, is it the softness in Asia and that it disproportionately impacts Clinique and Lauder\u2019s skin care which is higher margin? Or is it that there is also a stepped-up reinvestment this year with the goal of accelerating growth in some way?","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. First of all, I'd like to say the 10% is at the top of the range and in that sense when we put something at the top of our range means that we will do our best efforts to reach it. And, however, the reason why this is not in the middle of the range this is exactly the reasons you just underlined, meaning that there is both high profit pressure in certain externally just like Hong Kong, Macau, the situation in Korea, the slowdown in China and all these factors and the fact that these external pressure happen to impact particularly the skin care part of our business and which is highly profitable and very concentrated on Lauder and Clinique.","So it is exactly the combination of these factors that we don't control what will happen out there. And so we want to be prudent in that sense and we needed to be able also to invest the appropriate amount of money to navigate this situation in fiscal year 2016.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Astrachan","Yeah, thanks and good morning, everybody. A question on Clinique Est\u00e9e, so what was the sales performance in 2015 and if not specific just broad strokes? And then what are the expectations for the brand in 2016 and maybe if you could just talk about that progression a little longer term? ","And then differently just switching to emerging markets, so 14% of sales today maybe talk a bit about where you can be over the next three years to five years on a percentage of business basis, again, just broader strokes. How do you benchmark your exposure versus peers and then what is the cost on the operating margin outlook to achieve that continued expansion and specifically sort of what categories lead the growth in that channel? Thank you.","Tracey Travis","So, in fiscal 2015, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique were down low-single digits in constant currency. And so, we expect them to be up in fiscal 2016 low-single digits. So, that\u2019s the difference between fiscal 2015 and 2016.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah. The second question was about emerging markets, so emerging markets today are 14% and we will continue to grow them in the next years. I prefer not to give you a specific number but you need to just \u2013 you can make up your numbers when you say that we are growing 6% to 8% every year in emerging markets ex-China are in this moment growing 20% plus. And China is projected to grow between 6% and 10% depending year-by-year. Those are the numbers which are emerging.","So, it will be a growing percentage of our total business. Now, what we need to invest in there as we explained China today is already more or less in line with the average of the company. And some of these emerging markets are ahead of the balance of the company. Others are in the beginning of the investment period. So overall, the investment is relatively reasonable to grow in emerging markets gradually the way we are doing it. So, this is not going to be a huge part of pressure on margin. It's rather the investment in other areas which are an important pressure on margin.","Operator","Your next question is from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. Just a couple of housekeeping things. Number one, can you give us the like door growth for your sales in China, not the retail takeaway but your sales into China. Number two, Tracey, you called out lowering the tax rate as a long-term driver of earnings growth but just looking at the progress that's already been made over the last decade, you're already below 30%. What's the five-year target for the tax rate, if you will, and I know it's subject to various geographic things and whatnot? ","But then my last question and sort of broader question is on the travel retail business because this is, whatever, it's been a tough 2015 for travel retail. Each of the quarters you've talked about it being either down in reported terms or low single-digit growth. And I have to go back to 2009 when obviously the macro was wildly worse than it is right now. So, I'm just wondering how many \u2013 you've been attributing the weakness in your travel retail to currency issues and less traffic and a little bit of MERS and a little bit of that but it just feels like the growth in the travel retail business may have structurally changed. So, I'm wondering is it that there are fewer airports that are opening, is there more competition in that channel because your growth of strong double digits in that channel seems to have evaporated? Thanks.","Tracey Travis","Okay. Let me start, Wendy, with your question on the tax rate. As we guided this year and you\u2019re right the tax rate has come down over the last few years. We guided 29% to 30% at this point. I think the low end of that guidance would be what we are prepared and again, to your point, with lots of contributing factors to think about for the longer term at the 29%.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah. And let me start on the travel retail question and then I will cover China. First of all, just to put the number straight, our travel retail business grows 6% at retail this year, which is a very solid growth which is slightly ahead of the traffic, so is a very strong number. So, I'm not sure I agree that there's been an overall [ph] travel.","It's true that it's not been double digit like it used to be in the past and the reason for that is that this was a very tough situation where you get Hong Kong, Macau travel and then you get the Korean MERS activity in June and July and other factors like the important change of certain emerging market consumers that are very heavy spenders like Russian, Brazilians and in lower part Chinese. And all these driven by currencies as well on top of by economic crisis in some of these countries like Brazil or Russia. The combination of these factors all happening at the same time including the flu in Korea, yes, have been putting pressure on travel retail. And also keep in mind that we have made the historical choice that paid out very well to focus particularly on the Asian travel retail expansion that was the driver of skin care around the world. And this part where we have historically created a very big market share has been the one hit the most in the current external situation.","We believe this is going to change. Every year there will be a different situation and we continue to believe that travel retail in the long-term will be a very strong driver of the business. And I don't think at all that our strength has evaporated. Actually, I think we've never been stronger in travel retail than today in terms of balance of brands, balance of airports and ability to grow in the future.","Second, I just want to underline, for example, in the quarter \u2013 in the last quarter, we had travel retail net sales were minus 4%, travel retail \u2013 retail that we have only until May by the way, was plus 9%. So we have been growing 9% retail. Now, June where we don't have the retail number probably was a different number impacted by the MERS in Korea, still very solid retail trend in travel retail even in the last quarter. China, our net sales in constant currency in China was 6% in the year. Our retail in China was 8% growth during the year and the like door in China was minus 1% for the year.","Tracey Travis","Which was improved from the prior year\u2019s like door growth.","Fabrizio Freda","Which was an improvement, yes, because last year, fiscal year 2014 the like door was minus 2%, so there was a little improvement.","Operator","Your next question is from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante","Hi. Good morning, everyone. I just would like a clarification with regards to the Americas growth, the 12% adjusted. So if you can break it down by North America, how much was acquisitions, how much was retail sales? And then I was surprised to see that you flagged Venezuela as a contributor because there have been [ph] scarcity to \u2013 for currency for necessities and I don't think that your categories qualify for that. That's a clarification. My question is whether you are experiencing margin degradation in department stores in the U.S. and whether you expect with the launches in Sephora that that margin degradation is going to worsen? If that happens, is it possible that you would shut down the less profitable doors in department stores in the U.S.? Thank you.","Tracey Travis","Okay, Javier. Let me start with the Americas growth and the components of that growth. So, as I said in my prepared remarks, Latin America which is certainly small relative to North America but it did grow strong double-digits and that was driven by Brazil and Mexico largely, but also Venezuela. Obviously, there\u2019s the inflationary environment in Venezuela, so that is one of the markets where we did take pricing and that has nothing to do with cash repatriation or anything like that.","As it relates to the U.S. and Canada, we had high-single digit, mid- to high-single-digit growth. So, again, a strong quarter for the overall Americas and those were the components.","On the acquisitions, this year, again, they were acquired at different points during the year, mostly in the latter part of the year. So, we had about roughly $30 million in sales from the acquisitions this year. So, a relatively small amount, most of that in the Americas, some of it though overseas as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle and some of the other brands also have sales overseas.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah. On the margin in department store, now, we are having a big stable margin situation in department stores in the U.S. And as far as the Est\u00e9e Lauder expansion in Sephora, we believe this will benefit the overall equity of Est\u00e9e Lauder and in turn this will benefit the growth in every single channel. We don't believe this will be a negative for department stores at all.","Operator","Your next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good morning, everyone. You talked a lot about millennials and different strategies to capture millennials. Where do you see the greatest opportunities? And will the level of product innovation, should we continue to see more newness catering to millennials? And lastly, on the advertising budget, how are you thinking about advertising dollars shifting to digital from traditional in the context of the entire budget? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","Well, I will answer the first questions. So the focus on millennial is a very important focus. Obviously, we have brands in our portfolio which are already very strong on millennials like M A C and are market leaders in many of these areas with many of the makeup categories with millennials in North America and around the world. Kors, Smashbox or many others or some of the new acquired brands like GLAMGLOW. So, in our portfolio, we have brands which are even more focused on millennials and we have an innovation plan for them for each one of these brands. The two brands that we are trying to accelerate in terms of penetration with millennials are Lauder and Clinique.","Clinique is historically very strong with millennial at the entry price of prestige. And as you heard in our prepared remarks, Clinique is doing a lot of new effort to revamp this ability to attract and engage millennials, particularly in the area of social media and specific product launches at the entry price point of prestige and particularly at the entry price point of makeup where the brand has opportunity with millennials.","As far as Lauder is concerned, you heard that there are several activities that we are doing, for example, with new models like Kendall Jenner, which have a lot of attractiveness with millennials. And this is happening even on fragrances with Modern Rouge launch. And then there is obviously the newly announced Sephora launch, which is actually designed an entire collection on makeup and skin care designed for the millennial on top of the social media that will go along with these activities. So, we are very focused on millennial in the next years. And we are seeing initial very encouraging results. And we have a strong starting point from some of our brands like M A C.","Tracey Travis","And then the second part of your question in terms of the growth between digital and traditional advertising, I\u2019ll just point out that more of our brands, again, we have a broad portfolio of brands. And more of our brands do digital marketing than traditional marketing. So, our digital spend is already higher than traditional marketing because of that. But having said that, if you were to think about it in terms of mix shift, about 30 basis points are shifting into digital out of traditional marketing.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara","Thanks. Guys, I guess for Americas, I know not all of this is necessarily operational but I guess, number one, can you talk a little bit more about the profit decline in the Americas, that 78% number was kind of big on an adjusted basis? And then skin down to on an adjusted basis, look, I understand the Est\u00e9e and Clinique serums and moisturizers are down but just curious if there was anything unusual in the quarter on skin or is this the way to think about a run rate in any way? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","I\u2019ll start from the skin. As I explained, Asia is \u2013 70% of the market in Asia is about skin care and our market share in skin care in Asia is very, very high. The moment the external factors happens mainly concentrated in this area like Hong Kong, Macau, the flu in Korea, this has an over proportional impact on skin care and specifically on serum and moisturizers, as Tracey explained in our prepared remarks. So, that's the unusual thing of the quarter that happened on skin care and that's the key factor in the short-term.","And then there is a longer-term factor which is the fact that to grow skin care, we need to activate a stronger growth on Lauder and Clinique as we have been talking across this call and we have solid plans for that for the long-term. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn to Tracey for the other parts.","Tracey Travis","So, in terms of the decline in the Americas profitability, as you indicated, there are more than just the region performance in the Americas profitability. These numbers, first of all, in our press release, are not adjusted for constant currency, so they are adjusted though for the re-measurement for Venezuela and for the SMI shift. So, they\u2019re not \u2013 the decline is not from an adjusted standpoint \u2013 a constant currency adjusted standpoint not as great as what\u2019s reflected in the press release. But the acquisitions and the purchase accounting related to those acquisitions flows through the Americas. Some of our enterprise IT expenditures flows through the Americas and then the stock comp that we called out flows through the Americas as well. So, on an ongoing basis, no, we would not expect that the Americas profitability would be down.","Operator","Your next question is from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a couple of quick ones. First, on travel retail this is, I guess, the third consecutive quarter where you've seen a pretty wide divergence between sell-in and sell-through. And I know there is a lot of destocking that has to go on but how much more is there before we see those two numbers start to converge at hopefully a higher number from here? And then secondly, on China, I think, you mentioned it was up 6% last year overall sales for you guys and I think, Fabrizio, you said 6% to 10% is probably a good run rate number. Is that what we should expect for fiscal 2016 given what's gone on with the change in tariffs and the devaluation of the yuan, for example? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","So, I will start from China. Yes, that 6% to 8% to 10% is the range we aim at. And I don't know if you should expect it because there is a lot of unknown in front of us in China in this moment. But that's definitely what we are trying to achieve in our plans, tailored to achieve the 6% to 10% range. And so on travel retail is the point is that there is still \u2013 when there are issues like a flu epidemic in a place [ph] like Korea which is one of the biggest markets, you have to expect that the retailers that don't know when this will finish will readjust their stock levels in a very decisive and immediate way.","And so some of this stock just travel retail is an area where stock adjustment when they happen, happen fast and when they are driven by external factors they can be unexpected and very, very strong. So I would \u2013 to answer your question, I would like to separate the unexpected situation like we had the one in Korea from the ongoing. I believe that in terms of the ongoing travel retail model for the future, we should see a convergence of net and retail and that should become more or less aligned. But obviously this excludes specific unique factors like the epidemic of MERS in Korea that could further impact the difference between sell-in and sell-out. For example, this may happen again in months like July where the MERS continued.","End of Q&A","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Thia Breen, Group President of North America for The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies. Thia is going to give us the strategic overview of the region and a review of the holiday results.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges. In addition, we will discuss results before the impact of accelerated retail orders that took place in the prior year quarter due to the implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative. You can find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and in the Investor Relations section of our website.","And I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio now.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to say that by executing our strategy successfully, we delivered strong sales growth in the fiscal 2014 second quarter, in line with our expectation and at the same time, advanced our business in many important ways. Our strong performance came despite a mixed holiday season and several soft retail markets across the globe. Our balanced portfolio enabled us to capitalize on our winning brands, geographies and channels, culminating in strong sales growth. We introduced exciting innovations, gained shares in pivotal markets, including China and the U.K., and increased our brand's penetration around the world.","Our sales performance continue to an unbroken record of growth over the last 4.5 years. Since our current structure began, our business has grown every single quarter, which underscores the strengths of our long-term plan.","In the most recent period, sales rose 4% in local currency. However, reflecting our true underlying business, sales grew more than 7% after adjusting for the $94 million of accelerated retail orders recorded in the second quarter last year prior to our Strategic Modernization rollout.","To put that performance in perspective, our 7% sales increase is about double our estimated annual prestige beauty growth worldwide. Our results were especially noteworthy given the headwinds we face, including heavy promotional activity in our largest markets.","Diluted earnings per share came in at $1.09, which was better than we had forecast. We overachieved our estimate by leveraging our strong results in several markets in high-profit channels and driving down costs.","The beauty of having a diverse portfolio of 30 prestige brands is the balance and sustainability it provides. If some brands experienced a period of softer growth, it has been our experience that they are more than offset by others which are flourishing. Similarly, if mature channels or countries grow slowly, that's usually been more than counterbalanced by faster-growing channels and emerging markets.","One of our strongest areas in the recent quarter was our makeup category, which remains critical to our growth. So we were pleased the sales rose sharply. M-A-C's ability to tap into consumer desire with a constant streams on new collection led to strong demand for its Holiday sets and its Rihanna products. M-A-C continue to build distribution by opening freestanding store and department stores doors primarily in international markets.","At Smashbox, the brand concentrated on foreign expansions in the U.K. and Germany and entered Russia and the Netherlands for the first time. Smashbox also saw its good momentum continue at home in its core North America market. In Bobbi Brown, retail sales rose double digits in North America and the United Kingdom.","Our 3 makeup brands each gained share in prestige beauty in the United States accordingly to NPD. Strong product launches from brands such Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, most notably in foundations and eye products, also contributed to makeup sales gains.","Adjusting for SMI shift, our skin care sales grew solidly. However, the category has been extremely competitive. Skin care remains our key priority, and we are focused on continuing to profitable growth in the category. Our recent skin care innovations helped to drive the category growth this quarter as some of those gains were offset by decline in some existing products. This year's biggest launches, Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion + and Est\u00e9e Lauder New Advanced Night Repair serum, were well received. Our luxury skin care brand, La Mer, enjoyed strong retail trends globally, especially North America and travel retail, despite being up against its soft cream launch in the previous year which was its most successful launch ever.","Much of our global innovation will continue to be centered on skin care, and we are committed to remaining a leader in developing the most advanced skin care technology for a host of skin care for consumers in every region.","In fragrance, our business as a whole did well. With the category, we had mixed results. Our high-end offerings continue to excel globally. In the holiday seasons, Jo Malone retail sales in our heritage market of the U.S. and U.K. each soared at least 20%. Tom Ford fragrances were popular worldwide, and the brand launched the men grooming collection, which helped lift sales. The men collection is also displayed in a second relocation in stores, creating greater visibility. Tom Ford high-end distribution expansion continued, particularly in the European region.","We also saw terrific response to several new fragrance launches. Tory Burch was the best-selling fragrance at Bloomingdale's, where it was sold exclusively during the quarter. Michael Kors new fragrance collection did very well everywhere it launched in the U.S. and Europe, and Est\u00e9e Lauder Modern Muse fragrance got off to a very good start, performing as we expected.","Other scents from our beauty brands also were popular holiday gifts. However, some of our Designer Fragrances and Clinique fragrances didn't offer major new products, and they came up short of our expectations. Nonetheless, we gained share in fragrance in U.S. prestige store during the important second quarter.","Aveda led our improvement in the hair care category with additions to its best-selling product lines. In the U.S., growth came from salons and online. Its U.K. sales were particularly good, spurred by TV advertising and 3 new retail stores. In addition, we doubled Aveda business in travel retail.","Now looking at our business based on where our brands are sold. Some of our best-performing global channels were online, travel retail and freestanding stores. Our e-commerce sales rose significantly. We had strong growth across our brand sites, as well as authorized retailer sites worldwide. Our sharp sales increase anchored our position as one of the largest online prestige beauty retailers. The channel has been so successful and grown so fast that our e-commerce business has doubled in the last 3 years.","We expect our online business to remain a major growth engine for the company over the next few years. With higher traffic and increased conversion driving our momentum, we continue to look for opportunities to expand our presence in these high-margin channels. And as an example, M-A-C launched e-commerce in Brazil and Israel in January.","In travel retail, our net sales grew sharply, helped by retailers ordering for about 50 new point-of-sales and also in advance of an earlier Chinese New Year. Travel retail's growth was by far the stronger in Asia Pacific, led by business at Japanese airports which are more attractive to local and foreigner shoppers because of the weak yen. Our retail sales exceeded passenger traffic growth, and we expect that trend to continue for the rest of the fiscal year.","For perspective, travel retail has also been a strong performer over the last 3 years as our net sales have climbed more than 70% and we gained more than 200 basis points on market share there.","One of our strategic initiative is to align our distribution to evolving consumer preferences and growth opportunities in emerging markets. As part of that effort, we increased our network of freestanding stores, opening 57 this quarter, mostly for M-A-C. Our global sales in the channel grew double digits. We also continued our growth in specialty-multi retailers in North America. We had good momentum in this channel, and we are working to make some of our products available where appropriate in multi-brand stores in other countries as well.","Turning to our geographies. Our sales in heritage markets performed well despite heavy promotional activity by brand and retailers as consumers sought value. The number of holiday promotion our brands offered was consistent with past years, but they started earlier since there were 6 fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. In the U.S. and Canada, our retail sales climbed solidly on the strengths of online, specialty-multi and prestige department stores.","Our strong sales growth in the U.K. was exceeded by even stronger retail sales with many brands and channels contributing. New doors and freestanding stores, compelling product and service, robust e-commerce and effective advertise made for a very positive holiday season.","Japan economic expansion continued, which was reflected in our business. Our sales advanced in local currency, further strengthening this important market. We feel positive about the remainder of the year and have plans to advertise major launches in Japan with television and enhance our High-Touch services.","Our underlying business in emerging markets continue growing double digits. To give you some example, sales in Brazil were vibrant, driven by M-A-C, Clinique and e-commerce, contributed to strong Latin America results. Russia, positive growth this quarter, reflecting solid retail demand and new doors opening. And sales in Turkey and the Philippines rose significantly.","While China is clearly our largest emerging markets, all the others, taken together, represents another major opportunity for growth. Our combined sales in these emerging countries are actually greater than our China business, and our sales in this group grew double digits in local currency this quarter. Like the Chinese, more consumer in these markets are traveling more and also buying our products in travel retail location and along travel corridors.","In China, prestige beauty growth remains solid even though it has slowed. The slowdown has been concentrated in Tier 1 cities, while the smaller cities are generating good growth. We have aligned our strategy to this reality and opened in 6 new Tier 3 cities during the quarter. Our 14 brands sold in China maintain the leading position among prestige cosmetic groups in our distribution.","Additionally, when looking at the Chinese market, there are other factors to keep in mind, namely that although disposable income among Chinese middle-class consumer is rising, they are buying more outside the country when traveling. While these issues have led to lower department store traffic, our sales in China adjusted for SMI shift remained solid, our retail sales grew mid single digit and we continue to gain share.","Our robust sales growth online and in freestanding stores contributed to our improvement. And although these channels are a small part of the total Chinese sales, we expect them to represent a greater portion in the coming years.","Some countries remained challenging, including Korea, where the pace of recovery in prestige beauty remains slow. However, several of our brands there are showing improvements and gained share, including Aveda and Darphin, and our travel retail sales in Korea grew. Thanks to more Chinese travel with greater purchasing power.","Some large countries in Continental Europe were soft, particularly Germany which was weaker than we expected, Italy and Switzerland. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment in Venezuela continues to be volatile. The country persistent high inflation poses a risk of potential currency devaluation, which could have a negative impact on our financial results, so we are closely monitoring the situation.","Our main focus for the rest of the fiscal year will be on our 2 biggest product categories, skin care and makeup, and we will launch major innovation in both areas throughout the second half. Makeup products that should create excitement include M-A-C VIVA GLAM Rihanna lip products, which we expect to generate a high level of media attention. Additionally, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is launching the Pure Color Envy Lipstick collection, which features a new formula and lux packaging at a higher price point. The new line is part of the brand's ongoing effort to be more modern and aspirational.","In skin care, we are demonstrating our commitment to the category through continued strong innovation supported by solid marketing activities. For instance, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique are rolling out major innovation in Asia this quarter in one of the region's biggest categories, watery lotions. Est\u00e9e Lauder Macro Essence Skin Activated (sic) [Activating] Treatment Lotion is the first of its kind essence in lotion that helps strengthen skin foundation and make it more resistant to signs of aging. Clinique's Even Better Essence Lotion, which is launching in Japan now, helps irritation irradiance [ph] with the newly developed complex.","Tapping into a universe of skin care concern, next month, Clinique will introduced an acne product that delivers results as effective as a leading topical prescription drug. The product, Acne Solutions Clinic Clearing Gel, rollouts first in the U.S. and Europe and then in Asia. To support these innovations, we plan to invest more in advertising in our fiscal third quarter, which we believe will build momentum also into the final months of our fiscal year.","We are proud of the progress we've made so far this year, and we believe fiscal year 2014 will be another winning chapter in our company long-term profitable growth story. We expect global prestige beauty to rise 3% to 4% in fiscal 2014, and our forecast is to grow about twice as fast, which will continue to improve our competitive position.","We recognize that our risks in some markets are softening, but we have proven our ability to anticipate challenges, be flexible and react to market changes in order to manage our business accordingly. We stay focused on meeting our financial goals and have demonstrated our ability to succeed in both strong markets and soft ones. And also because whether you look at our business by brand, by channel or by country, about 1\/3 of our sales are increasing by double digits, while the rest is keeping at least abreast of the industry.","Before closing, I want to thank all of our company employees for their continued creativity and dedication. Their exceptional work is what keeps us -- our strategic journeys moving forward to continue to create profitable growth.","Now I'll hand it over to Thia, who will discuss our North America business and strategy.","Thia Breen","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, let me give you a little background about myself. I am Group President, North America, and have led our teams in the U.S. and Canada for the past 4.5 years. I've been with Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies for more than 35 years in several brands and varied positions, starting as an account executive for Clinique in 1977.","When I was appointed to lead North America in July 2009, we renewed our focus on the U.S., our largest and home market, to reinvigorate our department store growth, working to enhance their competitiveness with mass, as well as fuel sales in other high-growth channels. We developed a winning strategy and enhanced market-specific capabilities. This enabled us to continue to leverage the company's strengths and best practices in a more efficient and effective manner across brands and retailers with one strong voice.","For us, North America also includes Canada, which is one of the top 10 markets for prestige beauty globally with many opportunities for growth. To capitalize on these opportunities, we established Canada as an affiliate in 2012 and have seen increased sales results. With this distinct focus on the U.S. and Canada, we've been able to successfully recruit consumers from mass by creating more innovative product, offering customized High-Touch services and experiences and tailoring marketing programs for specific consumers. This strategic focus has led to strong results for North America. Over the past 4 years, we have grown retail sales by approximately $1 billion and continue to be the leader in prestige beauty in both markets.","Now I will focus specifically on the U.S., first talking about holiday in the quarter, followed by what we see as the longer-term trends.","Our U.S. holiday business was solid, driven by outstanding programs across all categories, appealing gift offerings and strong online sales. This year, the holiday environment was more promotional. We started planning for this well in advance, understanding December would have 6 fewer selling days and that our growth in November would need to outpace December. Our November results were strong with double-digit sales increases driven by robust performances across our portfolio of brands, channels and categories. We gained share in the fragrance category led by new scents like Est\u00e9e Lauder's Modern Muse, Tory Burch and the Michael Kors collection. We experienced record online sales for the quarter, over 25% versus last year. And Cyber Monday marked our company's biggest U.S. e-commerce sales day in history, a reflection of our online leadership and commitment to building winning platforms.","Guided by our winning strategy, the U.S. continues to be an engine of profitable growth for the company. We have demonstrated our ability to win against mass, drive growth in department stores and succeed in high-growth channels, particularly evident by outstanding online results and double-digit increases in specialty-multi.","We are also now gaining share in our fragrance category. In the quarter, we continue to grow our luxury fragrances, AERIN, Tom Ford and Jo Malone, along with our new fragrances in department stores. Our brands also continue to drive success in the makeup category. M-A-C, Bobbi Brown and Smashbox had very strong growth across all channels in the second quarter. In addition, we have seen positive results with new offerings like Tom Ford Beauty. We expect these sales trends to continue with a robust launch calendar of new products, such as Est\u00e9e Lauder's Pure Color Envy Sculpting Lipstick and Nail Lacquers coming in March, and Clinique's Lash Power Feathering Mascara launching in April.","In hair care, Aveda has continued solid performance and gained share on salons, driven by the success of Invati. Although we did have growth in skin care last quarter in North America, these gains did not meet our expectations. As Fabrizio mentioned, we saw softening with some existing products.","For the remainder of the fiscal year, we are focusing on strengthening our position in skin care, with the introductions of new innovations in key subcategories like moisturizers, anti-aging and acne. We will continue to leverage our ability to execute with excellence to reignite stronger growth in this priority category.","We are a strong leader in prestige beauty in North America and believe we will continue to win by identifying new ways to strengthen our position. North America on a granular level is full of new consumers, diverse in terms of ethnicity, culture, age, location, shopping preferences and so much more. We are evaluating the market to identify and prioritize the area with the highest growth potential and see opportunities here similar to those in a fast-growing emerging market.","Driven by our creativity and innovation, we are developing strategies across regions, consumer segments, key accounts doors and channels to tap into these opportunities and drive growth. The composition of our consumers continues to evolve in the U.S., culturally and generationally, and we are focusing on key customer segments to drive growth, specifically multicultural and consumers over 55.","The Latina consumer is the fastest-growing group. Among our many early initiatives to serve the multiethnic consumer and meet her product needs, several of our brands have added multilingual service elements, tailored product assortments and multiethnic models in advertising.","Over the next 5 years, the population of women in U.S. 55 and older will increase by 5 million. We refer to this key segment as the ageless consumer. These consumers shop primarily in department stores for prestige beauty and have 2.5x more household income than younger households. Many of our brands resonate extremely well among ageless consumer as we offer innovative antiaging technologies along with High-Touch service.","We also see opportunities on a door-by-door basis with key consumer segments driving category and subcategory growth. For instance, if you take a closer look at our biggest retailer in the U.S., Macy's, and 3 of its stores within a 12-mile radius of New York City, you see significant differences. In Queens - Rego Park, the Latina consumer drives a majority of the beauty sales, while African American consumers over-indexed in Brooklyn, and fragrance accounts for about half of our beauty sales in both locations. In contrast, just a few miles away at Macy's in Flushing, nearly 2\/3 of the business is in skin care as consumer demographic shifts heavily to East and Asian. In each location, we have tailored our brand's presence, service model, product lines, shades and merchandising to better serve each customer segment.","Retail today is omni-channel, which presents another significant opportunity. Consumers expect a consistent and customized experience at every touch point, whether they're shopping on their mobile phone, laptop, tablet, in-store or in travel retail. We plan to leverage our strong online business and network of freestanding stores to ensure a seamless prestige experience no matter where she shops.","We are confident North America will continue to grow, given our focus on identifying emerging opportunities across regions, consumer segments, key accounts doors and channels. Led by my dedicated team, we expect this granular approach to generate profitable, sustainable growth, maximizing the infrastructure, capabilities and resources we have as an established market. We are excited about the company's future in North America, and we look forward to leveraging our portfolio and strengthening our leadership position.","Now I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Thank you, Thia, and good morning, everyone. I will first review our second quarter financial performance and then share with you our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2014. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the year-over-year impact of restructuring and other charges. And as the quarter and year-to-date comparisons are impacted by the company's Strategic Modernization Initiative or SMI activity in the prior year period, I will highlight for you both the reported and adjusted comparable growth rates, which I would encourage you to reference as well in this morning's press release.","Net sales for the second quarter rose 3% to $3.02 billion, in line with our expectations. Excluding the impact of currency translation, sales grew 4%. Net earnings and earnings per share each decreased 6% to $430.2 million and $1.09, respectively. EPS was above the top end of our expectations, reflecting strong growth in our makeup artist and luxury brands and high-profit channels and more disciplined cost management in response to some softening market trends.","As we have previously discussed, in the prior year, some retailers accelerated their orders into our second quarter that otherwise would've occurred in our third quarter in advance of the January 2013 rollout of SMI. The impact of that shift was an additional $94 million in sales and $78 million in operating income, equal to approximately $0.13 per share. Excluding the impact of the SMI-related order shift and the restructuring activities from last year, local currency sales would have grown 7% for the quarter, and EPS would've grown 6%.","Looking at our sales growth by region. Net sales in our Americas region increased 6% in local currency, with 4% growth in North America and double-digit growth in Latin America. The strongest performance in North America at retail came from double-digit sales growth, both in online, as well as in specialty multi-brand stores, as Thia indicated, and high single-digit growth in our freestanding stores and at prestige department stores. Latin American growth reflected increases in Brazil, Venezuela and Chile.","In the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, sales also increased 6% in local currency. We achieved double-digit growth in emerging markets such as Russia, South Africa and Turkey. The U.K. delivered a strong 9% increase in sales driven by strong performances in M-A-C, Jo Malone, Bobbi Brown and Aveda. Among the more established markets in Western Europe, France rose mid-single digits after adjusting for the SMI shift in the prior year, and we were encouraged that Iberia appears to have stabilized after declining for the past 2 years. Sales in Switzerland, Italy and Germany were lower.","And in travel retail, we achieved double-digit net sales grains, driven by the continued benefits of high single-digit international passenger traffic, combined with new distribution and an earlier Chinese New Year, all of which more than offset the impact of a change in Chinese tour regulations.","Our sales in the Asia Pacific region declined 3% in local currency, reflecting the significant impact of the SMI-related sales shift in China last year. Excluding the shift, local currency net sales in the region increased 5% and China rose double-digits, reflecting more moderate retail sales growth and the addition of nearly 20 new doors and 6 new cities during the quarter.","Australia, the Philippines and Singapore saw strong growth, and Japan continued its low single-digit growth. We believe Korea is beginning to stabilize with sales declines moderating to 3% this quarter. Sales in Thailand fell approximately 5%, as political and social unrest affected consumer shopping.","In my discussion of margins and operating expenses, I will refer to the SMI-adjusted shift comparison, which provide additional insight into our underlying performance for the quarter. As I mentioned before, a reconciliation table to our reported results is included in our press release.","Our gross margin improved 10 basis points to 80.7%, which largely reflected the net impact of pricing. Operating expenses -- expense dollars increased 5%. And as a percent of the SMI-adjusted sales, which grew 7%, operating expense margin declined 70 basis points to 59.1%. The major factors driving the decrease in margin were lower marketing and selling costs of approximately 60 basis points each, partially offset by a prior year adjustment of accounts payable of approximately 50 basis points.","Operating income rose 11% to $652.8 million, and operating margin increased 80 basis points to 21.6%. Net interest expense declined 7% to $12.4 million, primarily due to higher interest income, and our effective tax rate was 32.4%.","As a reminder, in the prior year, we recognized $21.3 million in other income related to the 2007 sale of the Rodan + Fields brand, which added approximately $0.04 to our EPS last year.","For the 6 months, cash flow from operating activities rose 19% or $127 million, primarily reflecting improved receivables and payables performance. Inventory days to sell rose to 186 compared with 163 days last year. Higher inventory was mainly due to anticipated sales growth and increased safety stock to maintain appropriate service level.","We invested $217 million in capital projects to support new counters, technology and retail stores. We repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of our stock for $205 million and paid $148 million in dividends to stockholders.","With the first half behind us, let's now turn to our outlook for the third quarter and the full fiscal year. Starting with the full year, due to slower trends in Greater China and Asia, travel retail and continued softness in parts of Europe, we are narrowing our expectations for fiscal 2014 sales growth to between 6% and 7% in constant currency, in line with the SMI-adjusted growth we experienced in the first half of this fiscal year. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 1% to 2%. Our estimate assumes weighted average exchange rates for the full year of $1.33 for the euro, $1.59 for the pound and $1.03 for the yen.","The combined benefits of gross margin expansion and operating leverage are expected to drive operating margin expansion by 50 to 60 basis points for the full year. As previously discussed, we continue to drive cost savings from our initiative program while simultaneously strengthening our capabilities in many areas, such as innovation, retail stores, e-commerce and information system that support our company's future growth objectives. Advertising, marketing and promotions are expected to remain fairly consistent as a percent of sales for the full year.","As you are aware, Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy, and there are number of uncertainties that could affect our business. While the country currently represents approximately 1% of our sales and 2% of our operating income, a hypothetical 45% devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar could result in a remeasurement loss of approximately $20 million to $27 million after-tax, depending on both the timing and level of the devaluation.","Additionally, Venezuela recently imposed a law limiting the permissible profit margin to 30%. For your clarity, our guidance does include the assessment of the potential impact of the margin cap but does not, at this time, take into account an assumption for the devaluation loss. Our fiscal 2014 tax rate is planned at 30% to 32%.","At this time, we are comfortable reaffirming our forecast for full year EPS in the range of $2.80 to $2.87. Depending on the magnitude of exchange rate movements, the approximately 1% to 2% negative currency impact on our net sales equates to about $0.05 of EPS. As a reminder, the next wave of our SMI rollout is scheduled for July 2014 and will include our North America order-to-cash, travel retail division, Japan and the Middle East.","As has been the case in previous rollouts, we expect retailers will increase their orders in advance of the go-live to mitigate any potential disruptions from the transition. The impact of this potential shift in orders will be to increase sales into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and full year from our fiscal '15 first quarter. We plan to provide an estimate of the shift on our third quarter call in May when we expect to have a better indication of the needs of our retailers. The guidance we are giving today does not include this shift in sales and profits.","For the third quarter, our sales are expected to grow 10% to 11% in local currency. Translation could contract growth by approximately 1 to 2 percentage points. We expect EPS will come in between $0.52 and $0.55. Remember that the prior year SMI shift in sales of $94 million or $78 million in operating income and $0.13 in EPS will have a favorable impact on comparisons in our third quarter. Adjusting for the shift, our sales growth is expected to be between 6% and 7% in local currency. Additionally, our tax rate is expected to be consistent with our full year guidance in the third quarter compared to the lower rate in the prior year quarter.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question on some of the competitive activity you're talking about. If you could just provide a little bit of clarity on exactly kind of where it's coming from, if it's focused in a particular region or category, just to give us a little bit of color around that would be really helpful. And then just a quick follow-up to that, unrelated, is how did e-commerce impact margins this quarter? I'm just curious on what the mix shift impact was on profitability.","Fabrizio Freda","So on the last one, how e-commerce impact margin, the more we grow e-commerce or online as a mix in our business, the better the margin goes because it's a high-margin channel for us. I don't think we can share specific indication and numbers, but basically, you need to associate the growth of online above average of the growth of the company to margin increase in general. The -- in terms of competitive activities, we see many. I mean, here in North America, the biggest competitive activity, and Thia can expand on it later, has been the promotionality of the holidays in general, and a lot of launches in the fragrance categories and the important activity in skin care, particularly in the cleansing and device areas. In Asia, we see a -- we see strong performance from us and some other international brands, but also we see strong performance from Korean brands that are growing market share in the region. And in terms of Europe, I think, it's the traditional competition, just that because of the recessionary environment that's been in general more promotional.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Tracey, could you discuss your regional and profit results a bit more in the quarter? I was surprised Americas was up so much and then Asia looked weak, so I just wanted to get some detail on the drivers behind that. And also, ad spend you had slated to be up substantially year-over-year in Q2. I'm wondering, did you spend in line with that given SG&A came in better than we expected, or some of that shifting into Q3?","Tracey Thomas Travis","Sure. So regarding our regional performance, as Thia indicated, we had a good holiday season in the North America and certainly in the U.S., so our growth was quite strong given some of the holiday programs that we had. In Latin America, as I mentioned, it was up double digits. So overall, from Americas standpoint, we certainly had strong growth as we -- as I spoke in the call and as we reflected in the press release. Asia had a number of issues, and even adjusting from an SMI standpoint, we continue to see, although we mentioned it was stabilizing, softer growth in Korea, we have low mid -- low single-digit growth in Japan. And then China was softer this quarter for the reasons that we mentioned. So the Asia region was a bit softer than we have experienced in prior quarters. And part of the reason that we looked to bring down our guidance for the full year was because of some continued softness although picking up in the second half of the year relative to what we've seen, certainly, in the fourth quarter. But we do expect some muted performance out of that region for the balance of the year. In terms of expenses and your question on advertising, yes, we did, as we looked at some trends in the quarter, did reduce some of our advertising spend and certainly some of our G&A spend.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have a question going back to some of the weakness in the skin care category, and maybe, Thia, this is for you. But is the weakness that you've seen in some of your existing products related at all to pricing that you might have taken? I know pricing is a new idea sort of for the company, and I'm wondering if you've taken some pricing and maybe pushed it too hard. And do you have a sense -- sounds like the new DDML+ is doing okay but maybe not as well as you had expected. Again, do you think the $1 price increase had any impact on that? And then just a quick question, Tracey, is there a specific time frame for when we might start to see improvements in the inventory levels?","Thia Breen","So Wendy, it's Thia. The pricing really had nothing to do with the performance of whether it's Advanced Night Repair or DDML+, as evidenced in our tremendous growth that we've had in some of our high-end skin care such as La Mer. So it would not be a pricing issue. And we did very well with the new introductions. But as Fabrizio and I indicated, there was just more cannibalization in some of our existing products, a bit more than we had planned for. Certainly, as we move forward into the second quarter, we have looked at this, examined it and we focused our promotional -- our activity in terms of innovation to see a turnaround in skin care in the second half.","Tracey Thomas Travis","And Wendy, regarding inventory, we are taking some various specific actions towards the end of the year to reduce our current level of inventory. We do, however, have another rollout of SMI. And so even though that's not in our financial results right now, that will result in a build -- of the residual build of inventory in addition to additional shipments towards the end of the year. So in fairness, I would say that our inventory levels will start to sustainably improve after this last wave of SMI when we can start to manage them down far more aggressively than we have been over the last couple of years with the SMI rollout.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I have a couple of follow-up questions. Why do you expect your results in Asia, in China in particular, to pick up especially in the fourth quarter? And similarly, what are you doing to make skin care pick up again, it sounds like, by the fourth quarter? And the final part of that is, could you list which categories grow fastest in fiscal '14 adjusted for currency? I think in the past, it was skin, followed by color, followed by fragrance. Could you give us an update on that for global results and also for the U.S.?","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. Well, we'll look at the ranking of categories. The -- let's talk about Asia. First of all, what's happening in Asia is a combination of factors, as we explained. First of all, in this moment, you have China with a slowdown. Let's talk first about that. The China slowdown is characterized by stronger slowdown in Tier 1 cities and in the luxury interest in general of Tier 1 cities population. But in Tier 2, 3, 4 cities, meaning the new population on China now, the growing middle class now are approaching more prestige products, actually the growth continued very solidly. So we are adjusting our strategy to this new reality. Meaning, we are building distribution and penetration in Tier 2, 3, 4 cities and aggressively building our online penetration in China. For example, the Clinique Tmall side has been extremely successful, and we are clearly ahead of goals. Because of this, we believe that we are sitting and adjusting our strategies to the new profile of growth in China, and in this sense, we should get better results even in a slowing down environment in the future months. By the way, we saw already a pickup in the month of January previous to the Chinese New Year. The second situation in Asia is temporary. I mean, Thailand is a big business for us, and Thailand, as we said, was minus 5% because of the political unrest. This was not expected, and we hope that as soon as Thailand will go to normalize the political environment, we'll continue to see the trend -- growing trends that, by the way, was double digit before the political unrest. So we are growing double digit to minus 5%. That's temporary. That's, obviously, for us, was a surprise. Then you have Korea that is stabilizing, although still declining. So we believe that in the next month, we will reach real stabilization and possibly, we will start growing again in this very important market for us. And then there are some good news that we have shared. Japan picking up, Australia doing better and the other markets like Singapore, Philippines really performing. So we believe this will pick up. Now in terms of skin care, in skin care, we are going back to do some innovation, which we believe in very strong in our key brands, which are what we define white spaces. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that Lauder and Clinique are entering the watery lotion category in Asia. To be very clear, this is a white space, so it's supposed to cannibalize much less because it's a space in which we are not and our competition is. And our products are superior, very strong, very liked by the consumers, so this will be net extra. Our skin care strategy in the future would be more focused on this net extra space. There are others which I cannot mention for competitive reasons that will happen in the last quarter. And then the example of Clinique Acne also is much more a white space for us, so it's a net extra additional space that our brands will build in skin care, by the way, in very profitable segments. And that's why we believe we will pick up again the trend in skin care. And I wanted to close saying, although in skin care, we have grown less than what we wanted in the quarter, we are still been growing and growing very well.","Tracey Thomas Travis","And regarding your question on full year category growth, so makeup, as we've called out, has been a strong performer year-to-date, and we expect that it will continue to be a strong performer balance of the year. We are seeing tremendous, tremendous growth in our M-A-C brand and Tom Ford and others. So that will be our fastest-growing category. Second would be hair care, with the success of the Aveda brand and some of the expanded rollouts there. Third would be skin care. And as Fabrizio mentioned, we do have plans in the second half in addition to picking up in Asia that will impact the skin care growth to be faster in the second half than it was in the first half. So that's the ranking, and then fragrance would be last.","Operator","Your next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Are we to assume that skin care margins will be down for fiscal '14? And then on the U.S., what have you expected U.S. category -- the U.S. category to grow at, and where do you see category growth now? And can you give a little bit more color on sales growth for the bigger brands versus the smaller ones, since it looks like the bigger ones were perhaps a bit more sluggish than you thought but the smaller brands are clearly more than offset? So is that growth disparity between those 2 ends of the portfolio widening? And what implications does that have on spending need and ability to leverage fixed cost by brands?","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. I'll take this last one, while Thia and Tracey will prepare to answer the first 2 questions. Actually, you are correct. Our midsized brands are today growing in our portfolio faster than our biggest brand, with the exception of M-A-C which is one of our fastest-growing brand. And this is having a very healthy impact on our business because it's making our portfolio broader, meaning the amount of brands that, if growing, have a significant impact on our growth is increasing. And the fact that the midsized smaller brands today are becoming bigger and are growing faster is another balancing factor to our portfolio that actually reduce our risk of being exposed to 1 brand or another being soft for a short period of time, or being exposed to one competitor [ph] or another. So we are broadening our portfolio geographically, we are broadening our portfolio in terms of channel -- growing channel like the expansion in e-commerce as an example, and we are broadening our strengths by brand portfolio. All this is a very positive trend. Now, Thia?","Thia Breen","In terms of the market and growth, we are thrilled because we are part of a dynamic market in terms of prestige beauty growth. If we take a look at the categories, department stores are certainly a major portion of our business today, and we have really figured out a way of attracting that mass consumer and recruiting for mass in our department store channel. We also have, in terms of high-growth channels, a tremendous growth in terms of online, also in terms of freestanding stores and specialty-multi. So we -- and you've seen the numbers and certainly makeup has been a key driver and it's a significant portion of our North American portfolio. We see the turnaround in terms of skin care, and Fabrizio had mentioned the white space in terms of acne and we have a new product in Est\u00e9e Lauder as well that attacks that. And certainly, as we look at it, because of this growing marketplace, we're going to be a major player and expand our leadership position.","Tracey Thomas Travis","And lastly, regarding skin care margins, we do not expect them to be down for the full year. Obviously, skin care will grow a bit less than makeup. So from a mix standpoint, it will represent less of those margin mix upside for us. But that margin should be up year-over-year in the category.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to come back to China because, I guess, I'm still confused here. You gave us a lot of color, but I've heard some conflicting numbers. So first, can you just tell us what your growth in the market was, excluding the shift in retail ordering, both in all-in and same-store sales basis, as well as your view of the current category growth? And I guess a little more color on your deceleration. I suspect the same-store sales number is going to be behind where the category was growing. If so, what's driving the market share weakness?","Fabrizio Freda","So what was the growth?","Tracey Thomas Travis","So for the quarter, our comp growth adjusted for SMI was 10% in the quarter. And then in terms of the year-to-date number, so the 6-month number, the comp growth adjusted, Jason, was 16%.","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. And in terms of our -- we are growing market share because we are growing in this market above the market trend, and so we continue to beat market share. And the strategy is to expand our penetration into Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities and online, which are within China, the fastest-growing segment of the market. So the strategy is pretty simple. We are exposing our brands to the fastest-growing segments of the market. And thanks to that, we are able to continue growing above the market. But however, the market is lowering and has lowered in the last quarter, and so that's -- those are the facts. Now the other important thing to understand are the China investment for taking a bit longer-term view is that the Chinese consumer continues to -- the middle class continues to grow and the Chinese consumers continue to spend. But they are -- some of them are traveling more, they're spending more when they travel in travel retail or in the countries they visit, and in a way, this is part of the reason why there's some slowdown internally, in our opinion. And so the combination of our sales with the Chinese consumer is still very, very strong, even if there is this slowdown trend internally. And that's the way we look at it for the long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Just wondering, for both Thia and for Fabrizio, have you sort of given up on the idea or are you sticking with the idea that you don't want to be in the device business? Just given how successful L'Or\u00e9al has been there, it seems to be both a big and growing opportunity, and I know up until now you've said that's nothing that you want to do. Are you still of that view? And just similarly, with acquisitions, you spent a while getting Smashbox to perform as you hoped, I guess, and does that mean you're maybe more willing to step up to the plate now? And then just finally, the big investment in fragrance feels awfully disappointing looking at the results. And I'm just wondering if we could expect a big pullback in spending next -- as you move out because you're not getting the return on investment that you would've liked to have seen.","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. Let me start on this last one. It's that -- we -- as you see, we are managing our business very flexibly and focus on our financial results and on maximizing return of our investments. So we learned, and we have learned this year that certain investment we mentioned before, some cannibalization of some skin care launches, we mentioned some countries, now you mentioned fragrances where we had lower return, in some cases, than what we expected, and frankly, higher returns in other cases. Within fragrances, I mentioned some great success stories in our launches in my prepared remarks, and I also revealed there were some areas where we did less than expected. So yes, you can expect us to adjust to this new reality and to learn from what we're doing, and to refocus and rebalance our investment in the future based on the successful stories, and minimize or avoid to invest in areas with wrong rate of return. The -- so there was the -- what's the other point?","Dennis D'Andrea","Devices.","Fabrizio Freda","Oh yes. The question on devices. Again, we watch the market, we watch the consumers and we learn. So I don't think we said never do anything about it, but we said that we were not going to launch devices at the point in time. The -- our strategy here is to try to create sustainable propositions to address the consumer benefits in that area, and we are working on it. So if we call it devices or different thing, or different kind of innovation, this is something I cannot discuss. But definitely, the benefit area of cleansing is a very important benefit area for the company, and we are going to address it in the future and I believe, very competitively. There was a third question.","Tracey Thomas Travis","M&A. Acquisition.","Fabrizio Freda","Acquisition, sorry. There were many questions. The acquisition, well, we continuously look at the market. We are very interested in growing acquisition. As you know, in our goals, we have the intent to build 1 point of growth out of acquisitions. So we are continually monitoring the market and we are ready to do the right steps when opportunity arises. Smashbox is a happy story so far, and we are definitely ready to consider opportunities if they arise.","Operator","Your next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","My question has to do with your margin goal. Early back in August, I understood that you said that the expansion in margins dependent upon making marketing and promotional spending more efficient, and it seems like you are now being compelled to increase both because of competitors' activity and the recessionary environment. And the other point that is also pressing margins, in my view, has to do with China. I don't fully understand the characterization that you are changing the strategy there. We have been hearing about this expansion in Tier 2 to Tier 4 cities since 2012, and what's the point of making this spending in brick-and-mortar if incremental sales are going into travel retail and e-commerce? So if you can explain us where the impact of these 2 in your margin goals.","Fabrizio Freda","I mean, on the impact on margin goals, to be clear, we have a strategy where all our high-growth areas are margin accretive. That's intentional. So travel retail, online, emerging markets, China, the new segments, skin care category, within skin care category, certain areas of benefit are all margin accretive. So our business is actually designed on purpose to grow faster in areas with higher marginality. And this is working so far. It's working very, very well. Now if you add cost-saving activity to this mixed asset, then you get the clear idea of what we are driving into margin progress and the way we're driving margin progress in long term. If you add to this the third element, which is leveraging growth with productivity gains, then you get the full picture. So I don't believe there is any risk in the strategy to decrease margin. Actually, I believe, we will continue to build margin gradually and we will relook our goals as opportunity arise and as our cost SMI saving programs become clearer. In terms of the China strategy, the -- I'm not sure -- I'm not very clear what you don't understand on the strategy because basically, the Tier 2, Tier 3 cities, the awareness of the brand today is low. Building brick-and-mortar there makes -- by the way, very efficient brick-and-mortars because few doors which sell a lot of products. And as you know, in our business, the profit is dependent from sales per door. So those few doors are very effective, very efficient. On top of this, they create awareness in this area, so these people that live in the city, when they travel, when they go online, buy our brands in travel retail, online or in Paris. And if we were not in the city to create awareness, first of all, we will have less productive doors; and second, we will not have the awareness for these people buying and preferring our brands in those channels. In that way, this strategy is definitely accretive to margin.","Tracey Thomas Travis","And the only thing that I would add with respect to your commentary on advertising, marketing and promotion, we have spent against everything that we had planned to spend on at the beginning of the year. As -- and Fabrizio mentioned that we are flexible as we have seen results, we have recalibrated some of the levels of spending behind some programs. But by and large, we have spent against everything that we had planned to spend on as we structured the year.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Your last question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A few things. If I look at sort of the cash flow statement, obviously, cash flow from operations were up 19% for the year, but the share repurchase is down 37%. You obviously have this big, growing cash hoard and the multiple is coming down, so I couldn't think of a better opportunity to get more aggressive in the share repurchase. And I always thought the strategy was, we don't want to add any more leverage but we're perfectly content sweeping the cash that we generate from this point forward. So just any clarity on that? And then maybe I missed it, but can you just give us the actual travel retail sell-in and sell-through percentages? And then the real question, sorry for being so long-winded, but it seems like Clinique is having a real tough go of it right now especially in the U.S. So I wonder if there's a triage plan there, and I know there's tough comparisons, obviously. And then, if Jane being appointed as President of the business, if there's anything incremental that's going to happen with the brand?","Tracey Thomas Travis","Okay, that was a lot. In terms of share repurchase, we see the opportunity that you see. And yes, we are still very committed to our share repurchase program. In terms of travel retail, I assume you were asking about the second quarter, and the net sales in the second quarter, as we mentioned, were up double digit, and the sell-through was high single digit for the quarter.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. And then on -- yes, the question was Lauder and Clinique?","Tracey Thomas Travis","Clinique.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, I think -- by the way, as I said, we had a very strong program in the future on Clinique, so we are very comfortable for the plan to restart more aggressive growth on the brand in North America. And maybe Thia to say a few words.","Thia Breen","And Bill, one of the many things we've heard since the appointment of Jane Lauder in this role, I worked with Jane when she was in the marketing role, actually, many, many years ago at Clinique, and the retail partners, retail community and internally, everyone is just thrilled with the fact that we have a family member now heading up this brand. So I mean, everybody has great expectation, and Jane has all of our support in what will be a tremendous role for her with the Clinique brand.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea","Good morning, everyone. On today's call, we have Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Kunes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Christopher Wood, Senior Vice President, Global Modernization, Information and Efficiency. Christopher will review the substantial progress we've made with our Strategic Modernization Initiative, as well as future deployment plans.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Except when noted, our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges. And as noted, our discussion will also be before sale shifts attributable to our Strategic Modernization Initiative. You can find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. And I'll turn the call to Fabrizio.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fiscal 2012 third quarter earning call. I am pleased to report that the successful implementation of our company's strategy continue to drive our strong performance. ","We reported 4% sales growth, which was ahead of our forecast. Earning per share were $0.38 before restructuring, which was also higher than we anticipated. The increase was due in part to greater cost savings and better-than-expected currency trends, which helped us further leverage our sales gains. Product mix and pricing contributed to our gross margin improvement of 140 basis points to 79.1%. Sales from our underlying business were even stronger, rising 9% in local currency, after adjusting for sales shift for SAP implementation and a charge for anticipated sales return related to new SPF regulations. ","Our gains spanned all regions and major product categories, illustrating the broad strength of our business. We believe this performance was greater than the growth of global prestige beauty. Around the world, except for a few countries, prestige beauty has been outperforming mass, showing particular strength in the U.S. and China. As the global industry leader, we continue to drive this demand through our effective advertising strategy and improve our retail position. We have proved we can gain share or growth not only in robust emerging markets such as China but even in more mature ones such as Germany and Italy. Importantly, we are uniquely positioned to continue benefiting from these encouraging trends since our business is solely focused on prestige beauty. ","The company's solid performance this quarter reflects our ability to manage our business effectively and sustain our commitment to creativity and innovation. Our employees' talents are evident in hundreds of highly desirable, locally relevant products, an effective advertising strategy across various media platforms that attract customers into stores, and our High-Touch service that creates a pleasurable shopping experience and generates loyal consumers and repeat business. Our portfolio luxury brands, including La Mer, Jo Malone, Tom Ford, achieved excellent sales growth. Across the globe, affluent consumer are spending more on brands they covet that offer good value, especially when combined by superb service. As a result, these high-end brands continue to thrive.","In the Americas, our greatest growth this quarter was in the high-margin skin care category, where we have put much of our focus since we began our strategy 3 years ago. In prestige department and beauty specialty store in the United States tracked by NPD, we gained an impressive 1.6% share in skin care, led by 3 of our brands: Clinique, Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer. Our skin care lineup is so powerful that in the quarter, our brands had 8 of the top 10 SKUs and 20 of the top 25 products. Importantly, our skin care sales in these channels expanded 23% at retail in this recent period over the same quarter last year. Est\u00e9e Lauder, in particular, had great results, with its skin care business rising 21% at retail in the United States. ","But our success isn't just in skin care. Our makeup sales in U.S. prestige department and beauty specialty stores were 8% higher than last year, while our fragrance sales expanded nearly 4%. Our ongoing strategic collaboration with North America department stores to reinvigorate the beauty floor is reaping many benefits for us and for them. Virtually all our brands showed good growth in the channel. Overall, prestige beauty continues to outpace mass in industry-wide prestige beauty sales, up nearly 14% in the quarter compared with just 1% for mass brands.","In Latin America, Brazil remains our fastest-growing market, driven largely by M-A-C, which is expanding its presence and investing in more advertising and promotion. Our DKNY and Tommy Hilfiger fragrance brands showed nice gains in Brazil, and we brought Zegna into the market. The total Brazilian beauty market is growing at 10%, but our sales growth is more than triple that rate. Although the economic climate in much of the European region has been sluggish, it was our strongest this quarter, adjusting for the SAP shift. ","Part of that success can be attributed to our intense focus on being locally relevant. Est\u00e9e Lauder's new Revitalizing Supreme Global Anti-Aging Creme, which was created specifically for European women, was supported with a widespread TV campaign and reached the #1 position in France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands in prestige facial skin care during the quarter. Travel retail also fueled our region sales, as yet again the channel enjoyed healthy double-digit gains worldwide. Global airline passenger traffic grew, led by Asia\/Pacific region, which helped our company gain share in the channel. Overall, China was travel retail top country in the quarter, due to the higher traffic related to the Chinese New Year. Additionally, the Beijing and Bangkok airports are among the fastest-growing high-volume airports globally. ","In the Asia\/Pacific region, our performance was mixed. Sales in China grew double-digits. We opened 23 new points of distribution for our brands, expanded into 2 new cities, and Bobbi Brown launched e-commerce. We have also seen a growing trend of Chinese consumers buying our product outside of their home market. For instance, many Chinese traveled during the New Year in January and purchased our products and other luxury goods in travel retail shops as well as in Greater China, Paris and other popular international destinations. The World Luxury Association reported that Chinese consumers spent $7.2 billion on luxury goods in Europe, the U.S., Hong Kong and Taiwan during the Chinese New Year, 29% more than last year. In comparison, sales in Korea and Singapore declined due to softness at retail. While Japan sales were still somewhat soft, they came in better than we expected. ","Looking at our business by category. We had a terrific result in skin care globally, largely from several recent innovation that were backed by compelling advertising, including Est\u00e9e Lauder cream for Europe and several products from Clinique. In Asia, our skin care sales rose on the heel of several launches, such as Origins, Dr. Weil's Mega-Bright and Youthopia Lift firming cream and Clinique Moisture Surge Intense. The category accounted for approximately 65% of the region's sales. ","Our advertising strategy for skin care has been so successful, we are taking a similar approach to makeup. Next week, for the first time, Clinique will start running national TV ads for a color cosmetic product in the U.S. We expect this creative commercial for Chubby Stick Lip Colour to attract many new consumers, particularly younger ones. Our other makeup brands are also leveraging this pull strategy. Tom Ford Beauty is investing behind its new color cosmetic line. Smashbox advertised its eye shadows in Camera Ready BB Cream using print and digital during the quarter, which generated strong growth for the brand. Smashbox is one of a number of our brands that have introduced BB creams, one of the newness beauty trends, which first become popular in Korea. These all-in-one products, which incorporate moisturizer, foundation, sunscreen and antiaging properties, have recently become a hit in the U.S. and in Europe. ","Aveda's newness innovation, its Invati collection for thinning hair, is having a terrific reception and helped boost our hair care category. Bumble and bumble expansion in Sephora is raising brand awareness and helping to drive consumers to Bumble network of salons. In fragrance, Jo Malone and Tom Ford, our high-end brands, continued to perform well. And our Aramis and Designer Fragrance division had good sales increases globally, lead by our Donna Karan franchise and Tommy Hilfiger. However, our U.S. fragrance sales weren't as strong as we hoped, and we lost share this quarter. We expect our results to improve with the recent global rollout of Zegna, continued success of Coach and upcoming launch activities before the holiday season. ","Across all categories, our online business had a positive showing in every region, with particularly strong results for our retail partners. We continue to accelerate our social activity, engage our consumer through blogs, tweets and Facebook posting and build our digital talent pool. We are confident in our ability to maintain our steady growth and generate incremental sales for expanded distribution. For example, Bobbi Brown recently opened in Israel and sees potential for new doors, brand-building and greater growth in many of its other 58 markets. M-A-C plans to open 68 doors in the fourth quarter, all but 4 of each will be outside of United States. Even our most established brands continue to seek strategic opportunity to reach consumers. In Japan, Clinique, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Bobbi Brown opened in Isetan [indiscernible], a new multibrand beauty store, and Aveda launched e-commerce. Origins opened in 4 [indiscernible] store in Netherlands, as well as on the retail and e-commerce [ph] side and expects to open 5 more doors there in fiscal 2013. As part of its continued expansion, Smashbox plans to launch in many international market in the next year. ","Now let me discuss 2 other important developments.  First, to enhance our efficiency, we made a strategic decision to streamline our manufacturing operation and create a state-of-art facility in our Melville, New York, location for fragrance filling and skin care. This move supports our ongoing commitment to innovation and global competitiveness and should create increased synergies and collaboration between production and R&D. Over the next year, we will transition fragrance filling to Melville from Oakland, New Jersey, and close the Oakland plant. To make room for the manufacturing expansion, this month, we are relocating distribution operations from Melville to our North America hub in Pennsylvania, which will enable us to better serve our retailers by centralizing our distribution. These moves are expected to save several million dollars annually.","Secondly, this fiscal year, we have substantially increased our global advertising spending to continue fueling our brand strengths and support major launches. In the fourth quarter, we plan to continue increase this spending over last year to build our momentum as we enter fiscal year 2013. For the full year, our incremental advertising spending should exceed $275 million, primarily behind our best innovations. We continue to fund the additional advertising spending through higher sales and by reducing promotion and non-added value cost. ","As we approach the 3-year mark of our strategic journey, we have complete confidence in the soundness of our vision and our ability to execute with excellence. Our goals are to ensure that we anticipate consumer desires, build upon our leadership role in global prestige beauty and deliver sustainable, profitable growth to stockholders. Through this fiscal year, every quarter, we have obtained consistently higher sale. With just 2 months left in the year, we are confident we will achieve sales growth of about 10%, marking our second consecutive year of double-digit constant currency sales gains.","With a winning business model that leverages our sales growth into greater profits, we expect our operating margin to improve by about 120 basis points and EPS to climb approximately 20%. I'm pleased to say that we are raising our full year EPS estimate to a range of $2.22 to $2.26. We also expect to generate record cash flow that will fund investment in business-building activity to maintain our strong performance for the years to come. ","Now I will turn now the call over to Christopher, who will discuss our Strategic Modernization Initiative and how it is enabling the long-term sustainability of our success.","Christopher Wood","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by giving you some background about myself. I've worked in the prestige cosmetics industry for nearly 25 years and came to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies in 1993. Since then, I've spent most of my time in brands and running international businesses, most recently heading up our Korean and Japanese affiliates. ","Two years ago, Fabrizio asked me to return to New York to lead the implementation of our global Strategic Modernization Initiative or SMI and join the executive leadership team. Last September, I assumed additional responsibilities for the oversight of our global IT organization and the Program Management Team, which is responsible for aligning, prioritizing and pacing all major corporate projects, as well as leading the company's cost-savings initiatives. I've been fortunate to have worked in all 3 of the company's regions and have gained broad business experience over the past 20 years. ","This has proved to be invaluable as we've rolled out SMI to our brands, affiliates and global operations since I understand how these areas operate and what's required to adapt to the new way of working. Simply put, SMI is a catalyst for transforming our company in many different ways. It's streamlining our operations today to make us an even more formidable competitor tomorrow. As we roll out new systems and processes to our brand functions and affiliates, we're integrating our disparate operations, creating transparency and modernizing all facets of our business. When fully implemented, SMI will enable us to be more agile and make decisions faster, which will be critical to winning in the fast-paced global environment of the next decade. Lastly, SMI will create new efficiencies and eliminate non-value added costs, allowing us to invest greater resources in innovations and growth opportunities. ","Prior to my arrival, we had successfully deployed SMI in our North American and U.K. manufacturing sites and created the North American financial foundation. During the past 2 years, we've expanded the SMI deployment globally, adding affiliates and brands to existing sites. Working with my team and in collaboration with hundreds of employees in affiliates' brands and functions around the world, we've made solid progress. Currently, we're well past the midpoint of the program and are preparing for another large deployment next January. More than 60% of the company's sales are now SMI-enabled, which includes most of our global brands and more than 1\/2 of our affiliate sales volume. About 8,000 employees and vendor partners are using the new SAP software. We've experienced no major service disruptions or problems during 5 waves of deployment so far, and expect over 90% of our business to be SMI-enabled by the end of fiscal 2014.","The areas of our business using SMI processes and SAP technology include our manufacturing facilities in North America and the U.K, as I just mentioned, as well as 15 affiliates including Italy, Spain, Germany, Singapore, Korea, Australia and Thailand. In our most recent implementation, in January of this year, 13 sites went live, including 8 affiliates, 2 global brands, Bumble and bumble and Smashbox, some third-party manufacturing, as well as key account planning for North America. The next wave, which is scheduled for January 2013, will include Greater China, France, our Belgian manufacturing plant and global supply network planning. Also included will be our regional corporate offices in Paris and Hong Kong. ","We've chosen a high-touch, low-risk approach to our SMI roadmap so as not to adversely impact our strong sales and profit growth and to ensure that we execute with excellence. We've emphasized change management, process adoption, since these are keys to a successful transition to SMI and leveraging the benefits that are expected. Additionally, this deployment model leverages the collaboration and transfer of knowledge from process experts in existing SMI sites and affiliates to those in upcoming deployments, with the goal of creating communities of SMI expertise and best practices. ","The multiyear investment in SMI involves much more than installing new systems and software. It is a fundamental enhancement to the way we operate. There are 3 critical elements at its core: our people, who must adapt to new ways of working; our processes, which entail new systems and capabilities that focus on speed and agility; and technology, which includes new SAP software to automate tasks, reduce manual work, provide transparency and enable efficiencies and sharing of information. There are 9 key processes that are driving our SMI implementation and its benefits. The processes enable standardization, collaboration, alignment, visibility and sustainable ways of working across the company. SMI is interdependent with our other global and regional initiatives, including procurement, demand planning, distribution center optimization and regional PMT programs. ","Our SMI program is one of the largest investments the company has ever made, and its outcome is significant. It's transforming our business by creating unified, more efficient processes in a highly integrated, sustainable global organization. Its scope reaches across all brands, regions and functions, and this naturally involves a different organizational design and ongoing change management and communications. Before we embarked on the SMI program, our functions, brands and affiliates largely operated independently and had adapted different systems and processes over the year. Now we are streamlining literally hundreds of local practices and work habits into a set of clearly defined and similar processes that allow us to retain local relevance while leveraging scale, speed and agility on a regional and global basis. At the same time, we are reducing the complexity of our IT environment to provide a common foundational IT platform or a single source of truth in SAP. ","SAP aligns the company from an information point of view and provides common access to the same information across regions, brands and functions. For example, when an SMI-enabled affiliate closes its books at month's end, the results are immediately visible to executives in New York. Similarly, global brands are now beginning to have visibility into their worldwide inventory and are able to move products around as needed. Prior to incorporating SMI, it wasn't always apparent if there was too much of a certain product in one market and not enough in another.","Some specific benefits we've seen already include greatly improved productivity in Korea. Customer ordering has improved fourfold. Labeling is nearly 30% more efficient, and picking accuracy has improved from 97% to 98.6%. At Smashbox, the time it takes from receiving a retail order until delivery averages less than 6 days, versus 10 days or more before it went live with SMI. Overall, we're also enjoying more efficient purchasing execution, improved service to customers and consumers, better analytical tools and enhanced skills for our employees. Over time, SMI should provide a platform for growth by enabling us to be both flexible and decisive due to greater transparency and information around the world. As the program continues, we expect to further lower our costs by reducing inventory, obsolescence and continuing to improve cost of goods, productivity and financial discipline while creating a platform of enhanced capabilities for future growth.","The SMI program will be a net expense to the company through fiscal 2013. But in subsequent years, we expect to see a net benefit with significant savings and efficiencies. In our current strategy, our PMT initiatives, some of which have already been enabled by SMI, are expected to save up to $750 million through fiscal 2013. After that period, SMI should create greater opportunities in those existing cost-savings initiatives, as well as leverage capabilities for future value-creation by giving us greater visibility into all aspects of our business around the world. ","I want to thank everyone in the company who has been or will be involved in deploying SMI for your hard work and dedication to this important program. It is truly leadership from every chair. We are committed to continuing our SMI journey with excellence as we advance the adoption of our processes and leverage SMI's capabilities to drive growth, deliver value and ensure sustainability of a long-term business platform. With SMI, the company is embracing new ways of working that will vastly improve our day-to-day business, give us greater insights to quickly improve our local relevance, and lastly, eliminate unnecessary costs, so we can successfully pursue our mission to create sustainable and profitable growth. Now I will turn now the call over to Rick.","Richard W. Kunes","Thank you, Christopher, and good morning, everyone. A quick reminder, my discussions on the quarter and the outlook exclude restructuring and other charges. As Fabrizio discussed, we had another solid quarter. ","In local currency, sales rose 4%. Currency translation was not significant, and reported sales also grew 4% to $2.25 billion. Net earnings for the quarter rose 5% to $149.2 million compared with $142.6 million in the prior year, and diluted EPS was $0.38, $0.06 higher than the top end of our guidance. The third quarter sales growth comparison was affected by the pull-forward of $30 million in orders through the second quarter this year, ahead of the January launch of SAP. The prior year quarter reflected an additional $42 million in sales, ahead of an April launch of SAP. These 2 factors reduced third quarter sales growth by about 3 percentage points and EPS by $0.09. Additionally, this quarter, we established a provision of about $16 million in anticipation of returns related to the repositioning of makeup products containing sunscreen due to changes in U.S. regulations. This charge adversely affected sales growth by about 70 basis points and EPS by $0.03. ","Our reported figures for regions and categories and a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in the press release issued this morning. While our financial statements are prepared according to GAAP, we consider non-GAAP measures useful for analysis. With that in mind, in order to help you understand the underlying growth of our business in the various segments and countries, as well as the components of our P&L and margin progression, our discussions adjust for the sales and income shifts for the SAP rollout. All regions and major product categories grew on a local currency basis adjusted for the SAP shifts. Our skin care category, in particular, continued to thrive, with sales up 13% in local currency. ","The launches of Est\u00e9e Lauder's Revitalizing Supreme Creme in Europe and Clinique's Repairwear Uplifting Firming Cream led the innovation pipeline, and both brands continued to support existing products. La Mer grew double-digits globally, contributing nicely to skin care growth. In makeup, local currency sales rose 3% against a tough comparison, with 22% growth last year. Results were driven by M-A-C, Smashbox and the rollout of Tom Ford Beauty. Additionally, foundation launches from Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique helped to solidify our lead in this high-loyalty subcategory. The returns provision reduced makeup sales growth by approximately 2 percentage points. Our fragrance business rose 5%, excluding currency. Luxury brands, Tom Ford and Jo Malone continued to perform well. Additionally, recent launches from our other brands more than offset lower sales in certain existing fragrances.","In Hair Care, sales rose 5% in local currency, led by solid growth in Aveda. The launch of the brand's Invati line is an unprecedented success, and helped drive overall sales growth. Bumble and bumble continued to do well at retail, but reported sales were up against a tough comp with the pipeline fill for the Sephora rollout last year. On a geographic basis, our sales in the Americas grew 5% in local currency. Nearly every brand contributed with particular strength from our 3 largest as well as our luxury group. The United States rose 7%, Latin America grew 10%, led by strong results in Brazil and Chile, while Canada was up 6%. The returns provision reduced the Americas region's sales growth by about 2 percentage points.","From a channel perspective, online rose 13%, salons and spas grew 10%, department stores and multibrand specialty beauty stores rose high single-digits and our own stores were up mid-single-digits. These prestige channels once again outpaced mass channels in the U.S.","In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, sales climbed 12% in local currency. Travel retail was up 23%, reflecting 7% growth in international passenger traffic, especially in the Americas and Asia, strong underlying trends in our business, as well as select new door openings for Aveda, La Mer and M-A-C. ","Our U.K. sales rose double-digits, reflecting a strong online business and good results from TV advertising behind Clinique's Even Better Makeup. Additionally, our luxury brands continued to perform well. We saw outstanding double-digit growth in the Middle East, India and Turkey. Germany also rose double-digits, while Italy and Spain delivered single-digit growth, which was respectable given the difficult market.  Russia declined modestly, as continued destocking at a major account more than offset strong retail elsewhere. Brands gained at retail, but net sales were softer this quarter due to both the late receipt of orders and warehouse consolidation by a major retailer.  And Greece remains weak. ","Asia\/Pacific region sales rose 7% in local currency. China grew 14% on like-door growth and expansion of brands, doors and cities. Many Chinese traveled over the New Year holiday, helping to fuel 22% growth in Hong Kong. Also growing nicely were Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia, while Japan and Australia rose low single-digits.","Just to remind you, the margin discussions and analysis have also been adjusted for the shifts for SAP. Our gross margin improved by 120 basis points to 79.1%. The increase was primarily due to positive mix and pricing of 140 basis points, manufacturing variances and currency of 10 basis points each, partially offset by higher obsolescence charges of 20 basis points. These figures include the benefit of cost-savings initiatives of $21 million.","Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined 90 basis points to 67.5%. Advertising, merchandising and sampling expense increased 130 [ph] basis points, reflecting the planned incremental support behind the company's biggest innovations. This increase was more than offset by the favorable comparison to prior year impairment charges of 170 basis points and lower administrative costs of 40 basis points. These figures reflect savings of $19 million from our cost-reduction programs. As a result, operating income rose 31% to $263.5 million and operating margin grew 210 basis points to 11.6% of sales. We realized total savings of $40 million in the quarter from our cost-savings program and now expect to save $140 million to $160 million for the full year, and between $700 million and $750 million for the full program through fiscal 2013. ","Net interest expense was approximately $15 million this quarter, below prior year, reflecting the replacement of $120 million in 6% senior notes with commercial paper.  Our effective tax rate was 33.5%. We recorded restructuring and other charges of $28.8 million or $0.05 per share in the third quarter. For the full fiscal year, we expect to record charges of about $45 million.","For the 9 months, net cash flows from operating activities rose 20% to $870 million, compared with $720 million -- $728 million last year. We spent $272 million in CapEx, $550 million to repurchase approximately 11.2 million shares of our stock and paid stockholders $204 million in dividends. Our days sales outstanding at March 31 were unchanged from last year at 52 days, while inventory days fell by 3 to 166 days.","Let me now talk about our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year.  Our forecast reflects strong global demand in prestige beauty. For the year, we forecast local currency sales growth of approximately 10%. Our estimate reflects weighted average rates of $1.34 for the euro, $1.58 for the pound and $0.79 for the yen. Using these assumptions, the currency impact on our full year sales is expected to be negligible. The operating leverage from higher sales and cost savings, partially offset by substantial increases in advertising for the second year in a row, as well as investments in new systems, should translate to operating margin improvement of about 120 basis points for the year. We are tightening the range and raising the top of our full year EPS forecast before restructuring to between $2.21 and $2.26. We expect to generate more than $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations and invest about $425 million for capital expenditures. We still expect our effective tax rate will be between 31% and 33%.","A few items will cause unusual comparisons in sales and profits in our fourth quarter. First, the prior year fourth quarter was understated by $42 million in sales pulled into the third quarter ahead of an April launch of SAP. This is expected to increase fourth quarter sales growth by about 2 percentage points and EPS by $0.05. Second, our business in Japan suffered from the effects of the tsunami on the fourth quarter of last year, providing a somewhat easier comparison. Lastly, we expect to increase our advertising spending in the fourth quarter, some of which is carried over from the third quarter. This growth is on top of the substantial increase in the prior year and should help us maintain our sales momentum into fiscal 2013.","Therefore, our fourth quarter sales growth is expected to be between 10% and 11% in local currency. Reported sales could be negatively impacted by about 3 percentage points due to currency translation. These figures include the 2% positive impact of the SAP shift I just mentioned. We anticipate EPS for the fourth quarter to be between $0.11 and $0.16. And that concludes my comments. And we'd be happy to take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Chris Ferrara of Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to ask about, I guess, the timing of the returns on the investments you're making. Because obviously, you guys are putting a lot of advertising back behind the business, which is great, and the top line growth has been pretty robust. But if you look going forward, it looks like you're throwing more advertising at the business, but you're getting to, adjusting for SAP and other timing, a little bit slower growth rate. And understanding all of the macro factors, can you at least parse out what your take is on that slight slowdown in top line relative to the advertising you're throwing at it? And also in relation to that, what's the timing of the return on that? Right? It's just that -- is this going to result in a lagging sales acceleration or a sustaining of sales as you move out into the beginning of fiscal '13?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. Chris, first of all, I think we are getting very solid returns, in the sense, we -- if you look at after adjustment, which are technical adjustment, our quarter this fiscal year will be all between 9% and 11%, even 14% the first. So in this quarter, 9%, we've been growing. And next quarter, we will probably go between 10% and 11%. And the total year between will be a second year in a row at double-digits. Frankly, I believe this is the result of increased advertising. And we are increasing advertising to levels that we need, frankly, in the long term to sustain in order to deliver this kind of growth also in soft markets and in good markets. Because the second way, I think, you should judge the results is that we -- thanks to this strategy, we are growing in high-growth market like China, but we are growing also in soft markets like Italy, for example. Also the third way to judge the results is that we are growing market share consistently quarter-over-quarter globally and going in the right direction. The last way I would judge the advertising investment, that, anyway, we are increasing -- this fiscal year is interesting. We are increasing advertising for a total of $275 million versus previous year while at the same time growing margin up 120 basis points. So it's not that we are investing without return in the short term. I think we have even short-term returns in the way we are investing. So anyway, you should not assume that this increased advertising will continue forever. There is a moment where we'll reach what we believe is sustainable level of advertising to grow the business.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's perfect. And I guess, just a quick follow-up. Can you -- is it possible to benchmark your share of voice, just your advertising relative to the peers, and like, in other words, your share of voice relative to your market share in the major regions?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. We do this. And I tell you, we have a -- frankly, the level of advertising that we do is very different by region and reflect the market dynamics. As you can imagine, we have higher share of voice in advertising in countries like U.S., where we have a very big market share, in countries like China, where we have the biggest growth opportunity. While on the contrary, in more mature markets, where the market is not growing very fast and we do not have very high market share, obviously our share of voice tend to be much smaller. So it's a mixed picture, but we have these data.  It would be a bit complicated to share all of them, and I think some of them are pretty confidential. But the important concept here is we are now investing more and more. But as a next step, we are also doing a lot of internal work to become more effective and efficient in the way we spend our advertising money. So you should expect in the next couple of years us to also being able to improve what we get out of our advertising, improving our targeting capabilities in the company, improving our understanding of the new medias we are using, particularly digital and TV, and improving the quality of our advertising from a creative standpoint, which, by the way, I believe is one of the key strengths we're exploiting in this moment, and finally, addressing and focusing our advertising on the areas of highest return that clearly appear to be our outstanding innovation.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","For retail, a related question here on advertising spend. Could you give us a little sense in terms of the complexion of that spend, kind of where you've been from a print, TV, social media perspective to know where you're headed? And I guess, related to that, we're looking a little bit more for your strategy around the social media. And then just wondering how much of the increase in advertising spending is related to just overall pricing going up in an Olympics and election year versus actual dollars going towards impressions, et cetera. It'd be helpful.","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. So first of all, the -- our -- we are investing in all 3 big media that you mentioned. The -- we continue to invest. obviously, in print, in magazine advertising around the world. And this investment is gradually continuing to grow, but it's not the area of maximum growth. The area of maximum growth is digital and television advertising in some selected markets. So in a nutshell, we are increasing gradually magazine advertising around the world, we are very strongly increasing digital and social media investment, and we are selectively increasing TV advertising only on the brands and on the markets where TV advertising makes sense. So that's basically our strategy. The pricing of media -- frankly, the pricing inflation on media is very different by markets. As you probably know, it's pretty high in markets like China and pretty moderate in markets like Europe that today are in a sluggish economic situation. But overall, the large, large majority of our increase in advertising is more advertising, more effective advertising and is not driven by pricing. Actually, with our new media purchasing activity enabled by a global media agency by SMI, we are getting better in purchasing media rather than worse.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","One quick housekeeping. How much was China up in the quarter? And then not to ignore Christopher, I guess, could you talk a bit about more about how SMI will help build on the $750 million of anticipated cost savings? In particular, maybe try to help us quantify what some of the additional benefits you're talking about. I recognize you can't really talk about dollars, but just in terms of trying to frame it for us, that would be pretty helpful, including SAP implementation and also the benefits there.","Richard W. Kunes","First, so Mark, in the quarter, China was up 14% on a comparable currency basis.","Fabrizio Freda","And before Chris will answer your question on SMI, just to frame it. In a sense, you have seen us restructuring the company and delivering in these areas what I believe is a very successful plan for $700 million -- up to $750 million savings by the end of 2013. SMI is basically supposed to enable Phase 2 because SMI, as Chris in his prepared remark explained, has a peak of cost in reality for us in 2012 and '13. So to be very clear, this year, we are delivering 120 points of margin improvement despite being at the peak of SMI cost, and also in '13, will be a similar area of high SMI cost. And so this is an investment. While on the contrary, starting '14, SMI will start being a saving and will generate and enable the second phase of savings in the company that will allow us to continue both the margin improvements and obviously generate growth. Chris, please?","Christopher Wood","Thank you, Fabrizio. And thanks for the question, Mark. Obviously, we expect savings to continue to grow and be significantly higher than we originally estimated. One, because the scope of what we're doing within SMI has expanded. And as we gain more and more insight into the opportunities that are unleashed by either the process efficiencies or the visibility that we get through business intelligence, we just basically are looking at better and faster ways to leverage the existing savings. So let me give you an example. Right now, we think we can save about 3x the amount we originally expected from indirect procurement simply by having visibility into what we buy, where we buy, at what price and with what vendors. At the same time, we're building capabilities as we go through SMI, both from an informational point of view, whether it's our financial systems or our reporting systems, but also transactional systems. In Europe, we've implemented a tool called Vistex, which gives us visibility into the terms and conditions that we have with all our retailers. So just having that information across the European region helps us to negotiate better, helps us to leverage deals with pan-European retailers, et cetera. And just on a small point, I'm not a logistics expert, but moving to pick to voice in our distribution system centers, we have 30% to 40% more efficient picking and shipping. So all these things add up to basically give us a turbo boost on top of the savings areas that we've already identified under the PMT. So I guess, in a nutshell, you could say we're moving from kind of sourced savings to leveraged savings over the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Wu with Telsey Advisory Group.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","On Europe, sounds like Germany and the U.K. are still strong. You're obviously gaining share there and benefiting from Revitalizing Supreme. But can you perhaps talk about sort of what you're seeing there in terms of the environment and whether you've had to be more promotional at all, particularly in the U.K., to drive sales and how the sell-in versus sell-out rates are trending, if you are concerned at all about the inventory levels?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. No, actually, we are growing very strong.  In Europe we are growing 11.7% in markets which are pretty sluggish. And definitely not driven by promotion. To be very clear, our promotion spending is down significantly in the quarter in every single country around the world. So this is driven by what I was explaining before. This is driven by our new strategy, where we have some amazing innovation which increased advertising. And even in markets which are soft, we come in with innovation supported by strong advertising, and consumers react. For example, it's interesting to see that even in these markets like U.K., we see prestige growing faster than mass because at the end, in a soft market, all competitors tend maybe to advertise less. And on the contrary, we come up with a great innovation and stronger advertising in the prestige area, which actually moves consumers to our area. So it's a pull strategy, not a push strategy, which is driving our growth in this moment also in soft markets. And obviously, this is giving us interesting market share gains.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A couple of questions. Was the timing of Easter -- did that affect your shipments in the U.S.? And would that possibly create a slowdown from the third quarter into the fourth quarter? And then also, a similar kind of question about China. You said the Chinese New Year created a move by consumers to other parts of the world. China was a significant slowdown in growth from the first and second quarter. Will we get a pickup going ahead? Or is that -- should we expect continued slowing in China?","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. Let me start. From the U.S., our underlying business strength is really strong. Our U.S. business is very strong, and we believe we continue to be very, very solid. By the way, our estimate of sales growth for the last quarter is about 10%, and we've been growing about 9% in this quarter. So independently how festivities or things fall, we are consistently growing very close to double-digit.  Around the world and U.S. we continue to be strong. In the U.S. also, we have a particularly strong growth in skin care, so far, where we're building impressive market share, as I was explaining in my prepared remarks. In makeup also, we are doing well, particularly when you add to the NPD number our sales in the free-standing store of M-A-C, which are significant and doing well, while we are temporarily losing market share in fragrance, where as I explained, also because part of the strategy is just we want to avoid being too promotional, as I explained. We are deciding not to try to buy all the promotional volume that was particularly in the fragrance category pretty heavy. And so we are still paying the consequence of getting out of a more promotional game and in a more sustainable sales game. But we believe we'll do better when we'll be at the end of this process, also growth in term of growth in fragrances. So that's as far as North America. China. China is growing at 14%, which is very, very solid overall. And you should also assume that this includes the fact that there was Chinese New Year in the middle of this quarter. Now what we see more and more in these big festivities like Chinese New Year, that there are enormous amount of Chinese traveling in these periods. And they buy very high amount of volumes of our business, frankly, in general, luxury in travel retail and in the countries that they visit. As you know, the majority of Chinese travels to Hong Kong, to Taiwan, to Paris, to New York, and finally, in the various airports around the world. So yes, China was plus 14%. But travel retail was plus 23%, Hong Kong had a terrific year, France was growing, et cetera. In other words, there is an impact of Chinese consumers which is well beyond the numbers of Mainland China. So I believe that in this moment, we are doing very, very well and continue to do very, very well with Chinese consumer. The last piece of information. The China growth is a bit changing in term of dimension. China growth is -- the growth is not as strong as it used to be in the big cities like Shanghai and Beijing, but is very much accelerating in the Tier 2, Tier 3 and even Tier 4 cities at this point of time, in domestic airports, in the new vacation places of China, where now Chinese are having more and more vacation time. So China is evolving but is very strong, and I believe will continue to be pretty solid.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A few things. One is, we were just looking at your earnings progression on a quarter-over-quarter basis when you look at it versus the annual. And kind of in this what we call the pre-Fabrizio era, the first half was only slightly above 50% of annual earnings per share on average. But since that time, it's gone up pretty significantly, so the first half was about 3\/4 or 75% of your annual earnings. And I'm just trying to understand whether that's a pattern of business, whether that's the fact that you're underearning in the back half to prepare for the first half of the fiscal next year. Or is there something else that we're missing?","Richard W. Kunes","Ali, a couple of quarters ago, I think we talked about a business model that we're using to drive our business from a top line perspective but also to be sure that we're taking advantage of opportunities that present themselves during the year and to protect our bottom line. So we start the year with what we believe is a pretty reasonable and above-market growth rate in sales. But we also build in contingency monies and monies that we have corporately that we use to protect profitability if need be, if sales do not come in as expected. Or as we start to see the year unfold and we overachieve, we take those monies and target them to selected opportunities of high growth or the biggest opportunities for the company. So effectively, what happens is if things go well, we achieve a reasonably high level of profitability in the first half of the year, we have these extra funds to drive opportunities in the second half of the year. That's why our spending is a little higher in the second half of the year. But it then targets, if you will, a continuation of that high growth going into the next fiscal year. So it's a -- we think it's a very effective business model because it gives us protection on the bottom line in case there's disruptions. But it also gives us great opportunities to see how the year unfolds and where the opportunities and what products and regions and countries are doing the best and focus resources into those best opportunities.","Fabrizio Freda","And, Ali, I just want to add, that we talked this -- about this in detail a couple of meetings ago. I believe this is really a new financial model that we are using that's generating enormous competitive advantage, also because allow us to direct funds to the biggest opportunity in a pretty significant way when they appear as opposite to a historical model where everything was incremental, meaning incremental spending every single country, on every single brand of a little bit. Now we can decide there are those 2 big opportunities in this brand, in this region and go for it and win big, and then move to the next one. And we have created this internal flexibility, which is, frankly, a strong competitive advantage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Faiza calling in for Bill. We just wanted to talk a little bit about Korea. You talked about a decline in that market, and there are some signs about a macro slowdown. And with Korea being one of the top beauty markets in Asia, I just want to get a little bit more your perspective on that market and what your strategy is going to be going forward. And also if you expect with Japan, as the tsunami is lapped going forward, if you expect that to sort of mask some of the decline in Korea?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. On Korea -- frankly, Korea is a market that oscillates, is -- goes up and down over the years. And also to read Korea, you should also read what's happening in travel retail in Korea. Because depending on the current situation or the pricing situation, Koreans tend to buy more in Seoul or in their travel, and there is a phenomenon [ph]. On Japan, yes, we believe that, obviously, we have the tsunami teetering [ph] the base, so we'll believe we have a high single-digit growth potential in the next month in Japan. And in Japan, we are doing slightly better than what we anticipated. But in the end, the market remains pretty flattish, apart from obviously the different base period in the case of the tsunami. But since we have Chris in the room today, which was the General Manager of Korea, just want to make sure if you want to add anything on Korea.","Christopher Wood","Yes. I just think, Fabrizio said it, it can be cyclical, it's not predictive. But if you take from 2000 until now, I think we've had 3 or 4 periods of lasting between 1.5 to 2 years where the luxury market slowed down.  By no reason was it stagnant. I think Korea is growing in the 6% range right now. And I think it's a phenomenon of uncertainty surrounding the elections. I think it's a calming period with real estate prices increasing [ph] and Koreans basically uncertain about what's going to happen in the future. So I think the market will come back. It always does. The biggest concern today for us should be the mass market because we see very large growth in the mass market in Korea with very high-quality products, and we shouldn't take our eye off the types of investments and the high-touch approach that we've taken in the past. So we're obviously looking at it very, very carefully. But I think that there's no time like the present to be devising our strategy for the next 6 to 12 months because the market will definitely come right back up again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Couple of questions. Given that the Chinese consumer is such a big part of travel retail consumption, have you given any thought to reclassifying travel retail, either breaking it out or putting it into the Asia business? And can you give an estimate as to what you think your sales to the Chinese consumer are? I think at one point, you said $1 billion, if that's changed. And then on SMI -- and forgive me if you've already been specific about this, but I'm just wondering if the gross margin upside potential, if that's something you could quantify, and maybe even on the SG&A line. Obviously, you're going to spend a good deal of that back. But what do you think is the margin opportunity out of SMI over the next 3 or 4 years?","Richard W. Kunes","So certainly, if you want to start with the SMI piece first, without quantification, right, because what we're saying is we have guidance out there through fiscal 2014. But if you look longer term, where will the benefits come from, from SMI in a little bit more specificity? Certainly, from improved service levels. We know, as Christopher alluded to, that we did not have always the right products in the right place at the right time. So we'll improve our service level, which will result obviously in less returns as well. We'll have a leaner and more responsive supply chain in an operations organization. So both of those 2 items will certainly generate a greater gross margin. We'll have better inventory management, which will result in lower levels. We currently turn our inventory about twice a year, and we should turn it about 3x a year. That will reduce obsolescence and destructions. Again, those expenses aren't part of gross margin. But then as you go down into operating expenses, Christopher mentioned just a few moments ago that we already see probably 3x what we originally anticipated saving in indirect procurement. We're going to close points of distribution, so we'll have less warehouses, lower distribution costs and better efficiencies in the warehouses that we keep open. And I think, again, Christopher mentioned some statistics of greater efficiencies in distribution. We'll have improved processes throughout our organization. So we're in the process of actually transitioning from an implementation phase of SAP into a value-creation phase. And we mentioned that, that transition happens in the '12 to '13 point. And Fabrizio said in '14 and beyond we'll begin to see some of these efficiencies. But we are actually developing key performance indicators by process and building those into our budgets for the individual operating units to be able to drive those efficiencies and make sure that we get them. And lastly, is just better information and faster information. And with better and faster information, we can make smarter decisions and we can react quicker, and all of those will drive improved profitability.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. On the travel retail one, no, we are not considering any major reclassification on travel retail. However, we made transparent all the specific information on travel retail. And so you can read through travel retail what's happening in retail. And yes, the Asian consumers are more and more important, particularly the Chinese consumer, for travel retail, but it's also true that skin care and makeup are becoming more and more important, also for travel retail. And we look at this in this way internally. We do start these P&Ls in what happen if we invest more in China without the returns that we get in travel retail. By the way, we study also what happens when we invest in China in term of returns in travel retail, Hong Kong, the Taiwan, Paris. Or we study what happens when we invest in M-A-C Brazil in term of return in travel retail Brazil or New York sales or Miami sales. So we are becoming more and more sophisticated in understanding the result of our investment across horizontally all our system. And again, this is because of the new way we work together and also because of what SMI enabled us to do it in term of information sharing.","Operator","We have time for one more question, please. Your last question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on pricing because you guys mentioned that price and mix together were really a big contributor of growth, but that there was outsized growth in the super luxury end of the portfolio. And knowing that strategic pricing had been something you'd said you were going to tread lightly on but saw as a big opportunity, can you talk a little bit about how that's going, how broadly you're pricing and in what market, if it's market-specific?","Fabrizio Freda","Sure. And so yes, we have started this fiscal year, so the fiscal year '12 is the first year. We have started implementing the results of our strategic pricing initiative. And the result of this, that this fiscal year, on average, the input of price on our sales will be up 2 points versus an historical average of about 1 point. Obviously, with the exception of a few years, where the average was 0, but in general, it was about 1 point. And now we have doubled that this fiscal year. And we believe we have potential to continue having good input from -- good increases from prices in the future. That is -- that's about [ph] the ranges, 2, 3 points versus 1 historically, is the potential, because anyway, prices is pretty selective. That's why it's strategic. We are selectively pricing where it's possible on innovation. We are selectively pricing some countries to adjust our corridors, international corridor. We are selecting pricing on where we discover opportunities. And we are pricing up or down. In some cases, we are pricing down certain SKUs or certain markets. In the case of SKUs, we may be pricing down because we have discovered that this brand, this SKU is sourcing  from us and there is a specific price point where this sources increases. Or we may price down in a certain market because of the corridor versus other market to limit the phenomenon of people buying outside of the market or being -- comparing prices and being demotivated by these comparisons. So that's the work we are doing, and that is all included in our strategic prices concept.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

We delivered exceptional results in the second quarter, which I will elaborate on shortly.","But first I want to acknowledge how concerned we are for all the people including our employee and consumers who are affected by the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in China and around the world. Our hearts go out to them and I will discuss what steps our company is taking to support them in a few minutes.","In the second quarter, our prestige beauty portfolio resonated with consumers globally. Our successful strategy based on multiple engines of growth once again helped fuel our performance as we grew in all regions and all major categories.","Skin care rose in every region as did fragrance and hair care while makeup grew internationally. The company generated 16% constant currency sales growth, the highest organic growth rate in 20 years in the seasonally largest quarter of our fiscal year allowing us to gain significant share in global prestige beauty. While our second quarter continues to be boosted by holiday, it now also includes another important event driver Singles Day.","Our advanced planning for these events delivered strong growth across our business led by Asia\/Pacific region, the global online and travel retail channels and the skincare and fragrance categories powered by the extraordinary performance of Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer and our luxury and artisanal fragrance brands.","With disciplined expense management, we leverage our sales growth into a 21% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our strong performance reflected smart and deliberate investments in the best opportunities worldwide including focused product innovations, increased advertising, enhanced digital marketing, better use of data analytics, a greater local relevance.","We attracted a broader group of consumers and continued to build strong repeat rates for our products driving greater loyalty. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Korean-based Have & Be Company after having taken a minority stake four years ago. It\u2019s Dr. Jart+ skin care brand has grown rapidly with cutting-edge innovation and excellent speed to market capabilities.","We are optimistic about our first acquisition in Asia and we see many opportunities to further cultivate the brand globally as consumer interest in skin care continues to expand.","Our momentum continued in the first three weeks of January. But as you all know, the global environment has changed meaningfully, following the outbreak of the coronavirus. Our thoughts are with individuals who have been diagnosis and those who are more than a family in France.","The Chinese government has responded in a very serious manner along with many other countries and organization and they are working entirely to address and contain the outbreak and help those afflicted.","As a company, we are focused on the well-being of our employees in China and globally and are taking appropriate measures to protect them based on guidance from local authorities and the World Health Organization. Our consumer and business partners in China and elsewhere are also top of mind and we actively engage its way to support them. We are pledging RMB5 million to support coronavirus release effort for needs across China. We are matching donations of U.S. based employees to assist with the outbreak. We are working on various support initiatives to support people and their recovery.","Over the past 10 years in my role as CEO, I've made numerous trips to many regions of China. I met with our local employees, talked to consumers of all ages and conferred with our business partners. I travel all over to learn more about its beautiful country its wonderful people. My heart goes out to the citizens of China during this difficult time, and I look forward to my next trip there hopefully in the near future.","Although, it is difficult to anticipate the full impact of the coronavirus on our business, we expect the next couple of months will be very challenging. Chinese consumers in many big cities are staying home. And retailers are closing stores or limiting hours, in an effort to help contain the spread of the virus.","Additionally, global travel is being restricted. And the effect is being felt beyond China, into major travel retail corridors and large tourist cities. Given what we know now and our experience with past epidemics, we believe our business will gradually recover towards the end of the fiscal year.","We stand ready, to invest, to facilitate the recovery as soon as the market supports it, leveraging the flexibility of our resource allocation and our multiple growth drivers. We remain committed to China and to the Chinese consumers for the long-term.","And plan to increase our R&D investment in the market, in order to drive both breakthrough, prestige beauty innovation for China, the Asia\/Pacific region and the rest of the world.","Reflecting China leadership in science, we will expand upon our existing in-market capability. And build a new state-of-art innovation center, complete with the latest technologies and tools.","This facility will also highlight our passion and commitment to quality, sustainability and employee wellness. Our enhanced capability and capacity will ensure we meet the needs of Chinese and Asia consumers, with local relevancy and local trends, as well as with creativity, agility and speed.","These investment aims to sustain the long-term development of our company in China, and around the world. We will continue working to advance this new development. And look forward to sharing more details in the future.","Turning back to the second quarter results, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand was again a star, in our portfolio. The brand grew strong double-digits globally, in both skin care and makeup and rose in every region, powered by its main hero franchises, including Advanced Night Repair as well as Re-Nutriv, Revitalizing Supreme, Micro Essence and Double Wear.","This is a beautiful example of our multiple engines, not only winning across many brands, but also within a big brand. Re-Nutriv, Est\u00e9e Lauder luxury skin care line delivered superb results, supported by targeted marketing, with the luxury consumer, enhanced merchandising and desirable innovation.","Looking now at our geographic results, sales advanced in every region with strength across categories. In Asia\/Pacific, virtually every market grew, led by China, which accelerated, generating strong double-digit growth as all our brands, category and channels advanced.","We had terrific growth from smaller cities in China, which are becoming a greater part of our business, and a promising long-term growth driver. We expanded into two new cities, bringing our total to 123.","Our online business in China more than doubled, elevated by well-integrated online and offline campaigns for Singles Day. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand was among Tmall best performers for the event, while M\u2022A\u2022C, La Mer and Jo Malone London, each excelled in their respective categories.","Our brand expansion strategy on Tmall was a distinct advantage. As an example, following Tom Ford Beauty launched, on Tmall in 2019, the brand executed its first Singles Day to tremendous success in both fragrance and makeup.","Its performance was twice that of its Tmall launch day which was our biggest launch ever on the platform. Chinese consumer interest in prestige fragrance category is rising and we are nicely positioned with our wide portfolio of luxury fragrances.","Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty excelled in the quarter, helping to further diversify our business in China. We plan to launch additional luxury fragrance there later this year.","We delivered strong growth in our other emerging markets, outside of China, led by terrific results in Russia, India, Thailand and Brazil. In the quarter, we continue to invest for growth and attract new consumers.","For example, Brazil is the fourth largest market globally for hair care. And we launched Aveda, our 10th brand there. We are showcasing the brand historical commitment to sustainability, the environment and botanically-based product, with a salon in S\u00e3o Paulo that includes sustainable elements.","Across Europe the Middle East and Africa, Est\u00e9e Lauder, M\u2022A\u2022C, Clinique and La Mer, our four biggest brands, prospered demonstrating the appeal of established brands that have broad exposure to multiple subcategories and compelling innovation.","Every category advanced in the region. Our skin care brand led the growth with sought-after newness from La Mer, Darphin and Origins. And the U.K. grew modestly, for the second consecutive quarter in a difficult environment and several of our brands gained share.","Our growth strategy are showing promise amid macro industry-specific headwinds.","In North America, we made good progress towards stabilization of the business. We learned -- we leaned into our multiple engines of growth, leveraging our successful skincare and fragrance franchises during the holiday season, in light of industry challenges in makeup.","There were several bright spots. Brand representing about half of our sales grew and we had gains in the specialty-multi and online channels. In fact, La Mer delivered record Black Friday sales on its own site, driven by unique product assortment and an influencer-led holiday campaign.","As we work to rejuvenate the makeup business in North America we are creating products that leverage consumer insight from our enhanced data analytics. For example, we learned consumers want product that combine skincare benefits with makeup. In response, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand just launched Futurist Hydra Rescue, a new moisturizing foundation, combining the positioning of our winning Futurist franchise in China with consumer needs in North America. The launch is off to a very strong start, with high ratings and reviews.","Looking now at the channels. Our global online business delivered stellar results. Our brand sites, third-party sites and retailer sites, all grew double-digit, with broad-based strength across regions. Our online business was vibrant globally around Cyber Monday, as our brands offered well-received products and set in the important holiday gifting given season.","We continue to invest in our excellent growth prospects online. We launched our brands on more third-party sites which are rising in popularity, deploy new digital payment technologies across several of our brand sites in the U.S. and expanded our loyalty programs. We reach engaged content. We have increased the time consumers spend on our brand sites and traffic has grown, increasing the inherent media value these sites provide.","Travel Retail also continued its momentum. Our top eight brands grew double digits at retail, with strengths in skin care and our luxury and our artisanal fragrance brands grew strongly, aided by expanded distribution in the channel. Innovative pre-retail campaign, unique retailers' activision and effective advertising, all contributed to fantastic results.","The pretail segment of Travel Retail excelled in the quarter and is becoming an increasingly important part of our business. Pretail enable us to engage with consumers before they travel, build brand equity and desirability and drive conversion. When tourism and travel resume, following containment of the coronavirus, we anticipate that pretail will continue to start.","Another important highlight this quarter was the publication of our 2019 Citizenship and Sustainability Report. Last March we announced new goals and the report details our vision and progress. One of our goals is to promote ingredient transparency across our brands and Aveda led the way with an ingredient velocity on its websites. Other brands will soon follow.","Innovation is the core of our company, once again helped drive our performance, accounting for over 25% of sales. We have exciting innovation from our four biggest brands coming in the second half of our fiscal year, many in their hero franchises. We believe these launches will be well received by consumers globally and these important franchises have high loyalty.","We are pleased by our strong start in the first half and we are now focused on managing effectively throughout the coronavirus outbreak. We are determined to serve our consumers in the best ways possible. We believe that the efforts of the Chinese government along with leadership from around the world to contain the outbreak will prove effective. I want to thank our employees worldwide to their extraordinary efforts working through this challenging time, while supporting each other, our consumers, the communities where we work and our business. Their grace and agility are a testament to our company culture.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Travis","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. Certainly, our thoughts and best wishes are with everyone managing through a very difficult situation in China and globally. We are committed to supporting our employees and other stakeholders, while we also manage the business impact as best we can during this time.","As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. We acquired Have & Be the owner of the Dr. Jart+ brand towards the end of December. The results for the new brand will be recorded in future periods on a one month lag, so you can expect operating results from Dr. Jart+ to be reflected in our fiscal third quarter for the first time, including the impact of purchase accounting and the interest expense on the debt we issued largely to fund this acquisition.","So starting with the quarter results. Net sales for the second quarter rose 16% driven by strong growth in our international regions and improvement in North America. Sales growth in Asia, travel retail and online continue to exceed our expectations.","From a geographic standpoint, our Asia Pacific region net sales rose 30% with broad-based growth across the region. Sales in Greater China accelerated, rising very strong double-digits. Our sales in Mainland China continued to deliver broad-based growth across cities, brands, categories and channels and our brands saw record results on Singles Day.","As expected, sales on Hong Kong declined more than 20%. Among developed markets in APAC, we again delivered double-digit sales growth in Korea this quarter. Our sales in Japan rose mid-single digits despite the October 1st, VAT increase last year that contributed to double-digit growth last quarter. And emerging markets in Southeast Asia grew high-single-digits led by Thailand.","Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 18% with most markets contributing to growth. Our global travel retail business rose strong double-digits driven largely by like-door growth the continued rapid development of online pre-ordering and the successful introduction of newer brands like Le Labo and KILIAN.","Emerging markets in the region grew double-digits led by India and Russia. Western European markets grew low to mid-single digits led by Italy, Iberia and Germany. Net sales in the Americas rose 1%, a significant improvement from last quarter.","Skin care and fragrance showed good growth driven by Est\u00e9e Lauder, Origins and La Mer as well as strong holiday performances from Jo Malone and Tom Ford. Initial shipments of Est\u00e9e Lauder's new Futurist Hydra Rescue Moisturizing Makeup launch helped to partially offset the overall continued weakness in the makeup category.","In North America, sales rose high-single-digits across all our online channels. Our sales in the specialty-multi channel grew double-digits, while the brick-and-mortar department store business remained challenged.","From a category standpoint, skin care once again led growth this quarter. Net sales accelerated to 28% growth with strong contributions from Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, Origins and Clinique. Innovations such as Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair Intense Reset Concentrate La Mer The Regenerating Serum and Clinique iD BB-gel contributed incremental sales and supported their hero franchises.","Net sales in makeup grew 7% led by Est\u00e9e Lauder, Tom Ford and Bobbi Brown. Solid innovation and support in foundation and lip products, as well as special holiday sets and products drove growth in the category. Sales of fragrances grew 9% driven by strong holiday activations at Jo Malone, London and the launch of Metallique from Tom Ford.","Fragrance sales grew across all regions, but were strongest in the Americas and in Asia. Our hair care sales rose 5% driven by the launch of the Nutriplenish line of products from Aveda and improvement at Bumble and bumble.","Our gross margin increased 20 basis points compared to the second quarter last year. Favorable pricing and mix was partially offset by the impact of the incremental tariffs and higher obsolescence costs.","Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 130 basis points. We continue to leverage higher sales and greater efficiencies in our selling model and store operating costs to fund advertising and strategic investments in technology and other capabilities.","Operating income rose 23% and operating margin increased by 150 basis points. Adjusted diluted EPS of $2.11, increased 21% compared to the prior year, and the currency translation impact was negligible. EPS was higher than expected due to the stronger sales growth as well as disciplined expense management and was partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate.","During the quarter, we acquired the remaining stake in Have & Be, the Korean-based skin care company. The transaction resulted in a one-time gain of $576 million, primarily related to the re-measurement of our previously held minority equity investment to fair value. We also recorded $777 million of impairment charges related to three of our four makeup brands a reflection of the continued challenges in the makeup category that have been most prevalent in North America.","While the market momentum for makeup has slowed in the near term as we have previously discussed, the growth opportunities and the strategic value of these brands remains compelling as evidenced by our increased share and capability in specialty-multi retail the enhanced social media expertise of the brand and an increased consumer base of Gen-Z and millennials.","Turning now to cash flow. For the six months, we generated $1.26 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was roughly flat with the prior year. Higher earnings were offset primarily by the timing and level of accounts payable. We invested $291 million in capital expenditures with cash and $1.04 billion to acquire the remaining equity interest in Have & Be, which was funded with debt. We also continue to return cash to stockholders by utilizing $813 million to repurchase 4.3 million shares of our stock and $330 million to pay dividends.","So we ended the first six months of the fiscal year with strong net sales growth of 14% in constant currency and adjusted EPS growth of 21%, a tremendous reflection of the hard work of our teams as well as strong consumer momentum that we have in our markets.","So now let's turn to our outlook for the balance of this year. The strong performance in the first half of our fiscal year, our multiple engines of growth strategy and the greater financial flexibility and agility we have built into our operating model is expected to help us to effectively manage through the short-term disruption caused by the Coronavirus outbreak.","Due to the rapid escalation and the fluidity of the situation, it is both complex and difficult to predict the timing and the corresponding impact on our business. Therefore, we are not giving explicit guidance for the third quarter. We also remain mindful that a variety of macro risks such as ongoing trade tensions and continued challenges in Hong Kong's retail environment could impact our second half results.","For the year -- for the fiscal year, we now strive to achieve net sales growth of at least 6% to 8% in constant currency. This range is before the impact of one point of growth from the inclusion of sales from Have & Be.","Currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 1 percentage point reflecting weighted average rates of $1.10 for the euro, $1.27 for the pound and 7.03 for the won for the fiscal year. With this sales guidance, EPS is expected to range between $5.60 and $5.70 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from currency translation and $0.18 dilution from the Have & Be acquisition.","In constant currency, we expect EPS growth of 6% to 8%. Excluding the dilution from Have & Be, EPS growth is expected to be at least 9% to 11%, which remains in line with our long-term objectives. For the second half, net sales are expected to increase approximately 1% to 2% in constant currency.","Currency translation is expected to negatively impact growth by 1 percentage point and the inclusion of Have & Be is expected to add 2 percentage points. In terms of cadence throughout the second half we have anticipated the greatest negative sales impact from the Coronavirus to be in the third quarter followed by a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter.","We are severely curtailing discretionary costs, while continuing to support critical areas of growth. Leading Beauty Forward has reduced our percentage of fixed cost in our operations, which gives us greater agility to manage more effectively with slowing sales.","We expect the belt tightening to have the maximum benefit in the fourth quarter. EPS is forecast between $1.86 and $1.91 before restructuring charges. This includes approximately $0.03 dilution from currency and $0.17 dilution from Have & Be, which includes some impact from the Coronavirus outbreak, purchase accounting and interest expense on the debt issuance as I mentioned previously.","While our outlook for the balance of this year is uncertain, we do remain quite optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for the company. We believe we can manage through this difficult health prices while maintaining the agility to invest as needed and regain our momentum once the recovery is established.","On behalf of the entire Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, we extend our deepest well wishes to those who have been affected and thank everyone for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this period particularly our incredibly hardworking and wonderful team in China.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Dara Mohsenian","Hi. Good morning, guys. So just was hoping for a bit more clarity on the Coronavirus and how you guys are thinking about the potential impact longer term. I guess what we've seen with past epidemics is usually beauty demands come back pretty quickly after a couple of quarters. I know there's not a lot of visibility here and the duration of illness is obviously still a big wildcard. But just to retail any initial thoughts or context on if you think this could be an issue that impairs longer-term growth as we look out over the next few years? You talked about a gradual recovery through fiscal year end. Should we expect things to sort of ramp-up pretty quickly after that? Or how are you thinking about it in terms of longevity of impact? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","So obviously, we don't know about the specific medical health recovery timing, which is the unknown at this point. But we are in agreement with your assumption, which is basically this will have an impact in the short term and definition of short term is what is unknown today. But then after this period, there will be a recovery and people will come gradually back to normal habits. And so, we do expect to recover our momentum at the end of the health crisis.","And in terms of our assumption today are in line with what you said. We assume the two quarters to be affected by the impact and we expect a normalization in fiscal year '21. That's our assumption today. The other important thing is that, we are ready to stay close to the current mitigation of the issue and resolution of the health classes as we are doing, supporting our China team and all the activities that the government is putting in place in China today. And we also will stand ready to support the recovery when the recovery will be happening and to invest behind the recovery as required by the market opportunity, but most importantly, by the needs of rebuilding the right consumption of Chinese consumers in the name of the economical development of China.","Dara Mohsenian","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping we'd talk actually a little bit about the Americas because the strength this quarter, the inflection was very notable. So I was wondering, if you could talk a bit more about how much you think this is tied to just being really proactive in promoting and getting behind I should say in fragrance and skin and holiday being the key to this. Or are you starting to see other lift that you think can carry through past holiday? And then in part with that of course we've had the news about incremental Macy's door closures this week. So, if you can just comment on the outlook for the rest of the year in the Americas. Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","So, first of all, in -- as we said this quarter has contributed to the stabilization of our North America business and this has been in line with the strategy we communicated in Investor Day. And we remain committed and to continue the work of stabilization in the next months. So what happened this quarter is, first of all, we have used as anticipated much more granular insight in the market to activate our plans and much more local relevance in the activation.","The other thing that happened, we have recognized the softness of the overall makeup market and that's why we have accelerated our activity in skin care and particularly fragrances during the holiday season that we have well fitting the situation and we got great results. So, we had -- if you want adjusted our engines of growth in a way that contributed to the good results.","Our innovation pipeline as anticipated has been strong and the impact of innovation has improved. And so, all this have been a positive impact. We will continue to operate in that direction, but we do have still to be confront some of the headwinds. To be clear, the makeup softness, particularly the color makeup softness is continuing.","As you mentioned, the closures of certain retailing stores where we do have high market share will continue although we completely share the Macy's strategy of focusing on the high-performance doors and\/or gradually stopping the smaller and lower performance doors with -- as I said, we support the strategy, but obviously we will need to operate with the strategy with making sure that we retain the consumer -- the brands. And this will be difficult, but we will do our best to do that. So we need to take under account our extraordinary efforts to improve our model that are working, but also take under account there will continue to be headwinds. So our strategy remains at this point stabilization.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. And just as a follow-up, how are you thinking about the impact of Chinese travelers not really visiting the U.S. over the next several months just in terms of the outlook?","Fabrizio Freda","That's actually a good point. We assume that there will be obviously an important reduction of Chinese travelers not visiting the U.S. in the next at least two, three months and this will have a negative impact obviously on the sales to Chinese tourists.","Frankly, in this moment we are assuming in our guidance also a slowdown on any travel population. To be clear in this moment because of the coronavirus global concern, tourists in general is being reduced temporary. So, we are taking this temporary assumption -- sorry the assumption of this temporary reduction under account in our guidance.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Great. Thanks, so much.","Tracey Travis","And I just want to add as it relates to our guidance. I mentioned the range of $1.82 to $1.91 which is within our press release. I think I mentioned a different number in our guidance for the second half.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on a really good quarter. So, I want to ask you on the Dr. Jart+ dilution. Could you walk us through how much the $0.18 -- we're trying to think forward I guess over the four quarters of integrating that business, how much of that is one-time in nature? And when do you see that starting to wear off or even possibly turn to an accretive position?","And then I just -- I want to ask you as you think through the U.S. number a little bit, so do you think the retailers that you worked with on the holiday strategy to get more skin care and fragrance out there? They really seem to want to keep pushing on makeup even as the warning signs were showing up over the last year or two. Do you think they've gone through the psychological change yet that skin care is going to be the driver for the medium term? And are they accepting that they have to pull back more on makeup in a structural way?","I guess are the gains you saw in skin care and fragrance, would you characterize those as sticky and shelf space gains that are going to remain dedicated to those categories as we look into calendar 2020?","Tracey Travis","Yes. So, starting with the Have & Be dilution, we obviously have the step-up in inventory which is one-time depends on how you're treating the interest expense which is also in that number.","What I would say Michael is that we expect that Have & Be will be, if you think forward, relatively flat including purchase accounting. So, eliminating those onetime items next year and accretive the following year.","Michael Binetti","Okay.","Tracey Travis","The makeup question is the second question?","Michael Binetti","Yes.","Fabrizio Freda","Sorry could you repeat who was the subject to the makeup when you said they? I didn't understand.","Michael Binetti","Yes. Well, it sounds like it was a pretty meaningful acceleration. Obviously in North America or in America we can see your numbers. But it sounds like the number that you got from specialty-multi which was a great growth channel for you guys over the last few years, but slowed recently sounds like it improved a lot this quarter and it sounds like you worked with them on skin care.","And I'm just wondering if you feel like that channel they feel like they've gone through the mental change of saying, look skin care is going to be the bigger driver and we're going to give them -- give that category more shelf space that sticks around calendar 2020.","Fabrizio Freda","I -- frankly, yes, I think everyone realizes the power of skin care in this moment and we are all working together to leverage the power of skin care also because skin care for instant results and skincare product combined with makeup is on a growth.","So, there are -- yes you speak about shelf space which obviously is a bit more gradual in the way it changes. But definitely innovation programs are reflecting a lot of this. So, there is more activity, more social media, more advertising in skin care than before and this is a reflection on the results.","By the way makeup is a big category. The makeup for face meaning foundation for example is still doing very, very well. The place which is softer is color. And importantly, what we are doing to contribute not only to leverage skincare fragrances better but to reinstate growth in makeup in the future is we have accelerated the innovation in the makeup category contributing to the future results of our retail partners also in this category.","So, to be clear, we are not giving up at all on makeup. We are just accepting that in the short-term, we are focusing more on other category and innovating better in makeup to reactivate the consumer interest.","Michael Binetti","Thank you very much. Congrats on getting North America back to positive.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks. Good morning and let me add my congratulations. I guess my question is around Amazon. There's been some press out recently talking about them potentially evolving their model to launch some luxury brands, maybe using a concession model. If something like this was to play out, would you ever consider -- or reconsider, excuse me, Amazon as a channel for luxury beauty?","And then just a follow-up on China. Can you share, Tracey, maybe what percent of physical doors have been shuttered? And are you seeing any major change in trend in the online business in China since the outbreak has escalated? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. On the first question is -- the answer is no. At this point, we are not considering Amazon, a channel for our luxury beauty products and we are focusing of our current channels and our current partners to build a continued stabilization in North America of our business.","As far as the China question, is the number of physical doors, I'll let Tracey go with that.","Tracey Travis","Yes. So, as you can imagine it's quite fluid. And one of the things that we've seen is the Chinese New Year extended for many, many of our employees. Our stores have closed as malls have closed. So, very recently two-thirds of our department store doors were closed and the remaining doors were on reduced hours. Now that could change next week, so this is a very fluid situation.","Fabrizio Freda","And on the second part of the China question which is the online, absolutely the online channel is very strong in China and as we said in the second quarter. But in this moment also online is suffering because in this moment in the middle of the outbreak, the delivery system in homes and in the big distribution centers also people are now working like in this moment until February 10th, many people with non-essential activity in factories in other situation this is stopped. The same is for distribution centers the same for other activities.","So online in -- at least in the short-term is having the same issues of brick-and-mortar. In terms of the role of online in the recovery in the future, we are optimistic that online will play a very strong role in the recovery when the recovery will happen.","Erinn Murphy","Thank you for that context. All the best.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Strycula","Hi. Good morning. So, first part of my question just wanted to follow-up on Erinn's question. Can you give us a little bit more texture as to how to disaggregate how Mainland China sales are performing versus the travel retail component of the business? Primarily it's how we think about modeling the back half of the year. One of those businesses is housed within the EMEA segment. The other business is clearly housing APAC. So just want to get a little bit more texture as to which ones being more impacted real time.","And then Fabrizio, if you use history as a guide post here, how do we think about once the issue is call it \"contained\" what is like the recovery path off from that moment forward? Is it typically from what you've seen before three months, four months for travel retail to come back online from flights being booked? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah. So the short answer to the first question in this moment travel retail is the most impacted channel. Because if you think what -- just to give you the context of what's happening, you will probably know that more than 60 airlines just closed their flights. So in this moment the travel in and out of China is suspended in the large majority of cases. So there is lack of traffic for -- just in and out of China.","Second, in general tourism in this moment is more prudent, because it's a global issue. The outbreak is a global concern. And so many people which are concerned to travel in this moment are reducing their choice or postponing some of the travel. And I'm speaking touristic travel.","Then there is a third factor. Many companies have banned travel to any place -- to China, but also to any other place where there is the virus. And so business travel is being reduced not to count the many companies are reducing business travel for cost containment reasons.","So in this moment, the amount of travel in airports is reduced and traffic is significantly reduced. So that's the biggest impact. The second biggest impact is obviously China Mainland itself and Hong Kong, which have reduced significance. So I would say the Greater China area, because of all the reasons that we have already discussed in the prepared remarks that I'm not going to repeat.","But the most important thing is that keep in mind that until February 10 most of the cities are not even -- people are not back to work until at February children are not back to school. And people are requested rightly so not to get out of home for reasons, which are not essential and not going public transportations where there is a risk of contamination. So, the behaviors of the entire population is fundamentally changed. And because of this, this is the second area where in the short-term we expect an impact.","The second part of your question is the recovery. Now the recovery we know what you know. We have studied all the previous cases in all the previous situation. And what we see is that the recovery tends to be hockey sticks, meaning, when the things is back, it's back particularly in the traveling. When traffic is back, traffic is back and the people buy.","The thing that can -- that we can do more in terms of the business learning that we're applying or during the period before the recovery in travel retail will be very important to push conversion, meaning, when there is -- travel retail is built by traffic and by conversion. Conversion is an area where we're making many improvements. So in this period of transition where traffic will be low, we are reworking our plans to use conversion as a key mitigating element of the deep and then obviously we are preparing for future recovery plans when the time will arrive.","The last point I want to make is that we will try to tune the recovery to the recovery of the Chinese economy and the Chinese population. We don't want just to look this as a business. We want to see -- look at this as a contribution to the recovery of the country and really supporting our employees at the country in this. And the same will happen in travel retail where for example some of our customers and retail partners are Chinese.","And we are going to stay close to them to contribute to the recovery of the travel retail business to make sure that our long-term retail partners will benefit from the recovery much -- as much as possible and to start this all again to restart the right process and to regain momentum not only for us, but for the entire industry.","Operator","The next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you. Good morning. And I just want to echo the congrats on your results.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you.","Andrea Teixeira","So as a follow-up on the North America and the comments that you made for mix Fabrizio and obviously there was -- it's natural that in the holidays, it's more giftable skin care and fragrances. And you're also putting more -- I think prudently putting more marketing behind those lines. So do you think that innovation and momentum continue to build into the next few quarters? Or we maybe potentially have some seasonal positive impact of that into the second quarter? Thank you.","Tracey Travis","So I'll start and then Fabrizio can also add his comments. We are progressing towards stabilization in North America. And clearly, it was a strong holiday and strong second quarter for us in North America and in other parts of the globe. So our teams have worked awfully hard to make this holiday season a very good one and consumers responded and we're very happy about that. As we look at the back half of the year, Fabrizio touched on the fact that we do have tourists that we expect that that business to be a bit softer given the situation that we're managing through globally.","And I would also say that North America is making progressive progress. However, I would not expect that the second quarter would necessarily be reflective of continued acceleration from there. But the North America team is executing against all of the strategies that were laid out last year and we're seeing some good outcomes from that. So what we told you last quarter was North America, we expect certainly to have better performance this year than we did last year in North America. So that is progression towards stabilization.","Lauren asked earlier about the Macy's announcement. And clearly, as we've been saying for some time, we believe that brick-and-mortar needs to be taken out of North America. North America has been over retailed for some time. So we are very much aligned with what Macy's has announced in their Investor Day yesterday. The doors that actually would be closing in our fiscal year were already included in our guidance.","Andrea Teixeira","That's helpful.","Operator","The next question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Mark Astrachan","Thanks, and good morning everybody. Just wondering if you could quantify the online percentage of sales from China. And related to that also if you could just quantify the impact benefit from e-commerce accelerating consumption the enhanced availability in China. In other words, previously consumers would have to visit cities selling the product and now you're up to 123. But e-commerce obviously makes the product available everywhere. So maybe if you could just talk a bit about, how you think about that dynamic as having helped past tense sales and how you think about that on a go-forward basis and maybe if you think about some of those Tier 3 to 5 cities, which didn't readily available -- have product readily available, but now people can order online. How do you think about that in terms of accelerating demand, maintaining that demand and kind of how it will impact future growth?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. No, that's a very good question. As I commented a lot of times on the subject this is a very important phenomenon, because today we have physical distribution in China in 123 city with our most distributed brands which are Lauder and Clinique and much lower city coverage in the other brands, which are still on a growth trajectory. So it is a lot of physical distribution potential in the long-term still untapped. But at the same time, we know there is demand in China now in over 600 cities. So there are over 450 cities where there is strong demand and there is not yet physical distribution of prestige luxury and for sure prestige luxury of Est\u00e9e Lauder brands.","So this demand gets filled by online and get filled by -- when there's consumer travel also travel within China like in amazing 3-Tier markets like Hainan Island then where they can access the products or when they travel for internal business or vacation like go to Beijing or to Shanghai. So that's the situation. But online cover a lot these cities and that's why also is growing and is very strategic, because it give us access to these consumers in a very productive way.","The other important positive consequence of this dynamic is that the brick-and-mortar can remain very productive. It can remain very focused where there is the right productivity and online can cover productively the rest. So this is a good phenomenon continue to grow. It is definitely one of the reason behind my comment that we are having better and better results also in the Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities also where physical distribution has not yet arrived. In terms of percentage of sales, China is the highest percentage of sales online versus other markets. It's on high side and it's continued to grow.","Operator","We have time for one more question and that question will come from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi","Thanks. Thanks for the question. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow-up on Mark's question Fabrizio. How much flexibility do you have to turn up the dial on really focusing on some of those lower tier cities that you just referenced? I'm just thinking about as kind of the year progresses and if you really wanted to turn up the dial to generate sales growth in some of these other tier cities. Do you have that kind of control in the near term? Or is it a much longer-term burn?","Fabrizio Freda","I mean, we have control of the online I mean with our partners like Tmall and obviously, our own online activity. But the \u2013 remember we \u2013 our way to build distribution and also to build coverage is \u2013 we are in luxury. And for us selective distribution, which means demand ahead of supply is very important. So we gradually build the demand.","And the reason why today demand is growing so fast also in the city is social media. Because while in the past advertising was local, meaning advertising was focused in the cities where there was physical distribution. Social media by definition is national.","So you are in a dynamic where demand is normally ahead of supply and that's the typical demand of the good luxury market and we are filling this demand gradually and making sure that we keep the concept of desirability and high quality and high quality also the experience that we give to our consumer in mind.","So we are not selling products. We are selling quality and full experiences and we only do that when we can provide the best possible service to the consumer. So the short answer is gradually, but yes, we have the capability to dial up as the market opportunity reveals itself.","Nik Modi","And just a quick follow-up. Of the 450 cities you cited in China's opportunity, how many do you believe Est\u00e9e Lauder as a company has a very good handle on demand? And just a general consumer insights in those cities?","Fabrizio Freda","So I will not give you specific numbers but I can tell you that we have the consumer data, so we know the number of consumers that are buying from different cities. Even we use these data analytics to decide where to open physical distribution. So we use the demand and the elements of the strength of the demand from the cities also to judge our physical distribution strategy to make sure that we continue to provide better high-touch services to the consumer when the demand is sufficient to be productive and to offer the quality and the service that we need to offer. So it's a gradual development of quality service.","Nik Modi","Very helpful. Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","Welcome.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, everybody. On today's call, we have Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, our six-month and full year comparisons have been adjusted for the impact of the prior-year implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative, and the discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website.","During the Q&A section, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call.","And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio now.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in our fiscal 2016, with sales growing 8% and earnings per share climbing 18% in constant currency before charges. This performance contributed to stellar first half results as constant currency sales also rose 8% and EPS was 17% higher before charges.","Our company is helping to drive the momentum in global prestige beauty, which is resilient and growing despite significant economic volatility. We are strengthening our leadership by growing approximately twice as fast as the industry. Our success in this volatile environment has been driven by our broadly diversified business, powered by our multiple engines of growth, coupled with investment agility and strong execution. This was achieved thanks to our talented and experienced leaders and global workforce.","We are not over-reliant of any one category, channel or country, which helped cushion us somewhat from regional slowdowns or political strife. We reacted quickly to unexpected events and volatility during the quarter and reallocated our investment spending, capitalizing on the best opportunities, as condition changed. To cite some examples, we reduced the investment in Hong Kong which continued to decline and increased support in Canada, the U.K. and other fast growth markets. As the makeup category surged globally, we invested more in M\u2022A\u2022C's terrific momentum and in popular launches for our Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique brands to leverage their accelerating makeup growth.","In travel retail, we accelerated our brand expansion into Europe, which enjoyed stronger traffic tourists. Seeing a growing demand in our direct-to-consumer business, we accelerated development of e-commerce sites and freestanding stores in several markets. Our strategy is to invest dynamically in our strengths, which added fuel to our momentum and helped us driving terrific results.","Thanks to the strategic resource allocation, we had constant currency gains across the board of our regions and categories. By intentionally accelerating investment in selected winning areas, we generated a stronger results in our makeup and luxury brands, direct-to-consumer channels and the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, where we gained significant share. Even with formidable competition, we believe we are expanding our leading position in skincare and makeup combined in Western Europe and in emerging markets in that region.","Our strong overall results were especially encouraging in light of some difficult macro issues, including a depressed retail climate in Hong Kong and softer market growth in China, as well as worsening currency headwinds, especially in certain emerging markets. Although we expect economic and geopolitical volatility to continue throughout the balance of the fiscal year, we believe we can successfully navigate the instabilities because of our strong positions in the categories, channels and regions with the strongest sustainable growth.","We anticipated many of the major trends driving global prestige beauty today. We are able to leverage the increasing growth the industry is experiencing in direct-to-consumer channels, such as online and retail stores, as well as travel retail and specialty stores category into a growing numbers of beauty consumers. We were a pioneer in online beauty, recognizing early on that the channel would be increasingly important for marketing, communication and shopping convenience.","Today, we are among the largest and most established player in online prestige beauty and have enjoyed extraordinary growth. This fiscal year, we expect our online sales from our brand sites and retailer sites to top $1 billion for the first time, representing a doubling of the business in just three years. Our digital success comes from having a diverse entrepreneurial team, more than half of whom are millennials. And they quickly adapt to business, to changing landscapes. Our websites offer a desirable luxury experience and have become major contributors to brand growth.","The holiday quarter was a valuable time for e-commerce as more consumers opted for the convenience of shopping online. Online sales accelerated for various product categories, and beauty was no exception. Our E&M commerce business captured the increased volume and generated nearly 30% growth in the quarter. On Cyber Monday, sales of our North America brand sites were more than 50% higher than last year. On Singles' Day in China, sales of our five flagship sites on Tmall more than doubled, led by Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique.","Many global metrics of our brand sites improved, including the number of orders, which rose 27%. And mobile became an even larger portion of our sales, accounting for 36% of all online transactions. During the quarter, we added 69 brand retailers and third-party sites worldwide. Linking our brand sites to our freestanding store is key to enabling an omni-channel experience, which is an important evolving trend in retailing. We have launched numerous pilot programs and are building omni-channel capability to begin to seamlessly connect consumers across our brand sites and our freestanding stores globally.","We are exploring many different approaches and learning what's successful. For example, we launched online booking for makeup services in the U.K. and the U.S. and are finding that over half of the appointments at M\u2022A\u2022C new makeup studio in Manhattan have been made online. In the U.K., several of our brands offer cross channel gift cards that can be redeemed online and in our freestanding stores. And in October, Bobbi Brown aired an interactive beauty class that generated more than 1.1 million social media impressions.","Today, we have approximately 1,500 freestanding stores worldwide that are managed directly by our company or our partners. As we expand our number of highly productivity stores, we are testing new concepts. Origins discover retail design, which illustrates the journey from plan to product, is being rolled out globally. M\u2022A\u2022C's first makeup studio is a service-based store that we believe will provide an additional revenue stream. M\u2022A\u2022C freestanding stores are a key growth engine and account for approximately one-third of its global sales today.","Leveraging a growing demand for prestige beauty in Brazil, two of our luxury brands are entering the country with standalone stores. La Mer recently opened in a luxury shopping mall in S\u00e3o Paulo, where it offers spa treatment. And Jo Malone will soon follow, one of the 30 stores it plans to add globally this fiscal year. Our M\u2022A\u2022C and Clinique brands have been a standing and freestanding store in Brazil now for several years.","We also anticipated that specialty multi would be a fast growing beauty channel. In the quarter, our strongest sales growth in North America was in this channel, which saw robust retail sales through all our brands. Many of our brands are increasing their penetration with the appropriate retailers.","As I mentioned on our last call, one of our exciting initiatives comes from the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand which will launch its Est\u00e9e Edit group of products in 320 North America Sephora stores and on Sephora.com in mid-March. Inspired by today's young consumers, the Est\u00e9e Edit line delivers instant visible benefits centered on the theme beauty is an attitude aimed directly at millennials and promoted on social media. The Est\u00e9e Edit is part of a strategic effort to modernize the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand for long-term growth and seed the next generation of consumer while continuing to appeal to its core consumers. Additionally, in Sephora, Bobbi Brown plans to add more doors in the U.S. this spring. And GLAMGLOW reinforced its popularity with the launch of lip treatment products, which become best sellers there.","In international markets, La Mer launched in the makeup specialty chain in Australia, and in Europe Bumble and bumble and Smashbox had good growth in Boots. Douglas accounts for one-third of our business in Germany, and our retail sales there grew double digits in the quarter. Our brands continue to perform well also in higher-end department stores globally. However, in mid-tier North America department store, some of our brands are experiencing softness, although they showed solid increase online.","Travel retail is another long-term growth engine of our business that improved in the channel as well. Importantly, in the quarter, our net sales, retail sales and traffic growth all grew mid-single digit. With changing travel patterns shifting where and what consumers buy, we redeployed some of our investment activities to the corridors with the most touristic traffic. Korea returned to growth after concerns about MERS eased and Europe was robust as the weak euro attracted tourists. Hong Kong remained soft, also in travel retail in China has did markets in the corridor \u2013 also in the corridors frequented by Russians and Brazilians. Overall, in travel retail, we had double-digit retail growth in half of our top 30 markets.","Mirroring our broader company strategy, we continued to diversify our travel retail business by expanding our brands in more locations and opening more doors. The preorder business where travelers order products online and pick them up in the airports had a strong increase. Healthy passenger traffic growth is projected across all regions this fiscal year. Touching concern for the key geographies, the Korean market continued to rebound and our business is posting solid growth and gaining share, driven largely by our makeup brands which are set to be leveraging important Korean trends and demonstrating our ability to successfully compete with local brands.","In China, nearly all our brands grew double digits. While prestige beauty growth slowed, our business there grew a solid 9%, exceeding growth in prestige. Our results reflect our strategy to diversify our business by expanding our portfolio channels, cities and products. Our makeup and fragrance business has been growing rapidly in what has traditionally been a skincare oriented market, demonstrating our strategy to align our multiple engines of growth with local market dynamics.","The economic environment and beauty market growth in emerging markets overall has slowed. While we are not immune to soft local economic conditions, our business in emerging markets other than China continued to be very robust, rising 27% in the quarter, approximately three times the growth of prestige beauty in those countries. We are committed to these markets and plan to invest more in this time of softness to leverage our momentum, increase our market share, resulting in a much stronger position when these economies will improve again.","Around the world, makeup proved again to be a strong growth engine, a trend that we had anticipated and prepared for, which is evident in our results. For the quarter, our makeup business grew 13% in constant currency. Our three makeup brands are clearly benefiting, M\u2022A\u2022C and Smashbox especially, up strong double digits. But so are our multi-category brands. Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique makeup sales grew in every region. Foundation has been very strong across our brands, and we had four of the top five foundations in the U.S. in 2015.","Among Est\u00e9e Lauder's best products was Double Wear Stay-in-Place Liquid Foundation, a strong seller decades after its launch. This core product was the best-selling foundation in the U.S. according to NPD for the quarter and also the 2015 calendar year, with sales up more than 20%.","Clinique launched Beyond Perfecting Foundation + Concealer in Asia, which established a new makeup pillar for the brand and drove strong foundation growth in the region. This success in foundation is one of the key factors driving improvement in Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. We have chosen to reemphasize makeup in these brands to help ignite their businesses.","Est\u00e9e Lauder progress in both modernizing the brand and emphasizing local relevant product drove its higher sales, particularly in certain Asian and European markets. While skincare is its largest business, especially in Asia, the brand's substantial makeup portfolio is attracting younger consumers. It is creating a vibrant digital strategy with newsworthy updates and enhanced storytelling to communicate with consumers 24\/7.","Clinique's greater emphasis on makeup, especially some color products, is creating a stronger emotional connection with millennials, which is helping to stabilize its performance and drive growth. It is announcing consultant training, distorting key products and testing in new store formats that's colorful, high energy, modular and engages consumers. The first pilot of the new freestanding store model opened in Hong Kong two months ago, and sales are up sharply in what has recently been a relatively depressed market.","Our strategy of having multiple engines of growth extends to our innovation program, which develops desirable technologies and concepts across our product category and brands. Our innovation isn't just about creating big blockbusters and our success isn't based solely on the newness product for each brand. Instead, an important impact of our launches is to pull consumers into stores, build traffic and drive sales. Some shoppers do come to buy the latest lip shade, but many others gravitate on our staples, which accounts for the vast majority of our sales.","Let me give you example of some recent and upcoming products by category. In skincare, Est\u00e9e Lauder's new Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask is a global launch with a focus on Asia where masks are extremely popular. This offers key ANR technology and extends this important franchise. Est\u00e9e Lauder's New Dimension serum was successful in many markets in Europe and Asia, offsetting lower than expected results in North America.","La Mer introduced their Renewal Oil, a luxury entry in the popular facial oil subcategory and it has exceeded expectations in many markets. Clinique built a franchise around its Smart serum by extending it with moisturizer and treatment oils. In the makeup category, Skin Foundation have been strong sellers. Several of our brands, including Est\u00e9e Lauder and Bobbi Brown, are introducing cushion compacts, which is a growing segment and has been popular with consumers.","The strong growth in our high-end fragrances brands is another important element of our strategy that is working very well. The combination of Tom Ford, Jo Malone and recent acquisitions are generating sustainable profitable growth and we continue to expand distribution and roll out exciting new scents. We have had a variety of fragrance launches across prestige points, and many of them, as well as attractive sets, were popular gifts for the holidays. With an eye towards spring, Jo Malone Herb Garden collection will offer five different colognes.","Looking at the balance of our fiscal year, we are confident in our sound strategy and are choosing to increase investment in the strongest areas of our business. These investments will include more advertising, building freestanding stores and e-commerce sites, R&D and travel retail expansion. We are further fueling our growth momentum by investing in our winners and continues to build global market share. There are, of course, many macro factors beyond our control and slower markets to overcome. We believe, however, that our diversification, multiple engines of growth, strong innovation, financial agility and superb execution will generate excellent growth. We also continue working to find ways to better leverage this growth in the longer term.","With this confidence, we are raising the lower end of our sales guidance and now expect to deliver 7% to 8% growth in constant currency, as well as continuing to forecast double-digit EPS growth for fiscal 2016, delivering another year of strong results while continuing to build sustainable, profitable growth engines.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I will first review our fiscal 2016 second quarter results, and then I will cover our expectations for the third quarter and the full year. My commentary does exclude the impact of restructuring and other charges.","Net sales for the second quarter were $3.12 billion, up 8% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 70 basis points of this sales growth. Once again, the strongest geographic performance this quarter came from the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Net sales in EMEA rose 13% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in virtually every market. A continuation of strong local demand for our products increased tourist traffic in certain cities, and our selective brand distribution expansion contributed to double-digit increases in all major Western markets.","Sales growth in France was slower than last quarter, as the attacks in mid-November understandably curtailed both shopping and tourism in Paris. All emerging markets in the region saw double-digit gains led by Russia, Turkey and the Middle East. Our net sales in the global travel retail channel rose 5%, as double-digit gains in many countries and a strong return to growth in Korea were partially offset by continued declines in both Hong Kong and Brazil. Overall, passenger traffic growth is strong, and our growth at retail and net reflected the strength in the quarter.","Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 6% in constant currency. China rose 9% with e-commerce sales growing nearly 80%, thanks in part to the success of Singles' Day on November 11 when our sales more than doubled versus prior year. Our online sales for the quarter rose to nearly 13% of our total China business. We delivered solid growth in our core markets of Korea and Japan, while some of the smaller emerging markets in the region rose double digits.","Australia also delivered another quarter of strong double-digit sales growth. These strong results were partially offset by continued weakness in Hong Kong, where sales decreased by high single digits on top of a meaningful decline last year. A sharp continuation of a decline in tourist flows from China that began last year, combined with both the Chinese yuan devaluing this fiscal year and Chinese tourists continuing to travel more to other destinations in Europe and Asia is creating further weakness in local sales in Hong Kong. Excluding Hong Kong, the region sales would have grown more than 8%.","Net sales in the Americas increased 4% in constant currency. Strong double-digit growth continued across Latin America, led by Brazil and Mexico. North American sales grew low single digits, which reflected double-digit growth in Canada and low single-digit growth in the U.S. Sales were strongest in the U.S. in specialty multi, online and high-end department store channels, while tourist driven doors in all channels have been adversely affected by the strong dollar. Our sales in mid-tier department stores continue to be soft in brick and mortar while the related retailer online business was up sharply. Our holiday sales were broadly in line with our expectations, although the environment this year was more promotional than the prior year.","In constant currency, net sales in every product category grew this quarter, with double-digit growth in makeup, fragrance and hair care. Makeup sales rose 13% in constant currency. M\u2022A\u2022C, Tom Ford and Smashbox all rose strong double digits due to the success of key recent product launches, further distribution expansion and solid like-door growth.","Tom Ford Lips & Boys collection, which originally launched last holiday season, continued to be particularly strong this year. Bobbi Brown, Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder rose mid to high single digits in makeup, primarily due to strengthening their product offerings and their support behind the fast growing lip and foundation categories.","Fragrance category sales rose 12% in constant currency during the important holiday gifting season. Double-digit gains from Jo Malone and Tom Ford and incremental sales from our newer brands, Le Labo and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, drove the majority of the growth. Within other designer fragrances, Michael Kors Gold Collection and Tory Burch also contributed to growth and Est\u00e9e Lauder's Modern Muse Le Rouge, launched this fall, grew the overall Modern Muse franchise.","Hair care sales increased 14% in constant currency with growth from both Aveda and Bumble and bumble. Aveda launched Thickening Tonic and Shampure dry shampoo, which also benefited from continued growth in existing products such as Be Curly. The brand expanded its presence in travel retail and delivered strong salon growth in Western Europe, and Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in the specialty multi-channel.","Skincare sales rose 2% in constant currency. Skincare continues to be the dominant beauty category in China and Hong Kong where there has been more challenging macro trends that have contributed to the category's slower global growth. La Mer rose double digits. Origins and Darphin generated solid growth and GLAMGLOW represented incremental sales growth in skincare.","Est\u00e9e Lauder achieved modest growth due to recent launches and Clinique declined slightly in the quarter. Our gross margin for the quarter was comparable to the prior year at 81.2% of sales. Favorabilities in our supply chain were offset by the combination of category mix, with a slower growth in skincare, and some higher promotional expenses over the holidays.","Operating expenses as a percent of sales were in line with the prior year quarter at 60.4%. Increases were primarily due to higher store operating costs, which reflected over 130 new freestanding retail store openings over the past year, offset by improvements in selling, shipping and other expenses. As a result, operating income of $647.9 million was 2% above the prior year and operating margin was unchanged at 20.8%. Our constant currency operating margin improved 60 basis points primarily due to expense leverage. Net earnings were $458.6 million or 5% above the prior year quarter, reflecting a 230 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate, which was partially driven by a discrete tax credit in the quarter.","Diluted EPS of $1.22 was 8% above the prior year, including the benefit of a lower share count. Our stronger than expected EPS was largely driven by a combination of better sales performance across most of our brands and continued strong expense management as we navigated the volatile macro environment. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.01 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.11 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 18%.","We recorded $18.5 million in charges before tax, or $0.03 per share, for the transition of our global technology infrastructure to a new platform that we announced to you last quarter. As we mentioned previously, for the full fiscal year we expect to record charges for this transition of between $40 million and $50 million before tax, or approximately $0.07 to $0.09 per share.","Continued progress in our working capital initiatives, along with favorable currency translation, contributed to a seven-day improvement in inventory days to sell through the end of December. These improvements were partially offset by the inventory build necessary to meet our future sales growth objectives and the additional inventory from our new brands.","For the six months ended December 31, we generated $962 million in cash flows from operating activities, 3% less than the comparable period last year. The prior year cash flow benefited from the SMI sales shift. Excluding the impact of the shift from last year, operating cash flow this year rose 17%. We invested $223 million in capital expenditures, primarily to support new retail stores, counters, systems and office space.","We utilized $628 million in cash to repurchase approximately 7.6 million shares of our stock, 1.2 million more than the same period last year. We also distributed $201 million in dividends to stockholders. So that concludes our results for the second quarter and the half year.","Let me now turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year and the third quarter. For the full year, the sales shift related to last year's SMI rollout will impact comparisons to the prior year. I will now discuss our expectations adjusting for the impact of the shift. Our forecasted growth rates, both before and after the shift impact, are available in today's earnings release for your reference. Also excluded, again, for the full year is the impact of restructuring and other charges.","So, reflecting our strong first half performance, we have raised the low end of our guidance range and now expect full year sales growth of between 7% and 8% in constant currency, including 50 basis points from acquisitions. Currency has become an even greater headwind, and we now estimate that translation could negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately five percentage points. Our estimate assumes spot exchange rates as of the end of January of 1.08 for the euro, 1.43 for the pound, and 1.18 for the yen for the remainder of the fiscal year.","Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.07 and $3.12, including $0.04 of dilution from acquisitions. The increased currency headwinds are now projected to affect EPS by about $0.29, which is $0.05 more than we projected when we last gave guidance. Our strong first half performance gave us comfort to increase our investments in the second half of the fiscal year to support new innovation, additional freestanding store acceleration, omni-channel pilots, travel retail and the Est\u00e9e Edit, which should allow us to continue to fuel profitable growth. And while we remain on track to deliver $200 million of cost savings this year, we will also continue to look for ways to further improve our leverage in the future. We continue to expect EPS growth of 10% to 12% in constant currency.","In the third quarter, our sales are expected to rise 6% to 7% in constant currency, including 70 basis points from acquisitions as we anniversary our strongest sales growth quarter from last year. The impact of foreign currency is anticipated to reduce growth by approximately four percentage points. Our third quarter diluted EPS is expected to be between $0.53 and $0.58, including approximately $0.03 per share of adverse currency translation and approximately $0.02 dilution from acquisitions.","This estimate reflects our highest quarter of planned advertising and promotional spending as a percent of sales in the third quarter and is deployed behind key activities such as the global launch of Est\u00e9e Lauder's new Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask, the U.S. introduction of the Est\u00e9e Edit collection in Sephora as well as a variety of activities in the makeup category across multiple brands.","We delivered strong sales and earnings growth and showed solid progress on our strategic initiatives in the first half of the fiscal year while managing through a volatile global macro environment. We are encouraged by our results thus far and the scope of activities we have planned throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, which should support our continued growth momentum for this fiscal year and beyond.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Our first question today comes from Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Good morning. I wanted to pick up on the theme of agility, which was the center of the discussion we had a couple of months ago, and you began by calling it out again today. So really two questions, if I could, related it to. First, Fabrizio, can you maybe talk about some of the structural steps you've taken to enable that flexibility? Because I think there is some debate out there as to how much of what we are seeing is innate skill and a function of institutionalized discipline versus simply you benefiting from a spate of good luck that might eventually run out. That will be my first question.","And then second, Tracey, can you talk about how the theme of agility relates to your ability to protect margins and profit? Because I am struck by the fact that here we are, you just beat the top end of your Q2 guidance by $0.14 and none of that is being passed through to your full year guidance to insulate the P&L from incremental FX pressure. And maybe that is prudent on your part. I am inclined to think that it is, but at the same time I just thought that with the top line strength, all the pricing levers you have, some of your productivity efforts that there would be more ability to be nimble and agile on that front as well and avoid the guide down. So I would just love your thoughts there too. Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Now, on agility, as we discussed, so, first of all, we monitor the changes around the world. So the first institutional model is a continuous monitoring all the changes. Example, traveling corridor of tourist full, market growth in different levels. We have now new level of analytics and follow-up on how the business evolves. So understanding.","The second institution is then we tailor launches \u2013 product launches, assortment and things based on what we learn regularly. Third is when markets over-deliver their financial trends, they get more opportunity to spend. And when they market then to under-deliver, they tend to cover at least part of what they cover for the profit pressure that they are under. So these automatic mechanisms are anyway generating flows or resources automatically to the winning part of our business. Third, the way people collaborate is completely different today. We collaborate, we make decision together and so the ability to flow in an agile way, both resources and money, and make fast decision on locations is taken at the top of the company in a collaborative way. Those are institutional way, which are here to stay. And actually they are a \u2013 the way we work across every quarter.","So assume that we \u2013 once we decide a plan, we constantly work to improve it, quarter-by-quarter, months-by-months. And the company does this in a structural way. Second point before Tracey answer the second part of your question, I would like to say that in reality, what we are doing is focusing even more on growth, even in the second semester. We have so many winning opportunity and our location methodologies are working. And our ability to build the top line in a sustainable way for the long-term is definitely the most important priority for sustainable double digit EPS growth in the long-term.","So our point of view is that moving the lower end of our top line sales trend from the 6% to 8% \u2013 we have 6% to 8%. So moving from closer to the 6% to closer to the 8% in a sustainable way has much more value for our shareholders in the long-term than just covering currencies in the short term. So our approach is to focus on long-term top line growth acceleration. And in a moment where the environment out there is volatile, and we have proven that in volatile environment, we have a competitive advantage in being able to operate, we want to leverage that momentum and get this competitive advantage through. That's what we're doing. That's why we have decided not to cover currency. We trim the investment in the short term that we didn't feel was the long-term priority.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And so I think Fabrizio answered it well, Steve, but I will just add on that while Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique are ahead some good signs in terms of the first quarter, they have some great programs lined up for the second quarter that we think are worthwhile investing in. If we didn't have good opportunities to invest in, in the second half, we would certainly drop the upside to the bottom line. But as Fabrizio said, we have tremendous momentum in many of our brands. We have good programs in Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique that we think will deliver good results in the second half of the year, and beyond. So it's important for us to invest not only for this fiscal year but obviously to continue the growth momentum beyond this fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hello, Dana?","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hello.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hello. Hi. Congratulations and wanted to get a better understanding of channel penetration, given that specialty multi is growing so fast. What does it mean for distribution of the business? What percentage could it account for over time? And how does that impact margins go forward? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So, specialty multi is growing well globally. And what it means for our distribution that we are increasing distribution globally with our brand portfolio in specialty multi where appropriate. So you can expect a global increase of distribution gradually in this channel. However, we also learning how to win in this channel. So it's not only a distribution game, it's also a marketing game. This channel requires different marketing and selling techniques than the traditional department store core business that we have around the world. And so over time, I believe our organization is becoming better and better in partnering with specialty retailers around the world and learning how to grow our business in this channel better and better.","The first thing is so you can expect that the percentage of our business in which channel will grow, but this is very different by country around the world depending on the penetration of this channel. So, I will not give frankly detail on percentages, also because they will be very much the results of mix by geographies rather than on specific advancement in a given brand or in a given country. Tracey, I don't know if you want to talk.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I think you answered it well.","Operator","Your next question is from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Could you give us a little bit more color on the Est\u00e9e Edit? So it is going into 320 doors. How many SKUs is that? Can you give us some sense for how large a contribution to the revenue growth in the third quarter that will be? Is it 50 bps or whatever? Is it skincare and color or just color? And are there plans to expand it either to more Sephora doors or Ulta doors or any of the department doors as we go forward? And then, just following up on that, second of all, can you remind us or tell us; I don't think I heard it, Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder, are you still expecting them as big brands to be up for fiscal 2016? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. A lot of questions. So on Est\u00e9e Edit \u2013 so, first of all, Est\u00e9e Edit is exclusive to Sephora and will be launching Sephora brick and mortar and Sephora.com. And it's been developed also in strict collaboration with the Sephora teams. The Est\u00e9e Edit is focused on makeup, but includes also some \u2013 how we call it, instant skincare benefit products. To us some core SKUs of Est\u00e9e Lauder business. This brand will be supported by a very strong social media and very strong digital activities, really focused on the millennials and incorporation also in magazines that support the magazine and social media activity. So it will be a strong launch.","In terms of the impact for the long term, obviously, it will depend from the success. We have a very strong belief that this will be a strong success. And in case of success, we assume it will be expanded to more Sephora doors over time, obviously. But we will need first to test and see the success level that we get.","Now, in terms of the quarter, remember, this is launched in March 15 at mid-March, so the impact on third quarter is relatively limited. But we hope that the impact on fiscal year 2017 and 2018 will be \u2013 obviously be much stronger when success will happen.","The other important aspect of Est\u00e9e Edit is that it is not only going to be hopefully a success in sales, but is also very important way to attract millennials to the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand and is one of the steps to modernize the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand as a whole in our opinion.","On Lauder and Clinique, the Lauder and Clinique combined grew about 1% in the quarter two, so \u2013 which is a turnaround. This was in quarter two specifically, it was driven by Est\u00e9e Lauder growth as Tracey explained in her remarks. But the important point is that both Lauder and Clinique are growing again on their makeup business, which is in the case of the Clinique a very big percentage; in the case of Lauder is more the percentage of total business because of the big Asia penetration of skincare, but still in many countries is the bigger part of the business of these two brands. So that's the important reality.","We said that we would have started turning around to grow these two brands starting from makeup and then fall into skincare. On skincare, it's frankly difficult to imagine that skincare will also start growing again within this fiscal year with Hong Kong in the situation in which it is and with the China market growth in skincare being so soft. As I said before, China market growth is mainly driven by makeup in this moment, and the skincare is not growing very aggressively. So \u2013 but as soon as the Asia skincare dynamic will find back a normalized growth, we will complete the turnaround also on the skincare front of these two brands. That's our assumption for the fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks and good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask about gross margins, so flat sequentially for the second straight quarter. Just curious, you talked about promotional activity in China and the press release talked about just general levels of promotional activity around the holiday period. How much did that impact gross margins in the quarter? Were there other drivers as well? As you sort of think longer term, is modest expansion still reasonable? And then, sort of related to all that, I guess just back to the previous question, so there is clearly going to be some mix effect, I would assume, from skincare. So, how does that factor in as well? Thank you.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. Great questions. So, promotion affected the margins slightly in the quarter. The bigger impact in terms of it being flat year-over-year was the category mix as you indicated. So tremendously strong growth in makeup and much softer growth in skincare and fragrance as well, so strong growth in fragrance. Those two factors do affect our category, or our gross profit margin mix. In terms of the future, yes, we do expect to see some modest improvement in gross profit margin over the next few years, not to the extent that we saw four years or five years ago, but certainly a continuation of modest improvement over the next few years.","Operator","Your next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I was curious about the travel retail stepping up investments there because I feel like from an external perspective and some of your competitors, if anything, there is more concern about travel retail being a soft spot and I think even questions around whether we will see a resurgence when and if some of those wealthier emerging-market travelers start shopping again. And yet, you talked about increasing your investment in travel retail distribution. So, can you talk a little bit about that decision? Is it new airports? Is it new brands in some of your existing corridors? Just any color there would be great. Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely. So, first of all, we are applying to travel retail the same multiple engines of growth, diversification and investment agility philosophy that we are applying to the entire company. So as you said, travel retail has been having some outstanding momentum for years based on the Asian travelers' acceleration. And in this moment, the Asian dynamic, particularly the Hong Kong-Macau one, which is the worrying one and it's been soft, very soft in quarter two, we predicted the softness to stay in that part. But in reality, it's not the traffic which is declining. It is where consumers are going and how much they're shopping. So we are reacting to that. We are increasing brand distribution, yes. We are increasing penetration of airports where the traffic is going now, meaning more Europe and more other areas of Asia, for example. We are adjusting assortments to the new corridor, to the new traveling corridor.","So give you an example. At the moment, Brazilians don't travel any more as much as they used to. And when they travel, they shop less. We adjust assortments. And in these places like Miami, now there are more different kind of travelers to which we adjust. And maybe there are other brands that today are not there that are better suited with different group of travelers there. So the previous brands that we had before that were maybe more suited to Brazilians, as an example. This is happening all over the world. So it's adjustment in assortment, is increase our number of brands, is penetration of more airports, and most importantly, is a dynamic adjustment to the corridor travelers. So that's the first theme, which is about traffic management.","The second theme is about commercial. And what is changing is that all these currency changes in travel retail, the currency changes are changing the dynamic of the duty-free aspect, the discounts the consumer found around the world versus their home market. And that's why, for example, makeup is growing much better in travel retail. Makeup is much more purchased because of the commercial marketing from travelers to buyers rather than for big discounts. Also they get discounts for these in absolute terms, much smaller. So we are learning to increase some categories in travel retail where we were not as penetrated as we were in skincare, like some makeup.","We are learning that our high-end fragrances like Jo Malone are extremely successful in travel retail. So we are expanding the high-end, the sophisticated artisanal fragrances, including our new acquisition would be part of that. That is a very big opportunity. Also because as you know, fragrance is a very big market in travel retail and we are learning more marketing techniques to convert traveler into purchaser based \u2013 for example of M\u2022A\u2022C is adding makeup artists. Jo Malone is adding gifts methodologies in travel retail. So making sure there are more reasons to buy in travel retail than just lower prices than in the home markets. So that's the entire strategy. It's a pretty sophisticated strategy. And as everything we are doing is about the long-term sustained growth of this very important and profitable channel.","Operator","Your next question is from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Since we are talking about travel retail, I guess I will start there. Obviously, a big turnaround this quarter for your sales, although retail sales have been pretty good for the last few quarters. Is this an indication that the inventory adjustments we have seen in the past are now behind us or was this sort of a one-time blip in the quarter? And then secondly, on skincare, up 2% constant currency. Obviously, the market conditions of Hong Kong and China are not helping you, but how does that 2% compare to category growth overall? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I'll answer the first part of the question, which is basically, yes. We believe in this moment, as we said, the net-in and sellout retail seems to be aligned. Remember that the \u2013 part of this alignment that was caused by the MERS event in Korea, so we cannot eliminate the risk that more events like this will happen, or flus or things in other parts that will disrupt the relationship between net and retail in the future. But for the moment, I believe we are in a situation where they are realigned. And in absence of new disrupting event, hopefully, they will stay aligned.","Tracey, you want to address... sorry.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The skincare \u2013 I think the second question was skincare versus \u2013 the skincare growth in travel retail versus the category.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh, right.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And as you might well know that our skincare travel retail business is heavily driven by Asia and Asian markets and Asian traveling consumers, so we did see softness in the Hong Kong and China part of our travel retail business that was largely related to skincare. We also saw some softness in Brazil that was more related to makeup. But for skincare, definitely, the Hong Kong\/China softness impacted the category in travel retail. Yeah.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But I wanted again to stress what I said before that makeup is growing. The M\u2022A\u2022C brand travel retail trend is outstanding and the Joe Malone, for example, or the Tom Ford, so our high-end fragrances are really, really doing well.","Operator","Your next question is from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","So my question is on emerging markets, specifically, where you guys have delivered outstanding growth. What is your outlook for the year, broadly? And I am curious how that may have changed or may not have changed over the past three months to six months, given the difficult macro? And specifically, do you still think you can deliver this mid to high 20% growth that we have been accustomed to, just the fact the comparisons become more difficult in the third quarter? So any commentary there would be helpful. Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So the \u2013 sorry the question was the other markets, the other emerging markets?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Other emerging markets.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, the other emerging markets, the China, that grew 30% in the first quarter grew 27% for us in the second quarter, and anyway this is three times the growth of these markets. So, we are growing market share by design in the emerging markets around the world from Mexico to Brazil, to Turkey, to South Africa, to India, to the Middle East. And in all these markets, we are growing double-digit. As we said, China is not in this group but when we say China, which is growing 9% and the rest of the emerging markets 27%. And I think we will continue. Actually as I said in my remarks, we plan to continue to invest for growth and beat market share in this market even if in some of them the currency issues is creating some economical issues in these markets.","We will take the opportunity to further increase our market share in this moment, because also it can be done in a very efficient way and hopefully get the benefits of this when this market will go back to more normal economic growth. So it's a good momentum, our brands are loved, and the opportunities in front of us are enormous. And so if the question was, can this kind of growth be sustained? I believe, yes. This kind of growth can be sustained for the long time.","Operator","Your next question is from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. I'm sorry. I have three questions, but they are relatively straightforward. One is, just going back to the agility, I want to better understand how you are organizationally structured to do that. So who is actually responsible for the dynamic resource allocation? Is it centralized? Is it decentralized? So some more color there would be interesting because it seems to really be helpful to you guys.","Number two is \u2013 and it may relate to the first question or it may not, is your SG&A ex-advertising spend still seems relatively high here. So I'm trying to get a sense of how much opportunity you think there is there, especially perhaps as you become more nimble. Typically, that is fewer layers, fewer heads, et cetera, so some ideas there.","And then, the third piece is something completely different, just about the fragrances. I guess two of the 12 fragrances that remain with P&G, Dolce & Gabbana and, I guess to a lesser extent, Christina Aguilera, and your interest in those, given what you are seeing trend wise in fragrances recently. Thanks. Sorry for the three.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I'll answer the first and the third, and let Tracey answer the second. So, how our methodology works. First of all, it is about how we are structured. So \u2013 but the short answer is centralized. This decision is pretty centralized. We have monthly meetings where the finance team with Tracey at the head and the group presidents, which are \u2013 we have two group presidents take care of the region, or they go to market, and two group presidents take care of the combination of the brands. These four people plus Tracey and me centrally have basically complete control of the business and the resource allocation. And we review the opportunity and make decisions centrally in the same room on a very agile way. And that's I think the key topic. Then how technically that this work, frankly, it will \u2013 be more time than eight minutes on a call. But that's the key idea. It's centralized by six people.","Second question, actually, your third question on fragrances. Again, I want to insist, we have declared that in this moment our priorities are high end fragrances on brand assets that we own like Jo Malone and that's why the acquisition of Le Labo. That is our priority; that stays our priority. This part of high end brand own seasonal fragrances model are very profitable, are growing at a smaller but fast growing part of the business which is very well suited to the Est\u00e9e Lauder company portfolio.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Ali, regarding your second question on costs outside of advertising, yes, we do believe we have further opportunity in those areas. Most of our cost saving programs this year, some of them were targeted at A&P effectiveness, many were targeted outside of that with selling productivity and other cost saving initiatives. And we think there is further opportunity, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to leverage expenses going forward with some of the process improvement initiatives that we have put in place this year that should yield some benefits in the future.","Operator","We have time for one more question, please, Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you so much. Good morning. I was interested in just digging a little deeper into China, if I might. It used to be that prices were \u2013 I mean, I think at least 50% above, say, the United States. And I just wondered with some of the price changes that had gone into place, how much the price premium is in China today, on an average? And if you could just maybe walk around differentiating between Tier 1 cities, other cities, and obviously your online is doing very well, but where are the real pockets of weakness in China and what are the opportunities to change that even in the face of a soft consumer?","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, first of all, on pricing, in China, we have decreased the pricing, as you probably know, some time ago. And after the price decrease, the currency in China continues to devaluate. So in reality, the price differentials are much diminished on our brands. And I cannot tell you an average because it doesn't \u2013 but they are 10%, 15% in some cases, or 30%, 35% in other cases by SKU depending on many different dynamics. But they're much more reduced than they used to be in the past.","So, the second part is where are the strengths, the weakness of China? Our strategy in China, like the one I explained for travel retail, is about diversification. So China is softer in this moment in the biggest skincare segment, is softer in the biggest cities; Shanghai, Beijing. Is \u2013 while China growth is very strong in Tier 2, Tier 3 cities, it's very strong online. It's very strong in smaller brands which are entering in areas in makeup and fragrances, which are fast-growing categories for this population. So again, it's about diversification.","If you have multiple engines of growth, you can operate in new cities. You can operate online. You can operate in new growing segments like some makeup and some fragrance, high-end fragrance segments. There is an enormous amount of growth opportunity in China. And that is the diversification, multiple engine of growth work that we are doing also there and which are driving our results.","Just to give you a number, our online business grew 80% in total in China during quarter two. 80%; 80. So it is a very strong acceleration, and that's what is the focus of our activity of creating the right engines of growth also in China for the long-term.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Cedric Prouv\u00e9, Group President of International for The Este\u00e9 Lauder Companies. Cedric will discuss strategy and current results for key markets outside of North America.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","Our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges, including a remeasurement charge related to Venezuela. In addition, we will discuss results before the impact of accelerated retail orders that took place in the prior year quarter due to the implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative and the impact on our full year expectations of accelerated retail orders expected in the quarter ending June 30, 2014.","You can find reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Fabrizio.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our successful track record continued in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 as our strategy helped us deliver excellent results. We have generated sustainable, profitable and uninterrupted year-over-year sales growth quarter after quarter for nearly 5 years. This achievement has been driven by our superb creativity and innovation, broad portfolio of prestige beauty brands, a business that's well diversified across categories, countries and channels and the flexibility to direct our investments to the best opportunities.","In the third quarter, our sales rose 12% in local currency, slightly higher than our estimate. Diluted earnings per share before charges were $0.64, ahead of our forecast and up 42% from a year ago. Our strong performance came from leveraging our sales and rebalancing our marketing activities. We continue to be financially disciplined, with the flexibility to support strong growth areas while managing more prudently in others.","As a reminder, last year third quarter sales reflected a shift of $94 million of accelerated orders into the second quarter in advance of our SAP rollout. Adjusting for the shift, our underlying local currency sales gain this quarter would have been 8%. That increase is approximately double the annual growth of prestige beauty, which we estimate will be 3% to 4% this year.","Global prestige beauty continues to benefit from favorable demographics and attracting new consumers from mass. With our single focus on prestige beauty on a worldwide view into consumer trends identified by our 10-year compass, we have positioned our company in many of the fastest-growing and largest areas, making us confident we can continue outpacing the industry overall.","With 30 brands and more than 10 distribution channels around the globe, virtually every part of our business can fuel our growth. Depending on local economies, the cadence of our innovation and changing consumer desires, various brands, categories, regions and channels can be star performers. The key for us is recognizing we're succeeding and being flexible, so as market dynamics change, we react quickly and put greater resources into the best opportunities, which has allowed us to excel and gain share globally.","Over the course of the year, we rely on all parts of our business to drive our sales growth, but the contribution from our multiple engines will vary by quarter. For example, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, China, our luxury brands and online drove much of our growth. In the second quarter, the U.S., U.K., makeup, travel retail and online led the way.","In the third quarter, our emerging markets, Europe, M-A-C and our luxury brands accounted for much of our sales gains. Having many growth engines is one of our best attributes and illustrates the breadth and the depth of our business. They provide balance and reduce the risk of being overly dependent on any one part of our business to achieve sustainable, profitable growth.","Our industry leadership was recently confirmed by a leading global market research firm. It reported that in calendar 2013, we strengthened our position by adding 20 basis points of share, reinforcing our status as the #1 company worldwide in total prestige beauty. We gained share in prestige skin care and makeup on a total global basis, as well as in some key markets and regions, demonstrating the strengths of our resource and location choices. Being nimble has allowed us to deliver strong results despite several challenging markets.","Looking at our product categories, skin care and makeup remain our priorities since they account for the vast majority of our business and present the largest opportunities. Our skin care growth this quarter was significantly higher than last year's third quarter and also improved sequentially. We launched several important kinds of innovation to strengthen our global offering in this category. We are deploying more incremental innovation in areas where we either don't have a presence or our presence is limited. Examples of these white-space products are watery lotions, which are a key part of Asian skin care regimens and a large category in the region. Seizing an opportunity, several of our brands introduced products to fill this locally relevant segment. These lotions are just rolling out in Asia, and early results are very encouraging.","Clinique's Even Better Essence Lotion has been the brand's biggest launch in Japan in more than a decade. It launches in China this quarter. Est\u00e9e Lauder launched a high-performance product called Micro Essence Skin Activating Treatment Lotion. With its unique positioning as an essence in lotion, it has performed exceptionally well. La Mer introduced its own watery lotion a few months ago, and it continues to exceed our expectations.","At the same time, we are protecting and modernizing our core franchises with the latest technology to keep them fresh and competitive, as we did with Clinique new Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+ and the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand improved Advanced Night Repair Serum. They have performed in line with our goals.","A third type of innovation we have been undertaking is bringing our brands into large existing categories they are not yet in. For instance, in this quarter, La Mer rolled out its Lifting Contour Serum and Lifting and Firming Mask, which comprised its first collection to address contouring and lift.","Our makeup category also was strong, reflecting consumer's growing appetite for the newness products, which plays into many of our brands' strengths. This is especially valuable for M-A-C, which introduces something new just about every week, such as a product, color story, collaboration or locally relevant collection. This constant creativity gives it a competitive advantage.","In the third quarter, there was a dramatic surge in lipsticks as M-A-C lipstick sales at retail climbed 25% in the U.S. prestige department stores. Lipsticks also helped lift the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand's makeup results. It's new Pure Color Envy Sculpting Lipstick collection, which features sophisticated packaging and intense pigments, was a huge success, particularly in North America and European region.","Smashbox had a terrific quarter, thanks to strong demand for its new Full Exposure Eye Palette and selective distribution expansion internationally.","Our luxury fragrance brands, Jo Malone and Tom Ford, turned in an outstanding performance again, with double-digit gains in every region.","Est\u00e9e Lauder's new Modern Muse has resonated strongly with consumers. Among our new designer fragrance offerings, Tory Burch and the Michael Kors collection are the big success stories, exceeding our expectations. And sales of our Zegna Essenza collection had been strong.","As a company, we achieved our goal of gaining share in fragrance in the U.S. in the third quarter on strong profitable sales, with most of our brands contributing.","In hair care, products from Aveda's Dry Remedy franchise helped drive strong increases internationally, and sales to salons rose.","Looking at our business by geography, we are the #1 prestige beauty player in many of the biggest markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, and also in some of the most important emerging markets such as China, South Africa and Brazil. Our growth is well balanced between established markets and developing ones, which provides another layer of stability. All of our regions had sales growth for the quarter, as well as the fiscal year-to-date.","This quarter, we continue to grow our business in the U.S. and China, however, less than in the past because of softness in these countries. Despite the softness in these important markets, we still delivered strong growth as a company overall, which is another testament to the power of our diverse and broad portfolio and our strengths in many other markets.","In North America, the retail environment was tough in the quarter due in part to severe weather in much of the U.S. and a late Easter. China remains our biggest emerging market priority, and we are confident that long-term fundamentals remain strong. Despite an expected decline in same-store sales, our strategy to expand distribution, bring in new brand and enter more cities, continue to be solid. In fiscal year '14, our company expects another year of double-digit sales growth in China, a trend we expect to continue over the long term.","Aside from China, our other emerging market, which encompass 13 countries, grew healthy double digits combined, and their global total sales are bigger than our China business. Consumers in these countries comprise an important part of our travel retail business. The fastest-growing in this important group of emerging market were Brazil, Turkey and Central Europe. Our sales in the U.K. continue to be vibrant, and our business in most Western European countries is improving as prestige beauty is showing growth. Cedric will discuss our international business in more detail in a few minutes.","Our goal of sustainably generating sales growth ahead of the industry is an outgrow of our compass, which identifies and validates promising areas of consumer interest and short-term trends. Some products stemming from the vision will launch in the coming months, including breakthrough innovation to bring incremental business. For instance, Clinique plans to introduce 2 state-of-the-art global product in the first quarter of fiscal year '15. One is a custom-fit serum that uses highly advanced technology to treat the ageless consumers in a way Clinique hasn't addressed before, incorporating a breakthrough formula. Clinique Smart Custom-Repair Serum is the brand's first serum that acts on different skin problem and on individual skin types. The other product, a cleansing system that includes a new sonic device, was created by Clinique scientists working closely with the brand's guiding dermatologist and is rooted in the brand's skin care authority. Clinique has more than 15,000 consultants around the world, and they are excited about selling the new system and educating consumer about its unique benefits.","Este\u00e9 Lauder, meanwhile, is launching a new skin care product line in a big Asian white space. Nutritious Rosy Prism incorporates proprietary technology to address skin discoloration that can be caused by aging and environmental pollution. These are just a few highlights of our outstanding creativity. Our innovation pipeline is strong and sustainable, and many other brands have exciting new products and services on the horizon.","With regard to our distribution, we sell our products in more than 10 channels, including salons, specialty multi and freestanding stores. These channels present varying degrees of opportunities worldwide for many of our brands. One of our highest growth channel is our travel retail business, where we are the clear global leader in skin care and makeup, the fastest-growing beauty areas in the channel. We have gained share in these areas in recent years and still see many avenues of growth, including more brands, more airports and greater conversion of travelers into buyers.","Another winning channel for us continues to be our e-commerce business, which, again, grew double digits. We have been launching brand size in several of our emerging markets and keeping ahead of consumer shopping patterns by continuing to grow our mobile platforms. We also have other opportunities to eliminate known added-value costs, and we will have greater visibility into area of saving and efficiencies once SAP is fully deployed. Tracey will provide more detail on these areas in a few minutes.","With just 2 months left in fiscal 2014, we expect to achieve our goals of 6% to 7% local currency sales growth for the full year. Based on results to date and our confidence in the future, we are raising our earnings per share estimates to $2.86 to $2.90 before charges. These estimates exclude the impact of our next SAP go-live shift, which Tracey will also address. We will provide guidance for fiscal 2015 during our year-end call in August. At that time, we will also update our operating margin goals for the next 3 years. I'm pleased to report that we are progressing faster than expected toward our current target of a 16.5% operating margin by the end of fiscal year '16.","Now I will turn the call over to Cedric, who will discuss our international business.","Cedric Prouv\u00e9","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I just celebrated 20 years with the company, and I've had the pleasure of leading the international expansion of our unique portfolio brands for the last 12 years. Our mission is to leverage our experienced network of international affiliates and distributors to strategically roll out our brand across the world and nurture their growth. At the same time, we're maintaining great financial discipline, generating productivity improvement and building strong capabilities for the future. Among these, we are investing in retail stores, consumer insights, digital, store design and visual merchandising at the regional and the local level. Our regional efforts align with our overall corporate strategy priorities while integrating key characteristics of our diverse geography. We are proud, again, of our progression this year, marked by significant share gains in all regions and in travel retail.","International comprises over 60% of global sales and profits for the company, a percentage that is expected to grow as we expand around the globe. In the past 5 years, our international sales have increased over 10% annually, on average, in constant currency, equaling approximately $2.5 billion of incremental sales.","There are 3 central themes that I will expand on in my commentary: one, developed markets are improving; two, turnaround markets are stabilizing; and three, emerging markets are growing. Developed markets represent the majority of our business, and it continued to grow. Several areas have been economically challenged in the recent years, notably Western Europe and Japan. Encouragingly, we're seeing improvement across these economies in our business.","In the third quarter, we grew share in Europe, where Germany had an excellent quarter and France, Italy and Spain all posted net sales growth, as well as retail growth ahead of prestige cosmetics. Two key strategies for growth have been the diversification of our channel mix in the region and the accelerated growth of our more selective brands. Our channel mix has evolved ahead of our objectives for fiscal '14, allowing us to generate nearly 20% of our sales directly to consumer through our own retail stores and online, up from 15% in fiscal '13. Consequently, we have gained share in prestige beauty in developed Western European market this year, with growth at 2.8% compared to prestige beauty declining by 1.4%, or a gain of 50 basis points in share.","Our U.K. business continued to perform strongly. For the third quarter, our retail sales grew over 12%, continuing the solid improvement we've seen all year. This is even more impressive when you consider that The Este\u00e9 Lauder Companies is the top-ranked corporation in prestige beauty in the U.K., with share over 25%, led by Clinique as the #1 prestige brand. Our strategy in the U.K. and Ireland is to leverage our very balanced portfolio and to treat these countries as emerging markets. For example, we are pursuing new opportunities for our brands within this diversified consumer base in underserved neighborhoods in big and mid-tier cities where there is room for further penetration and locally relevant products and communications.","In Japan, we experienced strong retail growth this past quarter, as expected, in anticipation of a 3 percentage point increase in local VAT effective April 1. We are already experiencing encouraging trends this fiscal year, with retail growth of about 4% through December. We anticipate that some of the VAT effect will reverse in Q4, but we expect mid-single-digit retail sales growth in Japan for the full fiscal year. Our strategies for Japan have been based on improved consumer insights and locally relevant innovation, laying the groundwork for continued growth.","Fabrizio mentioned the success of our recent introductions in the watery lotion category. In fact, we're the leading international company in our distribution in Japan.","The second central theme is that turnaround markets are stabilizing. A few markets have been challenged recently, and we are pleased that they are now stabilizing and improving. Both retail and net sales continued to be strong in Russia, a market where we are now more diversified than ever in terms of geography, brands and distribution. We are focused on diversifying our distribution more profitably and with greater stability. We have been expanding our freestanding stores and online businesses while partnering more strategically with our retailers. Despite the general economic slowdown in Russia, we expect to outperform prestige beauty for the first fiscal year -- for the full fiscal year.","We continue to monitor the crisis in Ukraine. However, the market is not a large portion of the Russia business, and we have seen very little in the way of impact. The potential risk stems more from the possible escalation of sanctions between the U.S. and Russia.","Korea remains challenging, but the decline experienced in the past couple of years has slowed dramatically, and prestige beauty is stabilizing, with retail growth inching upward. Our business in Korea has seen sequential improvement, and for the third quarter, sales were relatively flat. Most of our brands registered growth in Q3, reflecting a greater focus on brand portfolio execution.","We continue to recover in Australia, a key market for us. Australia's GDP growth forecast reflects an improved outlook for consumer spending. Our retail performance shows sign of a turnaround, with growth in each quarter this year. Nearly all of our brands grew in the quarter, mainly by strong double digits, and we are capturing share and recording solid growth on a [indiscernible] basis. Australian consumers' affinity with makeup, in particular, has benefited M-A-C, which we expect will finish the year as the leading prestige brand in the country.","The third central theme is that emerging markets continue to be a key building block for our international growth. China remains a strategic priority, and Greater China and Chinese consumers are a focus of the entire company. Our business in China continues to be strong, and there is plenty of additional expansion potential mid to long term. While we experienced a slowdown in January and February due to competitive discounting for the Chinese New Year holiday, we recovered nicely in March, and our net sales are currently up 11% year-to-date without playing the promotional game. We expect double-digit growth to continue in this market, where we have very productive doors in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities and continue to expand beyond.","We continue to expand geographically in China into new cities. Fiscal year-to-date, our net sales in Tier 3 and 4 cities contributed 11% of brick-and-mortar retail, up from less than 8% in the year earlier, driven by Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. We continue to launch locally relevant products and introduce new brands, as evidenced by the opening of our first Jo Malone store in Beijing 6 weeks ago. We have identified additional brands in our portfolio that could soon enter the market.","Online is reshaping China's retail landscape. Our online sales are doubling on a fiscal year-to-date basis via our own brand sites, retailer sites and the incremental contribution of our Tmall initiative. Clinique has been very successful with its online shop on Tmall, becoming the top prestige beauty brand official store. And Est\u00e9e Lauder plans to go live there later this month, followed closely by Origins.","Though China remains a strategic imperative, it is not our only emerging market focus. Beyond China, there are more than a dozen markets which we also classify as emerging, and they are receiving varying degrees of investments, depending on the perceived opportunity. Today, these markets' combined sales exceed those of China and are growing double digits. We envisioned that they will increasingly contribute well into our 10-year compass projections. For example, our business continues to grow double digits in Turkey, Russia, Brazil and Mexico, 4 of our more strategically important emerging markets, and we are growing share in each.","We have strong growth in South Africa, and we plan -- and we have plans to expand into additional markets on the African continent. Our Middle East business continues to be very exciting, with retail growth in excess of prestige beauty over the past few months. Despite Venezuela, Latin America continues to perform with excellence and delivers faster growth than any of other regions.","One way that affluent consumers from emerging markets are introduced to our brands is through the travel channel. Our business in travel retail continues to grow nicely, with retail growth up 9% year-to-date against traffic growth estimated at 5%.","While Chinese-driven traffic has been challenged since October, when new tour regulations were implemented, we saw a significant improvement during the Chinese New Year period in January and February, driven mostly by independent travelers. We keep investing in the channel by opening new brands and new doors, updating existing doors and maintaining a leading advertising presence in key airports. Our strength in the APAC region and our ability to grow the emerging traveling consumer segment have led to our growth and considerable share gains in prestige skin care and makeup in the past 5 years. We are now the clear market leader in these categories and continue to add distance between us and our competitors. We continue to implement our winning strategies by building new capabilities specific to the channel.","As a key component to our SMI wave 4, the travel retail team is finalizing preparations for the July go-live. We are confident the implementation of SAP in the channel will go smoothly and that we will be able to leverage it to improve our profitability through efficiency gains and value creation.","The outlook for travel retail remains positive. International passenger traffic is expected to rise mid-single digit for the remainder of 2014. We are well positioned to capitalize on this growth and further expand our brands in this most dynamic channel.","Our online business continues to grow in importance. This quarter, we launched 9 e-commerce sites around the world, including M-A-C in Brazil, which is exceeding expectations and is already positioned to be one of our top M-A-C doors in the coming year. We also launched 13 new m-commerce sites, including 3 in China for Clinique, La Mer and Origins.","In closing, I would like to stress that we are very confident about the future sustainability of the international contributions to the company's top and bottom line growth. Our strategic focus on fostering better consumer insights, leveraging innovation, expanding our geographic presence, rolling out our brand portfolio, diversifying our channels and building new capabilities for success is working well. Our continued ability to expand our international business and grow share speaks volumes about the strength of our brand -- brands, the strategic diversification of our market portfolio and our ability to collectively reach and touch consumers around the world.","Now I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Thank you, Cedric, and good morning, everyone. I will first review our third quarter financial performance and then share our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '14.","As a reminder, my commentary excludes the year-over-year impact of restructuring and other charges, primarily the Venezuela remeasurement charges on this morning's press release.","Reported net sales for the third quarter rose 11% to $2.55 billion, above the top end of our expectations. Excluding the impact of currency translation, sales grew 12%. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share each rose 42% to $251.7 million and $0.64, respectively. EPS was also above the top end of our expectations due to both the sales performance and greater efficiency from our marketing investments.","Our third quarter sales growth was affected by the prior year acceleration of retailer orders into our second quarter that otherwise would have occurred in our third quarter related to the January 2013 rollout of SMI. The impact of that shift in the prior year quarter was $94 million in sales and $78 million in operating income, equal to approximately $0.13 per share. Excluding the impact of the SMI-related order shift and restructuring and other charges, local currency sales would have grown 8% for the quarter and EPS would have grown 10%.","As I walk you through the highlights of our third quarter results, my commentary will exclude the impact of the SMI shift in the prior year's quarter, as well as other charges to facilitate easier comparison of our business performance.","Looking at our sales growth by region. Net sales in our Americas region increased 7% in local currency, with 6% growth in North America and 13% growth in Latin America. Regarding softer retail sales, as Fabrizio indicated, a combination of challenging weather, a shift in gift timing for Clinique to the fourth quarter at a major retailer and anniversary-ing the 53rd week from last year along with Easter all contributed to retail performance. The strongest channel performance in North America came from specialty multi-brand stores and online, while department stores and our freestanding stores were more reflective of the softer retail environment.","Latin American growth came primarily from double-digit increases in Brazil and Mexico, which saw strong growth at retail and the launch of M-A-C's e-commerce site in Brazil. These gains were partially offset by price reductions in Venezuela, mandated by the new margin cap law enacted at the end of January.","In the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, sales increased a strong 10% in local currency. Regional growth was led by a double-digit increase in the U.K. and 7% growth in travel retail. We also achieved double-digit growth in emerging markets such as Turkey, Russia and Eastern Europe. Our markets in Western Europe were up across the board, with particular strength in Germany, Switzerland and Italy. France rose low single digits, and we saw encouraging growth in both Spain and in Greece.","Our sales in the Asia\/Pacific region increased 6% in local currency. Japan led growth in the region, with high-teens growth largely driven by consumers who bought ahead of the April VAT increase. Taiwan, Australia and Singapore also experienced strong growth.","Sales in China rose low single digits for the quarter, reflecting a like-door decline of 7% and due to the increased promotional environment and growth in both online and offshore consumer shopping, as Cedric mentioned in his remarks. We added distribution in 5 doors and 1 new city in China this quarter. Korea continues to stabilize, with sales declining less than 1%.","Our gross margin decreased 40 basis points to 80.4%, which primarily reflected both a mix impact, as well as some promotional costs and obsolescence.","Operating expense decreased 180 basis points to 65.5% of sales. The major factors contributing to the decrease were flattish marketing costs driving expense leverage of approximately 170 basis points and leverage of general and administrative expenses of 30 basis points, partially offset by higher store operations expenses.","Flat marketing dollars in the quarter reflect both a rebalancing by quarter to match brand initiatives and greater support behind brands with primarily in-store, digital and print marketing models such as our makeup artist brands.","Operating income rose 18% to $380.1 million, and operating margin increased 140 basis points to 14.9%. Our effective tax rate on the adjusted earnings I just discussed was 31.4%.","In our third quarter, we reported a remeasurement loss of $38.3 million related to changes in exchange rate regulations in Venezuela that occurred during the quarter. The Venezuelan government approved a new currency exchange rate mechanism, SICAD II, for access by companies operating in a broader group of industry sectors than previous rates had been recently. Our net monetary assets were converted from the previous official rate of VEF 6.3 to the new SICAD II exchange rate of VEF 49.81 per dollar as of March 31, resulting in the charge reflected in the quarter. Prior to the charge, Venezuela represented less than 1% of our year-to-date sales and less than 2% of our operating income.","For the 9 months, cash flow from operating activities rose 25% to $1.2 billion, primarily reflecting improvements in accounts payable and accounts receivable. Inventory days to sell rose to 191 compared with 165 days last year. Higher inventory was mainly due to anticipated sales growth, increased safety stock to maintain appropriate service levels and the anticipation of accelerated orders into the fourth quarter related to the rollout of SMI. For the 9 months, we have also invested $343 million in capital projects primarily to support new counters, technology and retail stores.","We repurchased approximately 9 million shares of our stock for $600 million and used $225 million of cash to pay quarterly dividends to stockholders. Our share repurchase program is open-ended, allowing us to buy back shares opportunistically. The acceleration in share buybacks in the third quarter reflected this policy, and we plan to continue this strategy when we have excess cash available in the U.S. As you know, a significant portion of our cash is offshore. That said, in the past couple of years, we have used 100% of our available cash to return to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends.","Let's now turn to our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. We expect fiscal 2014 sales to grow between 6% and 7% in constant currency, in line with the growth we have experienced year-to-date. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 1 percentage point. Our estimate assumes weighted average exchange rates for the full year of 1.36 for the euro, 1.62 for the pound and 1.01 for the yen.","The combined benefits of gross margin expansion and operating leverage are expected to improve operating margin by 60 to 70 basis points for the full year. Marketing expenditures are expected to increase approximately 3%, and other SG&A costs are expected to leverage. Our continued cost management programs enable us to continue investing in long-term growth drivers like innovation, retail stores, e-commerce and information systems that support our company's future while reducing non-value-added costs.","Our fiscal 2014 tax rate is planned at approximately 31%. I'm pleased to say that we are raising our forecast for full year EPS to a range of $2.86 to $2.90 before the Venezuela remeasurement charge and the effect of the accelerated sales orders ahead our SMI go-live in July. Depending on the magnitude of exchange rate movements, the approximately 1 percentage point negative currency impact on our top line equates to about $0.02 of EPS.","The next wave of our SMI rollout is scheduled for July 2014 and will include our North American order-to-cash process, our travel retail business, Japan and the Middle East. As has been the case in previous rollouts, retailers are expected to increase their orders in advance of the go-live to mitigate any potential disruptions from the transition. The impact will be to shift sales and profits into our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and full year from our fiscal '15 first quarter and full year.","We estimate the shift in sales to be between $125 million and $150 million, equal to EPS of approximately $0.14 to $0.17. This amount is higher than previous waves due both to the relative size of the businesses affected and to the higher expected sales in July compared to the timing of previous shifts, which have reflected seasonally slower periods in January.","Therefore, including the shift, our sales growth for the year is expected to be between 6% and 7%, and EPS is forecasted at $3 to $3.70 -- $3.07. With the July rollout, we will have completed our final major wave of SMI and will have more than 90% of our sales SAP-enabled.","We are excited about the opportunity to leverage the new systems and processes for further operational efficiencies and value creation. We expect to see some of these greater efficiencies in our cost-saving programs in the areas of indirect procurement, improved inventory management with reduced levels and handling costs, productivity and cost of goods. We also continue to make progress on our marketing effectiveness initiatives.","In closing, we are very proud of the results we have achieved thus far this year. And on behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous dedication and hard work.","And that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We'll be happy to take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I guess one sort of housekeeping question and one other question. So China, could you maybe just give us a bit of your thoughts on what the category growth looks like and sort of try to put the slowdown in retail sales and in your same-store sales in terms of the context around category? And then, Cedric, sort of broadly speaking longer term, how do you think about the percentage of sales that you see coming from this company from developing markets over the next few years? And what do you think the number is, as we sit here today, inclusive of the percentage of sales that you got from travel retail that comes from developing markets?","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. That's not one question. So I'll answer first the category, while Cedric will answer the rest. So we -- overall, the prestige industry, we see it growing 3% to 4%. And in the previous year, it's been growing at 4% to 5%, so this is a softer year of growth for global prestige beauty. This is driven by -- continue to be driven by demographic, middle class, aging population. But the softness versus previous year in big markets, particularly in China and U.S., is what, at this point in time, is keeping the category around 3% to 4%. Between categories within prestige beauty, we continue to see skin care as a strong, growing category. But this year, we see a special acceleration globally of the makeup category that become more and more important over time as a promising category within prestige beauty. Now Cedric, do you want to address the international part?","Cedric Prouv\u00e9","Yes, so if I understood the question, you're asking how we think the emerging market mix is going to evolve in the future. We have a pretty robust process where we have established a framework for all of our '13, '14 emerging markets, looking at them through 2022. I don't have the exact number in mind, but what I would tell you is that with the CAGR that we are experiencing with these emerging markets, we expect that we would probably double their size in the next 4, 5 years. And I think you asked a question about travel retail. Travel retail fundamentals remain very strong. And as we see these emerging populations accessing to travel and we are really growing in key populations that are going to travel increasingly, whether it's the Chinese or the Russians or Middle East or Turkey or Brazilians, so we are seeing an impact not only in the market but, of course, the destination. We think we also have a project on travel retail that would take us to doubling the sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, Tracey, I know you've talked before about the ability to access working capital opportunities, particularly inventory days that you'd need, the final wave of SAP to be up and going. So I guess the question is, with it likely to be 90%-plus done following this next wave, can you access working capital opportunities for this coming holiday season, or do you think it's more of a '15, '16 holiday season opportunity? And if so, just any preliminary thoughts on what you'd do with that cash as it starts to come through would be great.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Great question. So yes, I mean, clearly, the buildup that we saw in this quarter was to support that last major wave of SMI. And certainly, the higher levels that we've carried over the last couple of years have somewhat been driven by the rollout of SMI. So we expect inventory levels to start to steadily come down in fiscal '15, which will certainly free up more cash for us. As I said in my prepared remarks, as we look at our free cash flow, we'd look at the mix of distribution to shareholders that is excess -- outside of any acquisitions that we might be planning to do to redistribute. And that certainly will be what we do in the coming months when we believe we will have even more free cash flow available.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to talk a little bit about the marketing efficiency in the quarter. What drove that? How is it -- is it sustainable as you look at it? Is that one of the reasons why you feel like you've got more confidence in the margin targets? And then there has been some chatter about sort of gift-with-purchase being maybe a little less efficient right now. Are you seeing any of that in the market? So that issue specifically as well.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. On marketing, I'll -- so yes, there is more efficiency that we are making, and there are several things driving the efficiency. First of all, we have an internal project, which is adjusting our investment measured with greater return on these investments. So for example, we are adjusting down some of our television advertising activities and up other areas like digital and in-store and print as a result of some of these learnings that we had across initiatives. So this is about increasing rate of return on every single penny we spend. Second, the overall percent that you save on marketing can be impacted by the kind of innovation we have. For example, if we launch a big innovation in skin care on our big brands like Lauder or Clinique, this tends to be carrying more advertising investment than some of our makeup artist brands. So the mix between innovation across brands has an impact. Second, the mix by country has an impact. There are some countries which are more advertising-driven such as U.S. and other countries which are less advertising-driven such as some of the emerging markets. So overall, given the mix evolution of our business, given our rate of return improvements, we are confident that we can leverage our marketing expenses, still continue to spend more against our key opportunity and initiatives. In terms of gift-with-purchase, yes, we see the gift-with-purchase being less efficient than what it used to be in the past. That's why we are evolving and learning how to adjust our promotional strategy and how also, frankly, to improve the existing gift-with-purchase activity to make them more efficient for the future and more effective. Tracey, I don't know if you want to add something.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Yes, the only thing I'll add to that is that for the full year, we expect our marketing expense as a percent of sales to be slightly leveraged, so you won't see 170 basis points every quarter. But to Fabrizio's point, it does depend on the brand launch activity and the brand support activity, obviously, but we do expect to see a slight leverage this year, full year.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just following up on the advertising and the spending support, it sounds like over time, natural progression, more emerging markets, more makeup artist brands and more of the luxury brands, that there's a natural pull for the advertising to come down. So can you help us understand what -- help quantify what that kind of change is relative to what you can leverage in terms of just being more efficient?","Fabrizio Freda","No. Frankly, I think it's very difficult to quantify because this will depend -- that's exactly what we are doing. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are trying to adjust our business, reflecting the opportunity around the world to being flexible to respond to the various opportunity as they evolve. So it's very difficult to give you details at such level of complex mix element that we have around the world. But internal overall trend, you're right. That's exactly the point we are making. There is a leverage opportunity over time. And the way we are programming our strategy, basically, we call it compass, the way we are working our 5-, 10-year vision and compass of our mix of countries, channels, brands is designed to leverage, to leverage our gross margin, to leverage our marketing expenses to become, over time -- and to go in the right direction. However, you need to also assume that this change of model also bring new costs in some other aspect and areas of the P&L. For example, freestanding stores bring some other area of cost. And importantly, the mix -- the more we grow skin care globally, the more we can leverage all these aspects in our P&L.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen Powers - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Fabrizio, looking ahead, and I think you alluded to this in your prepared remarks and maybe in response to Chris's question, Tracey, earlier, but just given where the business is heading this fiscal year based on your guidance, should we expect you to revisit some of your longer-term goals alongside fiscal '15 guidance in a few months, whether with respect to the longer-term margin targets, working capital, the capital structure, cash deployment priorities in general. Because I think beyond your ability to continue to grow and expand share amidst all of the competitive and macro challenges, just getting more clarity and confidence in what Est\u00e9e Lauder thinks it can do longer term in terms of profitability and free cash flow generation is probably one of the highest-order questions for investors. So just curious on how you're thinking about those items or at least a communication of them going forward.","Fabrizio Freda","So actually, yes, I have talked about that in my prepared remarks. And so we are progressing faster than what we expected toward our 16.5% margin for 16% previous goal. And so we expect to revise this goal in the August call, as we do every year. And so you will get, at that point, a new plan for the future. We continue to believe that we have the ability to grow 0.5 margin point per year in the several future years, and that's what we are working on. To do that, we will need to continue growing our business, to continue leveraging our business and importantly, as Tracey has explained in her remarks, to start using the SAP and the SMI project to creating value and to -- because we will have visibility on new value-added cost elimination opportunities. Tracey, you want to add something?","Tracey Thomas Travis","Yes. And the only thing I will add to that is one of the things that has worked incredibly well for us over the last few years is the opportunity to both identify and deliver cost savings, as well as invest for the future. So much of what we are experiencing this year is related to investments that we have made in previous years to set up some of our midterm brands for more success, as an example. And we would expect to continue to do that over the next few years. Certainly, SMI gives us a new tool to leverage cost savings, where -- versus some of the prior programs that we have. So we are, as I said in my prepared remarks, quite excited about moving forward in this next journey. We will update all of our goals in the August call. That will be margin, sales, as well as working capital. And as the board authorizes capital structure, we'll update those goals as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Quick housekeeping question for Tracey. Could you just remind us the size and scope of your e-commerce business and kind of maybe whatever the high-level path of expansion you see for that channel? And then for Cedric, specifically, strategically, mobile commerce seems to be at a much faster adoption rate for your international consumers versus your U.S. consumers based on the work that we do. So as you look at your growth in digital for international, is it really, for you, more about sites, SKUs and brands available on those sites, or is it about key functionalities tied to payment that's going to drive conversion even further?","Tracey Thomas Travis","So on your first question, our e-commerce business is approximately 6% of our total business. There are some markets that are more highly concentrated than others, so the U.S. and the U.K. have more developed e-commerce businesses, e-, m-commerce businesses. And in those markets, the percent of sales are about 10%. And again, that includes both our sites, as well as our customer retailer sites. We are and have seen terrific growth in various markets of the e-commerce business. And certainly, Cedric talked about China, and I'll let him expand on the second part of your question in a moment. And we invest where we see high adoption in terms of e- and m-commerce and where we see -- where we have a brand presence as well so that we can leverage both in-store visibility and consumer availability, as well as e- and m-commerce visibility.","Cedric Prouv\u00e9","Yes, so this is a big topic for international, but of course, we are very focused on the rollout of our sites around the world. You know the prospective now, it's 6% for total company. In some of our international markets, we are passing 10%, like the U.K. And in some of the emerging markets, we are, of course, in the very early stages of development. In terms of the sites, it's important for us to develop the sites. We have our own sites, and we have retailer sites. In general, what we see is that retailer sites tend to grow a little bit faster, so we have a program to actually help our retail partners developing their online business as well, because initially, there's always a little bit of reluctance and protection of their brick-and-mortar business. What we see that's very important is the future of omni-channel, where actually, we need to integrate online and offline and we get much better consumer efficiency.","Fabrizio Freda","And the last part of your question was m-commerce. So our m-commerce in the quarter was just doubling versus last year. So you're right. The growth of m is really, really strong.","Cedric Prouv\u00e9","Much faster.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","The organic sales growth in the quarter at 8%, how much do the early buying in Japan contribute to that? And a related question is that early buying clearly helped the quarter, but you were hurt by the promotional activity in China and in the U.S. by Easter, the weather and the Clinique shift. So if we put all those things together, were you may be up 8% adjusted for those gives and takes?","Tracey Thomas Travis","Yes, I would say with those gives and takes, we were up -- we were still up around 8%. So Japan, again, is a large market for us but in the whole scheme of things, from a total company standpoint, would not significantly impact our results -- our segment results, yes, not our total company results for the quarter.","Fabrizio Freda","Your 3 observations are correct. There has been some element of stocking these 3 things, but they are not significant numbers.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Sean King - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Sean King in for Jason English. I guess the question that I have is if you could speak a little bit more about what you're seeing in U.S. department stores and what your expectation is for, I guess, the rest of the year given the weakness that we saw in the first quarter.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, we saw a weak first quarter, as we explained, for several reasons, like weather, Easter and the 53rd week, et cetera. So what we see, we believe that we would see some recovery of the trend in the U.S. overall in the market. We are confident that the U.S. market has the potential to continue growing in the mid-single digits for the long term and to continue growing faster than mass. Within that, the mid-tier department stores are going to be the critical issue in terms of acceleration because, as you know, the rest of online, specialty, freestanding stores are, today, having strongest trend than mid-tier department stores. But mid-tier department store acceleration is going to be supported by our innovation in the next 12 months, which is going to be strengthened, to be innovation, which is less cannibalizing. We call it white space innovation. It should bring new consumer and accelerate the trend again, particularly in the skin care area.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First, I just want a clarification on the 6% to 7% top line growth because until last quarter, that used to be excluding the SMI shift. And I'm trying to understand why now, it includes it, if I heard it correctly, particularly given the better number that you have from the top line for this quarter. And then the non-clarification question, although I would like some clarification about it, is the skin care rebound looks pretty good at about 7%. And a lot of it sounds like it was from innovations, which didn't really materialize last quarter. And I'm trying to understand -- I mean, cannibalization was a big theme last quarter for some of these innovations. I'm trying to understand why it's a little bit different this time, what went wrong last time, perhaps, what's getting better here. And if you can rope in as well the context of the fact you're only spending 1% of your sales on R&D versus some of your competitors spending much, much more, as well as the fact that the margins in skin care look like they were down, that's why the operating income only grew 2%.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Okay, let me [indiscernible] for that question, Ali. In terms of the 6% to 7%, and again, we quoted a lot of numbers on the call with all of the moving parts, so I can understand some of the confusion. And I think the press release does a good job of laying it out when you can refer to it. The 6% to 7% for the full year still does exclude the SMI shift. And obviously, we introduced the new SMI shift for the fourth quarter, but it also excludes that, so that is an SMI-adjusted number of 6% to 7%. What we spoke about was the $125 million to $150 million of advanced shipments we'll see in our fourth quarter are worth about $0.14 to $0.17 of EPS growth for the year, but that is including the next SMI shift. But the 6% to 7% is clean of SMI.","Fabrizio Freda","So no change versus our previous 6% to 7%, so basically, we are not changing our full year 6% to 7% x SMI. And in terms of the skin care, so you're right, the skin care had a softer quarter in October, December, and now there is an acceleration. The difference is the kind of innovation that we have in this part of the fiscal year is less cannibalizing. It's more white space. That's why in my prepared remarks, I spoke a lot about that exactly to make this point because I understood there was some confusion. Our innovation going forward will be a good balance between revitalizing our historical SKUs, like Advanced Night Repair on Lauder, and then adding on top non-cannibalizing innovation that enter white space and creates more net extra and then bringing in some of our brands into areas they are not, which is again, non-cannibalizing. So what you see in skin care is not necessarily more innovation in total, but you see that kind of innovation is driving faster growth. And I believe this will continue in the next 12 months, for example, with the innovation I have explained on Clinique in the course of my prepared remarks. Then in terms of the -- what was the third question?","Dennis D'Andrea","R&D, 1%.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, R&D 1% is -- we actually invest the majority of our R&D activity in skin care. So if you calculate the percent of your investment on the skin care sales, this is actually a higher number. That's one point. And then it's not necessarily apples-with-apples because we have other activities that support our innovation. And last, we -- our innovation program is based a lot in connect and develop with other groups, meaning with the suppliers, with university, with other experts. So we leverage capabilities which are outside of the company with our R&D program in a very profound way.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just have really quick questions. Number one, can you give us the like-door growth for China, whatever would be consistent with the minus 4% you gave us last quarter? And then, Tracey, on SMI, I know you've talked about how the first sort of aspect of the cost savings is just going to be turning off some of the legacy systems that you've been running sort of in duplicate as you've been in the process of rolling out SAP. So can you quantify for us -- forget about above and beyond, process changes and real benefits from SMI and SAP, but just the turning off of that old system, when is that going to start, and how much is that going to equate to in terms of the benefit to margins?","Tracey Thomas Travis","Okay. So for China, Wendy, the comp or the same-store sales growth in the quarter was minus 7%. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the total growth was low single digits, but the comp door sales growth was minus 7%. In terms of SMI and thinking about next year, so we go live in January. We have our normal hyper care period for 3 months, so the team remains in place in order to support that activity. And then we can begin the process of decommissioning legacy systems. From a cost standpoint, I think we'll be able to update more holistically in August some of that activity. There is some savings, though, related to your point of the decommissioning of those systems.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Brian Doyle - CLSA Limited, Research Division","This is Brian Doyle in for Caroline. Just on the U.S. business, we were wondering if there was some shipping of new products maybe ahead of sell-through. The mid-single-digit growth in revenue was ahead of retail data that we've seen, which looked quite a lot weaker. I know you had e-commerce, and owned stores did better, but if you could just help us out on that. And then secondly, I don't know if you actually commented on what you saw in terms of market share trend both in China and the U.S. in the quarter.","Tracey Thomas Travis","So on the shipments, you're correct. We did ship product in the U.S., particularly in the March time frame, to support some April activity. We talked about the Clinique gift that shifted into the fourth quarter from the third quarter, as well as some other activity as well. So that's why you see the disconnect in the third quarter. And that's why we spoke about retail softness, although the numbers from a net standpoint didn't necessarily reflect that.","Fabrizio Freda","So what's the second question?","Dennis D'Andrea","Market share in U.S -- market share in U.S and China.","Fabrizio Freda","So the question on the U.S. market share is -- the answer, sorry, on the U.S. market share, we are, by far, the leader in the U.S. We're more than double the second competitor and around 39% overall share. When you look at our quarter and our year, we are doing a very solid results in makeup. Also, please keep in mind that the retail numbers you see is only 60% of our business. The rest is not covered like freestanding store, online, et cetera. So the makeup, very solid. We are growing market share in fragrance and in hair care. We are growing faster than the market online in specialty, our luxury brands. So the specific issue in the U.S. market share is skin care in mid-tier department stores, and we need to address this issue with the non-cannibalizing skin care innovation that we have been describing the course of this call, in our prepared remarks. That's exactly our plan. That's exactly the area of focus that -- the area of softness that we will address with skin care innovation in the next 12 months to go back growing also skin care market share within prestige in the U.S.","Cedric Prouv\u00e9","And for China, we are the #1 group and we're the #1 brand. But we have stable market share for the year-to-date, and we lost a little bit of market share in the quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","First, a clarification on what you mentioned in Japan. Could you remind us what percentage of sales the company has in Japan and what was the actual growth of Japan in the third quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the second quarter? That will be the clarification because I didn't understand what you said with the prior question. And then more -- the real question has to do with China. The slowdown continued. What do you attribute this slowdown? Because we had seen a pickup of herbal and South Korean brands in our survey work. And how that dovetails into your strategy of opening stores in China at a time that there seems to be a slowdown, what does it mean for margins to the extent that those points of distribution may not be having the kind of throughput that you may want to have?","Fabrizio Freda","So I want first to address the China thing, and then we -- the Japan numbers. China, actually, it continued to be a very strong market. I want to clarify that slowdown means that it's gone from double-digit growth in the market to single-digit growth in the market but still remains one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. Second point is China, the decline -- or the stabilization or market growth in Tier 1 city of China is what is seen in the number. Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities continued to grow. China online business continued to grow, and China freestanding store and specialty channels continued to grow nicely. So the last point is on your issue of productivity. China is still, today, the, by far, most productive market per door. Just a number -- our doors in China are 5x more productive on average than our doors in the U.S. So a certain decrease on sales per door is to be expected with a strong increase in distribution that is happening and the fact that internal travelers, which are 350 million, now find the product in their city of origins, thanks to online and increased distribution in Tier 2 and Tier 3. So the decline of same-door sales in China is expected and, by the way, will not impact profitability for many years to go because, as I said, it's the most productive market per door of the world as we speak. And the other...","Tracey Thomas Travis","So on Japan, Javier, both Cedric and I spoke about Japan. It's about 4% of our total sales. The market has been performing strongly this year up until, certainly, the third quarter, where obviously, the sales growth accelerated. So even prior to the VAT increase, Japan had been up mid-single digits. In the third quarter, Japan was up high double digits, and that is in advance of, obviously, the April VAT increase, where the VAT went from 5% to 8%. So Cedric spoke about a little bit of softness post VAT in the April time frame, but we would expect that Japan would recover to that mid-single-digit level based on some of the strong programs that we have in the market right now with Clinique and others.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sort of long, convoluted question, but part of the issue in the U.S., could it be -- I know a huge source of growth has been taking brands -- taking share away from some of the mass market brands. And one of your competitors said there's no such thing as affordable luxury, meaning that we're going to focus our business almost exclusively on luxury products because there's sort of no mid-tier. And I think maybe part of the risk -- you can tell me if you think I'm dead wrong. But the middle-class consumer is massively stretched right now, and you see it in some of the IRI-type data. And so is there a risk with the strategy of pulling people out of mass because that consumer, at least for the time being, is very at risk? Or maybe you think I'm being short-term on this, and over time, obviously, that market comes back. Just love some clarification, if you don't mind.","Fabrizio Freda","Frankly, I think it's a great question because it's actually true that in this moment, meaning the last 6, 9 months, has been tougher to move people from mass into prestige than it used to be. In fact, you see also in our portfolio the growth of luxury brands is much stronger than the entry price of prestige brands. And in fact, that's why, again, in our prepared remarks, we are explaining that we are turning our focus more balanced into gaining market share within prestige with the kind of innovation we are launching also and a non-cannibalizing one. That, however, is, as you say, a short-term point, meaning that's what is the right to do in this moment. I believe, frankly, that in the long term, the sourcing from mass strategy will continue to be the way to grow the category in prestige, that the middle-class growth will fuel the prestige market. Now in the U.S., this may be slower than in this moment than in other markets, but globally, this is still the clear trend, even today in total. So you're right, but I don't think this is a long-term trend. I think this is just a short-term U.S.-specific adjustment that, in fact, we are doing.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Fabrizio, I was wondering maybe if you can just touch on the -- one of the earlier questions on emerging markets. And as you think about the 10-year compass and doubling the business over the next 5 years, how should we think about the margin profile? Because many consumer companies see margin degradation as they expand more aggressively in emerging markets. So if you can provide any clarity there, that would be really helpful.","Fabrizio Freda","No. Actually, as we explained in the last years, in the majority of our emerging markets, we start to build a business in a way which is accretive and not dilutive to the other -- to the company after a certain amount of year of investment, obviously. So the growing level of the profitability in the emerging markets tends to be in line or accretive to the margin, so we don't see an issue of this kind. Also, the expansion of international contains an important share of travel retail and online. And as you know, those will continue to be among the fastest segments in the international growth, and they are very profit-accretive. And finally, within the emerging market, we tend to choose and prioritize the ones which are more accretive and the brands that we use to build emerging markets. Take this is mind in a very important way. So net, I don't believe the expansion of new channel and new emerging market will be a dilutive risk. If anything, it's one of the mix element that, over time, will play in favor of building our profitability.","Dennis D'Andrea","Holly, can we wrap up?","Operator","Yes.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.","Laraine A. Mancini - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Good morning. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges, changes to the provisional amounts related to the recently enacted U.S. tax law, the new accounting standard for revenue recognition and other adjustments disclosed in our press release.","You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.

Our fiscal year is off to an excellent start as our multiple engines of growth once again drove double-digit sales and earnings per share gains, reflecting strength across our categories, brands, markets and channels. Strong double-digit advances in many areas of our business enhanced by targeted investments drove comparable sales growth of 11%, our sixth consecutive quarter with a double-digit increase. We leveraged our strong top line growth and benefited from ongoing disciplined cost management, fueled by our Leading Beauty Forward initiative, which led to diluted earnings per share climbing more than twice that rate, up 24%.","With these strong results and confidence in our ability to execute effectively, we are raising our EPS guidance for the year. We now expect EPS growth of 10% to 12% in constant currency on sales growth of 7% to 8%, which is at the top of our long-term sales goal.","The macro environment was particularly challenging this quarter, with initial impact of tariffs in Europe and China, a softer UK beauty market stemming from concerns about Brexit, and the closure of some department store doors including Bon-Ton in the U.S. and House of Fraser in the UK.","Despite these factors and overall volatility, we not only delivered our sales and financial targets, we exceeded them. Our success was widespread throughout our business and driven by the strength of our diverse brand portfolio, innovation and growth engines in every region and channel. Many brands grew double digits including three of our four biggest brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder, M\u2022A\u2022C and La Mer, reconfirming the power and desirability of strong, established brands.","Many markets delivered robust growth. In the Asia region, China, Hong Kong, Japan and every country in Southeast Asia advanced by double digits. In China, our sales accelerated. Consumer demand for our products was also vibrant in our other emerging markets excluding China. Importantly, our retail sales growth in the United States turned positive and global e-commerce and travel retail posted significant increases.","A sharper focus on strategic innovation drove our brand growth, particularly in the most popular hero franchises. Deeper analytical insights are giving us a greater understanding of consumer needs by market and amplifying our innovation power. We developed high-quality products for targeted consumer groups and a diversity of skin types that attracted new consumers and achieved strong repurchase rates.","We supported our innovations with increased digital advertising and influencer attention that enhanced storytelling, led to higher awareness, traffic and sales. Our strong innovation program is a sustainable growth engine that is broad-based, flowing across all our brands and geographies.","In skin care, our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand's hero franchises drove impressive growth. The brand's Advanced Night Repair franchise increased nearly 50% globally, fueled by new supercharged hero product. In Asia\/Pacific, sales of the new eye gel soared. La Mer was a star in our portfolio. Its sales climbed double digits in every region on strong demand for luxury skin care and new launches including its Treatment Lotion Hydrating Mask which boosted its global mask business. The brand is number one in luxury skin care in North America and in the UK, it gained share in both markets also reflecting loyalty from devoted consumers.","Clinique's skin care business grew globally supported by new innovation and established favorites. To accelerate one of its key product lines, Clinique launched a unique hydrating jelly in its Dramatically Different moisturizer franchise. Initial sales are exceeding our projections. Clinique also modernized its historical ingredient philosophy, making it more relevant for today's consumers. We are also excited about a new Clinique skin care innovation that we'll launch in December and can be personalized for each consumer's needs.","Another brand with strong global skin scare sales was Origins, thanks to its moisturizer and hero products. Origins is riding the growing wave of interest in natural beauty products and with its strong positioning is leveraging demand with new innovations.","Innovation and creativity in makeup contributed to M\u2022A\u2022C's success in the quarter. Its global growth was led by its international business and reflected its focus on bigger innovation with more impact. Its new Powder Kiss lipstick brought renewed attention to the brand-coveted lipstick collections. It was developed by M\u2022A\u2022C artists backstage and launched during Fashion Week in New York and Milan.","Est\u00e9e Lauder brand also achieved excellent growth in makeup. Sales of its Double Wear foundation, its biggest makeup franchise, increased more than 20%, aided by shade extensions and a new product in the line, as it continues to serve and appeal to all skin types worldwide with a broad range of shapes and formats.","Too Faced retail sales in North America rose sharply, driven by new shades of Born This Way Foundation and Super Coverage concealer. Too Faced gained share in the U.S., and its Better Than Sex mascara continued to be the best selling prestige mascara in the market. In fragrance, launches from several of our luxury and artisanal brands resonated with consumers, including Tom Ford Beauty's Ombre Leather and a range of scents from By Kilian called MY KIND OF LOVE that was created for specialty multi in North America and Western Europe. Est\u00e9e Lauder introduced Beautiful Belle in advance of the holiday season.","Combined sales from brands we have acquired over the past few years rose significantly. We are expanding their target consumer reach by entering new markets, farther penetrating equity-building channels, while at the same time developing new products and integrating them into our operations.","Our pioneer digital strategy continues to support our brands in many ways. In terms of e-commerce, all three platforms, brand.com, retail.com, and third-party sites advanced sharply. Our 200 brand sites generated double-digit sales growth and also have become powerful equity-building vehicles. Our brand sites alone attracted nearly 90 million global visits in the quarter, making them also highly valuable media assets. For perspective, we estimate that those consumer visits were worth $250 million in advertising equivalent, demonstrating effective and efficient new ways that our brands have to engage with consumers worldwide.","We continue to expand our brands on third-party platforms. We successfully launched Jo Malone on Tmall in China and five more brands on ASOS in the UK, a destination that attracts millennials.","Another rapidly growing areas was our global travel retail business, which continued its fast pace, driven by broad-based growth across brands and countries. Eight of our top-ten brands grew double digits at retail in the channel. And many key travel retail markets farther accelerated growth, including the UK, Italy, Germany and Turkey. This success contributed to our strong double-digit retail and net sales growth, far, far outpacing the 6% rise in international passenger traffic.","Travel has increased among many consumer groups, including Russians, Middle Easterners, Chinese and Nigerians, helping to increase demand in the channel. Our travel retail channel also benefited from successful launches, effective marketing, and exclusive products. We expanded distribution for our artisanal fragrance brands, which is helping to increase our share in the European region in travel retail.","We are making good progress on increasing passenger conversion with new programs. We believe that our travel retail business will continue to benefit in the long term from favorable fundamentals, including growing passenger traffic, increased conversion of passenger to shopper and a broader equity-building distribution of our new brands. Emerging markets, excluding China, were also strong growth drivers, advancing double digits, with the biggest gains in the Middle East, Russia, India, Turkey and Southeast Asia.","Finally, we are pleased that our North America results were also encouraging. Our overall retail sales in the U.S. turned positive. If we exclude Bon-Ton, this was the fastest growth rate in more than two years. Our push into fast-growing channels has continued to have a bigger impact, specialty multi and online, especially retail.com grew rapidly. In addition, we improved our business with our department store customers.","We expect a solid holiday season as we roll out exciting programs. Est\u00e9e Lauder's blockbuster promotion hits counters and online sites in the U.S. tomorrow. And our brands have created compelling sets in innovation that we believe will drive traffic. The risk of moderation of prestige beauty growth in China, particularly in the second half of our fiscal year, is included in our full year guidance to reflect the possible volatility stemming from the current geopolitical and economical environment.","However, I want to be clear that we have not seen any slowdown, and luxury cosmetic historically have been less sensitive to the variability of economic trends because they are an affordable luxury. In fact, our net sales in China this quarter further accelerated, and our strong double-digit growth came from many drivers. Our brands like those sales were robust. We gained share in our department store distribution, and sales in specialty-multi, freestanding stores and online grew even faster.","Our e-commerce business reached consumers in the many cities where we have no brick and mortar distribution, leveraging our efficient model. In addition, we achieved double-digit growth across every brand in every product category. Our efforts to diversify our business have been successful as our makeup and fragrance growth surpassed skin care growth. Importantly, our repurchase rates are strong, illustrating the equity of our brands and consumer appreciations for our products.","We have a long-term focus in China. We have invested there for two decades. It's an important part of our long-term emerging market strategy, and we plan to continue growing market share and serve our Chinese consumer with the highest quality products. We continue to be encouraged by attractive long-term demographic and economic trends in China as millions of new consumers enter the market. The rising middle class aspires to luxury, and today millennials and Gen Z consumers will have much more disposable income than past generations, particularly as more women enter the workforce. We believe demand for beauty in China and other emerging markets will continue to rise over the long term.","In summary, we achieved terrific progress this quarter. Most brands grew, and three of our largest climbed at double digits, including M\u2022A\u2022C which has gained more traction. Retail sales in the U.S. turned positive, generating encouraging business improvement. Many countries had higher sales. In emerging markets, we are strong overall. Our business in the Middle East, which had been depressed, started improving. Sales in China accelerated. Global online and travel retail continue to increase sharply. Our innovations created stronger hero franchises and attracted new consumers.","With these strong results to start the year, we are confident about our near- and long-term prospects. Our diverse brand portfolio, strong innovation pipeline and vast global reach supported by local insights and analytics should continue to fuel our success. We have the flexibility to invest where we see the best growth opportunities and are confident in the ability of our leadership team and talented employees to execute our strategy with excellence. We are well positioned to outperform global prestige beauty, deliver strong sales gains and generate double-digit growth in EPS this year and over the long term.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2019 first quarter financial results and then cover our expectations for the second quarter and for the full year. My commentary today excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges and adjustments, including those related to our Leading Beauty Forward initiative and the recent U.S. tax legislation.","All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency and comparable accounting methods unless otherwise stated. As a reminder, we adopted the new accounting standard for revenue recognition, ASC 606, this fiscal year on a modified retrospective basis. For the first quarter, the impact decreased our sales growth by two percentage points, our operating profit growth by five points and our EPS by $0.06.","Net sales for the first quarter were up 11% with virtually all regions and product categories contributing to growth. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia\/Pacific region led net sales growth this quarter. Sales rose 29% and most markets saw double digit increases. Sales in China and Hong Kong rose very strong double digits with broad-based growth across brands, categories and channels.","Prestige beauty growth in department stores in China continued to grow more than 20% and we gained share, while sales in specialty multi and online more than doubled. Our strong growth extended beyond China and Hong Kong. We also achieved excellent sales growth in Japan, where we experienced growth across all channels, including department stores, specialty multi and online. Taiwan and Malaysia were also up double digits and we had single digit growth in Australia.","Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 16%, driven by strong double-digit increases in our global travel retail business and emerging markets in the region. All three geographic regions within travel retail grew, led by corridors across Asia. Strong like-door growth drove the majority of the increase and was supplemented by additional points of sale, particularly for our less distributed brands. Our emerging markets growth in the region was led by the Middle East, Turkey, Russia and India. The Middle East had significant net sales growth following the reset that we did last year, but the underlying retail trend continues to be challenging reflective of the area's economic situation.","In Western Europe, Italy remained a bright spot, while lower consumer sentiment in the UK pressured brick and mortar retailers. This was seen most acutely in House of Fraser, one of our largest department store customers in the UK, as they reorganize under new ownership. Debenhams is also experiencing some challenges as they announced last week, and we are prudently supporting them as the holiday season begins. Our online business in the UK continued to grow double digits. In other Western European markets, our business was relatively flat, in line with prestige beauty in the area.","Net sales in the Americas declined 2%. North America continued to achieve double-digit growth in specialty multi-retail and in online, all of online, which offsets declines in mid-tier department stores and freestanding stores. Excluding prior year sales to Bon-Ton, our sales in North America increased slightly, better reflecting the retail improvement Fabrizio mentioned. Latin American sales declined as the tough environment in Brazil and Mexico overshadowed strong growth in the Andean countries.","Skin care continued to lead product category growth this quarter. Net sales grew 21%, with strong contributions from the innovations previously mentioned within hero franchises in the Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and La Mer brands. Net sales in makeup grew 6%, led by strong innovations and launches in foundation and lip from Est\u00e9e Lauder and M\u2022A\u2022C. Sales of fragrances rose 2% as gains in luxury and artisanal brands were partially offset by declines in designer fragrances and Est\u00e9e Lauder.","Le Labo launched its City Exclusives fragrance set online, continued its strong comp door growth and expanded its targeted consumer reach. Our hair care sales rose 7%, primarily driven by Aveda's strong innovation and its acceleration of online sales.","Our gross margin declined 160 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year, due primarily to the impact of new accounting standards, which negatively impacted our gross margin by 220 basis points through the reclassification of samples, testers, and collateral to cost of goods from operating expenses. This decline was partially offset by favorable skin care category mix and pricing of 100 basis points. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 250 basis points, largely due to the 180-basis-point impact of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition.","For the remainder of expenses, we continue to reallocate expenses smartly to drive the business with flexibility, fueled by savings from our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. Lower selling, general, and administrative expenses improved our expense margin by 210 basis points, allowing us to invest more in advertising behind strong innovation to fuel growth. We continue to optimize our marketing mix to maximize returns on investment across all areas. We have found that our increase in digital advertising broadly has been highly effective with a return on investment that is meaningfully higher than traditional media.","Operating income rose 13% and operating margin increased by 90 basis points. Excluding the impact of the new accounting standard, operating income rose 18% and operating margin increased 140 basis points. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 20.9%, primarily reflecting the lower U.S. statutory rate and favorable geographic mix of earnings.","Diluted EPS of $1.41 increased 17% compared to the prior year and grew 19% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.02 of unfavorable currency translation. Diluted EPS excluding the impact of the accounting change was $1.47, an increase of 22% compared to the prior year or 24% in constant currency. EPS was higher than expected due to the stronger sales growth and a favorable tax rate.","During the quarter, we utilized $119 million in net cash flows from operating activities, which was below the prior year due primarily to timing differences in shipments and receivables, and we invested $128 million in capital expenditures. We used $530 million to repurchase 3.8 million shares of our stock and paid $141 million in dividends. We also announced this morning a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.43 per share and an increase in our share repurchase authorization by 40 million shares.","Now, let's turn to our outlook for next quarter and the full year. We've obviously had a solid start to the fiscal year, but we recognize that a variety of macro risks, including pre-Brexit sentiments and post-Brexit potential implications, political instability in many areas around the world, and soft economies in certain markets, create an ongoing level of uncertainty in many parts of our business.","As you know, we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard beginning this fiscal year and the guidance we are providing today reflects the impact of the new method, which reduces our sales and EPS growth due to deferral of recognition of certain revenue and associated profit related to some promotional activity. We have also bridged to the comparable growth expectations we have for the business for ease of comparable business performance.","For the year, we remain comfortable with our sales growth expectation of 7% to 8% in constant currency and excluding the impact of the new accounting standard. This does assume some moderation of growth in China and travel retail in the second half, reflecting the current geopolitical and economic risks.","It also reflects the previously-announced door closings of certain department store locations in the U.S. and the UK. Currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 2 percentage points, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.17 for the euro, $1.31 for the pound and \u00a5687 for the yuan for the fiscal year. And the new accountings standard is expected to negatively affect reported growth by 1 percentage point. We now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 23%.","We are raising our EPS expectations to a range of $4.73 to $4.82 before restructuring and other charges. This includes the impact of known tariffs globally, including the planned increase in China in January, as well as approximately $0.20 of dilution from currency translation and $0.02 dilution from the new accounting standard.","In constant currency and with comparable accounting, we expect EPS to rise by 10% to 12%. For the second quarter, net sales are expected to increase approximately 8% to 9% in constant currency and using comparable accounting. Currency translation and the accounting change are each expected to negatively impact growth by 2 percentage points. Therefore, we expect reported net sales to grow between 4% and 5%.","EPS is forecasted between $1.47 and $1.50 before restructuring charges. This includes about $0.03 dilution from currency and $0.11 dilution from the new accounting standard. With the strong start to the fiscal year and with our first quarter behind us, we are focused on delivering another successful full year of solid top-line growth, margin expansion and double-digit EPS increases thereby generating strong returns for our shareholders.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Sorry about that.","Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Good morning.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, Fabrizio, you were pretty clear that the fiscal 2019 guidance now assumes more onerous external assumptions in China and travel retail, given the external environment despite the internal momentum. I was hoping you could also take that out to more sort of a longer-term basis as you look out over the next few years. And, A, maybe just on a backwards-looking basis give us some historical context for how much of the top line momentum in these two areas have been driven by macros more recently in the last couple of years versus more enduring factors, just to help us conceptualize the macro risk.","And, B, going forward, can you talk a little bit about how you can practically manage or adapt your strategies in those two areas, or even maybe at the corporate level, elsewhere in the organization, if the macro pressure materialized, particularly given the inventory swings in China and travel retail historically which can often exacerbate a retail sales slowdown? So again, that's sort of beyond fiscal 2019 as you look longer term. Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Yeah, that is a long question. Let me start from the 2019 part of your question, which was the first part, and then I'll address the long term. So, we have recognized that given the external environment, there is a risk the China TR moderate growth and there is a risk of tariffs. So we have frankly already recognized that risk in the August guidance. However, we have prudently growth the protection of our estimate from that risk this time because obviously, we didn't pass all the beat of quarter one on, which increased our protection of this risk to materialize. If this risk does not materialize, obviously, we have the opportunity to do better. And that's the way we look at it.","And we have also internal flexibility to answer more directly your question to move funds and resources to the most appropriate growth opportunity, depending on what we see. And we have, with our leadership team organized ourselves to be ready to allocate resources, depending on the situation externally and depending on the rate of return of our innovation and our initiatives. So that's the way we are organized.","In terms of the long term is we frankly believe that the China market will continue to be a market that will grow at double digit over the long-term. And this is going to be driven, as I said in my prepared remarks, by many external factors, meaning demographies, growth of middle class, women work, young generation, purchasing powers and the amazing, amazing interest for luxury beauty in the Chinese consumers. That will not change. It will not be changing because of economic trends. Maybe variable or volatile because of economic trends in the short term or because of tariff implication or any other aspect, but will not change in our opinion for the long term. So, we are assuming that a double-digit growth of China and travel retail will be part of our long-term potential in terms of growth.","But also, we have demonstrated in this quarter that to reach a 6% to 8% growth for the long-term, we do not need an over-delivery of China travel retail. We are just implying travel retail and China to continue what we design a normalized long-term growth. And we will be able to deliver our long-term 6% to 8%. And the many other engines of growth are also helping that. Last data point, if you take our EMEA results and you exclude UK short-term issues for Brexit, as Tracey underlined, if you exclude the TR positive impact, you are left with plus 7% growth, which is exactly in the middle of our long-term 6% to 8%, just to make the point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman, Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Good morning.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about M\u2022A\u2022C. So M\u2022A\u2022C being called out for double digit performance \u2013 I know, Middle East was a big part of it, so some are probably reselling, you know, sort of, the reset that you've done in the Middle East in the route to market. Can you just talk about performance for M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S., both online, separate from mid-tier department stores? What you're seeing in terms of \u2013 you've talked about your hero products, bigger innovation? What is it strategically that's driving some change in that business? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Yeah, no. Thank you. M\u2022A\u2022C is improving sequentially its performance. This definitely in the quarter in the short term has the positive implication to restock in the Middle East and to the improvements of this trend in the Middle East. Therefore, M\u2022A\u2022C is very important.","But now also to speak about the negatives, I will say there's also \u2013 there is the negative that Brazil is another important market for M\u2022A\u2022C which it was not very active in this quarter. So, there are positive and negative also internationally.","The drivers start becoming many, many. China continue to be a great driver. Asia in total continue to be a great driver. TR continue to be a great driver, and many other emerging markets, and markets in Europe \u2013 Italy, for example, that we have mentioned as for the overall business is one of the best performing markets for M\u2022A\u2022C. And to your question, we continue to see...","(34:08 \u2013 34:18)","Operator","There will be a slight delay in today's conference. Please hold.","(34:22 \u2013 35:43)","Laraine A. Mancini - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Hello.","Operator","Ms. Mancini, you may proceed.","Laraine A. Mancini - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Okay. Lauren?","Lauren R.

Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. You talked about Brazil, right, emerging markets, Italy...","Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Yeah. I was speaking about \u2013 so you dropped when I was speaking that there was the positive of the Middle East that you highlighted, but there was also some negative, like Brazil is not yet back, but obviously because of our external environmental situation.","But I was also mentioning the positives for M\u2022A\u2022C. There were China, TR, every single Asia market, Italy. And I was speaking about the improvements in the U.S. in specialty-multi, in online, and I was saying that these improvements are also generated by a more focused innovation plan with fewer initiatives, bigger, and focus on the key drivers. And I made the example of lipstick, but we have also a big example in foundation and an exciting innovation plan in front of us. So, M\u2022A\u2022C is on improvement trend in the U.S. and continues its solid performance overall internationally.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti, Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Great quarter. Let me add my congrats.","Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Thank you.","Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Thank you.","Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Tracey, would you mind adding any, kind of \u2013 is there any kind of numbers you could add around how much you guys adjusted guidance related to the tariffs and the more conservative assumption around China and travel global?","Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Basically, when we gave guidance in August we included the known announced guidance at that time that we knew were going to be impacting us. And so that was tariff related to the EU and some preliminary tariffs in China. Subsequently, it has become more certain at least that \u2013 or at least we believe that we may experience higher tariffs in January.","So, some of the \u2013 embedded in the guidance in the second half from an EPS standpoint is the inclusion of that increase in tariffs. We do, as we said on the last call, 30% of our product in China comes from the U.S. The balance comes from our factories around the rest of the globe. So, that's generally what the exposure is. We also export products out of China, primarily raw materials and components. And so, we do get a duty drawback on that.","Michael Binetti - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Just following up then. I think some of your competitors have mentioned seeing the category, the beauty category accelerate globally. And then, there has been some comments on strengthening trends behind premiumization. As I look through your guidance, I know you guys always try to make sure you're on the conservative side of where you see the category headed, but it seems like those two dynamics, in particular, with the global growth accelerating and then premiumization would \u2013 could potentially be an outsized benefit for you given your exposure. Can you speak to anything you're seeing related to \u2013 I guess, you kept your outlook for the category the same, but I didn't really hear any commentary on premiumization, how you see those two trends.","Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","So, I'll take this one. And premiumization, absolutely we see that. As you see in our \u2013 but, again, your question is about guidance. So, the guidance \u2013 I'll comment to the guidance in a second. But in terms of the results we see today, we see the market of beauty remaining very strong. Our estimate is 5% to 6% for the year, which assume in this 5% to 6% a little slowdown in the second semester, but the current growth is very strong. And we do see premiumization, meaning prestige is growing much faster than mass in all the markets that we have data about.","And most importantly, we see consumer continue to trading up and going toward luxury skin care, basically towards quality products and quality experiences. And we see the overall luxury experience, which includes service and customization, to be more and more preferred by consumer, and we believe this is a long-term trend and the fact that we are a company completely focused on prestige we believe is a strong competitive advantage for the long-term because in all our brand, we are delivering the premiumization benefits that the consumer is looking for.","Your second part of the question was more specifically in the guidance. No, on the contrary in the guidance, as you have seen, we do not assume the market to accelerate \u2013 the premiumization to accelerate in the second semester. Actually, we assume a moderation of this phenomenon for the next short term for the January-June period, not necessary for the long term but that's in the assumption and again we explain why we are taking prudently this assumption at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Good morning.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. I had a question on your Makeup business. Operating income declined as did margins, so you called out stepped-up spending behind Too Faced. So, I was hoping you could drill down a little further on this to give us a sense of, I guess, where you're at with the spending and then maybe how much your Makeup business would be performing excluding the spending. And then, hoping to get a sense of how much longer the spending levels might be or stay elevated behind Too Faced. And then finally, more importantly, what kind of lift you're seeing right now if any or really what your expectations are? Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Yeah. So, regarding Makeup, we did have \u2013 we called out as well some declines in our Smashbox business. But the Too Faced investment \u2013 the Too Faced had quite a few large launches this quarter. They launched their Born This Way Foundation with extended shades, Born This Way Concealer. Their Tutti Frutti line as well launched this quarter.","So, they had \u2013 quarter-to-quarter, it's very difficult to look at our results from a spending standpoint because we are so launch and innovation driven. And if it's a bigger launch one quarter than the next, you'll see perhaps outsized spending and depending on when that spending happens in the quarter. So I would expect that our Makeup operating margins will improve throughout the balance of the year, and you'll see more normalization there.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Ottenstein, Evercore ISI.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much and terrific quarter. You're obviously doing a really nice job on some of the larger well-established brands and I know this is a tricky question, it's very hard to dissect, but I was wondering if you could give us a sense of the contribution of innovation to those brands and e-commerce and if it's possible, obviously they're connected, but I was wondering if it's possible to kind of tease out the impact of both of those factors? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Yeah, so first of all, on all these brands, and frankly on every brand that the impact of e-commerce is very positive. As we explained, we have brand sites, retail.com and overall platforms like Tmall. We are growing in each one of these three segments very strongly, double-digits, and particularly on platform at very strong double-digits, and also in retail.com at very strong double-digits.","And we expect this strong trend to continue because also we are creating great experiences online in all these platforms and the consumer is more and more interested. We are very strong, and we have been investing for years in this area, so we consider our e-commerce business a strength and something we can continue to leverage and be at the forefront of the industry with it.","In terms of the contribution of innovation, as I touched in my prepared remarks, we are really taking innovation to the next level. Our innovation today is much more focused on the right opportunities, on the right consumer targets, on the right benefits, thanks to a major work we have done in the last couple of years on adding analytics and more sophisticated analytics to our way to determine how to innovate and to focus our marketing plan after we have produced the innovation, and we see the results of this.","Personally, I believe that a big part of our acceleration on the big brands is driven by the quality of our innovation and by the ability to focus innovation on the areas of biggest return. Finally, we are really focused on product quality. That's why at the end, we speak about prestige. Premiumization is about qualitization in my opinion and the consumer are going more and more towards high quality products. Our products are superb quality as we see from the repurchase rates of our consumers.","So innovation needs to be pushed with trial, but after the trial what really makes the innovation successful is how many consumers come back more and more to buy the product, that we measure with our repurchase rates. And we have extraordinary strong repurchase rates and obviously profitability is driven by repurchase. Investments are driven by trial. So we always keep in mind this difference.","Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","And the only thing I'll add to this and this doesn't directly address your question, but just a reminder that for our overall company, our increase from pricing and distribution has been roughly the same in the 2% to 3% for distribution, 2% pricing. Everything else is innovation and comp store sales. So the big acceleration that we've seen, which certainly includes the performance in China and travel retail but also online, has been really in that category, which is very, very strong and very healthy for us.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","So it sounds like you've got a very nice, for lack of a better word, formula working that has had this gaining traction, and it seems to be gaining some traction in Clinique. Would that be fair? And do you see \u2013 and how would you look at the mix between the innovation in e-commerce in terms of getting Clinique even to a higher sales trajectory?","Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Thank you for this question. Actually, yes, we do expect Clinique to get a lot of acceleration, definite from online. That's already happening and will continue to happen more, but as I mentioned particularly from innovation. I believe Clinique is one of the best innovation programs in this moment in front of us, and I said there will be a new launch of Clinique, which is very important in December which is very exciting in the area of Skin Care. And there is more innovation to come.","Plus the ingredient story of Clinique has been taken to the next level, and this also is having an initial encouraging impact on consumers. So we are in a situation where three of our biggest brands are already growing double-digits, in which M\u2022A\u2022C is gradually improving, in some points, which has been U.S. and UK. And in a situation where Clinique, we believe has the potential for the total fiscal year to go back to growth as well. And so our ambition is to finish this fiscal year with all our top-four brands on a growth trajectory.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson, Citi.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Could you talk about the trends in the specialty-multi business in the U.S.? I think for the last few quarters, we've heard you talk about strong double-digit growth, and it has clearly slowed a little bit in this quarter. Is that just a function of Smashbox weakness?","And can you update us on kind of where you are? I know you don't want to tell us exactly how many ULTA doors M\u2022A\u2022C is in, but kind of where you are maybe inning-wise? Are you in the third inning of distribution expansion for M\u2022A\u2022C into ULTA doors? Or just how much more run-way is there for new door expansion in specialty-multi? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Yeah, you're welcome. And so we are doing well in specialty-multi. We continue to grow. And this has continued to be one of our key drivers. And we are at the point already, we communicated that last quarter, where the benefit of specialty-multi start to being substantial, so having a significant impact on our growth in the quarter. That's very positive.","Now there's been some slowdown on Smashbox for sure, as you mentioned, and that's obviously a slowdown of the results of growth. But the other brands really in specialty-multi did very, very well, and there is no other sign of slowdown. Actually, I would say, most of them are on a clear accelerating trend. And there is more potential for distribution.","Yes, on M\u2022A\u2022C in Ulta, there is more potential for more doors. That is not only about M\u2022A\u2022C. There is more potential for many of our small and medium-sized brands that have the opportunity to further accelerate distribution in this area. And as you know, we had also some distribution in online and flagship doors of brands like Jo Malone and La Mer, which are also performing very well on the high-end consumers that shop in this channel. So overall, we are positive and we believe this story can continue to build over time.","Operator","Our next question is from Nik Modi, RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to stick on the topic of innovation. Fabrizio, maybe you can just talk about some of these new product launches you referenced in terms of the personalized skin care product and just some context around if you've tested it, what kind of demographics does it appeal to? And then maybe you can also talk about the Clinique 72-hour moisturizer and kind of how you think about that product relative to how it's maybe tested or your hopes and desires for that franchise? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Yeah, so on the innovation on Clinique, which is customized to every consumer, I prefer not to comment more. We are in the process of announcing it to the various retailers around the world, and so we'll be soon official and will be launched in December. But basically is the kind of innovation our analytics are giving us, meaning innovation that is not only a great product quality that provide interesting and relevant benefits. But is also proposing to the consumer a new customization idea and so there is responding to new desires, doing it in a way which is unexpected and different. And that's the quality of innovation I'm speaking about.","We always had to make quality products. We always had the ability to create interesting benefits. But we are now learning how to do it in a way which is much more customized, more differentiated and anticipate new consumer desires in a world where the consumers is more at the center of the attention and leading the process.","In terms of the other innovation, yeah, the Moisture Surge, which is the Clinique 72-hours benefit product you had mentioned is doing very, very well. It's one of the key driver of the success in skin care of Clinique, and it's the results of a extraordinary technical innovation, where the level of moisturization is extremely strong and very appreciated by the consumer, included into a formula with a very special texture that we know has high level of appreciation by the consumer around the world. So, it's strong, it's doing well, and we believe there is potential to do even better in the future. We'll continue to drive it.","Another example is the launch of jelly, which I mentioned, which is basically taking the core franchise of moisturization of Clinique and giving it a different form and this jelly form, by the way, our analytics show that there was absolutely preferred by a certain group of consumers, particularly young consumers. And so, with the goal of rejuvenating, of making younger, that historical franchise of Clinique, we have chosen a form, a texture, and a model of benefit that we knew was preferred by this group of consumers. And, in fact, the results are coming. So, it's about applying our historical innovation strengths to better analytical understanding of the opportunities and thanks to this, creating much higher rate of returns of our innovation scheme.","Operator","Our next question is from Linda Bolton Weiser, D.A. Davidson.","Linda Bolton Weiser - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you. So, when we talk to investors about your strong trends in growth and innovation and everything, you've been talking about, one of the pushbacks we get is that we are getting potentially close to the end of the cycle. And some investors actually think we will get a recession in the next 18 to 24 months. So, can you talk about \u2013 in the past, you had invested quite heavily through the cycle and especially in a downturn you continued to invest behind your brands. Can you talk about \u2013 is there anything different in the structure of your business or the mix of your business, this cycle that would potentially mute the decline in your earnings that we saw in past downturns? Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Yeah, so, I'll start. One of the big differences quite honestly is Leading Beauty Forward. And so, the efforts that we have taken to take more fixed cost out of the business to structure ourselves differently, to invest behind faster growing areas, we actually have more flexibility in our cost base, which you hear us talk about quite often. And in terms of investing behind when markets are strong and when innovation is strong, but also pulling back when there is a downturn or to your point if a recession were to occur.","So, I think structurally the company is much, much stronger today than it was a few years ago, because of all of the work that we've done in programs like Leading Beauty Forward to really reorganize our expense base and invest behind areas that really drive the growth of the business.","Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","So, to that point of Tracey, basically, we have higher variable costs and lower fixed costs, and we are more flexible, and we have great cash. And so, the ability to go through recessions with cash assuming this had to happen. But I want also to touch on the part from the consumer. To be clear, we have a portfolio of brands, that really go from the entry price point of prestige to the luxury. And so, we have seen during recession our abilities also to push more the brands which are at the entry price point and to leverage them. And today, we are much more capable of doing that and we have a much richer portfolio across the several price points.","The other thing which has changed is \u2013 please, let's not forget that prestige cosmetics are affordable luxury. And the famous thing that Leonard Lauder said many years ago about the lipstick index, which is when there is a recession, women buy more lipsticks, not less, for the simple thing that it is affordable luxury in a moment where maybe other luxuries is not the right priority for families or for people. And so, we believe that we can leverage much better than in the past the concept of the lipstick index.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan, Stifel.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, and good morning, everybody. One housekeeping question, one follow-up on the Clinique line. One, just Tracey, is there any benefit anticipated in the second quarter guidance from sell-in ahead of the tariffs? And then just on Clinique broadly, I guess maybe to put the question in a different way, why has the brand not resonated with consumers in recent years? And, I guess, the question is, the innovation sounds pretty exciting, but from a brand standpoint, how much of it is the brand itself where there's a lot more competition for a dermatologically correct skin care makeup brand today versus maybe 10 years or 15 years ago? And then how do you think about spend or innovation around kind of modernizing it versus just running the business kind of as it is with lesser growth than you have seen in recent years versus history?","Tracey Thomas Travis - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","So let me start on the tariff question. We are seeing obviously incredibly strong growth in China, so we have not been building up related to the tariffs. We've really been flowing inventory as we have it to support the slow or the very fast sales trends. So we don't have a big inventory buildup in China where that would cause the moderation or the slowdown that we're speaking about in the second half.","As it relates to Clinique, and I'll let Fabrizio add on to this as well, one of the things that we mentioned in the last call that I would just remind you of is, Clinique has been one of the brands that's been disproportionately affected by some of the retailer dislocation that's happened, particularly in North America \u2013 in Canada and in the U.S. because they were so strong in those businesses, so. And the same in the UK as well, we're seeing that impact with Clinique. So they have been disproportionately affected by that.","The innovation in recent years has been quite strong, and certainly there's been a lot more competition in the space. I always say great brands attract great competition and certainly our brand portfolio has done that. So the innovation, as Fabrizio mentioned that Clinique is coming out with, is informed by insights, the competitive environment, what consumers are looking for today, and being done in a Clinique way. And so we are very encouraged by early signs that we've seen on some of the product launched starting with Moisture Surge and certainly the jelly that Fabrizio spoke about and the upcoming innovation that will begin to be phased out in December on the new product line which is quite exciting.","Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","And I just want to add that the Clinique team, which is probably listening to the call, will be very happy about your question because they could not agree more that they are working very hard on the modernization of the brand. They have modernized the allergy-tested, fragrance free position of the brand with the new purity statement. They're modernizing their stores. They're modernizing their packaging. We spoke already about innovation.","There's been a lot of progress on Clinique and frankly, you would see already more of this progress into the number if it was not for the fact that, for example, Bon-Ton closure is the large majority impacting Clinique, the House of Fraser softness in the UK is for the large majority impacting Clinique. So Clinique has been the most impacted not necessarily by the consumer not liking the brand, but really from the dislocation of the distribution reality around the world. And the work they are doing on modernization of the brand starts working well, and we believe will give soon better and better results.","Operator","Our next question is from Erinn Murphy, Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good morning. And let me add my congratulations. Maybe just a segue from a lot of the comments on Clinique, but when you take a step back and just think about the natural beauty trend, how much of your portfolio today really lends itself to this macro trend? And then going forward, how are you weighing the opportunity to invest behind this trend in your existing portfolio today versus looking at M&A?","Fabrizio Freda - The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc.","Yeah, in our portfolio, first of all, the purity concept is actually the Clinique concept. As I said, today it is called in many different ways. It's called clean, natural, et cetera but \u2013 so the brand that is now stepping up to leverage this trend in a unique Clinique way is actually Clinique. The other brands are obviously Origins, which is, as I said in my prepared remarks, exactly in the middle of that and in fact is having exciting results. And exciting results because it's leveraging the strength and because it's doing great innovation exactly on that trend, like the very recent launch of Origins lipstick line in the U.S., which is a super exciting flower-based line that leverage even in lipstick the natural trends that personally, I believe, will be very, very interesting for the consumer worldwide.","And then we have Aveda. Aveda is in the middle of this since always, since ever. Not only Aveda adds to the natural element to be leveraged, the sustainability element as well that is a very strong preferred Millennials point of view today. So Clinique, Origins, Aveda are the obvious question that we are using these brands to further leverage these trends.","And on your question on M&A, we always look at the M&A possibilities around the world, and if there will be opportunity in these areas, obviously we will consider them.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Kunes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dennis McEniry, President, Est\u00e9e Lauder Online. Dennis will discuss the current status and future opportunities for our online business.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Except when noted, our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges. And as noted, our discussion of the fourth quarter will also be before sales shifts attributable to our Strategic Modernization Initiative. You can find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone. We have now successfully completed 3 years of our long-term strategy which has driven our momentum and produced superb results. Our business model continued to deliver strong sustainable sales growth that was highly profitable. I'm extremely pleased that in fiscal year 2012, for the second consecutive year, our company achieved double-digit sales gains and record profits despite difficult economic condition in some key markets.","The company's 10% sales increase was about twice the rate of global prestige beauty which means we gained share and further strengthened our position as industry leader. We also made significant progress against our strategic objectives. We continue to focus on fewer but more impactful products and an increasing number geared to local consumers in specific markets. We improved our pull-push activities with innovative advertising that bring new consumers to our brands and at point-of-sales offered best-in-class, high-class services both in person and online. Moreover, we did all this while reducing costs and rolling out SAP to more business units. Before I discuss the full year, let me touch on some key areas in the fourth quarter.","We were encouraged that our business in important markets remained strong despite macroeconomic concerns. Local currency sales in the U.S. and Western Europe generated solid growth, while China and travel retail climbed strong double-digits. These results demonstrate strong demand for our products. As we have done in previous 4 quarters, we increased advertising spending over last year to build momentum in future quarters.","In fiscal 2012, our operating margin reached a record 14.2%, up 120 basis points. Our excellent performance give us the confidence to raise our operating margin goals yet again. And today, we are announcing a new target of 15.5% to 16% by the end of fiscal 2015. I am proud of the many financial milestones we achieved this year which includes the following. Sales grew 10% to $9.7 billion driven by stronger business in every category and every region. We believe about 2% of the growth came from higher prices. We gained share in our distribution in many large markets including China, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and also in the important travel retail channel. We believe we also gained share in the online channel globally. These share gains were driven by the skin care and makeup categories.","By being financially disciplined, we leveraged our higher sales into even greater profit growth. Gross margin rose 140 basis points to 79.5%, helping to drive operating margin improvement. Net earnings were $901 million and diluted earnings per share grew 23% to $2.27, the highest in the company history. We generated $1.1 billion cash flow from operations which enabled us to raise the dividends 40%, repurchase shares and invest in capital projects. The company also created greater stockholder value. Our total stockholder return was nearly 10% higher than our peer group. To keep the stock price appealing to a broad range of stockholders, we split the stock 2-for-1. Virtually our entire portfolio contributed to these terrific results. Combined sales from our top 3 brands grew double-digits.","Est\u00e9e Lauder's robust growth was driven by its surging skin care business which increased sharply in every region. Clinique enjoyed a strong performance in makeup, thanks to product innovations, including foundations that offer great skin care benefits as well as Chubby Sticks lip balms. In the first for the brand, Clinique advertised its top makeup products on television which raised its profile, attracted new consumers and lifted sales. Our M-A-C brand now holds the top spot in prestige makeup in more than 10 countries including the U.S., the U.K., Canada and Mexico. We strategically expanded M-A-C's distribution by opening about 125 doors in 5 new countries, 42 international cities and 5 foreign e-commerce sites.","Our high-end brands and luxury fragrances which include La Mer, Bobbi Brown, Jo Malone, and Tom Ford, enjoyed terrific double-digit sales growth worldwide. Affluent consumers stayed loyal to our aspirational brands and our personal High-Touch services helps generate repeat business. La Mer as an example, appeals to a broad range of consumers. It became the fastest-growing skin care brand in Europe. And we believe it generated more than 1\/3 of its business from Chinese consumers around the world who covet its luxurious skin care offerings.","Looking at our business by geography. Our momentum in North America continued. Sales rose high single-digit following a record performance the previous year. U.S. prestige beauty outpaced mass brands due in part to our initiative with prestige retailers. Our company's must-have products in High-Touch service helped drive traffic in the U.S. prestige department store and specialty stores where our brands gained share in skin care and converted shoppers from mass.","Internationally, sales rose 12%. Latin America robust double-digit pace continued for the third consecutive year and was broad-based across countries, brands and categories. Our business in Brazil, one of the fastest-growing emerging markets, soared nearly 50% in local currency. M-A-C became the #1 prestige beauty brand in Brazil. At year end, it had 26 freestanding stores including 6 new ones, and they are its main channel of distribution. As a company, we are the #1 prestige player in Mexico, our largest Latin America market.","Business in Europe was solid despite struggling economies in the eurozone. In fact, 3 of our most mature markets, France, Germany and Italy, showed double-digit increases due partially to the success of more pool advertising. Our brands continued to resonate in the U.K. which had mid-single-digit growth and outperformed prestige beauty. The emerging markets in the Middle East and Africa had exceptional double-digit growth for the year. We continue to expand many of our brands throughout the region.","Travel retail again had fantastic double-digit growth, more than 4x the rate of international air passenger traffic. And for the first time, net sales topped $1 billion. Our travel retail sales have doubled in 3 years. Net sales increases came from virtually every brand. We gained 100 basis points of share in this channel. Our company became #1 in travel retail in Asia-Pacific. And in prestige makeup globally, we maintained our leadership in skin care.","Overall, Asia-Pacific sales were healthy. Although by country the picture was mixed. We experienced strong growth in Greater China, a marginal increase in Japan and weak results in Australia. China out -- overtook Japan to become our largest Asian affiliate, and our sales there climbed 28% in local currency which enabled us to gain -- to again expand our leadership position. Particularly strong was Est\u00e9e Lauder which is the #1 brand in its distribution in the country. La Mer, Origins and our online business grew sharply too. We now do business in 58 Chinese cities, 20 more than last year. And through e-commerce, we reach consumers in nearly 350 cities. Much of our strategic focus has been on skin care. And the category's sharp growth was fueled by strong innovations including Est\u00e9e Lauder's antiaging cream designed for European women several best-selling products from Clinique, a strong core business from La Mer and Origins.","Over the past year, we put more emphasis on other major product category makeup with good results.  M-A-C and Bobbi Brown enjoyed healthy growth globally and were aided by strong digital outstretch. Tom Ford Beauty launched a cosmetic line that continues to be a big hit. And Smashbox had terrific improvements as we successfully integrated brand into our affiliates and distribution.","In fragrance, our more expensive luxury scents enjoyed a receptive global audience. Jo Malone opened 50 doors worldwide including 7 in the United Kingdom, its home market. Our Aramis and Designer Fragrances Division continued to develop the core of its business, classic scents in key countries led by its Donna Karan, Tommy Hilfiger and Coach collections, and it achieved solid profit improvements.","In hair care, Aveda's new Invati line for thinning hair is a global success and the brand is learning to combine new kinds of retail opportunity with flagship salons. Bumble and bumble grew its straightening product line and opened in more Sephora stores in Europe which helped it post solid global growth. Our third hair care brand Ojon, is one piece of the portfolio that hasn't yet met our financial expectations. However, we believe several new high-performance hair repair products combined with wider retail distribution will improve its results.","Across our branded region, we worked to engage consumers through multiple platforms. Driving our global sales was a greater investment in advertising, especially on television and in digital to support our major innovation which we funded in part by reducing gifts and promotions.","In the last 3 years, we increased our spending on advertising, merchandising and sampling by $0.75 billion equal to 220 basis points yet still managed to increase our operating margin every year and invest in new capabilities. In fiscal 2012, we spent $2.5 billion as a percentage of sales, advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses climbed 80 basis points to 25.3%.","Last year, more brands used TV in more markets to promote their latest products. For instance, Clinique ran commercials in virtually every European country to advertise Even Better Clinical. In the digital space, Bobbi Brown's latest Pretty Powerful campaign strengthened its position in social media and recruited new consumers. M-A-C and La Mer which traditionally have been word-of-mouth brands, began running captivating ads in select fashion magazines this spring.","While we have pursued many avenues of growth, we also have kept an eye on costs. We made considerable progress on our cost-savings initiatives last year capping another $145 million in expenses. Since our strategy began, we have reduced our cost by $708 million. We took other steps to operate more efficiently including closing 7 distribution centers globally and plan to consolidate a fragrance-filling plant.","Our Strategic Modernization Initiative made big strides, as 13 more sites around the world went live. Today, more than 60% of the company's sales are SMI-enabled and the program has helped identify areas for further cost reduction. We expect fiscal 2013 to be the last year of big SMI expenses and then begin to generate the net benefits thereafter.","With 3 years of our strategy complete, this is a good time to reflect on how far we have come. I'm extremely proud that in this short time, our company has created blockbuster products, reignited our department store business in the United States, greatly expanded our brands' international presence, launched a new collection and acquired or licensed brands. Our brands' modernized many of their counters and became more consumer-friendly by displaying prices, consumer reviews and favorite products. These steps made our brands more approachable and desirable and helped change the face of the prestige beauty business. Our success is shown in our total stockholder return of 242% and the $15 billion increases in market cap over the last 3 years.","In 2009, we laid out our strategic plans and aimed for an operating margin of 12% to 13% by fiscal year '13. Having surpassed the top of the range by 120 basis points one year early, we are confident in our strategy and the journey ahead. Despite a much higher base, we still expect to increase sales 6% to 8% annually over the next several years.","In fiscal 2013, we believe that prestige beauty will grow by 3% to 4% and our anticipated growth rate will again be twice that pace. And importantly, we believe we can leverage our higher sales into greater earning growth, increase our margin and create additional stockholder value. We anticipate delivering strong EPS increases for the foreseeable future, continuing our status as a profitable, high-growth company. We are raising our targets even though our optimism is tempered somewhat by global economic unease, particularly in certain key areas.","We foresee further economic slowing in Western Europe and the trade is being more prudent with inventory levels. In China, we are cautious that macroeconomic conditions may impact future growth trends. But we continue to grow by reaching new consumer as we expand in more cities. Korea has seen a sharp market downturn. Australia has been facing currency issues, Japan growth is stagnant and some of our Latin American business is being impacted by government import restrictions. In the U.S., we think prestige beauty will remain solid but not at the levels we have seen recently. We have built this market's condition into our forecast and, because of our global diversification and focused strategy, believe we can sustainably outperform our competitors. And we have done this in each of the past 3 years.","Our results for fiscal 2012 show that our company is well positioned. Prestige beauty typically is resilient in downturns and the luxury sector has stayed strong. Even in past times, consumer indulges more luxuries and the new lipstick or cover-the-skin cream is often irresistible and a good value. As the only global company operating purely in prestige beauty, we sit at a unique intersection. We are more insulated than general consumer goods companies and more affordable than other kinds of luxury products, such as designer fashions, handbag or watches.","But those strengths don't fully explain our competitive advantage. The reason we have consistently been able to outperform our peers is because our robust strategy is directed on winning in the most important, fastest-growing segments of our business, which include skin care, emerging markets, travel retail, online and the U.S. luxury tier. By sharpening our consumer in size and innovation, we are leading in the critical areas that are propelling prestige beauty sales around the world. Going a step further by being financially disciplined, we have leveraged our strong sales gains into greater sustainable profitability.","Every year, as we chart the best course, we are first guided by the direction of consumer trends in broad growth opportunity for the beauty industry over the next decade. We call this long-range outlook our 10-year compass. It serves us as the backdrop for our more detailed strategy, which set our priority for the next 3 years. Our budget for the next fiscal year spell out specifically then where we plan to invest to drive our growth and capture some of the biggest opportunities.","Following these roadmaps, in fiscal 2013, our investments will span geographies, channel and product and service innovations. Emerging markets will continue to be an important growth engine. However, we are broadening our focus to encompass emerging market consumer outside of their home country. We will follow their shopping patterns wherever they live and travel. For every $1 of sales we generate in China, we find that we get $2 from Chinese consumers elsewhere, in places like Hong Kong, New York or Paris. The same holds true for Brazilian consumers and differentially even more pronounced for Middle Eastern shoppers. Since China is the fastest-growing beauty market, we plan to strategically expand distribution into more cities to reach new consumers and expect to open more than 200 points-of-sales, including some freestanding stores. La Mer plans to test new advertising vehicles in China. All told, we expect to show solid double-digit growth in the country.","Brazil holds great potential. And as Sephora expands in the market, we plan to grow with it. The first store in S\u00e3o Paulo opened a month ago, and Sephora expects to expand rapidly. E-commerce and freestanding stores are the other 2 important legs of our distribution strategy in Brazil. We also intend to build brand awareness with Brazilian shopper as they travel from Rio to Miami and New York.","The travel retail channel, spanning 1,600 locations worldwide, is expected to remain a catalyst for our growth. Sales trends play to our strengths as the greatest growth is coming from skin care and Asian travelers. We plan to open pop-up stores in busy airport locations, bringing more brands to more stores, accelerate our advertising and further leverage the channel to reinforce brand equity. Currently, worldwide travelers take over 1 billion international trips by air every year. That number is expected to climb 4% in the next 12 months, which represents slightly slower growth than fiscal 2012.","Specialty multibrand beauty stores are another fast-growth channel. Some selected brands are opening in certain booth stores in the United Kingdom this month, joining Clinique, which is a top-ranked skin care brand there. Bumble and bumble and Ojon are working with a retailer to establish the prestige hair category. Additionally, several of our brands claim to expand their business with Sephora. For example, Est\u00e9e Lauder is scheduled to test 25 Sephora doors in North America in September. Other brands, such as Origins and Smashbox, plan to leverage their U.S. success with a retailer internationally. In the digital realm, we are advancing our capability and talent to stay in the forefront of this medium, which is important for both e-commerce and communications. High-Touch is paramount in whatever we do because even on a screen, we need to be engaging and relevant. Much of our focus, as Dennis will explain in a few minutes, is one of the booming mobile universe, where consumers can buy, review and chat about products at the moment's notice. By 2015, we plan to more than triple our e- and m-commerce sites, which clearly speaks to the potential we seek.","In traditional stores, High-Touch is a major part of what distinguishes our brand from the competition, especially mass. Clinique has taken the lead in imagining service announcements, which began with its Service As You Like It options, that are being implemented in department stores globally. In its next advancement, Clinique recently unveiled its try-and-buy bar in New York City and Seoul. The lush, colorful, futuristic display incorporates a variety of sensory elements as the consumers sample products that dispense automatically. It's truly a major step forward in modernizing the brand image and putting more fun in the beauty floor.","Additionally, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is rolling out Beautiful Skin Studio mirrors to 400 North America department store doors. These countertop mirrors feature adjustable and perfect lighting, allowing consumer to find an exact foundation match. Our freestanding stores provide a wonderful expression of our brand equity.","But we realize we need to develop new and exciting retail formats and personal services to attract shoppers and enrich the customer experience. M-A-C is opening several flagship stores following the success of its Times Square store, which quickly became its highest-volume location. This fall, we'll open stores on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris and here on Fifth Avenue. We expect to open about 75 freestanding stores globally for all our brands, including some that are opening store for the first time. For instance, in Singapore, Lab Series recently opened our first store that targets men.","Our company prides itself on constant, state-of-the-art innovation to stay a step ahead of consumers' wants and needs. We will continue to focus on bigger deals rooted in breakthrough technologies and local consumer insights. We believe we have succeeded with La Mer Moisturizing Soft Cream, which arrives in stores next month and is expected to be the brand's biggest introduction ever.","Fiscal year 2013 should be an exciting year for launching and expanding several brands. AERIN, a new luxury beauty line created by Aerin Lauder, debuts shortly in upscale stores in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The line offers modern, effortless beauty, which reflects Aerin's point of view based on years of beauty experience. AERIN will be sold at select Est\u00e9e Lauder counters, alongside the high-end Re-Nutriv line. Marni, our new fragrance from the Italian fashion house, is slated to roll out in the spring and is positioned in the fastest-growing segment of fragrance, the luxury end.","Zegna. We launched a luxury collection around the holiday in limited distribution followed by a high-end fragrance next spring, timed to Father's Day that will target male consumers globally. Smashbox, which we acquired in 2010, is set for a rapid international expansion. We plan to enter 80 booth stores as well as more Douglas and Sephora stores in Europe. It also plans to enter Brazil, by launching in Sephora.","Generally, we expect to implement another major deployment of SMI, bringing its capabilities to more than 10 additional business units and affiliates, including China, Hong Kong and France. We also plan to continue building our capabilities in other important areas, such as consumer insights, digital technology, research and development and IT systems.","Before I close, on behalf of the company, I want to thank Rick for his tremendous effort over his 26-year career at The Este\u00e9 Lauder Companies. During his last 12 years as CFO, Rick instilled greater financial discipline, built a terrific team and contributed to the company achieving record results. He has been instrumental in driving our winning strategy and positioning us for a solid future. He's also been a close partner to William and me, and I'm pleased that he will stay on through the end of the fiscal year to advise me on special projects and ensure a smooth transition.","I look forward to welcoming Tracey Travis, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who'll join us next week after 7 years as CFO of Ralph Lauren Corporation. Tracey brings a wealth of financial experience and deep knowledge of consumers product companies. We are excited to start working with her, as we continue advancing our strategy in the years ahead.","Lastly, I want to thank all of the employees of The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, who have worked so hard to accelerate our leadership in the global prestige beauty. I'm confident in their exceptional talents and deep passion. They are our inspiration for tomorrow's beauty innovation that will be critical to creating profitable growth for many years to come.","Now I will turn the call over to Dennis McEniry.","Dennis McEniry","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I worked in the e-commerce space for about 17 years and joined The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies 11 years ago. I have been President of our online division since May 2003, where my team and I have the responsibility for the global online P&L, as well as development of our brand marketing sites around the world.","Our online business is critical to the company's strategy of winning in high-growth channels. We were the first global prestige beauty company to go online. And that headstart has helped us become the industry leader. Our online sales have grown rapidly over the years. And this highly profitable business is margin-accretive to the company overall. We will continue investing in High-Touch services online, new technologies, marketing tools and retailer partnerships to further enhance our prospects. The online channel's growing importance makes it an integral part of the company's 10-year compass. And we see it as a key engine of the company's future growth.","During my time here, our online efforts have expanded dramatically from just 4 sites in the U.S. in 2001 to about 340 marketing and e-commerce sites today in more than 50 countries. My team also works with our retailers to support their 76 sites around the world that offer our products.","In fiscal 2012, we launched e- and m-commerce sites in 6 new markets, for a total of 15 now. And this year, we plan on selling in an additional 6 more countries around the world. Throughout our history, we have experienced excellent sales momentum, illustrated by 24% growth in fiscal 2012. We achieved strong double-digit gains in every region for our brand sites, retailer partner site and practically every brand. We expect this pace to continue over the next few years. Wider distribution helped drive sales growth, and also sales grew nicely on a comp basis. In the U.S., where we began selling online over 14 years ago, our sales grew a healthy 20%. They also rose fast in markets experiencing general economic slowdowns. Online sales grew 34% in the U.K., 55% in Germany and 40% in China.","Online has grown tremendously in many ways. Sales have tripled in the last 5 years, with compounded annual growth of over 27%. Six of our brands were recognized last year as having among the highest digital IQ in a benchmarking study of beauty companies. Our big brands are winning online and represent more than 1\/2 of our division sales. Consumers have signed up to receive over 1 billion emails from our brands this year. And this year, our sites will host 250 million visits from consumers around the world.","Skin care is our top-selling category online, followed closely by makeup. Our hair care business is small, but we are encouraged by trends. Aveda and Bumble and bumble, generate a higher percentage of their total sales from the online channel in the markets where they are available than our other brands. Fragrance sales are small online as a portion of the mix of business because consumers can't experience the scent. All categories experienced strong double-digit growth online.","One of the most exciting developments in the -- is the growing adoption of mobile devices worldwide. We have seen double-digit month-on-month increases in mobile traffic in every region. In the U.S., many of our brands are generating more than 15% of their online sales from mobile devices and m-commerce sales are growing much faster than sales made on PCs. In Japan, an astounding 2\/3 of M-A-C's online sales come from mobile phones. We are leveraging the growing mobile adoption in emerging markets, such as China, India and South Africa, where mobile phones are leapfrogging PC technology.","As a result of mobile's growing importance, we are quickly moving to deploy m-commerce sites as well as mobile and tablet-friendly versions of our marketing sites for our brands around the world. Our execution is paying off and allowing our consumers to engage with our brands wherever they may be. Mobile devices even play a role at our counters, where consumers are using their phones to research our products or find the latest hairstyles in our salons. Another benefit of the online channel is that it allows us to reach consumers where we don't have brick-and-mortar retail. In China, for instance, more than 2\/3 of our online sales come from cities where we have no traditional retail presence.","Essential to the company's success has been bringing High-Touch service from our counters to our sites. In North America, online shoppers receive advice via live chat, email or telephone from beauty advisors who work at our counters, not from traditional call center service agents. Each brand offers its own unique High-Touch experience, giving consumers the best possible service online. We are rolling out these services to other markets starting in the U.K. Additionally, we are adapting High-Touch to the mobile platform and developing exciting innovations that are expected to launch in the coming year.","Our brand websites are an integral part of the company's marketing efforts and have become important expressions of brand equity. Our strategy is to make them digital flagships with unique services and engaging content. To that end, in fiscal 2012, we redesigned sites for 4 of our brands and are redesigning 5 more this year, including Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and M-A-C.","We were also able to garner important consumer insights. As consumers give feedbacks through product ratings and reviews, we use this information to improve products and packaging. Consumers also like to get credible feedback from other consumers, who are an important influence in buying beauty products. Having brand websites around the world allows us to better understand differences in consumer preferences. And we tailor our marketing and merchandising efforts appropriately.","The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, for instance, features skin care on its sites in China and has a more balanced product assortment across skin care, makeup and fragrance in the U.S. Our online efforts also helped support our traditional retail channels. The consumer shopping journey often begins online to do product research, followed by a visit to a brick-and-mortar store. We also use our sites and retailer sites to promote in-store services and special events.","Online is an important vehicle for interacting with our consumers. And we've made great strides in digital marketing and social media. All told, our brands have more than 11 million Facebook fans in 40 countries. M-A-C leads our social media efforts. It doubled both its fan base on Facebook and its views on YouTube in the past year. Our company's emphasis on local relevance is also integral to social media. Our brands are experiencing great engagement on local social platforms, such as Sina Weibo in China and mixi in Japan, as well as Twitter, Pinterest and Tumblr around the world.","The future of our online business looks bright. Over the coming years, we plan to launch e- and m-commerce in dozens of new markets, both alone and with retail partners, as well as establish more brands online in countries where we currently have a presence. With a growing middle class, particularly in emerging markets, we expect greater traffic on our sites. In fiscal 2013, the online division is expected to account for about 5% of the total company sales. Yet in markets where we've had e-commerce for many years, online sales represent close to 9% of the total. With our historical results and the strong momentum we foresee, we believe our online sales can double in 5 years. Given the high profitability of the business, the more we grow, the more the company's margins will, too.","Our considerable success online is made possible because our company has great brands with innovative products that enjoy strong consumer demand. I want to thank all of the people in the online division around the world, whose dedication, hard work and the ability to embrace the constantly changing landscape is second to none. I would also like to acknowledge the leadership of William Lauder, who had the foresight to launch our online efforts 16 years ago, in the very early days of brand adoption of the Internet. Now I will turn the call over to Rick.","Richard W. Kunes","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. A quick reminder. My commentary reflects our results and expectations before restructuring and other charges. I will quickly cover the highlights of fiscal 2012, and then discuss our outlook for fiscal 2013. As Fabrizio noted, we once again made significant progress in the third year of our strategic plan. We exceeded sales and profit targets despite macroeconomic challenges in some areas of the world, demonstrating the resilience of our prestige beauty category, the strength of our strategy, our deep execution capabilities and the strength of our channel and geographic diversification.","In our fourth quarter, we turned in terrific local currency sales growth of 12%, above recent trends, due in part to the prior year $42 million sales shift into the third quarter related to the SAP rollout. After adjusting for the shift, sales growth at constant rates was 10%, with all regions and major product categories contributing. Net earnings for the quarter rose 39%, to $69.2 million, compared with $49.7 million in the prior year. And diluted EPS was $0.17, $0.01 above the top end of our guidance.","Our press release gives all the reported figures for regions and categories and a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We consider non-GAAP measures useful for the analysis to help you understand the underlying growth of our business. My discussion also adjusts for the sales and income shift on the SAP rollout.","For the quarter, sales in skin care rose 9% in local currency. Skin care grew in each region, reflecting our continued global focus on this category. In makeup, local currency sales rose 12%. Results were driven by solid gains from our makeup artist brands. Our fragrance business rose 11% in local currency. Luxury brands Tom Ford and Jo Malone generated double-digit growth. In hair care, sales grew 9% in local currency. Aveda benefited from the success of the Invati product line, as Fabrizio mentioned, as well as increased salon distribution.","Geographically in the quarter, our Americas region sales grew 9% in local currency, with virtually every brand growing, many at solid double-digits. Sales were robust across the region. The United States rose 6%, Latin America grew 26%, led by exceptional results from M-A-C and Brazil, while Canada was up double-digits. From a channel perspective, our North American sales in department stores grew 6%. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, sales climbed 13% in local currency. Travel retail rose 26% on strong results from virtually every brand. Our U.K. sales rose mid-single-digits. Western European countries grew 9% with nearly all rising double-digits, partially offset by continued weakness in Spain. The Middle East and Africa grew nearly 20%. Asia-Pacific region sales rose 8% in local currency. China grew 20% on 6% like-door growth and expansion of brands, doors and cities. Chinese travel was a major contributor to the 37% growth in Hong Kong. Our business was also strong in Southeast Asia, while Australia and Korea remained weak. Japan experienced 9% growth against a prior year period that was affected by the aftermath of the tsunami.","Our gross margin improved 120 basis points, to 80.5%. Most of the increase came from positive mix and pricing of 90 basis points. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 200 basis points, to 76.2%. Advertising, merchandising and sampling rose 100 basis points during the quarter, on top of substantial investments in both the prior quarter and the prior year quarter. And higher impairment charges added 60 basis points.","Turning to our full year. Sales rose 10% and currency had very little impact. Net earnings were $901 million, compared with $742.5 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.27, 23% higher than the $1.85 reported last year. As you can see from our press release, every region and product category contributed to the outstanding sales improvement this year. Gross margin expanded 140 basis points to a record 79.5%. This improvement was primarily due to favorable mix and pricing, which together added 140 basis points. For the year, our PMT initiatives improved cost of goods by $80 million.","Operating expenses as a percentage of sales continued to reflect our strategic priorities. In total, operating expenses rose 20 basis points to 65.3%. Our strategic investment in advertising, merchandising and sampling added 80 basis points. Higher stock-based compensation costs added about 50 basis points. Lower selling and shipping costs of about 50 basis points, lower impairment charges of 20 basis points and a favorable currency of 10 points partially offset these increases.","Our cost-savings initiatives reduced expenses by $65 million. This is the third year in a row we have increased investment in advertising, merchandising and sampling, capabilities, new freestanding stores and the SMI implementation. At the same time, we were able to fund these activities by shifting promotion expense from cost of goods, reducing selling, distribution and administrative costs and maintaining global discipline around the growth of our employee costs through our strict productivity metrics throughout the organization.","Since fiscal 2009, total operating expenses have decreased 220 basis points. And as Fabrizio noted, in that same time frame, we have also increased advertising, merchandising and sampling 220 basis points. This translates to a reduction of all other operating expenses of 440 basis points.  After our SMI program is essentially complete, we expect to realize a new wave of cost savings.","Operating income rose 20%, to $1.37 billion, and operating margin rose 120 basis points, to a record 14.2%, compared to last year. Net interest expense declined by $2.8 million, to $61.1 million, reflecting the replacement of senior notes with lower cost commercial paper and the effective tax rate for the year was 31.7%. We recorded $63 million in charges associated with restructuring in fiscal '12, which is equal to $0.11 per share for the year.","Days sales outstanding increased to 42 days, compared with 41 days at this time last year. Inventory days improved to 180, compared with 188 days last year. For simplicity and to match calculations many of you perform, we have always reported the inventory as it relates to cost of goods. However, these figures include about 15 days of inventory related to promotional materials, such as samples and testers, whose costs flow through operating expenses rather than cost of goods. Our days of inventory restated for this impact were 165 at year end. Inventory days are likely to remain in line with fiscal 2012, so we can maintain good service levels while we continue to implement SMI.","We generated a record $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, primarily reflecting the improvements in earnings. We spent $421 million for capital projects this year, as we continued to invest in systems, retail stores and counters. We returned substantial cash to shareholders. During the year, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares of our stock for $593 million and used $204 million for dividends, which reflected a 40% increase. Our organization has become more financially disciplined and we have succeeded in planning more prudently. We have maintained our productivity guidelines to drive operating expense leverage, allowing us to invest more if sales targets are exceeded.","This business model has proven effective and is reflected in our goals and targets for the coming years. Our stated goal is to grow our top line at least 1% faster than the growth in global prestige beauty, which we believe will be around 3% to 4% in fiscal '13. Our sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 8% in local currency. This scenario assumes that we see increasing weakness in certain Western European and Asian economies and a somewhat slower U.S. prestige beauty growth rate.","We continue to build our capabilities to price more strategically and at least cover inflation. Our sales estimates for fiscal 2013 include approximately 2 percentage points of growth from pricing, which when coupled with ongoing savings initiatives should drive substantial gross margin improvement. Based on current exchange rates and the forecasted strengthening of the dollar over the course of our fiscal year, we estimate a negative currency translation impact of about 3.5 percentage points on our full year sales growth. Our estimate assumes weighted average rates of $1.20 for the euro, $1.51 for the pound and JPY 81 for the yen.","We expect to benefit from our PMT initiatives and other cost-containment efforts. However, although we see good leverage in local currency, we expect less leverage on a reported basis, as sales growth is curtailed by currency translation and our costs are disproportionately in U.S. dollars. Additionally, we continue to invest to build capabilities and strengthen our infrastructure for greater efficiency. This is the second peak year of significant investment in SMI, as we roll out the program to another large group of affiliates next January. We continue to upgrade systems for human resources, point-of-sale and consumer relations management. We expect to invest in store expansion, modernization and the rollout of High-Touch initiatives. And again, we plan to shift spending from promotion to advertising, especially digital and television.","By the end of fiscal '13, we expect to have generated total savings from our initial program of between $760 million and $785 million, significantly more than the $450 million to $550 million that we originally projected. With the current resizing and restructuring program drawing to a close, our Program Management Team, or PMT, office continues to identify the next wave of savings in areas such as supply chain, advertising and promotion, IT, selling, lower product returns and further efficiencies in our business processes. Many of these opportunities are enabled and supported by the SMI project. We expect to report operating margin expansion of about 70 to 90 basis points this year, which includes a negative impact of currency translation of approximately 20 to 30 basis points.","Recently, we issued $500 million of new long-term senior notes. We will use about 1\/2 of these proceeds to redeem the 7.75% senior notes due next year. And the remainder gives us the flexibility for share repurchases, acquisitions, debt repayment or general business needs. As a result, in our first quarter, we expect to record a pretax charge of approximately $20 million, equal to $0.03 per share, for the extinguishment of debt. Our fiscal 2013 tax rate is planned at 31% to 33%.","Restructuring and other charges are expected to be about $10 million in fiscal '13, equal to about $0.02 a share. Diluted EPS for fiscal 2013 is expected to be between $2.44 and $2.56, up between 8% and 13% compared to the prior year. This range excludes the onetime charge of $0.03 related to the repurchase of debt, as well as restructuring charges. Depending on the mix of exchange rate movements, the 3.5% negative currency impact on our top line equates to about $0.10 to $0.12 of EPS. Excluding this foreign exchange impact, our EPS is expected to rise by 12% to 18%.","Now looking at other financial metrics. We expect inventories to build during the first half of our year as we prepare to go live with SAP in a large group of the businesses -- of business units. We expect year-end inventory days to be about the same as fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2014 and beyond, we should begin to see inventories improve more aggressively. We plan to generate about $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations and expect to use between $475 million and $500 million for capital spending.","Our uses for free cash flow remain the same. First and foremost, we invest back in the business. Second, we continue to search for small to mid-sized acquisitions that make good strategic and financial sense. Third, we plan to repurchase shares and have about 15 million shares remaining in our authorization. Lastly, our board periodically reviews our dividend policy, where we have said that we have room to grow the dividend given our relatively low payout ratio and yield.","Our first quarter is up against a very tough comparison with prior year sales growth of 18%. Despite weakening business in several markets and expected slowing of global prestige beauty growth, we should see some momentum from our recent advertising increases and new product launches. We are planning for sales to grow 5% to 7% in local currency. Currency translation is likely to have a significant impact and could hinder reported growth by about 4.5 percentage points. EPS for the quarter is estimated to come in between $0.71 and $0.77, which includes a negative currency effect of approximately $0.04. Excluding the impact of currency, EPS is expected to rise about 6% to 14%.","Similar to last year, we plan to go live with SAP at our next wave of affiliates in January. To mitigate any potential short-term business interruption associated with the rollout, we expect that some retailers, primarily in Asia-Pacific, will increase their orders in our second quarter. This year, the business units affected represent substantially greater sales volume than last year's wave. Therefore, we expect the shift in orders to be much higher as well. We will provide an estimate as we get closer and have a better indication from the retailers.","In closing, I want to welcome Tracey to our company and our best-in-class financial organization, a terrific global team who worked hard to strengthen our financial discipline and achieve cost savings. My thanks go out to the entire finance team for the dedication and support they have shown me these last 12 years. I want to also extend my appreciation to the Lauder family and Fabrizio for helping to make such a rewarding career possible. I look forward to working with Tracey to effect a smooth and seamless transition.","Lastly, I would also like to thank all of you for your support and confidence over the years. We've come a long way, and I'm happy to note that I'm leaving the company in a very strong financial health and on the path for further sustained profitability. I wish you all the best. And that concludes my comments for today. And we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Nik Modi, UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The question is really about share gains. Fabrizio, can you provide any kind of perspective on kind of where you think you're sourcing your share gains from? And what I'm trying to get at is oftentimes the share situation has just looked upon the largest players, which happen to be publicly traded. Can you talk about what's going on with some of the smaller players and if you're seeing any benefits from any share gains there?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. I think we are gaining shares depending by country, by channel, frankly, with different source. And we are also -- in some channels, we are gaining share from the small players. But there are some channels, where, frankly, we are getting shares from the big player. Let me give you examples. In the fastest-growing channels, like travel retail or online, we are definitely getting share from the big players. And on the contrary, in some more traditional channels and in some other areas where we are growing but we are not very big into a market share yet, like specialty doors, in this case, we are taking share also from small players. So it's a mixed picture. And the other important aspect is that we continue to source business, in general, from mass, meaning that as you have seen, this is the second consecutive year where, in general, prestige in several countries around the world is growing faster than the mass. And I believe this is also the result of our strategy and the strategy of some of our big competitors, which is going through continuous improved innovation, continuous improved services in the prestige environment and stronger advertising of these better products and better services, which is leading more and more consumers to be interested in our space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty, BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'm wondering what you still see, Fabrizio, is the big opportunities for the company for change after the SMI investments have been made. What parts of the organization do you think still haven't been touched enough or the future looks different now than it did 3 years ago?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. There are several areas where we have only scratched the surface of improvement because of lack of systems and lack of a unified way to look at the opportunity across the globe. So first of all, we still can improve dramatically the service level to our retailers. That, in turn, will generate greater sales because we will lose less volume from out of stock and less volume from delays or lack of being able -- or not being able to deliver. And obviously, most importantly, we will get less returns. As you know, with still a significant amount of money that we use every year to manage returns, to destroy products that is very inefficient, obviously, and we have opportunity to improve. Second area is we can add more responsive supply chain and better cost across our global supply chain and, in general, across our operations, including the interface between supply chain and product innovation and product development. Third, we can definitely improve our inventory management and bring them to lower levels and, in turn, get lower obsolescence and lower distractions. And we can move our turns from 3 to 2 possibly over the years. Fourth, we can improve our entire procurement. We have done some good progress there, but we have a long way to go. And so far, we're already 3x our original expectations. And frankly, I believe there is much more once the systems will allow us to work globally in the correct way. Then we are going to further reduce our points and -- points of inventory of warehouses. And this will, in turn, reduce further over time our distribution cost. We will support also many processes that today are very much people-intensive. And so this will continue to allow us to grow, improve our productivity. And finally, just in general, better availability of information that from my experience can create an even better allocation of resources. And since we are spending a lot of money in OpEx, as you know, at least allocating this money correctly and generating better return, we would still further improve our efficiencies. So that's in summary. And obviously, we have many more details that we are working on. And as Rick mentioned, the PMT, which is the group inside the company which has driven the delivery of the value of our restructuring while completing our restructuring, is also initiating a very deep and in-depth analysis of the next opportunity that I just mentioned.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser, Caris.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","You mentioned a lot of different numbers and objectives and everything. And I'm sorry if you mentioned this, but can you give us an update in terms of what you're selling expense ratio was in FY '12 and how that compared to FY '11? And then can you also talk about if, like, if you expect a trend of reduction of that going forward, given that you're sort of changing some of your selling methods there at retail? And can you update us on the initiative to expand the As You Like It selling format? Is that completed in terms of all over the world? And are you expanding that into other brands? Or can you just talk about that whole issue of selling expense and efficiencies there?","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. Let me start just framing the strategic issue, and then we'll give you all the specific numbers. First of all, the High-Touch services, like the one you mentioned from Clinique, Service As You Like It, is expanded by brand, meaning Service As You Like It is a Clinique point of view of services that is Lauder, La Mer, other brands that have different point of view. So what we are expanding globally is a specific High-Touch service model for each of our brands. And we are very advanced. But the point is not that we -- once we finished expansion, that's not the end of it, because now we are working with the concept of service innovation, meaning like each of our brand launch new products every year, our brands have people thinking what is the next service that a consumer wants to make our products even more exciting. And this happens on every brand. So you will see a continuous rollout of services. Now some of these services require capital, like the one that require counter restructuring. But many,  I would say the majority of them, do not require capital, just require a good execution using our existing resources. In terms of selling efficiencies, we have -- we will continue to improve our efficiency in-store, which, as you can imagine, they are linked, that sales per door. So the better sales we sell per door, the more efficient in sales expenses we become in general. Then the total company sales expense is also subject to mix in the sense the more we grow in segments, where sales expenses are lower, like specialty doors or like online that we are discussing today, the more the mix improves in this area. Now I'd like Rick to give you some specifics.","Richard W. Kunes","Sure. And -- so in the past year, our selling expense improved about 40 basis points versus the year before. In the last 3 years, it's over a 200 basis point improvement. And as Fabrizio said, the opportunity is really to set productivity metrics by door and by counter, by brand to really improve those numbers. And there is a mix effect, as Fabrizio mentioned. We also have, in a sense, the other way is that as we expand our retail stores, which have a slightly higher selling expense than our normal business, that works the other way. But we see it as an opportunity and we intend to go after it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley, Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","My questions are about growth in the U.S. You said it would slow. I think your sales in North America have grown 9% to 10% over the last couple of years. Is it fair to assume something like 5% to 6% for this year? And another part of this question is, you've pretty consistently grown but lost share in U.S. department stores in makeup and fragrance. You've gained share in skin care, which I know is your focus. But are you comfortable with growing at slower rate in the market in makeup and fragrance, or might that change going ahead?","Fabrizio Freda","No. You said it very well. U.S. market has been growing very, very fast in prestige in the last couple of years. And this is also because of all what we have done, frankly, of moving consumers from mass to prestige. Now what we are seeing is that we do not expect the market to continue a double-digit growth overall, but still we expect the market will grow mid to high digit. So very solid market, but maybe not double-digit. That's as far as the market is concerned. We have been growing very well, as you said. We have been growing market share in skin care that was our focus. Frankly, we are doing very well also in makeup because what you don't see in the NPD numbers is the M-A-C freestanding stores, which are a very successful part of our business. And we have been losing share in fragrances because we have been cleaning up our fragrance activity from heavy promotion or unprofitable parts of our activities. And this obviously is subject to change. We believe we'll go back growing in fragrances as well once we have reached the level of profitability and when the business model will be ready for that. And I think we are close to the moment where we should see growth also in fragrances in the U.S., in the sense that in the next months, we'll start progressing in that direction. And then probably in fiscal year '14, we'll see the most of the impact of the activity we are preparing. And also I wanted to add, we are growing very largely in hair care because while it's true that our Ojon brand is not yet hitting the way it will, I believe, but our Aveda and Bumble brands are really growing nicely. And we are enjoying a development of this category as well in the U.S. The last thing I want to say on the U.S., by the way, this is an opportunity, I think one of our most successful channels in the U.S. has been online. And online, we have been growing very, very fast. I would like Dennis to say a few words on the success of our online business in the U.S.","Dennis McEniry","So online business in the U.S. is about -- we expect it this year to be about 9% of the total U.S. business. And we've been growing in the low 20% year-over-year for many years. And it's a very strong business for us in the U.S. And that U.S. business has allowed us to bring that model successfully to other markets around the world. So the capabilities that we've built in the U.S. have been kind of the core of what we've been able to do and roll that out to Asia-Pacific and Europe.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Do you know how much of your U.S. business has been generated by the Chinese, Brazilian and Middle East consumer coming here?","Fabrizio Freda","No. I don't have a number, unfortunately. I wish I have systems that are so sophisticated to allow to answer this question specifically, but is significant, in the sense that we know, for example, in some stores where we have this information, like some M-A-C stores in New York, we know that Brazilians could be even 1\/3 of sales. But obviously, not in all stores but in a few stores, where there are a lot of tourists. And the same for Chinese in California or in the West part of the country. So can be significant, but is significant in the cities and in the areas, where there are a lot of tourists and travelers. It's less significant obviously, on the average of the country.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Do you have any interest in celebrity fragrances, which have been growing?","Fabrizio Freda","No.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","No? Why?","Fabrizio Freda","Because our expertise and our focus is in different areas of the fragrance market, which, by the way, are also growing very fast, like high-end prestige fragrances that the lists in our model are more profitable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante, Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I have a clarification, if I may, and then my question. The clarification has to do whether your guidance for the September quarter has any benefit from the timing of shipments versus the December quarter, as has been the case in the past. And then my question has to do with, if you talk about the weakening of the consumer environment, which is consistent with what we had seen with retail sales in the U.S., only up 2%. And then your sales guidance is the same as last year, 6% to 8%. So it seems to me that your budget relative to last year is a bit more risky. And that the one key difference seems to be that you are pushing distribution more aggressively. So are you putting inventory at risk at a time when consumers are retrenching? And also if you can tell us how many freestanding stores you have in fiscal 2011. How many did you leave open by 2012? How many stores are you planning to open in fiscal '13? And what are the margins of these stores?","Richard W. Kunes","Javier, that's about 20 questions in that one. But we'll do our best to answer them. So first, there is no timing impact on our first quarter of shipments. The growth guidance that we have is just year-over-year growth. And actually, growth over a prior year quarter, that grew, I think, 18%. So we're pretty comfortable with the first year's growth. As far as the budget goes, when we were at this time frame last year, there were risks that were out there as well. And quite honestly, the 6% to 8% guidance that we gave then, we just had a good year. We were very successful with some of our new launches. We grew our business. We expanded some distribution. So I mean, we had a great year this year, which allowed us to exceed those numbers. We go into this fiscal year with certainly a level of uncertainty that we're all aware of that's out there. But we're comfortable with our 6% to 8% guidance, and we think that it's built as solidly as our budget was last year. It's just that we'll have to see what develops over the course of the year. But we're comfortable with the guidance that we've given.","Fabrizio Freda","Also I just want to mention one thing for simplicity is that last year, the year we just closed, our analysis of the global market, the prestige market, grew 5%. We are saying that we believe our estimate for the next 12 months is 3% to 4%. In other words, our concern about North America being solid but a little bit slower, China being solid but slower or Western Europe being actually in trouble, our concern reflects into our assumption, which is a capital point. So global market growth less than we have seen so far. And now obviously, if this will happen, we believe we can deliver the 6% to 8%. If this will not happen, meaning if the market will grow better than 3%, we may deliver more. If the market will grow worse than 3%, then, obviously, we will have something at risk and we'll need to find offsets within our activity as we do every time, where we have a risk to manage. So that's as simple as the way we look at it.","Richard W. Kunes","Yes. Regarding the number of freestanding stores, we have 800 freestanding stores versus 750 last year, and we're going to add about 75 new doors in fiscal 2013. And I hope that covers most of your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder, Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'll stay on the sort of multiple questions on the stores. And specifically related to the travel retail, can you talk a little bit more about the increased push here for some of your own branded stores in this channel? And then maybe a little bit more detail, Rick, on those incremental stores, how those break down by brands and regions.","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. While Rick will open all our books to look for the source by region and brands, let me take the travel retail one. So in travel retail, as you know, traffic has been increasing in the last year, around 5%. The information we have is traffic for the next 12 months is projected to be 4.2%, so a bit lower than that. The good thing for us, I mean, is that where this traffic is slowing is Western Europe, as Asia remains pretty high-traffic growth. I think the number is about 10%. And the Americas is also pretty solid, while the Western European traffic is the one that gets strongly offset. But as you know we are the market leader in Asia. We are pretty strong in Americas. And we are the only the fourth or the fifth company in Europe. So we are less affected by our competition on where the traffic is going to slow, assuming those assumptions will prove to be true. The other thing we are seeing in travel retail is that we are learning really to manage the travelers as the consumer across all our business rather than only having travel retail like a separate division. What I mean, we really manage through corridors, we look at the consumers from Shanghai to Hong Kong in their travels to Paris in the airports, and we try to coordinate initiative activity. We look at market spending now in a more coordinated fashion. The level of collaboration between our outstanding travel retail division and the various affiliates has increased dramatically, allowing us very clear visibility for best resource allocations on the travelers around the world, which I think is developing into another competitive advantage. And then what you mentioned, which is yes, we have a beautiful portfolio of brands to seek the new needs of travel retail because travel retail growing mainly driven by makeup and skin care. And obviously, our portfolio of brands fits the current trends fantastically well. Now Rick?","Richard W. Kunes","I'm sorry, Tim, I'm going to disappoint you a little bit. Out of the 75 doors, I know that 35 are M-A-C. They are spread, quite honestly, geographically around the world. But if you want, if you give Dennis a call sometime after our conference call, we'll be able to give you the other details, where the rest are.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga, Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just wanted to really take advantage of Dennis being on the call this morning and talk a little bit more about e-com and digital if we can. Some of the things that I think that are very unique to prestige beauty and were unique to you guys is you have very high loyalty factor and the ability to control your distribution. So I'm wondering how you would respond to this crowd this morning in terms of talking about maybe the role of Amazon and all the related beauty-dot-comers out there in terms of what it is that you do, as well as maybe addressing some of the flash sales sites and how you partner with some of the digital content providers, like HSN and QVC. And then maybe just a bigger picture, broader issue here is you guys stand for service. And the definition of customer service is changing in a post dot-com sort of world. And there's really a rise and move towards same-day delivery. How could you meet that part of your customer's experience and meeting her demand for service?","Dennis McEniry","So just some general comments. First of all, starting with your last points on service. High-Touch service for us has been one of the hallmarks in the way we've built the business online. We staff our customer service areas with the real beauty advisors and makeup artists, hair salon specialists, et cetera. So that is a key thing that we do. And as I mentioned earlier, we're rolling that out to each of the markets around the world. In terms of service delivery, we track that very carefully. We have one of the highest speed-to-deliveries. So from order to the door, we track that in each market. And we are doing very well there. We are planning on testing same-day delivery in key megacities around the world. And that's upcoming. In terms of other distribution choices, flash sales, et cetera, our brands have experimented with that. It, frankly, is not a key part of our strategy online, although we are constantly testing out all of these new models, and that's a core of what we do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara, Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The question's on advertising, I guess, and, I guess, one clarification. Did you say you expect to grow sales 6% to 8% over the next several years? I thought maybe you said that. And then the other question is, so relative to the 3% to 4% market growth rate, right, you're saying 6% to 8%. Last quarter, you talked a little bit about advertising not having to go up in these huge increments forever, right? So I was wondering if you could pull that together, right? I mean, what's the fiscal '13 thought process around how much more advertising needs to go up for fiscal '13 and beyond? And then, again, is that a several year 6% to 8% rate that you're out looking for?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. Again, let me answer the overall question, then Rick will give you the specific numbers in a second. Yes, I did say for several years. So 6% to 8%, on one side, is our specific guideline for fiscal year '13. On the other side, 6% to 8% is also what I already said, I think, for sure in CAGNY. That was our long-term view, which was coming from us believing that the long-term, the market will grow around 5% and we will be able to grow always at least 1 point ahead of the market. That, with that assumption, will translate into a 6% to 8% power over several years. That's what I meant. But the specific guideline of 6% to 8% next year, I mean, in fiscal year '13 is based actually on the assumption of the 3% to 4% market growth in fiscal year '13 and our ability in that moment of time of our growth to grow double the market. On advertising, yes, we are going to further increase advertising in absolute term over time. If the advertising will increase in terms of percentage, obviously, this will slow down. The percentage increase will slow down over time gradually. But we will continue to look for ways to turn savings in areas which, in our opinion, are less efficient, like promotion, into advertising. So the continuous increase of advertising will not translate necessarily in an increase of overall OpEx but may translate into a better mix of spending in our portfolio in the future. Rick?","Richard W. Kunes","Yes. No, I think you said it perfectly, Fabrizio. We have 2 initiatives for savings in the advertising area, and one is on efficiency, which, as Fabrizio says, how can we spend our dollars better, wiser? Can we use less service providers, if you will, around the creation of some of our advertising? Is there ways to be more efficient in the way we spend our money? And the second initiative that's under way is around effectiveness. So of the advertising that we do, are we reaching the right consumer? Are we running the right ads in the right locations in the right media, if you will, that gives us the best effectiveness of the dollars that we spend? So we will see the percentage growth and percentage of sales start to slow down somewhat. But we think that underlining that will be a much more effective and much more efficient spend of those dollars.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Wu, Telsey Advisory Group.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","I have just some questions for Dennis. Dennis, you mentioned that online sales could double over the next 5 years. And I was wondering how much could come from the U.S. versus the newer markets, such as China, and the resulting margin dynamics there. And could you also comment on how much of the online business is replenishment versus new customer purchases and perhaps talk about sort of the biggest challenges that you face of driving stronger sales of new customer purchases and how you plan to address them?","Dennis McEniry","Sure. So a couple of points. One, we see the U.S. growth being very strong for the years to come, the next several years. We also -- however, though, as we open up more markets and we build our capabilities in more markets, we see a growing percentage of our mix coming from international sales. And that's been happening now for the last 3 or 4 years, as we open up markets around the world. China, frankly, can be one of the biggest markets for us in the future. It is expected that in 2015, China will become the largest e-commerce market in the world, surpassing the U.S. for the first time. So the U.S. has always been the largest e-commerce market. And by 2015, it's expected that China will become the #1 e-commerce market in the world, and we are aggressively pursuing that opportunity. In terms of replenishment and new sales, it kind of differs by category. Fragrance for us is more of a replenishment market. However, for skin care and makeup, our strong brand launches are always equally done well online. And so new purchases, for instance, for the M-A-C, Lauder, Clinique brands always work outstanding online. And so we see both new consumers and new product launches do well. And frankly, for fragrance, it's more of a replenishment market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I have 3 questions. The first is a shorter-term one. You've talked about the risks in the environment. But I was just wondering if anything has deteriorated in July-August relative to the fourth quarter. The second question is if the rest of the world grows faster than the U.S., all these different channels, because you've had this unusually fast growth in North America, is that actually good for margins because it's a lower-margin area? Or are there other factors at play because of your manufacturing here? And then just finally, within travel retail, which is now over $1 billion, can you -- do you have a sense of how much of that is incremental business that you wouldn't otherwise get in the local territories? And is there a rise in competition in pricing, given how high margins are?","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. I'll answer the first and the third and let Rick answer the one on margins. So in July-August, frankly, what we have seen is what we told you. And in a sense, the areas that we have illustrated being worrying, like Western Europe, Korea, Australia is slightly softer U.S. growth, although strong. Those are exactly what we're seeing also in July. So I will not say there's a big difference between what we saw maturing in the last quarter and what we are seeing in July and is the same trends. On the other side, there is nothing improving, the rest of the world, we just told you in July-August. In terms of your travel retail question, the -- we don't believe that there is more competition on price. Actually, the pricing in travel retail is already very interesting for the consumer worldwide and is completely linked to the prices in the various affiliates. So there is a connection. So the competition on travel retail depends really from the strengths of the brands in the country of origin of the traveler. So the real core investment for building travel retail is to build winning brands in the countries that provide the biggest number of travelers. In other words, if we win in China, you win with Chinese consumers, wherever they shop in the world. The same with Brazilians and the same with every other consumer. And that's where we are focusing on. Rick?","Richard W. Kunes","Sure. And regarding the regional profitability, if you were to look at a Clinique business, a Clinique counter around the world, that profitability is relatively the same. I think what you see as far as our regional profitability is somewhat of a mixed effect, if you will. Number one, I mentioned during my comments that we have a large U.S. dollar-based expense base here in the U.S. So that is our corporate headquarters. We have lots of our brand management located in the United States. So that sort of remains, if you will. And we have a larger fragrance business here, which is a lower-profitability category of business for us. Going in the right direction, by the way, and we're making some pretty good strides in improving its profitability. But it is a fairly large business here in the U.S. That makes it somewhat less profitable. So as we grow faster internationally, because of that mix effect a little bit, you get some benefit related to the fragrance comment I just made. But we still have this U.S. dollar-denominated expense base, which is something that we deal with as a company. So I don't think it's quite the picture that you were envisioning.","Fabrizio Freda","And I just realized I didn't answer your part on the question on travel retail on is this new consumers or just cannibalizing the base business in the countries. No, we know that there are a lot of new consumers. In other words, different from what maybe people believe, travel retail is not only a replenishment business and lower cost for people that are lucky enough to travel, it's really new trial. In fact, travel retail, like online, like Dennis just explained, is a beautiful channel for launching products, for creating new trial, for making people interested for the first time into your brands. And so it's an excellent channel. Basically, travel retail and online have a lot of similar elements in being a strong trial channel, high-margin, great service and an opportunity to build unique competitive advantage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj, Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I actually just at this point had a couple of follow-up questions. One is going back to the answer, Fabrizio had given about SMI benefits. And you looked at 5 or 6 things: obsolescence, pre-promotions, out of stocks, et cetera. All of those sounded like -- except maybe for indirect procurement, like COGS benefits. So I wanted to get a sense from you, first off and a follow-up to that question, about what the trajectory is to get to your margin goals between COGS and SG&A. How should we think about that mix? And then the second follow-up is you've had a couple question about freestanding stores, but we haven't really -- I haven't really gotten a great sense over the years of kind of both the economics and operational challenges that brings in. So when you open up a store, what's the lead time to really ramp it up? What are the ROIC implications? I'm assuming the returns are a little bit worse, like a traditional retailer, what are the margin implications, et cetera? And how should we think about that as you become more and more of a retailer and we try to project your returns, et cetera, as you go forward? So those 2 follow-ups will be really helpful, if you can, please.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. Let me start from the last one, and then ask Rick to start answering the first one. We're now becoming a retailer. Again, in freestanding stores, we have 10% of our business. And freestanding stores have fairly different roles. In some places, it's just -- it's the only way, like Brazil. In Brazil, unless we have the possibility of building freestanding store for M-A-C, we will never be the leader in prestige in Brazil without that option. So it just is the only opportunity. In other emerging markets, it's the same. In other markets, it's the way to build the brand asset, meaning creating flagship. M-A-C in Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es is going to be an amazing marketing investment beyond what the specific door will deliver. That is then spread across the entire M-A-C business. So there are different roles. Some roles of the retailing activity are actually to be seen like advertising, other roles in other cases, as I said, is the best way to build a brand in the market. And in some cases, they are very profitable, too. I mean, if the belief is that retailing stores are in general less profitable, that our normal wholesaler activities, that's not correct. We have many instances where our retailing store actually are more profitable. And as I said, we're not becoming a retailer. So we have 10% of the business in freestanding stores and 90% of the business is still more in our traditional platforms. Rick?","Richard W. Kunes","And then, Ali, you are correct that we do have some opportunities in cost of goods that should result from the implementation of SAP software. And in fiscal 2013 in particular, you'll see some more so from pricing and from continuation of product mix, some improvements in cost of goods. But we will see some additional benefits beyond '13 coming in cost of goods from the implementation of SMI. However, we will see some pretty strong improvements in operating expenses from a few areas. First, this productivity metric that we put in place controls, if you will, our people cost, which are about -- well, they used to be 50% of our operating expense base. And right now, they're actually dropped down to about 45%. So already this productivity has taken a big effect on the people cost within operating expenses. Also the A&P effectiveness that we just talked about is obviously an operating expense. The indirect procurement opportunity that Fabrizio mentioned is really around everything that we spend in indirect procurement. We do a pretty good job in purchasing and in -- of our cost of sales-related items. But when you get into operating expenses, that's where we really have the opportunity to get some efficiencies through the indirect procurement process. And we also have the distribution savings that Fabrizio mentioned. So really, the combination of all of those should give us a opportunity for our operating expense improvement going forward.","Operator","Your final question today will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman, Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just quickly, I wanted to ask about hair care. First time I can recall you guys calling out hair care as being the category that'll see the fastest growth in the coming fiscal year. And then obviously, the big jump this quarter. So is it mostly the distribution gains you talked about? Or is there something else that's changed in the business that you haven't addressed so far?","Fabrizio Freda","I mean, hair care as a whole, what you are seeing is that, first of all, Aveda is doing well. And recently, Aveda launched a product line called Invati, which is doing exceptionally well. And we are going to further expand this product line, where we are in distribution and expand Aveda distribution. Bumble is doing extraordinarily well in the U.S. and we are going to expand the model also internationally. Ojon, on the contrary, has been below expectation and also, you've seen the numbers, the impaired assets this fiscal year, the fiscal year we just closed, they obviously are within total hair care. So we believe next year will be a further acceleration because Aveda and Bumble will continue to further improve their expansion. And, for example, we have the first-time TV advertising on Aveda that will join our big brands in this activity. Aveda is also our fourth biggest brand. So it's one -- will be one of the key drivers of our growth and we are expanding also in travel retail in Asia and it is one of the key drivers. Also we really are embarking into the bigger year for the long-term to create a hair care prestige business. And Aveda and Bumble are brands which are already ready for that. And Ojon, we continue preparing it for that. But we believe we have good chances of succeeding also there.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, our first quarter and full-year comparisons have been adjusted for the impact of the prior-year implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website.","I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio now.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal 2016 year is off to a good start. In the first quarter, we delivered excellent financial results, generating strong adjusted constant currency sales growth of 8% and earnings per share growth of 16%.","Our winning strategy and business model are at the core of our success. Our strength came from our broad portfolio of prestige beauty brands which is diversified by category, geography, and channel with multiple growth engines across all these areas. We can accelerate the ones working well and reallocate resources as market dynamics change. These factors continue to make us more resilient and position us for long-term, sustainable results.","We are pleased to operate in the global prestige beauty industry which is growing fast even during volatile times. Within the industry, makeup is today the fastest-growing category, and we are a global leader in prestige makeup. Once again, our luxury and makeup brands were the best performers, fueled by the intrinsic brand equity, strong launches, and solid base of business.","Worth noting are Jo Malone London, Tom Ford and La Mer in the luxury tier. M\u2022A\u2022C and Smashbox were standouts in makeup, a category where consumers are increasingly spending more of their beauty dollars. We are especially pleased with our results in light of the softer retail climate in China and Hong Kong, the MERS impact in Korea, a sharp decline of Russian and Brazilian travelers, and significant and higher than anticipated currency headwinds.","From a geographic standpoint, we delivered a stellar performance in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Growth in the region was helped by an influx of travelers attracted by the weak euro. Our midsized brands, notably Tom Ford and Smashbox, had the fastest growth, benefiting from strong retail trends, well-received launches, and new doors.","Our growth at retail was robust, and we gained share in prestige beauty in several established markets, including the UK, France, Germany, Italy. We also had double-digit growth at retail in nearly all EMEA emerging markets. The online and specialty multi-channels were vibrant in the regions. Sales in Boots and Douglas were particularly strong. Freestanding store are a key component of our expansion in the region and we added 9 new location for M\u2022A\u2022C and three for Bobbi Brown during the quarter. We continue to expand and improve our business in travel retail. Our sales at retail rose 7% with most of our brands and markets growing despite currency headwinds affecting travel from a number of key consumer group including Japanese, Russians and Brazilians.","In line with our strategy to introduce more brands and expand our reach in the channel, we launched Darphin and GLAMGLOW and opened nearly 100 new counters for our other brands. The forecast for international passenger traffic growth is healthy 7% for the fiscal 2016 which we believe will help improve our business in the coming months.","However, our net sales declined in travel retail due in part to a tough comparison with the previous year first quarter. We also experienced a weaker business and significantly lower trade stock in Korea as a result of MERS concerns. Total air travel visitor to Korea dropped about 40% from June to August and continued to be weak in September even though there were no new cases reported. We expect travel to Korea to improve as fears of MERS subside.","In North America, all of our brands grew sales. Makeup continue to be the strongest contributor to growth, up high single digits. Specialty multi remains one of the fastest growing channels, rising double digits for the quarter. Four of our brands opened new doors in Bluemercury and we had strong sales growth in Sephora. We plan to further broaden our presence in specialty multi. Clinique continues to selectively expand in Ulta and Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is on track to launch its new Est\u00e9e Edit collection of makeup and skin care products in March in approximately 250 Sephora stores and online.","In Asia Pacific, Australia and Japan were strong and Korea had another positive quarter. In Australia, a weaker currency drove greater local consumption. Distribution is expanding for prestige beauty and online is growing strongly. Our sales were solid across all channels, and we gained shares in department stores. Our sales in Japan rose high-single digit in the quarter, as the lower yen stimulated greater tourist activity especially from Chinese.","Local demand for prestige beauty was solid. Our business in Korea continues to improve and strengthen. Our net sales grew mid-single digit and our sales growth at retail exceeded prestige beauty growth. As our brand successfully competed with local brands and leveraged the new Korean trends.","Korea is a trendsetting beauty market that is known for both rapid innovation and high quality products. One element of our strategy is to build our presence in the local market to participate in the popularity of Korean brands. Last week, we announced we are making an investment in the in the novelty Korea Skin Care Company behind the brands Dr. Jart+ and Do The Right Thing. This a strategic opportunity for us to partner with high growth, distinctive brands that combine Korea innovation with a global sensibility.","The investment give us, our company an opportunity to support Dr. Jart+ development and continue success around the world. We look forward to working with the company's entrepreneurial founder as he continues to grow the brands. For us, this investment creates another pillar in our long-term growth strategy for Asia.","In China, most of our brands had higher sales, many rising double digits, fueled in part by the increasing demand for makeup. We are accelerating expansion of our makeup brands to leverage this market trend. M\u2022A\u2022C grew 25% at retail in the quarter, and this year, it's planning to open more doors in more cities.","Tom Ford opened its first department store counter in China, with the expectation to add several more during the fiscal year. These gains came amid a backdrop and soft retail environment in China caused by many factors, including the stock market volatility there. The company retail results in China were overall flat, with lower traffic in brick-and-mortar stores offset by higher volume online, where our sales nearly doubled.","Our net sales declined 3% due to lower sales of the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, which had a tough comparison with the previous year when its major new introduction occurred on July 1, and this year, New Dimension launched in mid-September. However, the brand remains the largest prestige beauty brand in China in its distribution.","Although we are seeing Chinese consumer spending less at home, they are travelling more and purchasing abroad, particularly in Japan and large European cities. For example, La Mer and Jo Malone benefited from the huge rise in Chinese tourists in Paris, which helped drive sales growth of more than 50% for these brands in France. While China's economic expansion is moderating, it remains healthy, and we are bullish on our long-term prospects. We expect to grow high-single digit this year, in line with the industry.","Hong Kong continues to be affected by sharp declines in Chinese travelers and weak local consumption. We are the largest prestige beauty company in Hong Kong, and Est\u00e9e Lauder is the largest brand. But our sales at both net and retail declined in the quarter. Despite this climate, several of our brands grew, including M\u2022A\u2022C, Tom Ford, Jo Malone. We are pushing opportunity to strengthen our business with local consumers in Hong Kong. However, we do not anticipate a significant pick up in consumption in the near-term.","Another major growth engine is our e-commerce business. Online sales rose 26%, with excellent growth from brand, retailers and third party sites, with particular strength in EMEA and APAC. Mobile sales were vibrant, and now account for more than one-third of our global online sales, and more than 50% of online sales in the UK.","Overall, orders increased and conversion rose strongly. We continue to expand our online availability and opened 100 new digital brand locations globally, mainly in international markets, on both our sites and retailer sites. For example, in China, Tmall continues to be a strong contributor to our online sales, and Bobbi Brown launched on the platform in September, bringing the number of brands we sell on Tmall to five. We also progressed on our strategy initiatives. Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique are both launching new products across categories, and making good progress on their turnaround plans. Est\u00e9e Lauder grew in several regions and gained shares in EMEA.","During the quarter, the brand introduced New Dimension, reinforcing its leadership in serums. It launched in the U.S. and the UK in July, and in the rest of its international markets starting mid-September. The line is performing to expectation, and is proving to be a terrific recruitment tool in Asia. In makeup, the brand's new Pure Color Envy Liquid Lip Potion has done really well globally.","Clinique #FaceForward campaign has strengthened the brand's attraction to younger consumers and generated extensive editorial coverage. The campaign has helped improve sales of its 3-Step franchise in North America, the UK and Asia\/Pacific.","Clinique also launched a digital editorial lifestyle platform called The Wink, highlighting emerging trends, global influencers, wellness articles, travel, and beauty information, essentially the people and the ideas that inspire the world of Clinique. This platform is intended to help Clinique strengthen its relationship with current consumers and recruit new ones.","Our recent and upcoming launch activity is strong across all categories and brands, and we have an excellent selection of gifts for the holiday season. Let me give you a few examples. In skin care, La Mer introduced the Renewal Oil, the first oil formula for the brand, and Genaissance serum essence, which builds on La Mer Miracle Broth technology at the uber (13:55) luxury price point.","Clinique launched Sculptwear serum and Smart moisturizers, and Origins New Original Skin Rose Clay Mask strengthened its leadership in prestige masks. Several brands have developed new foundations. A high loyalty product, Smashbox BB Water, a makeup with a very high-light texture, is off to a great start.","M\u2022A\u2022C is launching Studio Waterweight SPF 30, a gel-serum formula, and also Matchmaster cushion compact, the first of its kind for the brand. Building on the success of Beyond Perfecting Foundation and Concealer, Clinique recently expanded their franchise with a powder foundation. We have a full slate of exciting new fragrances in time for the holidays, including the Michael Kors Gold Collection, Tory Burch Absolu, Donna Karan Liquid Cashmere White and Black, and Jo Malone Mimosa & Cardamom. Est\u00e9e Lauder leveraged the excitement of its Modern Muse Le Rouge launch by live-streaming the event on two popular social media platforms, Snapchat and Periscope.","We are pleased with our strong start this quarter. We remain committed to deliver strong constant currency full-year sales growth ahead of the industry and double-digit EPS growth, even though, as I explained, we expect continuous lower growth in some key markets and channels around the world.","Our performance this quarter demonstrate our many strengths, and is proof that, by staying focused on our long-term strategy, we can successfully navigate external challenges and market volatility to deliver sustainable and reliable results.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2016 first quarter results, and then I will cover our expectations for the second quarter and for the full year. And to clarify our underlying business performance, my commentary on comparisons to the prior year excludes the first quarter and full-year impact of the acceleration of retailer orders that shifted sales from the first quarter of fiscal 2015 into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 related to our rollout of SMI.","The impact of that shift was $178 million in sale and $127 million in operating income, equal to approximately $0.21 per share. Also excluded for the full year is the impact of restructuring and other charges. Net sales were $2.83 billion for the first quarter, which was 8% growth in constant currency. Last year's acquisitions contributed 70 basis points of this sales growth.","From a geographic standpoint, Europe, the Middle East and Africa had a standout quarter. Net sales in the region rose 11% in constant currency, with double-digit performance occurring in both Western developed markets as well as emerging markets. Strong local demand for our products, as well as increased tourism in Western Europe, fueled double-digit increases in major markets such as the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.","We also continue to achieve strong double-digit sales gains in many emerging markets, including the Middle East, Russia and Turkey. Our net sales in the travel retail channel declined 7% as we experienced inventory adjustments among retailers in Hong Kong, China and Korea, as well as anniversaried strong shipments prior to the retail slowdown that occurred in October of 2015. Sales at retail in the quarter were strong 7% as Fabrizio mentioned.","Net sales in the Americas increased 9% in constant currency. Strong double-digit growth continued in Latin America led by Brazil and Mexico. North American sales grew mid-single digits which reflected double-digit growth in Canada and solid growth in the United States.","Sales were strongest in the specialty multi, online and department store channels while tourist-driven doors have been meaningfully negatively impacted by the strong dollar.","Net sales in the Asia Pacific region were flat in constant currency. Australia delivered another quarter of double-digit sales gain, a sharp increase in Chinese tourists combined with good local demand, drove stronger growth in Japan, and Korea generated mid-single-digit growth. This sales growth was offset by the less favorable trends in greater China, most notably in Hong Kong.","Net sales by product category were led by the 16% constant currency growth in makeup for the quarter. The biggest contribution came from the continued strength of M\u2022A\u2022C. And makeup sales of Tom Ford and Smashbox rose double digits on brand expansion, new products and strong same-store growth.","Est\u00e9e Lauder again had growth in makeup including strong demand for its Double Wear franchise. Sales of fragrance products rose 12% in constant currency. Luxury fragrances continued to drive sales growth led by double-digit gains from Jo Malone and Tom Ford and incremental sales from Le Labo and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle. The launch of the Michael Kors Gold fragrance collection also contributed to sales.","Hair care sales rose 6% in constant currency with growth from both Aveda and Bumble and bumble. Aveda launched pure, dry shampoo and benefited from other recent launches. The brand also delivered strong salon sales in Western Europe. Bumble and bumble continued to generate good growth in specialty-multi and online channel. Skin care sales declined 1% in constant currency reflecting the current global industry trend favoring makeup. La Mer, Origins and Darphin generated solid growth, and the category benefited from the incremental sales from GLAMGLOW. These increases were more than offset by Asia-driven declines at Est\u00e9e Lauder, which are a large part of the brands business there. And U.S. department store weakness at Clinique.","Our gross margin of 79.6% was flat with the prior-year quarter. Operating expenses as a percent of sales rose 90 basis points to 63.6%. The primary drivers reflect our strategic priorities. We incurred higher store operations cost from the increase in freestanding retail store openings over the past year. The strategic acquisitions we made in fiscal 2015 added 30 basis points to operating expenses as a percent of sale. Our investment and innovation and product development continues to rise at a faster rate than sales. And these increases were partially offset by reductions from our cost savings initiative. As a result, operating income declined 5% to $453.2 million, and operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 16%.","Also affecting our operating margin were lower sales from our high-margin travel retail business. However, our adjusted constant currency operating income increased 8% in the quarter and resulted in flat constant currency operating margin. Net earnings were $309.3 million or 14% above the prior-year quarter in constant currency, primarily reflecting the higher sales and a 350 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate. Diluted EPS of $0.82 came in above the top-end of our expectations due to higher than expected sales, continued expense management and a lower tax rate.","Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.11 of unfavorable currency translation and approximately $0.01 of dilution from acquisitions. Continued progress in our supply chain initiatives and favorable currency translation helped improve inventory days to sell by 13 days to 180 by the end of September. These improvements were partially offset by the inventory build necessary to meet our future sales growth objectives and the additional inventory from our new brands.","During the quarter, we generated $8 million in cash flow from operating activities, which reflected normal, seasonal, higher-working capital requirement and inventory to support the holiday selling period. The comparison of our cash flows versus prior-year was also unfavorably impacted by the cash received from the accelerated orders in the prior year. We invested $90 million in capital expenditures, primarily to support new retail stores and counters.","We utilized $387 million in cash to repurchase approximately $4.7 million shares of our stock, nearly double the amount purchased during last year's first quarter. We also paid $90 million in dividends to stockholders. Additionally, this morning, we announced another 25% increase in our dividend rate.","Let me now turn to our outlook for the second quarter and for the full fiscal year. For the full year, the sales shift related to last year's SMI rollout will impact comparisons to the prior year.","I'll discuss our expectations adjusting for the impact of the shift. Our forecasted growth rate both before and after the shift impact are available in today's earnings release for your reference. For the full year, we continue to expect sales to grow 6% to 8% in constant currency including 50 basis points from acquisitions.","Currency has become an even greater headwind than previously anticipated. And we now estimate the translation could negatively impact our full-year sales growth by approximately 4% to 5%. Our estimate assumes current spot exchange rates of around $1.10 for the euro, $1.53 for the pound, and $1.21 for the yen for the remainder of the fiscal year.","However, we are still expecting our diluted EPS to be in the range between $3.10 and $3.17 including $0.05 of dilution from acquisitions. The increased currency headwinds are projected to affect EPS by about $0.24, $0.06 more than we projected when we last gave guidance.","Our strong first quarter performance gave us comfort to raise our expected EPS growth to 10% to 12% in constant currency.","Regarding the second quarter, our sales are expected to rise 6% to 7% in constant currency. The translation impact of the stronger dollar could contract growth by approximately 5 percentage points to 6 percentage points. Activities behind our key product launches and our holiday programs should help drive sales growth.","As we have said before, we manage our business on a full-year basis and for the longer term. And our spending by quarter can vary, depending on the needs of the business and how the quarter progresses. At this time, our second quarter diluted EPS is anticipated to come in between $1.04 and $1.08 per share, including approximately $0.10 per share of adverse currency translation.","As you are aware, the company has been engaged in a multi-year upgrading and modernization of its systems and processes. In a continuation of these efforts, we are transforming our global technology infrastructure to improve the delivery of internal IT services throughout the organization.","We are transitioning from a platform of company-owned assets to one that is primarily vendor-owned. We will be utilizing a new third-party provider with an enhanced scalable platform to improve our ability to respond to the demands of the business and leverage more advanced technology.","We expect to record restructuring and other charges of approximately $40 million to $50 million, primarily to write off certain IT assets. Implementation of this initiative will take place throughout calendar year 2016.","We expect the transformation to increase operational efficiency, reduce future IT service and infrastructure costs, and result in additional future savings, freeing up cash that we may reinvest in capabilities and growth opportunities. This initiative will also be return-generating.","We are pleased with our start to the year as we deliver strong sales and earnings growth and progressed well on many of our growth and efficiency initiatives.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Our first question today comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little about the gross margin. And as you look out over the next couple of years, as you look at your business mix moving to more of a sort of company-owned store environment, how should we think about the gross margin? Because if you look at this quarter, obviously great top line growth, but not quite as much leverage there as I think some of us had hoped for. So can you give us a little bit of an outlook in terms of maybe is mix having a bigger impact than what we've currently been modeling? Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. We have different gross margins, depending on the different channels of business. So as it relates to our growth in retail, as we grow our retail business or our online business, for that matter, we would expect that gross margin \u2013 that's a benefit to our gross margin from an overall average company standpoint. There are other channels and brands that have lower gross margins.","So as we've spoken in previous quarter calls, depending on the mix of our business in any given quarter, you would \u2013 you will see a range of gross profit margin performance and operating margin performance, which is why we continue to focus on the full year in terms of the guidance that we give and you should expect.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik H. Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks for the question. Just actually two quick questions. Fabrizio, I was wondering if you can give me or give us some thoughts on market share for Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, just kind of going around some of your largest region especially in China. And the second question just so I can understand this whole IT initiative, should we be expecting any disruption related to inventory like we saw with SMI or is this completely unrelated? Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I'll answer the second question first. Regarding this shift in terms of our IT infrastructure, it is not like the application that we implemented with the SAP initiative. So, the SMI initiatives though, we will not expect to have an inventory build similar to what you've seen, thankfully, for SMI over the last few years.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And in term of market share, as you can imagine, we are growing global market share, with net retail sales in the 8% range, and with the market growing at this point, from our estimate, around 4%, we are really growing strongly global market share. However, in some areas, in Lauder and Clinique particularly, the market share could be flat or declining.","For example, you ask about Asia. In Asia, Lauder is the clear market leader in Hong Kong. And in China, with the softness of these two markets, obviously, the overall market share in Asia of the brand is under pressure. And Clinique, which is the overwhelming market leader in U.S. mid-tier department store, with the lower growth in this channel versus the other channels in the U.S., also Clinique market share overall in that area will be under pressure. But overall, globally, we are doing a very good progress in market share, again with the same strategy of a good portfolio by category, and then by channel and by country.","Operator","Your next question is from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning. Thank you. At one point, the Chinese traveler and locals, I think you believed were about 10% of your business. And with the shifts you've seen, Europe, it sounds like, is attracting more Chinese tourists, but Hong Kong isn't. And I wonder if you could just tell us what you think happened to growth of sales to the Chinese consumer overall? Was it up or down, or what are your thoughts there?","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Our estimate is, our sales to Chinese is up, and it continues to be very, very strong and very solid overall around the world, but as we explained, where this growth happens is changing. And then, depending of the market share of our brands in the specific area where the Chinese are going, then there could be a bigger or lower impact.","So the fact that there is an issue in Hong Kong in this moment, obviously that's a negative for our sales to Chinese, because we are, as a company, the market leader in Hong Kong. But overall, as you said, we are getting great benefits in Europe and we see good progress in other markets where \u2013 like Japan, where the Chinese in this moment are going and buying a lot.","Finally, you see an impact on the U.S., mainly in the U.S., because of the strong dollar. The amount of purchases to Chinese consumers has decreased in the last quarters. And obviously, we have a very high market share in the U.S. and we have been penalized by that trend.","But all in all, again, we look at the long term, we believe Chinese consumers in mainland and around the world are, and will continue to be, a great source of growth, and a great source of business, and we remain completely focused on them, independently from the mix impacts in the short term. And we have been able to deliver a great growth in the quarter despite, in the quarter, a relatively negative mix impact of the Chinese spending.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Guys, I guess I wanted to ask about EMEA, right. And I understand that you had an influx of, I guess, Chinese shoppers in there. I think you cited that as helping. But if you strip out the travel retail decline, it looks like EMEA, ex that travel retail decline, was up very substantially, right, maybe mid-teens, maybe high-teens? I guess \u2013 let me know if that's wrong. And if it's not, how sustainable is that in the near term? And do you get a bounce in Asia before you get what could be a slowdown in EMEA from those giant growth rates? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We believe this is a strong trend. We are doing very well in EMEA, and growing market share in many, many of these markets. And we believe we have plans to continue this trend. UK is really booming. In the UK market, the market is growing 7% in prestige, more than mass. We are doing great job in attracting consumer for mass, and in growing market share across all channels.","The emerging markets in EMEA, which are a big part of this, we are growing outstandingly. Just to \u2013 our total emerging market growth this quarter was 13%, excluding China was 31%. So, in the EMEA market, we are growing basically one-third of our business on top of what we had, and this is supposed to continue, and we have very clear plan on that.","So, EMEA in total, excluding TR, by the way, is 23% growth. And so, really standing, and there are several reason why these strengths \u2013 I'm not sure as the same identical strengths of the quarter, but this good solid trend is expected to continue.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And the only thing I'll add to that is, embedded within our guidance for the balance of the year; this was, to Fabrizio's point, a very, very strong quarter for EMEA, and we do expect that to continue, certainly benefiting from both the tourist as well as strong execution of our brand programs in the region.","A bit moderating for the balance of the year, relative to what we experienced in the first quarter, largely benefiting, particularly from some of the shifts in the quarter that happened fairly quickly with the MERS situation, as well as the situation that we referred to in China, and people changing their travel plans, in addition to the benefiting from the lower currency in Europe.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. Actually, two questions, if I may. First, a simple one. Travel retail net sales have fallen short of what you've reported retail sales to be by double-digits for two consecutive quarters. So, given that, do you think we're going to see normalization and reversion of net sales, matching retail sales on a go-forward, and do you think this can sort of abate some of that, that margin headwind?","And secondly, Fabrizio, during your prepared remarks, you made numerous mentions to sort of distribution build: new counters, new doors, new stores. Any sense of how much that, in aggregate, is contributing to your growth? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'll start with the second question. Contribution to our growth is or distribution is 2%. So, 2 points of growth are distribution increases we met in the quarter, which is a continuing verse of what happened the last fiscal year.","In terms of travel retail, what you should expect, first of all, the traffic increase of \u2013 in travel retail today is about 7%, and so remains very solid. But the mix of it, meaning there are less Brazilians, less Russians and Chinese are going in different places than Hong Kong, this mix has a negative impact in the short term on conversion, meaning on the number of travelers, that really buy, buy in a big way because different populations have different conversion rates.","So, again, in this global, complex world, you need to keep in mind mix has a huge impact. So we believe that in the future, the mix impact should improve because, as you know, there is in the base the turmoil of Hong Kong that started in October, November. MERS should get out of the base as well, and meaning that the MERS impact should not be there anymore in the future.","And then we, specifically as Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, as we are doing in every other aspect of the business, we are modifying our portfolio and adjusting and diversifying also our travel retail sales, meaning we are building stronger business in EMEA, stronger business in the Americas. We are diversifying our brands. We are launching new brands. We are covering more airports, more tier-2 airports. So we are continuing our strategy of diversification also in travel retail, and we expect this will benefit our trend, it will make us less dependent on short-term mix inputs in the travel retail evolution.","Operator","Your next question is from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. So obviously, some of your Paris based trends had some pretty negative commentary overall particularly in travel retail. So can you just give us an update in terms of inter-quarter trends, if you saw any change through the quarter or through October so far? And then just update us on your assumption on industry growth for this year. Is it still 4% to 5%? Thanks so much.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I mean, on travel retail, the quarter was tough obviously. And so, I think we agree with the negative comment on the quarter. Our point of view on the long term future of travel retail remain however very positive and we believe travel retail is and will remain a strong channel, a channel of growth and a great opportunity for us.","And then, we believe that in the continuation of this fiscal year in the next 12 months, we should see gradually an improvement of the trend as I was explaining because many negative impacts on the travel retail will be in the base \u2013 in the base (40:25). And so, that's the difference. And...","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The market? Yes. We do still expect the market growth to be 4% to 5% this year.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question is from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. My question has to do with the change \u2013 not call it the change, the emphasis on opening stores that you announced in August. If you can tell us how many stores have been opened this fiscal year, 2016, and what will be your corporate like-for-like growth, excluding M&A and new store openings?","So that will be my question. And a clarification with regards to EMEA, it seems that I understood that \u2013 or at least this is what I gather \u2013 that ex- travel retail, all the other pieces in aggregate of EMEA could do 23%. So how much of that is a \u2013 you mentioned that emerging markets grew 31%, so the Western European piece grew very rapidly as well. Could you tell us what you're doing with Boots and Douglas? It seems that you had mentioned that on the passing. Are you opening more doors? If there is more opportunity to increase distribution in Boots and Douglas? Thank you very much.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","All right. So, Javier, let me go ahead and start. In terms of new door openings, for freestanding stores, now we referenced both freestanding store and freestanding format openings, as well as some of the openings that we're experiencing in travel retail. But as it relates to retail, freestanding stores and freestanding store formats, we expect to open about 250 this year.","As it relates to in our growth algorithm of 6% to 8%, how much we're expecting to come from distribution, it's about 2% to 3% of the 6% to 8%. And as it relates to the acquisitions this year, we're expecting about 50 basis points of our growth in that 6% to 8% to come from the new acquisitions that we did last year.","Operator","Your next question is from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Our question relates to your initiative, particularly around the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, to broaden the reach to the millennial customer. And maybe you could talk a little bit about your digital content initiative with respect to the brand portfolio more broadly. Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you for your comment. And, yeah, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, as we explained, is doing several trends to complete the turnaround, go back to long-term growth levels. One of these steps is focusing more on the millennials and attract new consumers and particularly younger consumers to the brand. The key activity recently has been with the new model Kendall and all the activities behind Kendall Jenner launch of the new fragrance or new makeup. And the daily social media activities behind these new launches, they've been very successful.","And so, we will try to continue that. And as part to this plan to attract more millennials, behind Kendall, behind the social media, behind specific product launches, we attribute particularly high importance to the launch in Sephora U.S. of Est\u00e9e Edit with 250 doors next March. Then we'll be continuing this progress in attracting to the (44:13) brand the millennial generation.","Operator","Your next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. So, Fabrizio or Tracey, given the challenging macros out there, I'm surprised you're willing to raise your FX-neutral EPS guidance so early in the year here after the Q1 beat. So, I was just hoping to get a sense of what was really driving that. Your FX-neutral sales range remains the same, but maybe you're more comfortable where you're landing within that. Or is it more due to the margin side and maybe the cost of doing business is not as high as you expected? And just to your level of conviction that you can deliver that earnings growth with the global volatility out there will be helpful. Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, I will start on and I'll let Fabrizio pick up on the environment and our expectation as it relates to sales. But I think in terms of our comfort level with raising our guidance, one of the things that we are saying is better leverage on some of the initiatives that we were expecting for this year. We've talked a lot about our flexibility and agility as it relates to expenses. And the ability that we have created over the last few years to shift resources to fund the initiatives that are driving more momentum. This certainly starting this quarter there was a tremendous amount of uncertainly, we bet on some strong winners this quarter. Hence, we're able to deliver the quarter and we think we have better insight into what will work for the balance of the year relative to the initiatives that we started the year with. So, that gives us comfort in terms of our ability to deleverage our initiatives a bit better than what we had initially anticipated.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then overall, I think you posed the question that say, is it really overall, is the amount of confidence and the amount of things that progressed well in the quarter, like our cost savings, our activity internally and also to the mix because we were anticipating a softer Hong Kong or softer China and we have planned to offset, I said, to reallocate the resources in EMEA and in other areas and to accelerate the United States and North America in general. Obviously, the softer part was more sure than the good part and the good part was validated with the activity we've done in the quarter.","And so, the reassurance that we saw in the fact that our strong offsetting investment we are working well gave us more confidence to get the balance of the fiscal year in the direction we just stated.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Astrachan with Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks and good morning, everybody. I just wanted to clarify. So, is your expectation still that Clinique and Est\u00e9e brands get back to growth this year? And then, sort of more broadly on the same brand, I guess, investors \u2013 it seems to us at least, lump those two brands together. But I'm curious internally how you view longer-term growth prospects for each brand? And obviously, they're different brands, different positioning.","And in terms of the Clinique brand, it seems a little harder, to sort of get a sense of how it fits in with a consumer that wants either lower end or higher end with the entry-level Prestige brand perhaps becoming more squeezed from a consumer purchase standpoint longer-term. I'm just curious how you think about that and could there ever be a scenario where you look to dispose of that brand in favor of investing in other things?","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, let me answer (48:14) question. There is no scenario in which we dispose of any of these two brands. Those are two core brands of the company, it will continue to be our priority. And, yes, our goal is to bring these brands back to single-digit growth as soon as possible.","Now, the brands are very different, you stated one from another. So, the brands are making progress as I stated in my prepared remarks, both brands, but let me take them one-by-one.","The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is making progress in makeup. We already turned around the makeup part, and we will continue to accelerate that. We have a strong holiday plan on fragrances with Modern Muse Le Rouge plan, and we expect to continue making progress on the fragrances.","On the skin care part of the Lauder brand, frankly, with Lauder being the market leader in Asia where over 90% of the business is skin care, and in this moment, a global softness happening and being so focused on Hong Kong and China skin care business. It's very difficult to have the skin care turnaround executed and finalized in the short period of time in that external condition. Said this, we will continue working on it, we'll continue to diversify, and we expect also \u2013 we have the goal also to turn around the skin care part as soon as possible and as soon as market \u2013 external market condition also will be a bit more favorable for the skin care product.","On Clinique, same thing. Good progress on makeup, which is a very important part of the Clinique business, and good progress in many markets around the world. For example, Clinique in China has been, in the quarter, growing double digit and is one of our fastest-growing brand there. The Clinique challenge has been in departments \u2013 the mid-tier department store U.S., in the area of skin care particularly, and that's the area that we are attacking with the next set of initiatives and activity, working with our partners to turn around also this part.","I also want to say, in the U.S., Clinique continues to grow, for example, very well in specialty multi, in Sephora, in Ulta and in overall online.","So good progress, and yes, we are still determined to bring both of these brands with their very different problematics and strengths to single-digit growth as soon as possible, external markets permitting.","Operator","Your next question is from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Could you guys talk about a few things? First, shipments versus consumption in the quarter \u2013 and I know it is not a great resource, but it looks like NPD continues to pretty dramatically trail some of the numbers you're reporting. So I would love any commentary you have there?","And then, the price harmonization impact in China \u2013 so I know it is fairly early, but I'm just trying to figure out, are the Chinese shoppers \u2013 is it price-driven, or is it experience-driven, when they buy overseas? Are you seeing them by only in travel retail; outlets, because it is cheaper because of the duties; or are they buying it more exponentially, and I think probably the latter is better than the former?","And then, just lastly, very quickly, have you ever thought about like a more of an omni-channel approach to Clinique, including maybe going into masks? I know you have done very well in Boots in the UK. I think you have a decent business at Shoppers Drug. So I wonder if you ever explore like CVS or Walgreens with Clinique. I am out of breath. Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Wow. So, again, let me start from the last part, no. We have no intention to bring Clinique in any other distribution than prestige global distribution. So there will not be expansion of Clinique to mass. Clinique is a prestige, luxury brand that need service element attached to the business model to be successful around the world. This will remain the same.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Bill, as it relates to NPD information and shipments versus sell-through, I assume you're referring to the U.S., the North America NPD numbers. And a couple of things that I would point out; in our first quarter, September is a pretty heavy shipping month for holiday sales, so that would affect shipments, and you wouldn't necessarily see that in the retail sell-throughs and the market share information. And also, free standing stores are not in that information...","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And online.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...and online, so \u2013 or not our online site. So those are two elements that are missing that are certainly in our numbers when we report, that you don't see in the NPD numbers.","Operator","Your next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I actually wanted to talk a little bit about holiday, just kind of in general, your outlook in terms of the broader retail environment. I know sometimes when there's heavy promotion around other areas of retail, it can impact category growth in beauty. So a little bit on that. Anything you are doing differently in terms of gift sets, or positioning around holiday would be great. And then, secondly, within the U.S., just curious on Est\u00e9e. Because you've had New Dimension in the market for the better part of the quarter, how skin care for Est\u00e9e performed in the U.S., and just any kind of color on the outlook for New Dimension's momentum forward. Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, so on holiday, we feel confident we have a good set of activities, particularly strong on our fragrance business, on our makeup business, and we believe we are well prepared. There will be also our portfolio brands, and the growth we have seen in brands like Jo Malone, Tom Ford is reinforcing the part of our portfolio which has the possibility of having great traction during the holiday.","So we see improvements ,not only in our gift sets and in the promotionality of holidays, but we really see improvements also in the kind of portfolio choices that we can offer for gifts during the holiday period everywhere in the world. The other aspect that we are improving is that a lot of the holiday sales are going to be directed online, in our retail dot-com areas and online in general. And we continue to improve our online readiness for having a great gift season.","Now for the other question, is New Dimension of Lauder was in line with the expectations around the world, including in the U.S., is particularly successful in the beginning in certain European markets. But in the UK, also was very successful as of July. And in U.S., I would say, more or less in line with expectations. And the impact on the overall skin care Lauder is positive. We see the New Dimension brings new consumers into the game. And so, we believe can have a good impact in the long term.","However, last year during the same period, we had launched Advanced Night Repair eye product, that was a very successful initiative. So in some markets, including the United States, we see that New Dimension launch was not able to completely offset the Advanced Night Repair launch in the previous year. But again, we'll continue to grow and attract new consumers to the brand, in our estimate.","Operator","Your next question is from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. It's not entirely clear to me, because the first quarter was stronger than we expected, clearly on the top line and the bottom line, and much stronger than your guidance \u2013 why you wouldn't be raising the full-year numbers. I'm just trying to understand, was there more pipeline fill? Was it that shift \u2013 I know, Tracey, you mentioned a shift in some marketing expenses. Or is it that you feel incrementally cautious about the macro environment? Or are you just being wildly conservative with the second quarter and the full-year numbers? Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Wendy, we're definitely not being wildly conservative with the numbers. We actually did, when you think about the fact that we maintained our full-year guidance and we talked about experiencing another $0.06, or expecting to experience another $0.06 of currency impact based on the current spot rates, indeed we did raise our guidance for the full year.","So, we did flow some of the beat in the first quarter through to the full year. But it is a very uncertain macro environment and, as Fabrizio mentioned, there are many markets that are volatile right now, and currency still remains volatile right now. So, we were not comfortable flowing 100% of the beat through in the first quarter to the full year, but we certainly flowed a portion of it through.","Operator","Your next question is from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I have a couple things. One is, on the SG&A beat, based on lower spending. Given the commentary that we've heard for a while now about agility and nimbleness, is there any way to help us think about how much less volatile you may be today, given some of these kind of organizational capabilities you've built, about reacting more quickly and stuff? Because \u2013 and if you could be specific about what you've actually done. Because it has always been a concern, I think, among investors \u2013 among us as well \u2013 that you are not really a staple company, right, you're much more discretionary, so macro has to be much more concerning for you guys.","Can you give us a sense of how your organizational capabilities have changed? And if you can tell us how much less volatile you might be, so we can be less concerned about macro, that might be helpful. Tough question, but love some context there.","And then, second thing is around the dividend increase of 25% \u2013 good; again, I think that was 20% last year, so now 25% this time. How should we think about where you're funding that from? I mean, clearly, the payout ratio seems to be going up because the EPS growth, ex-currency, is 10% to 12%. Should we expect some more debt load? Lower stock buybacks? Is it just kind of the payout ratio going up, working capital improvements? How should we think about that from a signaling perspective, given your dividend's going up so much? Thanks, guys.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I'll take the first one and Tracey will cover the second one.","So, in terms of volatility, the market has increased volatility. And that's why we have prepared ourselves to deal with this volatility better. So, the strategy that I keep repeating, the multiple engine of growth, is actually a clear strategy that internally, we are executing since several years. And now, this has reached to a point where we believe we are much less volatile than we used to be and more reliable and more sustainable than ever. This comes from the fact that by channel, we are today more diversified.","For example, we have now 8% of our business online and some of our key markets like U.S. and U.K. is 12%. And in China, as we discussed, it is double digit, it is 10%. We have more business in our free-standing stores, particularly on certain brands and particularly in emerging markets. Meaning, that we have bettered the ability to build business in the emerging markets which are growing fast, even if in some cases, there is not available luxury distribution in those markets. And some of our brands have been designed to drive this accordingly.","We are better diversified because now we are winning around the world much better in specialty-multi. We had mentioned our strong growth in the U.S. in Sephora or our strong growth in Europe in Douglas or in Boots in the U.K., and there are several examples in Asia as well. So, channel diversification is one example.","Second, category diversification. We have now demonstrated that we are the market leader in global makeup. And so, even in the moment where the macro factor makes skin care grow less aggressively, particularly because skin care in Asia is growing less, we can definitely accelerate makeup and within makeup there are very profitable segments, so makeup that can be accelerated, that are equally profitable to skin care.","We have demonstrated that in the fragrance business, creating these high-end fragrance part of the portfolio, which is profitable and growing fast like Jo Malone as a brand, that we can continue tapping into the growth of the fragrance strategy, but with a strategy which is more in tune with the Est\u00e9e Lauder company capability and long-term vision.","And finally, diversification by brands. We are much less dependent only from Lauder and Clinique. First of all, M\u2022A\u2022C today is a brand which is as big as Lauder and Clinique. And then the rest of our portfolio of the small brands, now mid-size brands, all together, as I explained a lot of times, are actually bigger than our biggest brands. So we have now really multiple origins of growth, more diversified.","So the first reason why we are less volatile is because there is not anymore one thing that can happen macro that can have a very big impact on our business because there will be others that we can accelerate to compensate this one.","Second part to the answer is then, what do we do, what we have changed in terms of resource allocation? We have created internal system where we are much more capable of reallocating resources when we discover these trends or these changes on trends, and to make sure, for example, that we do not overspend if there are situations where the market doesn't deserve it because the market is under pressure.","And so we can cut spending very fast where the market doesn't deserve to be pushed in a certain moment, or cut spending where initiative, a new launch is not delivering what we were expecting to avoid burning money that will not return.","On the other side, we are also capable to increase spending in areas where there is strength and where there is growth or where the market offer an opportunity that was not forecasted before and we can do this in a range of months. And so our ability to reallocate resources with internal system in just a few months has increased dramatically versus the past.","So in summary, we are more reliable, more sustainable, more long term and less exposed to external trend than ever because of our portfolio and because of our ability to reallocate resources in a pretty fast way. Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And so, to continue what Fabrizio said, one of the benefits of being able to execute well against our strategy inclusive of the agility, the diversity and the agility that we've created from executing in our strategy is that our free cash flow, as you all know, has increased quite dramatically over the last few years.","We've seen a big acceleration in our free cash flow which has allowed us to take up the dividend as well as repurchase more shares every year, as we on an annual basis review and get approval from the board on terms of how much of our free cash flow will we distribute to the shareholders. Much of that cash is generated overseas, and so, we have taken on small amounts of debt as we have committed to that strategy. And we've also taken on debt, and as I've shared with you previously, we'll continue to take on debt for acquisitions as we need to in the future.","Operator","That concludes today's question and answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor section of our website.","During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for the call.","And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio now.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our company delivered an excellent performance in the third quarter. Our business accelerated, driven by many brands, channels and markets that experienced strong momentum. In constant currency, our sales rose 9% and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 28%, both of which exceeded our expectations. The outperformance was generated from stronger organic sales growth, largely in China in travel retail channel; a better-than-expected performance of our newest brands, Too Faced and BECCA, as well as disciplined expense management.","When fiscal 2017 began, we said our sales were expected to accelerate every quarter, culminating in a robust second half. As we look to the fourth quarter, our sales growth should increase farther, enabling us to deliver our financial and sales target for the full year and position us for a strong start in fiscal year 2018.","Our success this quarter came despite continued external macro headwinds in certain areas. In the U.S., foot traffic continued to decline in brick-and-mortar department stores, our largest domestic channel. And Macy's closed 68 stores, as expected. In certain other countries, we faced difficult economic or political climates, particularly in the Middle East, Turkey and Latin America. And the continued strength of the dollar impacted our reported results.","Globally, we encountered stiff competition from both established and upstart brands. The fact that we have achieved a strong performance against this backdrop speaks to our successful strategy, which is anchored by our increasingly diversified business model and multiple engines of growth. We also are benefiting from our choice to stay focused on a dynamic prestige industry that has been growing steadily for many years and continues to grow faster than many other household and personal care centers.","As global prestige beauty undergoes rapid change, we are embracing new opportunities, accelerating penetration of the fastest-growing channels, reallocating resources to the leading business drivers and pivoting for the future in our industry. Consumers' appetite for beauty products is intensifying, particularly in the luxury arena and in makeup, which fuel outstanding growth in our high-end brands and continued double-digit growth in our makeup category. In addition, we enjoyed superb growth in the fastest-growing beauty channels, with travel retail, online and specialty multi, each rising strong double-digits.","By geography, we grew strong double digits in certain emerging markets, notably China. Altogether, we generated higher sales in every region and in our three largest product categories, fueled by an acceleration of our hero products, new product innovation and increased social media presence, new digital initiatives and greater penetration in the fastest high-growth channels. At the same time, we continued investing in priority areas and capabilities and our Leading Beauty Forward initiative.","Our diverse portfolio of brands continues to be a strategic advantage. We leveraged each brand in the most appropriate prestige distribution channels to target different consumer segments. This approach yielded outstanding results for our luxury brands including Tom Ford, La Mer and Jo Malone. Each generated double-digit sales growth in constant currency in every region. La Mer's new hydrating serum and brightening mask were well received and benefit from an increase in travel in Chinese consumers around the world. The brand gained share in Asia-Pacific and maintained its leading position in luxury skin care there.","Among our largest brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder achieved the solid growth globally for the second consecutive quarter, with higher sales in skin care, makeup and fragrances. The brand was well positioned to capitalize on increased travel and consumption from Chinese consumers, which favorably impacted its business in travel retail, the UK, and Asian markets and lifted its skin care sales. Est\u00e9e Lauder's makeup category excelled in Asia-Pacific with increases in face, lip and eye products.","The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand continued to support its two key hero franchises, Advanced Night Repair and Double Wear, with new products combined with more effective marketing and communication. The investment paid off. The two highly desirable product lines reached the new consumer, posted positive growth in every region and increased double digit for the fiscal year-to-date. Around the world, Double Wear is the best-selling prestige foundation in many markets such as the U.K. and attracts consumers across generation to the brand, including millennials.","We have successfully created a new growth engine with our luxury and artisanal fragrance brands and they continued to advance strongly, while at the same time improve the profitability of the entire fragrance category. Jo Malone and Tom Ford accelerated rapidly, particularly in travel retail and we also see great potential for our newer fragrance brands, Le Labo, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle and By Kilian. This is the first full quarter that reflected a contribution of our newest brands, Too Faced and BECCA and their sales exceeded our expectations.","We also started to extend their presence internationally. Adding these brands to our portfolio accelerated our penetration in both makeup and in the fast-growing specialty multichannel and increases our reach with millennial consumers. Indeed, many of our brands are expanding in fast growing channels to reach new consumer. Since today, they have wider choices of where to shop for prestige beauty products.","In this regard, we are excited our M.A.C. brand will launch this month in Ulta Beauty, one of the fastest growing specialty multi-retailers in the United States. Ulta's consumer are devoted beauty enthusiasts and have been requesting the brand. M.A.C. will first be available on ulta.com starting next year, followed by about 25 stores beginning in June, with more than 100 doors planned by the end of December. The locations will feature dedicated M.A.C. makeup artists in a boutique-like setting, allowing M.A.C. to provide it exceptional artistry services.","Expanding into specialty multi globally is integral to M.A.C's strategies to grow its consumer base, continue to raise awareness, become more accessible and drive incremental sales. Although M.A.C. is the number-one prestige makeup brand worldwide, it is in less than 3,000 doors, a fraction of the location of most of its direct competitors, in some cases, in even less than 15%. M.A.C. continues to make great inroads in specialty multi internationally. In Brazil, for example, M.A.C. is the leading brand on sephora.com and will open in some of the retailers' top brick-and-mortar stores this August.","In Europe, M.A.C. is increasing consumer reach by opening more doors with Douglas, as well as other specialty multi retailers including KICKS in Sweden. Our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand launched in Ulta last fall in 30 doors and successfully tapped into a new audience. During the first three months, more than 40% of consumers who bought its products were new to the brand. And over 65% of the new makeup consumers were millennials. With strong sales results, Est\u00e9e Lauder plans to roll out to more Ulta stores.","Clinique's experience in Ulta has been terrific and it is building on its business there with more in-store boutiques. By the end of fiscal 2017, our three largest brands will have strategically expanded their consumer reach in the U.S. specialty-multi channel.","Several of our other brands have achieved strong sales in the U.S., specialty multi, including GLAMGLOW, Smashbox, Tom Ford in Sephora and Darphin in Bluemercury. During the quarter, we launched Jo Malone and La Mer into a few key Sephora doors, including its largest one that recently opened in Manhattan, and also on sephora.com. Initial response has been terrific. Both brands are recruiting new consumers from these efforts.","Internationally, our business has also performed well in many specialty multi retailers, including Mecca, Boots, Douglas and (11:18). More specialty multi retailers are entering Korea, and Clinique and Origins have expanded their consumer reach to some of these new locations. Clinique and M.A.C. has launched in specialty multi in Thailand with fantastic results.","We had outstanding results in travel retail, led by our business in Asia-Pacific. Our vibrant retail sales showed the strongest quarterly growth in over three years and far outpaced passenger traffic growth in the quarter. Sales increase in every product category. Makeup sales surged, led by M.A.C., Tom Ford, and several other brands. Higher skin care sales were driven by Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer in the greater number of Chinese and other Asian travelers.","And in fragrance, which still leads total beauty sales in the channel, we achieved the superior results and share growth, led by Jo Malone and Tom Ford. We believe there will be strong demand among consumers for our newer luxury and artisanal fragrance brands in travel retail as we roll them out, enabling us to further penetrate the channel's most important category.","We also continue to expand the availability of our other brands that aren't widely distributed in travel retail, and brought more brands into more high potential airports.","Our sales from our e-commerce channels continue to grow at an exceptional pace, up 30% globally, more than twice the growth of e-commerce in general. Sales rose double-digits across brand, retailers, and third-party sites, and also grew double digit in every region, driven largely by increased traffic, order size, and conversion. Mobile-driven sales rose significantly and are now a larger portion of our total mix.","We entered Hong Kong, a new market for our online business, with a brand size from GLAMGLOW. And in China, our online sales soared, led by our brands on Tmall. M.A.C. plans to launch on Tmall this quarter, which should provide more fuel for our China business and allow M.A.C. to reach new shoppers in smaller Chinese cities who don't have access to its products in brick-and-mortar stores. Globally, we continue to successfully launch additional brands online in more markets.","Department stores are striving to provide consumers with strong experiences they can't get anywhere else. International department stores remain strong, particularly in Europe and China. We continue to work our \u2013 with our U.S. department stores to create in-store and omni-channel excitement and innovate with product, services, merchandising, and education. We are devoting additional resources to the top doors and promoting in-store events on retailers' websites where, as I just mentioned, our business had been brisk. Research shows the consumer who shop both in-store and online spend more than those who buy in just one channel. We are being proactive with department stores to design strategies to reinvigorate traffic, while addressing productivity challenges in brick-and-mortar.","Now, let me turn to our recent and upcoming innovations. Across our brands, we are focused on the biggest global opportunities, which in Clinique's case means its core products, like moisturizers. Its initial launch of Fresh Pressed serum and cleanser with concentrate Vitamin C was a global hit that garnered terrific attention and demand, and validated the brand's strength to leverage the initial success with a more extensive rollout in the coming months. The serum is used with the brand's moisturizers, which increases their sales as well. Fresh Pressed helped drive improving retail trends for Clinique in China and travel retail.","In another move to strengthen its position in moisturizers, Clinique just introduced a supercharged hydrating formula of Moisture Surge, developed from proprietary (15:45) technology that is expected to elevate the best-selling franchise. Clinique marketing will focus on the instant benefits of Moisture Surge, which has been growing in most markets.","Est\u00e9e Lauder will begin introducing Advanced Night Repair Eye Concentrate Matrix in July. This product, which contains innovative technology based on scientific breakthrough research, repairs the visible signs of aging on eyes to make eyes look refreshed, and features a custom designed massage applicator. It is one of the brand's highest scoring products in testing with consumers. For example, after four weeks of usage, almost 90% of women said their eyes looked more youthful. It will be supported by a 360-degree campaign, based on strong insights from consumers around the world.","In makeup, we are very excited about Est\u00e9e Lauder Double Wear Cushion Compact for Asian market, which will be supported by strong investment in China, and Pure Color Love lipstick, a global launch that is aimed at younger consumers.","M\u2022A\u2022C new Next to Nothing sheer Face Color is a lightweight foundation that makes skin glow. It is being supported with a major social media campaign that is already helping fuel M\u2022A\u2022C sales this quarter.","In fragrance, Jo Malone launched Star Magnolia cologne, which is expected to have wide appeal, and Tom Ford created SOLE DI POSITANO, which evokes my fragrant (17:28) Italian coast.","With the help of our Leading Beauty Forward initiative, we continue to reallocate resources faster, and cut cost deeper, to invest in talent and capabilities that will drive our business in today evolving beauty landscape. This includes social media, digital technologies, retail operations, and analytical expertise. To help leverage both new and existing brands, our brands continue to increase their social media activity and capabilities to engage consumers across numerous digital platforms using influencers, brand ambassadors, and other compelling voices and technologies.","For example, Smashbox collaborated with a popular influencer to help promote its Cover Shot Eye Palette, and the collection became one of the brand's largest launch ever. And in China, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand significantly lifted its makeup sales by leveraging a combination of in-store and social media campaigns. This kind of digital content created by influencers and third-parties is measured in terms of earned media value. In the third quarter, M\u2022A\u2022C remained the second largest beauty brand among prestige and mass makeup players in earned media value in the U.S., as measured by Tribe Dynamics. M\u2022A\u2022C has improved its earned media value share in makeup in each of the last three quarters.","Our brands are also creating inventive digital experience for consumers. For example, a cutting edge technology used by Est\u00e9e Lauder and Smashbox lets consumers virtually apply different lipstick shades, either in real-time or in (19:16).","Our performance this quarter further demonstrated our company strategy, built on multiple engines of growth and leading to agile resource reallocation, when need, is sustainable and working.","Our company has the most desirable portfolio of prestige brands in the industry. And we are (19:38) to strategically deploy them brand across fastest-growing channels and consumer segments around the world.","Importantly, we have the highest quality workforce with extremely capable people committed to our company's success. At the same time, we are reducing costs, redesigned for better sales growth leverage, and reallocating our resources to make priority investment in the most attractive areas that are expected to drive our growth in both the fourth quarter and next year.","As a successful high growth company in a growing industry, we have continued to increase our global share in prestige beauty. And as we enter our fourth quarter, we are further building momentum to deliver another year of strong profitable growth.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2017 third quarter results, and then cover our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges, which are disclosed in our press release this morning.","Net sales for the third quarter were $2.86 billion, up 9% in constant currency compared to the prior-year period. Incremental sales from our most recent acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA contributed approximately 4 points of this growth. And the balance was driven by strong performance in several areas of our business, most notably travel retail, online, China, and our mid-sized and luxury brands.","From a geographic perspective, every region grew sales, led by Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Net sales rose 13% in constant currency in EMEA, led by a 30% increase in global travel retail. The substantial growth in travel retail was supported by an 8% increase in international passenger traffic, as well as further expansion of our makeup and fragrance brands in the best airports.","Notably, our travel retail business in Hong Kong and Macau returned to strong growth in the quarter. We are closely monitoring the political tensions that have curtailed Chinese consumers traveling to South Korea but we do expect the slowdown in this travel quarter to be offset by Chinese consumers traveling to other Asian destinations.","The EMEA region also benefited from strong sales in Italy and the U.K., which rose high-single-digits while most other Western European markets grew mid-single-digits. The region's major soft spot this quarter was the Middle East, where net sales fell again as distributors continue to align their inventory to much weaker retail traffic. This negative sales trend, however, did begin to ease this quarter and is expected to further improve in our fourth quarter as we anniversary the turndown.","Excluding the Middle East, the total EMEA region grew 15%. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 8% in constant currency. Growth was led by China where net sales rose more than 20%. Most of our brands grew double-digit in China this quarter and our online business in China grew more than 70%. We also achieved solid sales growth in Taiwan and Malaysia, and both Japan and Australia rose low-single-digits while sales in Hong Kong continue to stabilize. Net sales in the Americas rose 5% in constant currency.","Latin America sales grew 5%, led by strong growth in Mexico and Chile while Brazil remained challenged. Sales in North America benefited from the addition of our newest brands, Too Faced and BECCA, as well as double-digit growth in both the online and specialty multi-channels. These increases were offset by continued declines in the brick-and-mortar business of department stores, as well as in freestanding stores.","Our gross margin declined 160 basis points from the prior-year period due primarily to adverse product mix, including the impact of the fiscal 2017 acquisitions and the associated inventory step-up related to purchase accounting. Obsolescence was also a slight contributor to the margin decline.","Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 370 basis points, primarily due to lower selling and promotion expenses that reflected our changing channel mix, along with prudent expense management in line with softer sales in U.S. department stores and freestanding stores. General and administrative expenses also declined, reflecting the benefits of our cost savings programs, equity income from our investment in Have & Be Company, and the deferral of some IT and R&D projects to the fourth quarter.","As a result, operating income rose a strong 23%, and operating margin increased by 210 basis points. Net earnings rose 24% to $340 million, reflecting the operating income improvement and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Diluted EPS of $0.91 was 25% above the prior year, and grew 28% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.02 of unfavorable currency translation and $0.02 of dilution from acquisitions.","EPS was higher than anticipated due primarily to the margin accretive sales beat, coupled with disciplined expense management by our teams, and the deferral of some projects to the fourth quarter.","With respect to cash flow and capital allocation, for the nine months, we generated $1.25 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, and we invested $316 million in capital projects. And approximately $1.7 billion in acquisitions. In early February, we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes, which we used to repay outstanding commercial paper and to refinance $300 million in senior notes coming due on May 15. We also continue to return cash to shareholders utilizing $363 million to repurchase 4.2 million shares of our stock, and $361 million to pay dividends.","Now turning to our outlook for the full year, we expect to end fiscal 2017 with sales growth of between 6% to 7% in constant currency, and that reflects approximately two points of incremental sales from the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA. Currency translation is expected to depress reported sales for the full fiscal year by nearly 2 percentage points, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.08 for the euro, $1.26 for the pound, and $1.09 for the yen.","Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.32 and $3.37 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.13 of dilution from currency translation and $0.07 of dilution from the recent acquisitions. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 8% to 9%.","Our sales in the fourth quarter are expected to rise 9% to 10% in constant currency, demonstrating the sequential acceleration in sales growth that we have anticipated throughout the year. The strong fourth quarter increase is expected to come from approximately four points of incremental sales from Too Faced and BECCA, expanded consumer reach for our several brands, particularly in Specialty Multi, online and in our international free standing stores.","Further improvement in Hong Kong as sales are expected to return to positive growth as travel to the area picks up. An easier comparison in the Middle East, as we lap the period of soft retail sales and destocking, and continued momentum in China and other Asia-Pacific markets.","We are also committed to continue to invest behind our strategic priorities. We do plan to invest increased spending in our fourth quarter behind new products and marketing activities, support for the roll-out of the new distribution, such as M\u00b7A\u00b7C and ULTA and some projects in IT and R&D, information technology and research and development that were delayed from the third quarter. We expect fourth quarter EPS of between $0.35 and $0.40. This includes dilution of about $0.03 from currency and about $0.03 from acquisitions.","We are successfully executing against our Leading Beauty Forward initiatives according to plan as Fabrizio mentioned and will continue to reallocate resources to strategic areas of importance.","In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results and are very proud that our organization continues to make great progress on achieving our long-term strategic objectives, while pivoting and successfully reallocating resources when necessary towards the fastest growth areas of our business. In this dynamic, ever-changing global macro environment, our success is a true testament to the collective efforts of our dedicated employees around the world.","And that includes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Our first question today comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking by question, and congrats on a great quarter. So my two questions are on BECCA and Too Faced. First, I wanted to get a sense of what type of growth rates you're currently seeing in those businesses? And then, it sounds like they're both trending above expectations, so just curious what's driving the above expectation performance so far? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So the growth is very, very strong in these two brands. So, it's very strong double-digit growth in each one of the two brands and in every segment they're operating. And what is driving the success is actually same-door sales is a success, which is driven mainly by same-door sales and for the moment, a very small initial distribution deployment. These two brands are really strong and consumer demand is exceptional. And their recent launches are among the most successful launches in the entire marketplace.","And on top of that, for us, the great news are that they attract really new consumers that in the past we were attracting less, particularly Too Faced attract more younger consumers in our portfolio which is great extra business for the company overall. And importantly, they have dramatically increased our penetration in Specialty Multi in the U.S. And this will continue internationally, which is a very important objective because as you all know, the Specialty Multi-Channel globally is one of the fastest growing channels in our sector.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to see if you can kind of elaborate more on basically the Clinique products into ULTA stores and how \u2013 I understand you've been there for five years, and how that learning can be applied to the M\u2022A\u2022C relationship? And along those lines, how you think about any cannibalization of the products within Specialty Multi against department stores.","And second, if you could elaborate more on the fourth quarter guidance for margins, because it seems conservative against your beat of $0.21, and just $0.03 increase over the low-end of the guidance. So if you can give us what is your embedding in terms of investments? I understand from Tracey's comment that you had some R&D that might be pushed over to the fourth quarter. So if you can elaborate more on the investments? And again, congrats on the results.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Thank you. I'll start with answering the ULTA question. So Clinique is very successful in the ULTA channel. And what we have learned is that when Clinique is exposed with all the strengths of the core (32:42) portfolio and the strengths of services to a good growing traffic, the brand responds very, very well. And Clinique is growing both makeup and skin care aggressively in every ULTA door in which the brand is deployed. In terms of what we can learn for M\u2022A\u2022C \u2013 by the way, as I said in my prepared remarks, we plan to increase gradually the number of Clinique doors in ULTA in agreement with our retail partner.","And, as far as the learning for M\u2022A\u2022C, absolutely we have learned a lot for perfecting our upcoming M\u2022A\u2022C execution; also from the Clinique experience. In particular, we have learned the importance of the service aspect, of making sure that the brand is deployed with all the necessarily SKU, assortment SKU, and decorations of the SKUs to the consumer, is the concept of a curated assortment that really fit the consumer, which has been a big learning that will be absolutely applied to every one of our brands.","The good news, that is true for Clinique based on your question, but is true for every other \u2013 our three big brands. Also Lauder is the same. We really attract new consumers and a lot of millennial consumers. So the cannibalization is very, very limited. This consumer, our consumer that were not shopping in the brands before in a large majority, or they were lapsed brand users, because they were not anymore going in channels that \u2013 where the brands today are distributed. So the large majority of the business is net extra business. Tracey?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","And in terms of the fourth quarter. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, because we have some very strong launches coming up in the fourth quarter, we also have a fair amount of consumer reach expansion into Specialty Multi, as well as some of the opening of our free standing stores and other points of distribution in the fourth quarter. And that's where the investment is coming in, in the fourth quarter.","When you look at the \u2013 our expense mix in the fourth quarter relative to last year, it's relatively comparable. And again, our motto certainly here has been to start strong and stay strong. So, a combination of very strong launch and distribution activity in the fourth quarter, and certainly supporting products to accelerate into fiscal 2018 is what the fourth quarter represents.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. First, curious if you guys have detected any change in overall market growth for global prestige beauty from the 4% to 5% it was growing at earlier. And then secondly, a little bit more detail on the U.S. growth, with and without Too Faced and BECCA, and maybe what M\u2022A\u2022C did in North America this quarter? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So on the total M\u2022A\u2022C growth, no. We're not seeing a big change. Overall, it's still between 4% and 5%; probably closer to 4% in this moment than to 5%, but still in the range. And \u2013 but what we have seen a change \u2013 we see a change continuously is where the growth is coming from. And the growth is coming from \u2013 by category \u2013 is coming more from makeup than in the past, as you know. And by recently, in this quarter, the growth is again coming from Asia more than in the previous quarters. And then, certain emerging markets have been more challenged than in the past, like, I don't know, Brazil or Turkey, obviously, and a few others. And so, we see a variation where the growth come from. But what is interesting is actually the total growth is still between 4% and 5%.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","And as far as the North America performance this quarter. As we indicated, the brick-and-mortar channels were pretty challenged, particularly in the U.S., in the third quarter. Excluding Too Faced and BECCA, the North America segment was down in sales, and M\u2022A\u2022C was certainly a contributor to that performance.","The M\u2022A\u2022C team is working very strongly in the U.S. to accelerate performance, both in the department store channel and certainly in their freestanding stores, and has some great programs coming up over the next couple of quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to focus on the comment, Fabrizio, you made on the earned media value for M\u2022A\u2022C picking up in the third quarter. When you look back, what was driving that? Was it new product launches? Was it product placement with influencers? And then I guess just a housekeeping question in terms of the cadence of openings at ULTA. You talked about 25 in June and over 100 by year-end. Should we just kind of model the balance of that in the next quarter? Or how do we think about kind of the next couple of quarters in the calendar year? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So, let me start from this last question, is \u2013 no, is what I said. You should not model it differently; is 25 by June and then 100, and you can assume that the 100 will be equally split, because it's a matter of capability opening. And the opening will be more aggressive as of September, obviously, because of organization and capability things. But this is the total number that we're planning for at the moment. What was the?","Dennis D'Andrea - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Earned media for...","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Ah, the earned media value of M\u2022A\u2022C. So what was driving the improvement of the earned media value of M\u2022A\u2022C is, first of all, the M\u2022A\u2022C activation of many more influencers. And the activation also of M\u2022A\u2022C makeup artist has influenced themselves, which is a unique model created by the M\u2022A\u2022C brand. Meaning M\u2022A\u2022C is, obviously, activity is external influencer, (39:17), but also, many of the very valuable makeup artists of M\u2022A\u2022C influence themselves. And being enabled by a lot of great quality asset to support to do this job around the world, and particularly in the U.S.","The other thing is, activity in this, is M\u2022A\u2022C is back launching hero products. And as you know, a lot of these media value is driven by exciting new products. For example, Next to Nothing launch, which I mentioned in my prepared remark, is an activity which is creating a lot of conversation in the social media arena, which is helping support the brand. We believe this strength will continue. The M\u2022A\u2022C brand is very active among the various changes they're leading in the U.S. market and internationally in increasing the numbers of hero products that will be passed of their deployed portfolio of innovation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for slotting me in. I just want to turn to margins. Your guidance implies that EBIT margins are going to be down for the full-year modestly. Another three year where you kind of fall short of your longer term targets of 40 basis points to 50 basis points. Can we go through some of the drivers? Like, obviously some deleverage in free standing stores, department stores, et cetera. Talk about the size of those, the path forward?","And maybe put a little more teeth on this Leading Beauty Forward program to give us some context of the savings when they can flow? And what it means for margins on the forward? Is this sort of just the new reality that we should get acclimated to service stagnant (41:09) margins? Or is there a path to improve on the forward? Thank you.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Jason. With respect to our margins this year, and I think we had indicated this was the case last year as well. One of the things as you all know that we've been experiencing for the last three years is negative currency impact on our margins. So, in fact, if you look at the guidance that you're referring to, Jason, for this year, we have 80 basis points of improvement in margins. That is being offset by a combination of currency as well as our acquisitions. And so we've had a bit of that experience over the last couple of years as we have done a fair number of acquisitions. But most importantly the currency drag on our margin.","So, yes, we've had deleverage in free standing stores and that's had an impact. We are offsetting much of that with some of the shifts that we are doing in terms of expansion into specialty-multi, and you'll certainly see more of that impact in fiscal 2018.","As it relates to Leading Beauty Forward, when we announced the program about a year ago now, we indicated that the structure of the program is efficiency, effectiveness and redesigning certain organizations to allow us to achieve greater leverage in the future, and leverage implies margin expansion. So, we've delivered 80 basis points of savings from just our cost savings programs this year. Leading Beauty Forward will take another chunk out of our cost base, and also allow us to grow in a more leveraged fashion. And we've got lots of great activity around Leading Beauty Forward.","When we announced the program, and certainly still maintain this, we said that we would not see benefit this year. We will start to see some benefit next year, but it will not impact our margin guidance for next year. And then you'll start to see Leading Beauty Forward lead into our margin results over the following few years until it achieves its full potential and that full potential is $200 million to $300 million.","We will invest a portion of that back but a portion of that will also be dropped to the bottom line. So it is the reason that we have so much activity around Leading Beauty Forward and, as both Fabrizio and I mentioned, it is actually slightly ahead of plan in terms of some of the initiatives under the program as the organization really rallies behind this to not only create some of these leveraged structures from an organizational standpoint, but also build some of the capability for the future support of our strategic objectives.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. I have a couple of quick follow-on questions on M\u2022A\u2022C. First I just wanted to clarify that it did improve sequentially in the U.S? And then in ULTA, I imagine this will be incremental in the top line. But will it be a drag on your margins given some expected cannibalization of your more profitable M\u2022A\u2022C retail stores? I guess how do you balance that?","And then I was curious about a potential halo effect that you might be seeing, broadly speaking, with your new innovation on some of your hero franchises or maybe as you further penetrate new channels, such as specialty-multi with some of your big brands. I guess I'm curious if you're seeing any evidence that Est\u00e9e Lauder customer baskets are increasing? Meaning that your customers are buying more of your portfolio brands and possibly spending more per transaction? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So, let me start from this line. I think we said it in prepared remark and everywhere we comment on this new distribution. The new distribution is bringing new customers. And so we have absolute evidence. That's why we have tested our way first with 30 doors, then in certain areas internationally, the same. We have done this very gradually with a lot of attention. And there is \u2013 the large majority of consumers are new to the brands.","This is true for new distribution, both online in specialty and this is true for a lot of our new innovation which is focused on segments where we have strategic opportunities or strategic gaps. And that's actually been the big strength. And the other information we \u2013 that I have already shared but I want to further clarify it is that the large majority of these new consumers are millennials. And that's true in all these things that we have. We have year-end data that comport all these learnings and then based on this data, we made decision on distribution evolutions around the world.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","In terms of M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S., no, we think some up and down performance as it relates to M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S. So the expectation, obviously, is in the fourth quarter and beyond that the M\u2022A\u2022C performance given certainly the expansion into specialty-multi along with, as Fabrizio said, many of the programs that they're working on and the increase in some of the digital activity that they're doing will start to gradually improve sales in the U.S. And also, as we said, M\u2022A\u2022C is quite strong other than a couple of pockets in international, quite strong in international, particularly in Asia.","And again, in addition to some of the expansion into specialty-multi that's being done here in the U.S. and the work that is going on to grow sales in the freestanding store and distribution \u2013 and department store channel, they're also launching in Asia on Tmall. So we expect next year to be a strong year for M\u2022A\u2022C going forward.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","And then in term of profit dilution of the new distribution, M\u2022A\u2022C is very dependent from traffic. And so if we \u2013 where we are able to create good sales per door, M\u2022A\u2022C is a profitable brand. And so our priority is to stay focused on really making M\u2022A\u2022C a good brand with great sales per door in every single distribution channel and that will make M\u2022A\u2022C \u2013 will keep M\u2022A\u2022C as a very profitable brand. And in term of the overall dynamic, I want again to clarify the \u2013 M\u2022A\u2022C exposure to, in this moment, the declining brick-and-mortar department store traffic is the key issue we are trying to solve.","M\u2022A\u2022C has enormous demand and attention from consumers. It's a very desirable brand. Wherever M\u2022A\u2022C is exposed to traffic, it's performing well. And that's the key issue we are trying to work on. As we said, we have many international pockets where M\u2022A\u2022C is booming. And we need to address the U.S. issue as we have discussed. And I hope you see many of the pivoting activity that we are doing to achieve this goal as fast as possible.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","And the only thing I want to add to that is M\u2022A\u2022C is one of the strongest, if not the strongest, brand online in terms of growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thanks and good morning, everybody. Wanted to go back to the overall category growth question and answer. So obviously, good quarter sequential improvement but still pretty decently below your large peers in terms of absolute organic growth. So I guess I'm curious to what do you attribute this? How much is Americas? The M\u2022A\u2022C commentary that you've touched on, how much is Clinique as a brand that hasn't been touched on but seems like it declined in the quarter? And then how do you think about improving those trends relative to peers? Or do you think this sort of normalize over time as overall growth moves back towards what you're calling 4% to 5% prestige beauty category growth? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Our growth algorithm is 6% to 8% and we are obviously on this trend. And the key point is this industry is not a zero-sum game. All the big companies are growing. And depending by quarter and by year, some are growing a bit less or a bit more, but we all are growing. So the key point is that there is a strong category growth and there is space to grow for a lot of big companies. And they believe that small brands are diluting the growth of big companies is clearly not demonstrated by the facts, because big companies are growing, are growing their brands and enriching their portfolios. If there are some smaller brands which are doing very well, some of them get acquired by the big companies when they have the right rate of return. And so I believe actually this is an environment where many big companies can grow and can grow at the same time in this amazing part of the industry which is prestige beauty.","Now, what do I attribute in the short-term in the last six months, nine months? Our growth be below some of our competitor is frankly 80% U.S. department store traffic. We are the company which has the highest exposure in percentage of our business and in our big brands to U.S. department store traffic. And that's the big thing. And then there are other \u2013 many, many other areas of the world where frankly we are growing faster than many other companies.","And the last point I want to make, we are building market share. So in a market we continue to grow 4% to 5%, we continue to grow market share. This was evident also in the recent Unimonitor (52:02) report for 2016 calendar and is obviously proven by these first quarter numbers where we are growing in constant currency 9% versus the market which is probably closer to 4%. So we keep growing market share. We keep growing well in all over the world and we do have an issue to solve \u2013 to address, which is that U.S. department store traffic and our high penetration of this channel. And we are pivoting to reinforce this channel and at the same time diversify our business in the needed way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. First, we obviously talked a fair bit about M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S. and the increase in ULTA and Sephora, but one of the things I want to know is how much of their issue for M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S. do you think is a function of more competition in the makeup category versus just its retail positioning, particularly with younger consumers that M\u2022A\u2022C has captured for so long. And then perhaps can you give a little bit more detail in terms of what other opportunities are there for other brands in terms of the specialty-multi distribution, not just the smaller faster growing brands, but also the larger ones?","And then following up on that, as more activity moves online into smaller format channels, what's the difference in terms of the purchasing patterns versus your traditional retailers? Obviously, the consumer is younger. They are clearly focused a little bit more on the smaller brands versus the larger brands, but what about like product category, price points and things like that? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Okay. So let's start again. M\u2022A\u2022C is \u2013 there've been some recent research issued that M\u2022A\u2022C is the number one brand loved by teenagers in this market in the U.S., and just been published a research on this. All our consumer data showed that M\u2022A\u2022C is among the preferred brands among the millennials and, frankly, all generations. So M\u2022A\u2022C is a business built to be really very sensitive to traffic.","And that's the key thing we need to do. The brand is in excellent shape, very desirable. And as I said, to demonstrate this, there are markets around the world where the brand this quarter has been growing 40% or 45%, despite the competition being the same. And so it's a very specific opportunity.","Said that, there is definitely a lot of new competition, and every big brand has to face this new competition. On this, I would like to make an \u2013 to do an observation. What we see in the data is that this increasing competition, done by an ever-increasing number of brands, is an increasing competition in the momental (55:06) trial. That is, we don't see increasing competition in the area of loyalty and in the area of retention and repeat, which where the profit is.","Let me explain this. We have, for example, in all our big brands, take Est\u00e9e Lauder with Advanced Night Repair, take M\u2022A\u2022C with Studio Fix, the big hero products in this moment are getting more success and increased repeat, despite the increased competition. What is tougher is to get the attention at the trial moment, because of the many small brands , there's more activity out there (55:42).","But I would like you to think that the trial moment is not the profitable moment. Trial is an investment. Repeat is a profit. And so at the end, the profitable brands are still the big brands with great hero product, great repeat, and not many small brands that generate a lot of noise on trial, because unless they get the repeat, they will not be sustainable.","And so, we are very focused on a sustainable, long-term profitability strategy for our brands, and that's the way we are addressing the issue at M\u2022A\u2022C and the opportunity for all our brands.","So, the second question was specialty-multi, which is an opportunity for many of our brands, and I mentioned many of them in my prepared remarks, exactly to give you maximum exposure to all the pivoting we're doing. Instead of repeating them, I would like just to clarify one point. Every brand has a unique distribution strategy in the Est\u00e9e Lauder Company portfolio.","So, we don't do things by channel. We do things by brand. So, there are brands which are designed to win well in specialty, brands which are designed to be in multiple channels, and brands that are designed to be more exclusive in a certain channel type. And our broad portfolio brands give us the possibility to play this growing multichannel portfolio globally in an excellent strategic way.","The last question was on online, and yes, we see a very different pattern in purchases online. Purchases online tend to be younger and tend to be, frankly, very profitable, because consumers are very loyal when they get into it. There's a lot of good repeat.","But most importantly, the online sales allow us to reach consumers that sometimes we cannot reach with brick and mortar. This is particularly true in emerging markets. I just gave the good example of China, where a good launch of M\u2022A\u2022C in Tmall that will happen this quarter, we know, by all our analysis, that will expose millions of Chinese consumers in cities of Tier 3 or Tier 4, that today cannot buy the brand, to be able to buy the brand. This is true for many other brands in our portfolio, and many of our online activities around the world.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So, I wanted to look at your two heritage brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, and Est\u00e9e Lauder looks like it's clearly stabilizing here. There's another quarter of sales growth in both skin care and makeup globally. What are you learning from that? Because on the flipside, it looks like Clinique is still struggling a little bit, both in skin care and in color, not just in the U.S., but it looks like globally as well. So if you could help kind of figure out what could happen to Clinique, and how you're learning from Est\u00e9e? You mentioned some innovation. Is that really going to be the turning point in Clinique?","And then second thing, Tracey, maybe more for you, on just more quantification on the drivers you'd mentioned regarding SG&A coming down in the quarter. How much of it was a shift in IT spend from this quarter to next quarter? Was there an ad spend shift perhaps, versus how much of it was kind of more permanent, in terms of actually the improved efficiencies from cost cutting or channel mix? Thanks, guys.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Okay. I'll start from the Lauder and Clinique question, and Tracey will take over. So, first of all, Lauder is growing, so it's not stabilized. Lauder has been growing in a very exciting way, in my opinion, this quarter. And this is the second quarter in a row where the Lauder brand is growing globally. What is driving that is successful innovation that is hitting new consumers, combined with an amazing work on relaunching hero products, and that's the key point. I mean, Double Wear is a fantastic foundation product that millions of consumers around the world love. But still, there are millions of consumer that never tried this product. And so, the ability of the brand to continue win with winning hero products is the key learning, and this is working very well.","And, for example, we have learned that Double Wear in specialty-multi attracts Millennials, despite being a foundation that's been there for many years, and being a fantastic product for many years, attract new Millennials to the brand better than maybe specific Millennial launches targeted to Millennial. So we are now ready to leverage these new discoveries on Lauder and continue the acceleration. The third thing which is helping the Lauder brand is that the Lauder brand is more exposed, positively exposed, to the Chinese consumers and to the Asian dynamics than the Clinique brand, for example.","The Clinique brand in the country is more exposed to U.S. department store than any other brand in our portfolio together with M\u2022A\u2022C U.S. But globally, Clinique is more exposed in total. So the key point is that Lauder benefited from the comeback of growth in Asia and it being part of one of the brands, driving the comeback of skin care in Asia. And so the research of Asia, Asia skin care is obviously helping the Lauder brand and in our opinion will continue to grow \u2013 to support the growth of the Lauder brand.","The learning for Clinique are the same, is more hero products, more activity on innovation that on top of building specific new products, build existing hero products, the Pressed Fresh Vitamin C launch is an example of that. Vitamin C is a new product per se, but at the same time create regimen with existing moisturizer of Clinique and so sell and build hero products and we have tested these successfully in the last year.","The art of learning for Clinique is that also Clinique need to accelerate the entrance in growing channels. So also Clinique is further accelerating the expansion in the successful specialty multi-channels where it's playing and online. And so we will continue to do that and, sorry, the last thing on Clinique is the makeup. Clinique is also working to further activate their makeup innovation and activities in fiscal year 2018 that should further boost the brand.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","And in terms of the beat this quarter in the margin leverage that we had this quarter, I would say that about 65% of it is a combination of the sales beat as well as the mix of sales. So, favorable channel mix as well as category mix, as Fabrizio was just saying. We did see a pickup in our skin care category and as you all know, that is our most profitable growth category from a margin standpoint.","And then the balance of it was some shifts in terms of projects, and as well as A&P spend. So, again, we mentioned there were some of the programs that are launching in Q4 that we are spending behind that were initially thought to launch in Q3. The Cushion Compact would be one of those for Est\u00e9e Lauder in China, and so we are spending behind that in Q4. So that's some of the shifts.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcasted.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, our full year comparisons have been adjusted for the impact of the prior year implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative, and the discussion of our financial results and expectations are before restructuring and other charges. You can find the reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website.","During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call.","And I'll turn it over to Fabrizio now.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone.","Our company had a very successful year in fiscal 2016. We delivered excellent financial results with adjusted constant currency net sales growth exceeding 7%, faster than global prestige beauty growth and adjusted earnings per share rose 13%.","We also made progress on our strategic objectives, by farther diversifying our business, strengthening our multiple engines of growth and advancing our creativity and innovation.","This year new products represent nearly one quarter of our sales, an all time high. Additionally, we designed and launched Leading Beauty Forward, a multi-year initiative to increase our efficiency, speed to market and agility.","Our strong performance confirmed our resiliency during a volatile fiscal period that began with MERS in Korea and ended with Brexit in the U.K.","In between we experienced sharp currency fluctuations, disruptive geopolitical events including increased terrorism and slowing economies in some of our key markets.","In global prestige beauty, we also faced tougher competition and change in consumer behavior. Nonetheless, we successfully navigated these new challenges by also strengthening the company's fundamentals, making us confident, we can sustain our strong and profitable growth and achieve our long-term goals.","Our best growth came from our makeup category especially MAC, our luxury brands, the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and the online and specialty multi-channels.","Our ability to grow so strongly in such a dynamic landscape is a testament to our more balanced and better diversified business, and strategic ability to identify and anticipate change in consumers and industry trends. That is what defines and distinguish our company.","In other of our key attributes is our increasing agility. During the year, we saw a variety of markets impacted by unexpected economic, political and social events.","During those times, we made sure our resources were aligned with other areas, having better growth potentials and other key strength is our multiple engines of growth throughout our more than 25 brands based on categories, channels and countries.","These allowed us to achieve double-digit growth in some brands, channels or markets, while balancing lower growth in other areas.","For example continued political unrest in Hong Kong caused a sharp drop in Chinese tourists, who travelled to other countries instead. Our brands quickly responded by increased the range of products appealing to Chinese consumers in key tourist doors in the market they visited across Asia and Europe.","Fiscal year 2016 was also marked by rapid changes in global prestige beauty. Thanks to our 10-year compass, we had anticipated many of the trends and we're well positioned to meet consumer change in desires and shopping habits.","For instance, we've increasingly invested in digital marketing and e-commerce, which was our fastest growing channel this past year. Our global E&M commerce sales surpassed $1 billion for the first time, a milestone we are very proud of and we expect our strong online growth to continue.","We made progress on our strategy as we strengthened many of our brands that diversified our portfolio. Our compass pointed to the growing interest among Millennials for more specialized brands.","So we nurtured the ones in our portfolio into significant competitors. Several of them including Jo Malone, Tom Ford, Smashbox, MAC, La Mer powered much of our growth and gained share.","As makeup sales soared across the industry, Smashbox and MAC grew shapely, driven by their creativity and strong consumer demand. Our specialized luxury brands were big winners and we acquired By Kilian, which strengthens our spending in the fastest growing area on fragrance the ultra prestige tier.","Additionally, we have made minority investments in a successful Korea skincare brand Dr. Jart, which give an interest in a local brand in that very influential market.","Our two big multi-category brands stabilized overall as they each ended the year with flat sales. However, both brands restarted solid growth in makeup. Est\u00e9e Lauder makeup sales rose in every region, led by foundations and lip products, its long standing Double Wear foundation continued to be a best seller worldwide.","In skincare, its innovative Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask helped accelerate sales of the ANR franchise in China and generated buzz and photos on social media. The brand's global net sales reflected strong growth in the European region and energy market, offset by decline in Asia Pacific, largely due to Hong Kong.","Clinique also advanced on many fronts. Its makeup sales were up sharply on a global basis and Pep-Start Eye Cream was a top seller in several markets. Clinique created digital campaigns featuring Millennial influencers that contributed to solid sales growth in the specialty-multi channel and in Europe. These gains were offset by declining in U.S. mid-tier department stores and Hong Kong.","Looking at our business geographically, sales in energy market rose 15% overall and 25% excluding China. To fuel our momentum, we further emphasized our local relevance in products and social media. These past year our brand reached many new consumers in energy markets; Jo Malone entered Brazil for example. We launched our first e-commerce operations in Mexico and La Mer had a terrific growth in Russia.","Our channel strengths reflected industry trends and we invested in areas with the best traffic in growth. Sales in our online business rose 27% reflecting solid gains in brands and retailer sites. We opened more sites for our brands and with retailers globally to widen our product availability. Orders and conversion grew more than 20%.","We continue to selectively expand our brands in specialty-multi retailers globally to broaden our consumer base. For example, in North America, Estee Lauder introduced the Millennial oriented Est\u00e9e Edit collection in Sephora, while Origins launched in select Sephora stores inside JCPenney and plans to roll out to full distribution there this year.","In Europe, Smashbox continued to broaden its prices in Boots in the U.K. and entered the specialty multi-retailer Lot Gardenia beauty in Italy. We strengthened our capabilities, particularly in R&D, information technology, digital and consumer insights.","Across our brands creativity and innovation remained a priority. Approximately 24% of our sales came from new products and our investment in research and development climbed in line with our sales growth.","Our global patent portfolio has increased 40% in the last four years, primarily in skin care and strategic areas with high consumer interest. Our newest patents covers technologies that will anchor high quality products that we expect to a broad appeal in the light global consumers.","We also launched Leading Beauty Forward to reduce costs and free app resource to invest in the areas that will help fuel our growth, including retail, innovation, digital, social media and new consumer phasing activities.","In this fast paced environment, we want to improve our speed and flexibility as we go-to-market and serve global consumers and creative contemporaries ways.","In this new fiscal year, our actions fall into two broad areas. The first is increasing the reach of our target consumers throughout wide space opportunities across geographies and channels.","The second, is enhancing our consumer engagement, with new experiences and innovative high quality products and services, which will encompass digital marketing, disruptive in-store merchandising, compelling creativity and Omni-channel offering.","Our brands had numerous opportunities to attract new consumers in every region. M\u2022A\u2022C is one of our largest brand, but isn\u2019t as widely distributed as other brands. It has approximately one tenths the doors of Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique and about half the distribution of several direct global competitors. So there are millions of untapped new consumers, the brand can potentially reach.","Many of our small and medium sized brands are now poised for global expansion. For example, in travel retail, Jo Malone today is available is less than half of Tier 1 airports. So there is a lot of runway left to reach additional travelling consumers.","Online, Jo Malone has e-commerce website in just eight countries, compared to 26 for Clinique. In fact Jo Malone expect to launch E&M commerce in approximately 10 new markets this year.","As our consumer coverage increases, we are carefully watching same-store sales growth as well. We expect new points of distribution, same-store growth and pricing to each contribute approximately the same amount to our total sale growth this year.","Freestanding stores are expected to account about one third of our new distribution this year. As our brands broaden their reach, they will emphasize fast growing image building channels. In the online world, our focus is on mobile and omni-channel. Consumer expect a seamless integrated experience across channels, platforms and social media.","We are implementing new technology and digital experiences including online booking for each store appointments, omni-channel loyalty programs and high touch mobile services. With sales in specialty multi retailers on a fast track, we will increase the number of doors, we are in and widen the scope of our brands in the channel to reach the consumer who shop there.","For example Clinique plans to roll out more ULTA locations and enter some Sephora store inside JCPenney. Estee Lauder meanwhile will reach new shoppers with a curated selection of products in ULTA, in 30 stores and on ULTA\u2019s website.","In travel retail global passenger traffic is forecasted to grow mid single digit. We expect our net sales to surpass traffic growth, led by many of our midsized brands that have opportunities to enter additional airports all over the world.","We are working closely with department stores to bring more traffic to beauty, both in store an online. We will elevate the consumer experience in department stores with differentiated customized services such as makeup lessons from our expert advisors for which there is a strong demand.","Although department store had been challenged in the U.S., they continue growing internationally including the U.K., Western Europe, Australia, Canada or Latin America. Social media is integral to every beauty brand today and an important component in winning with Millennials.","To engage consumers, our brands plan to utilize more global and local influences, beauty consultants and makeup artists to amplify their messages, Est\u00e9e Lauder is collaborating on a makeup collection with fashion designers and influences Victoria Beckham and she is promoting it to her 12 million Instagram followers.","Our brands are increasing their media spending and devoting more resources to digital, which allows them to target their communications to potential new consumers with relevant messages, thanks to better data and new technologies.","Approximately 30% of our total advertising spending is now digital, up 15% from last year. Our brands are doing interesting activities in the digital space. Est\u00e9e Lauder launched the interactive global content network based in New York. It was like a news room and Bobbi Brown held its first live video on Facebook, celebrating its 25th anniversary and a new campaign, which attracts nearly one million viewers.","Innovation remains paramount, as our brands pursue high growth sub categories. One area is skin care with instant benefit such as masks from some of our brands that make skin glow. In addition Clinique's Pep-Start HydroBlur moisturizer irritates and blurs skinning perfections on the spot and Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme Plus Wake Up Balm creates instant morning radiance.","We plan to accelerate our growth in skin care. The recent launch of Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair ampoules should help drive the brand's important franchise. Clinique created a collection around Pep-Start, with the additional moisturizer cleansers and La Mer is rolling out a new formula of its core moisturizing line.","With new innovations and consumer engagement activities, we believe we can further strengthen our leading position in makeup. Estee Lauder is building on its Double Wear foundation with an innovative cushion stick. Clinique introduced Super Balanced Silk Makeup, an entry price foundation with sun protection and M\u2022A\u2022C instant curl lash mascara as a customizable brush.","We also plan to propel our fragrance business, particularly in the ultra prestige tier where we have a large desirable portfolio.","Jo Malone highly anticipated major fall launch is Basil & Neroli and Tom Ford newest entry in its senior collection is Orchid Soleil. Prestige beauty is a driving consumer area and its growth continues to exceed mass beauty in key countries.","Underlining demographic trends are positive. The mid-class in energy markets, Millennials and Ageless Consumers had a big appetite for prestige beauty and those populations are increasing.","We operate in an unpredictable global environment and carefully monitor ongoing issues such as the ramification of Brexit on our business. We are aware that unforeseen challenges will arise. However, we have comfort in knowing that we have many strengths that underpin our financial performance.","Our diversified business is anchored by multiple engines of growth, a wealth of creativity and the ability to quickly react and adapt to events and trends, making us optimistic about our long-term success.","Over the next three years, we expect to generate sales growth of 6% to 8% and double-digit EPS increases in constant currency. This year we expect to once again outplace global prestige beauty growth and gain share despite external headwinds and challenges.","In fiscal 2017, we forecast constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% with double-digit EPS growth. I want to thank my executive team and every one of our employees for their hard work and passion. They are one of the key reasons we have performed so well and continue to be so confident about our future.","Now I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Thank you, Fabrizio and good morning, everyone. First I will review our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full year financial results and then cover our expectations for the fiscal 2017 first quarter and full year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges.","Additionally, the fiscal 2016 full year comparisons have been adjusted for the impact of the prior year implementation of our strategic modernization initiative.","Net sales for the fourth quarter were $2.65 billion, up 7% in constant currency compared to the prior year. Incremental sales from our newest brand acquisitions contributed approximately 50 basis points of this growth.","Our business was quite strong in Europe, the Middle East and Africa despite macro events in France, Germany and Turkey as well as the U.K. Brexit vote.","Net sales rose 12% in constant currency with double-digit growth in most countries notably the U.K., Germany and most of the region's emerging markets. Our sales declined in France due to a large drop in tourism and in the Middle East because of continued economic uncertainty.","Our global travel retail channel delivered an 11% net sales increase, reflecting strong retail trends in many tourist destinations, partially offset by continued weakness in Hong Kong and in Brazil.","Currency volatility and terrorist activity continue to effect travel and consumption patterns and we saw a moderation in passenger traffic to Europe in the quarter. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 6% in constant currency. Australia was a stand-out growing strong double-digits while China, Korea and Japan grew mid to high single digits. Our net sales in Hong Kong continue to decline, but less than in the previous quarter.","Net sales in the Americas increased 3% in constant currency. Latin America grew more than 20% led by Mexico and Brazil and Canada rose mid-single digits. Sales in the U.S. rose low single digits.","Our sales through both online and specialty multi-channels continue to rise double digits. However declines in tourist-driven retail doors and contained weakness in the Brick and Mortar business of mid-tier department stores curtailed growth.","Make-up sales again led product category growth, rising 12% in constant currency. M\u2022A\u2022C, Smashbox, Clinique, Bobbi Brown and Tom Ford achieved double-digit make-up growth and Est\u00e9e Lauder rose mid-single digits. Foundation, lip products, kits and palettes have been very popular among all consumers.","Hair care sales increased 5% in constant currency. Aveda benefited from the launch of Invati for men products and Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in Germany and in France.","Skin care sales grew 3% in constant currency, led by growth from La Mer and Origins. These increases were partially offset by Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, reflecting continued weakness in U.S. mid tier department stores as well as in Hong Kong.","Sales of fragrance products rose 2% in constant currency. Jo Malone was the largest contributor to growth as sales rose strong double digits. Our recent acquisitions Le Labo and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle are growing rapidly and By Kilian provided incremental sales.","Our gross margin was unchanged from the prior year. Favorability from pricing, lower obsolescence and supply chain savings were offset by channel mix, currency and new products. Operating expenses as a percent of sales declined 10 basis points.","Higher store operating cost associated with our retail store growth was offset by lower selling and shipping cost and cost savings from our SMI program. As a result, operating income rose 7% and operating margin improved 10 basis points.","On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 9%. Net earnings increased 7% to $163.1 million, diluted EPS of $0.43 was 9% above the prior year, reflecting higher earnings and a small benefit from a lower share count and lower effective tax rate.","Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.04 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.01 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 11%.","Switching to our full year, details of our performance are largely covered in the press release, so I will focus on some of the highlights. With strong net sales up 7%, our gross margin improved 10 basis points. Manufacturing favorability and lower obsolescence were partially offset by product category mix and currency.","Our full year operating margin declined 40 basis points to 15.5%. While the decrease included slight dilution from the recent acquisition of By Kilian, the decline was almost entirely driven by 50 basis points from the impact of adverse currency.","We continue to benefit from our cost savings and sales growth leverage. We ended fiscal 2016 with an effective income tax rate of 28.3%, a 200 basis point improvement from the prior year.","Net interest expense rose to $55.1 million from $45.7 million in the year earlier, reflecting the increase in debt from our May 2016 bond issuances, partially offset by higher investment income.","In fiscal 2016, we realized approximately $135 million in restructuring and other charges, $54 million of it related to the transformation and modernization of our global technology infrastructure, which is largely complete and approximately $81 million in charges for our leading Beauty Forward initiative.","Operating cash flow was $1.79 billion, representing a slight improvement over the prior year, adjusted for the SMI shift. We invested $525 million in capital projects, two thirds of which was in consumer facing areas such as counters, retail stores and E&M commerce sites.","We repurchased 10.5 million shares of our stock for $890 million and paid $423 million in dividends to stock holders, increasing our dividend rate by 25%. In total, we returned approximately 104% of free cash flow to stock holders, contributing to our 6.4% total stock holder return for the fiscal year, which compares with 4% for the S&P 500 for the same period.","Additionally, we invested in an acquisition in a minority interest and we increased our balance sheet leverage by issuing $600 million in senior notes at favorable rates.","Overall, we're very pleased with the performance we delivered in fiscal 2016. Our 7% net sales growth and 13% EPS growth in constant currency are strongly aligned with our long term goal and we've laid the foundation for more efficient and effective organization to leverage growth with the launch of leading Beauty Forward.","Now looking ahead over the next few years, we plan to continue to focus on our strategic priorities with an even greater emphasis on speed and agility in the context of a rapidly evolving prestige beauty landscape.","The recent Brexit vote has added a layer of uncertainty that will mostly likely not be fully understood for some time and we believe the risk of other economic and political disruptions will remain high as we start our new fiscal year.","Nevertheless, our strategies are sound and as a result over the next three years, we expect our business to continue to become even more balanced and diversified by product category, brand, geography and channel.","Prestige beauty is expected to grow at 4% to 5% annually for the next few years and we remain committed to our goal of exceeding the growth of global Prestige beauty by at least one percentage point annually.","We also expect to continue to drive value from our existing cost saving programs and we expect to begin realizing some of the initial benefits from leading Beauty Forward in fiscal 2018 and generate annualized net benefit of $200 million to $300 million upon full implementation of the program.","With the recent approvals of the first initiatives under leading Beauty Forward, we can now develop more effective organization structure to enable increasing improvements in consumer engagement for our brands as well as develop more efficient and effective processes for many of our corporate functions, including the initial organization design of a potential shared service report structure.","We expect to approve further initiatives throughout the next two years. All of these efforts should permanently reduce the run rate of the areas that addressed under the program and provide funds for continued investment and capabilities that more directly support the sustainability of our profitable topline growth.","It is more important than ever that we maintain the financial and operational flexibility to compete effectively in the dynamic prestige beauty industry. We must be able to nimbly allocate the appropriate amount of resources as consumer preferences, travel quarters and exchange rates continually shift.","Balancing cost savings, sales leverage and reinvestment for future growth we expect operating margin expansion of approximately 110 to 150 basis points in constant currency through fiscal 2019.","We remain committed to our goal of growing EPS double digits in constant currency each year, which we have delivered consistently for the last seven years. Working capital improvement also continues to be a focus and we expect improved cash to cash cycle performance across accounts payable, accounts receivable and inventory.","Over the next three years, we plan to free up over $400 million in additional cash, which would increase our growth and cash flow from operations in excess of our earnings growth.","We are targeting inventory days to sell of approximately 150 days by the end of fiscal 2019, a market improvement from today's levels. Now let me focus on our outlook for the fiscal 2017 full year and first quarter.","In fiscal 2017, sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 7% in constant currency. We expect all product categories and regions to grow led by the makeup category and the EMEA region.","By channel, growth is expected to continue to be strongest in online, specialty multi, freestanding stores and travel retail. As Fabrizio mentioned, several of our brands will accelerate their expansion in specialty multi retailers and online, which should enable us to reach new consumers as they increasingly shop multiple channels for prestige beauty products.","The impact of this activity and the cadence of our new product launches are expected to produce stronger topline growth subsequent to our first quarter. Our estimate reflects current spot rates given the recent volatility we have experienced the last two years. Those spot rates are 112 for the Euro, 131 for the Pound and 101 for the Yen.","We continue to achieve cost savings from our SMI program. In fiscal 2017, we expect to generate approximately $150 million in savings primarily from indirect procurement, AMP optimization, supply chain initiatives and selling effectiveness, some of which will be used to invest behind our newly acquired brands and Onmi-channel capabilities.","We anticipate our tax rate will range between 28% and 29%, diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.38 and $3.44 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.08 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 10%.","In fiscal 2017, we expect to take restructuring and other charges of $80 million to $100 million with about $35 million to $45 million in the first quarter. We expect to update these estimates when additional initiatives are improved and as a reminder, total program cost beyond fiscal 2017 over multiple years are anticipated to be in the $500 million to $600 million range.","In fiscal 2017, we expect cash flow from operations of approximately $1.8 billion relatively flat with last year with the inclusion of the impact of leading Beauty Forward. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $550 million or 4.5% to 5% of sales.","With respect to our capital structure, we have room to grow our dividend while maintaining a sustainable payout ratio and as of June 30 we had approximately 18 million shares remaining on our buyback authorization. We will continue to assess the need for greater leverage to support our strategies including shareholder returns.","For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect sales to rise approximately 2% to 3% in constant currency. Translation could hinder growth by approximately one percentage point. We expect our small to mid-sized brands to continue to be strong contributors in many global markets owing to their increasing appeal with multiple consumer groups across various channels.","We also expect continued growth to be generated in many developed and emerging markets, particularly in Europe. Partially offsetting these growth drivers in the quarter are some macro issues that we expect to impact our results.","Our U.S. business continues to be affected by low traffic in mid-tier department stores and tourist-driven doors and we are facing a difficult comparison to the prior year quarter, which was our strongest quarter in the U.S. when Estee Lauder and Clinique launched major skincare products and M\u2022A\u2022C had exceptionally strong results.","Our cadence of product launches reflects smaller programs for all three in this year's first quarter. The Middle East is projected to decline as distributors adjust inventory levels to reflect sluggish consumer spending and we are experiencing weak sales in France as a threat of terrorism curtails travel and domestic spending in the near term.","For the first quarter, our EPS forecast is between $0.73 and $0.77 before restructuring charges. The adverse currency translation on sales for the first quarter equates to about $0.03 of EPS. And as a reminder, the size and quarterly cadence of our new product launches and our programs changes from year-to-year. We continue to focus on delivering annual results in our overall long-term sales and profit growth plans.","We look forward to another successful year ahead for our company and for our brands. We are fortunate to operate in one of the highest demand consumer categories today. Our brands are among the most desirable in the industry and we believe our team is the most talented in the industry with their incredible creativity, passion for the business and depth of knowledge on what products consumers aspire to have.","This winning formula continues to support our confidence and our plan, despite a volatile, political, economic and currency environment.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. We will be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey good morning folks. Thank you for the question.","Fabrizio Freda","Good morning, Jason.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Hi Jason.","Jason English","Hello. So I guess two questions if I could and both are margin related. It seems like just sort of backing into the implied margin, I apologize to give the detail in some of the prepared remarks, but it looks like you're looking for a flat margin year at the EBIT line this upcoming year.","Is that true and if so, what are some of the puts and takes that get you there and then sticking on margins, there was really good progress a couple of years ago and seeing fragrances march higher, we had a setback last year, we've kind of stalled that margins this year with some weakness in the back half of this year, maybe what's going on with the margin progression and the plans to improve profitability on fragrances.","Tracey Thomas Travis","So in terms of the overall margin, it's impacted primarily by currency again this year. So this is the third year in a row where we had a fairly significant impact from a margin standpoint on currency and that\u2019s the primary driver.","We certainly have some of the mix impact related to makeup and skin care going on as well this year. So some of it is mix impact and some of it is the currency impact. As I indicated, we still do have our cross savings programs to offset a lot of the unfavorability that we are experiencing and we continue to work on other initiatives to improve the margin.","On fragrance, one of the things that we've spoken about Jason in the past is, much of our growth is coming from some of our fragrance brands that have higher margin characteristics. So Jo Malone is a very profitable fragrance brand for us.","Our newer acquisition because of some of purchase accounting don\u2019t yet have the margin characteristics of Jo Malone, but we certainly expect that they will once we get pass the purchase accounting impact in the next year or two.","Jason English","Awesome. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink from Piper Jaffray.","Steph Wissink","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up question on Leading Beauty Forward, could you just give us some sense of the cadence of the savings and the reinvestment?","Should we assume on a quarterly basis that they're pretty well in sync or will there be some timing inconsistencies we should be planning for based on the cost and on the reinvestment? Thank you.","Tracey Thomas Travis","So, this what we had spoken about as it relates to Leading Beauty Forward, we don\u2019t expect to see any savings from the program until next year. So this year we don\u2019t expect to see savings from the program.","As far as the restructuring this year, it could be a bit lumpy in terms of quarter-to-quarter depending on when say projects are approved under the program.","And just a reminder in the program we are doing a fair amount of org redesign. So there are a lot of costs upfront in order to realize the savings so that we can actually more permanently reduce cost going forward. So that\u2019s a bit of what\u2019s going on fiscal '17 as it relates to Leading Beauty Forward.","We will start to see savings in fiscal '18 or in fiscal '19 and beyond fiscal '19 is when we expect to achieve those run rate savings of net $200 million to $300 million.","Steph Wissink","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA.","Caroline Levy","It has to be on China, I was just wondering if you could help understand what you're seeing in Hong Kong and Greater China as whole, because one of the calls we are making is that there\u2019ll just be more Chinese travelling domestically.","Do you have the travel retail setup within China that will help you there or do you have to build the traditional stores to capture the Chinese who are not travelling outside as much as there were?","And then just within Korea, I think you're already lapping MERS, so just -- I was just wondering if you expect accelerating growth there? I know you're doing much better you're growing, but are you seeing some good trends there?","Fabrizio Freda","So Caroline, we love your questions about China. So the answer is yes. I think you are right. First of all, the amount of consumer or Chinese consumer travelling abroad is very solid, as you know is well above 100 million this year, 117 millions is the numbers, we calculate and is growing.","So first of all there is no at least in our knowledge any reduction of travelling. Now where they travel, you are absolutely right. Less of them travel to Hong Kong and more of them travel to different destination internationally. That is also true, that there is an enormous increase of travel within China and we are very well positioned.","We have -- as you know there are duty-free areas within China where we are very strong. For example Hainan Island that are increasing and there is more travelling there. On top of that, the fact that consumer travel touristically within the country offer us the possibility or continue building distribution in territory and four tier cities, where we are enjoying this internal travel, which obviously in this case is not duty-free.","So both are true, continue increase of external travel and increase of internal travel and we are capturing to both opportunities. As far as Korea is concerned, we are doing very well in Korea.","We are growing, for the year we\u2019ve been growing more than the market. So we build market share and we continue to see very strong growth also in the Seoul Airport and so the Korea trend in fiscal year '16 has been very, very strong.","And we expect the Korea market to continue to have a strong influence on Asia in general and that the Korea consumers continue to be a high demanding consumers that we use also to as a benchmark for the kind of new ideas and new products that we go to launch in Asia or globally.","Tracey Thomas Travis","And Caroline, we do see in the first quarter in addition to we are lapping, as I mentioned very strong growth in the quarter last year from the Middle East and France and softer performance this quarter for obvious reasons that we spoke about. We are seeing very strong growth in Korea in the first quarter because we are lapping MERS.","Caroline Levy","That\u2019s great. And could you touch on Hong Kong little? Just what you see happening?","Fabrizio Freda","Hong Kong, as we said in the prepared remarks is we continue to see decline in Hong Kong. We continue to see reduced flow of tourists, but we see increased purchase, and increased business with local consumers.","So Hong Kong continues to lose tourist and continue to have a solid actually increasing business with local consumers. So I believe the market is in a transition and the same for Macau and so we see declines, but declines in lower levels than declines we saw before.","Caroline Levy","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Astrachan from Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Yes, thanks and good morning, everybody. Fabrizio, wanted to ask about your acquisition strategy and your thoughts on whether continuing to purchase small brands makes sense, particularly it seems your larger competitors are making some larger scale deals.","And then also could you discuss fragrances? Where you're focused compared to doing makeup, which seems to be a focus of some of your competitors as well as perhaps skin care where you make a play perhaps for the improvement in that category relative to levels in recent years.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. First of all we agree. It\u2019s not about buying small brands. That\u2019s not a strategy. The strategy was to create a portfolio of the high-end artisanal fragrances that combined could change really the market and that make the fragrance market again a market of high-end consumer demand driven brands that can inspire the consumer in the world of fragrance and make so the company, the company with the best portfolio in this growth area of the future.","That was the acquisition strategy there. It\u2019s not about small brands or big brands. It was about building the most amazing portfolio of artisanal fragrance brands, and we have done this.","So you are also right that there is a growing makeup business around the world. We already have an amazing portfolio than with some of our competitors didn\u2019t have.","So we had M\u2022A\u2022C, Bobbi Brown, Smashbox. By the way, Smashbox was the first acquisition that we\u2019ve done. It was exactly makeup, but we agree with you that the future will see opportunities to continue growing in makeup and there will be opportunities for more makeup brands in our portfolio.","And in terms of skin care, we purchased GLAMGLOW, which is a skincare brand. And it\u2019s a skin care brand, although small, but it\u2019s a skin care brand in our opinion with great potential to grow to become big and also it\u2019s focused exactly on the new skin care trend. So instant benefits by masks and specialty multichannel dynamics.","And finally, we purchased a minority interest is one what is the fastest growing skin care brands in Korea today, which is Dr. Jart, which was exactly the strategy. So I believe that the point is that strategy is not about fragrances or small brands. The strategy is about acquiring brands that fill strategic opportunities in our portfolio and this will continue to be the strategy.","Mark Astrachan","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. I just wanted to follow up then. So from a M\u2022A\u2022C or your overall makeup portfolio standpoint, are you seeing any impact from your competitors doing deals like not to name specifics, but obviously, L\u2019Oreal has talked about some of the brands that they are growing quite exponentially?","Fabrizio Freda","Our M\u2022A\u2022C brand has been growing double digit very strong globally in fiscal year '16, and we expect M\u2022A\u2022C to continue to grow double digits globally also in fiscal year '17 is a super strong brand.","And as a lot of markets where M\u2022A\u2022C is growing 20%, 30%, there are so many more consumers that the brand has now reached, so there is full potential. The competitiveness of the U.S. market in makeup has definitely increased. And in fact, we see the need of increasing the competitiveness in the makeup also activity of M\u2022A\u2022C in the U.S.","But, for example, we saw the same opportunity on those in Clinique a year ago and I just want to repeat that in the last 12 months, loaded Clinique makeup in the U.S. grew double digits showing that when we focus on a specific market and specific area, we can get the results. So yes, but there is an opportunity there and we are very focused on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Great, thank you. You guys have obviously done a great job over the years of growing well ahead of the category, and Q1 expectations are for a fairly massive slowdown.","So can you talk through -- you\u2019ve already talked through some of the things that will impact Q1, but can you talk about the order of magnitude of things that will get better to get you from the two to three back up to the six to seven like how much is the new distribution like the JCP relationship, ULTA, etcetera versus new store openings and improvement in macro, travel, retail, innovations.","So, if you could just kind of talk about order of magnitude of those things and then I\u2019ll have a follow-up.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah, sure, I\u2019ll start and then please Tracey are there any perspectives. So the building blocks of fiscal year \u201817 and that's the best way I can address your question. The building block is that the first building block is pricing and as I said, out of the 6%, 7%, about two points will be pricing.","A lot of the price increases of the year happened in January, and so already these 2% of pricing is skewed towards more the second part of the year.","Then think of the distribution. So the second 2% of increase of the year is greater distribution reaching new consumers around the world. Now many of these new distribution, including the one in specialty that you just mentioned, are going to happen after October.","Many of the freestanding stores in Europe that we've had the majority of the freestanding store we\u2019re going to open will happen in that period and many of the new specialty multi doors in the U.S. will happen after October.","So that\u2019s the second difference, that second positive which is going to happen more skewed ahead in the fiscal year versus the first quarter. The third big point is as I said before to the previous question, we have a very solid new fragrance portfolio in the high end. Now this fragrance portfolio, as you know tend to have a huge opportunity to grow during holiday periods.","And so all the holiday periods, they\u2019re not only Christmas, but also Valentine, Mother Day happen to be after the October and this will be another big extra acceleration element which is later in the fiscal year. Then we have all our innovation programs.","As Tracey said in her prepared remarks, our innovation schedule change in the year, we have less blockbuster initiative this year because we believe the consumer and the social media environment, which is developing, need more diffusion of newness versus blockbuster approach.","So a lot of the innovation is more skewed as of October. In our portfolio, this is the other building block on the same door that will impact the same door 2%, 3% of progress that we see in the year.","Then as I said, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique are on an improvement trends and we expect Est\u00e9e Lauder Clinique to continue to improve and M\u2022A\u2022C U.S. is expected to continue to improve in the second part of the year and so all these factors will improve the comp part of the fiscal year. So a lot of good steps that we believe will over the year accelerate.","The last thing I want to say of that is that we have proven just the year with fiscal year '16 that we finished, we grew two of the quarters more than 8% and another quarter 5%. So we have proven that we have the capability, the potential to grow at 8% plus in the quarters where all the key elements of our building blocks start acting together.","Olivia Tong","Thank you. That's pretty helpful. Two follow-ups, first, can you provide how many doors you opened in the quarter. And then just the incremental distribution that you spoke to obviously it helps grow sales, but how do you assess the risk, the potential risk to the prestige of the brand for Clinique going into more value to your department store.","And then just generally how do you view the door expansion potential for Clinique and modern brands beyond some of the specialty multi -- the incremental doors that you\u2019ve talked about I think you said 30 doors for Estee. How much more opportunity -- Estee Lauder brand, how much more opportunities do you see there? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","First of all we see many opportunities around the world on reaching new consumers. So it's not about diversification of distribution. It's really about reaching new consumers, and reaching where the traffic of prestige consumers are.","We don't plan to reach consumer. We shall not interest in the prestige. We don't plan to distribute in any area where prestige or luxury is not well presented.","And we do not plan to distribute anywhere where this service quality will not beat the level of prestige. So we continue to be completely focused on luxury prestige distribution, that means great environment, the right target consumer and the right service level.","However the world is evolving, that word is changing, and there are many new opportunities online, specialty travel retail, freestanding stores and obviously some very promising new activities also in the department store world.","And we are focusing on all of them and wherever there is growth of prestige consumer. So that really distracts you. What you see in the specific examples we are sharing are the immediate next steps. These are immediate next steps for the long term strategies.","So the answer to your question, there are more and more opportunities over the year to continue reacting in that direction and then, Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Yes, so Olivia, I want to make sure that we clearly answer the question. When we have quoted door counts in the past, we're really talking about retail stores, in some cases our company operated stores and in some cases our total store count, which includes our third party operated stores as well.","So when you asked the question about how many doors we opened in the fourth quarter, we opened 35 of our company-operated retail stores in the fourth quarter. We opened a little over 170 of those stores in the full year.","We also open third party stores as well in the year and as Fabrizio indicated, of our total distribution growth that's about third of the growth of that 2% distribution is freestanding stores.","So they're becoming a bigger part of our overall base of total sales, but still the largest drivers of our growth are our comp performance and certainly the contribution to innovation.","Fabrizio Freda","And Olivia the other number is that the sum of the freestanding store that Tracey just described in fiscal year '16 grew 11% sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","Hi good morning, everyone.","Fabrizio Freda","Good morning.","Bill Schmitz","I'm not understanding the negative mix, because it seems like the most profitable brands and the most profitable regions are the ones that are growing the fastest. So why is there negative mix in the P&L?","Tracey Thomas Travis","So it's a couple of things, and we have a lot of mix impact in the P&L. So it can be a bit challenging, but if you just look at our category margins, makeup is a very high category margin for us as is skincare.","Skincare is a little bit higher than makeup. So when you see the disproportionate growth of makeup, which is happening in the industry and certainly we're both driving and benefiting from and the slowdown that we've seen in skincare it does have a mix impact. So that is a piece of it.","The other pieces that Hong Kong is a quite profitable area of the world for us from a sales perspective, sales and profit perspective in that region. And the double digit declines that we've seen in Hong Kong have also had an impact.","So there's a geographic impact of the Middle East would be the same. So there's a geographic impact and then there's a category impact from a mix standpoint that we have experienced.","We have and the team has done a tremendous of offsetting that impact with our cost saving programs and other choices that we have made in order to continue to grow double digit EPS growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Yes. Good morning. First one is actually just on the point of double-digit growth and this was the case on last year's fourth-quarter call as well. But, Fabrizio, twice you've mentioned for fiscal '17 an expectation of double-digit local currency earnings growth, but at the same time, twice it has been mentioned that the guidance is 8% to 10% local currency.","So I just wanted to clarify which it really is, understanding there are risks on the table and macro fact that it is 8% to 10% versus double digit is two different things.","The second thing is around cost savings. So I believe for fiscal '16 you started the year expecting $200 million of SMI-related savings. You lowered that to $175 million for the year I think back in May and then as look into fiscal '17 you're talking about $150 million.","So it feels like some of those expected savings aren't achievable for some reason, something's changed because I would've thought maybe it was a delay in timing. But something with SMI it just feels like perhaps the savings are not quite what had been anticipated even 12 months ago. Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah. Thank you for your question. I\u2019ll answer the first part. 8% to 10% -- as 10% at the top of the range which is double-digit. So our point is that we are committed to do our best to deliver double-digit and as usual if we give you a range, we are committed to do our best to reach the top of the range.","But to tell you 8% to 10% in this moment in time at the beginning of the fiscal year where there are so many volatility out there and so many social political situations that we have also explained in our remarks, we are basically acknowledging that there are some risks and so that\u2019s what 8% to 10% means.","But does not take anything away from our commitment to do all what we can to deliver the double-digit meaning the 10% and so that's simply the way we see that and then Tracey you want to add.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Yes. So on SMI we\u2019re actually pleased with our SMI program and we did set a target of $200 million for -- some programs get off to a bit of a slower start given the volatility that we were managing through in the year. So we ended at $185 million. $150 million and again we're talking about year-over-year cost reduction.","At some point as you start to go further and deeper on some of these initiatives, there is going to be less opportunity clearly when we initiated the second phase of our savings program, we went after the biggest opportunities first. And then you start to see that weighing down.","Hence the reason why we announced Leading Beauty Forward, which certainly will generate more savings in future years as the SMI savings start to narrow a bit.","So I think we are right on track with respect to where we expect to be in terms of SMI savings and we certainly will always strive. We have a very competitive team. So we always strive to exceed what we -- what our targets are.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein Research.","Ali Dibadj","Hey guys. I want to ask a short-term question and a long-term one, going back to some of the questions from earlier. One is still on your 2017 guidance, 6% to 7% constant currency, 8% to 10% on the bottom line. I guess I'm still not convinced that the margins you are projecting are flat because of currencies, and maybe dispel me of that confusion because it looks like it's less than 1% of an impact on your top line for the year.","You talk about $0.08 on the EPS line, but that's like 2.5% of EPS so that's a very large multiplier, much bigger than we would've expected. So trying to get a sense of why that's the case.","And even that, by the way, doesn't explain the margin structure being flat given all the cost-cutting that you're doing, the good cost-cutting that you doing. So that's question one.","The other one is I do want to go back to a question in terms of distribution expansion into Sephora and Sephora in JCPenney, into ULTA with Estee Lauder, which I think we would have said 10 years ago, if ULTA had existed, would have been crazy, Jo Malone pushing more.","We have seen a lot of not the same, but analogous issues. Just recently Coach, as an example, said, look, we are pulling back from department stores again, slightly different issue because they were discounting a lot. But we've heard this before from Tommy, Burberry, Ralph Lauren, as Tracy knows very well.","And you look at this a lot, guys, so I want to get a sense of how you are looking at it. Appreciate your thoughts on this, because there is a concern that at some point you are going to get rid of the scarcity; at some point you're going to massify the brand, which drives the brand erosion and you kind of lose a little bit of that prestige.","So given some of those analogies, can you explain kind of long term how much longer do you have before you start hurting the brand? Thanks on those two, short and long term.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Okay, Ali, so let me start with your questions with respect to merger. So currency is another big impact and we gave you the spot rates that we\u2019re using, which again certainly could change during the course of the year. But rather than us predicting how that will change, we\u2019re using current spot rates and that definitely has at least 30 basis point impact on our margin for the year.","In addition to that, we did talk about the fact that some of our very high profit margin regions are actually showing either slower growth or declines in the case of Hong Kong as we mentioned. The Middle East just slowed quite a bit. U.K. is a bit softer than what we certainly have experienced over the last couple of years.","So those are all impacting. If nothing changed with respect to either our category mix or geographic mix, then you would be absolutely spot on. But those are things that we\u2019re managing as well.","So our cost savings programs not only help us to expand the margin, but they have helped and fund some of our investment, but they\u2019ve also helped us because of the programs that we put in place a few years ago and are continuing to deliver on are helping us to offset the negative impact of some of the macro situations that we\u2019re experiencing right now.","Fabrizio Freda","Okay. And on distribution, Ali, my point is we vet every single decision starting with a consumer point of view. So we are not distributing our brands anywhere where the consumer doesn\u2019t demand them and the consumer is the target consumer.","The distribution decision we are taking are always brand building, meaning there are consumers that are on target, particularly Millennial, that we will not be able to reach without proposing the brand in that areas and that\u2019s what is happening around the world, particularly the Millennial consumer are changing their shopping habits.","The brands that do not evolve their shopping habits to reach this consumer will basically actually lose traction with the new luxury consumer rather than risk their image.","And so it\u2019s an evolution and it\u2019s driven mainly by the habits of the Millennial consumer, also is very different by category. This is happening very aggressively in makeup, for example, and the way the Millennial consumer in makeup is happening also around the world.","And a lot of this is about online and the availability of the brands online. So second thing is not the image of the distribution, but is the -- we call it consumer reach. So the way we look at it, because again that\u2019s your question, we don\u2019t look at it like only the image. We look at it do we reach the right consumers.","So it is an analysis starts from target consumer reach. And in fact, that\u2019s what we have used as language in our prepared remark. Coverage, reach, rather than expanded distribution. Then when you look at internal number of doors, that\u2019s actually, there are a lot of closures. There are a lot of stores which are being closed not only in the U.S. around the world.","So in terms of a number of stores, this is not necessarily an increase of our ability. So it\u2019s putting the brands where the consumer expect them at a certain moment of their progress.","Last thing I want to say is that you mentioned Est\u00e9e Lauder Clinique, which are today within Prestige broadly distributed brands. But keep in mind that all the rest of our portfolio is actually an enormous amount of extra distribution opportunity, meaning our brands have not even started being available to the right level of consumer around the world.","So a lot of our distribution expansion is not about Lauder Clinique. It\u2019s about bringing the rest of our portfolio to available to the right target consumer around the world and numerical internal sales and profit. That\u2019s where the biggest opportunity is.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Thanks very much for the question. I wanted to follow up, maybe from a little different angle, on Ali's question. I want to ask about the channel. How do you manage it internally? How do you break the news to your core channel customers, your department stores, that the exclusive availability of not just Estee Lauder, the prestige brand products, but -- the efforts and alignment of your company have been such a big part of their success historically that at the margin, yes, you are following the consumer, but this necessarily means less emphasis on those channels and maybe less investment in those channels going forward.","My question would be how do you manage, how do you compensate people to make that switch internally? How do you have those -- have you ever gotten push back from some of your department store partners that maybe what you are doing is hurting them a little bit at the margin?","And maybe going down the road, are there ways to make the business actually more profitable by maybe investing a little bit less with businesses that have been -- retail partners that have been more important to you in the past than they are today? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","So, no. As I said, we start from the consumer, from the consumer demand. And so that\u2019s the way we make distribution decision and we make distribution decision in partnership with our retail partner.","And they always know these things before and we are very, very honest discussions about what\u2019s needed for the brand. Sometimes a new distribution decision actually help sales for the brand in the total country, including in the retailers where the brands was previously distributed.","And by the way our brands very rarely are exclusive to a retailer. They are targeting certain group of consumer, that\u2019s clear. For example, Macy\u2019s, as you know, has announced to close 100 doors. We are collaborating -- we will collaborate with Macy\u2019s to protect the consumption of our brands in these doors transferring to other Macy\u2019s doors consumers.","We will do our best to support Macy\u2019s in this plan, which we believe they\u2019re doing the right thing. We will focus a lot to support Macy\u2019s in selling more in the remaining doors that they will focus on as well as we\u2019ll continue to support Macy\u2019s in building the best, we can their online business that we have together.","So also our retailers decide to close doors to other things and we collaborate with them in keeping the sales, continue increasing the sales. So it\u2019s not about one or the other.","If we focus on the client, on the final customer, we get always the right decision made and there are normally win-win for the brands, for our retail partners and for the consumers. That\u2019s what we are looking. That\u2019s our principle.","As far as your question in term of if I understood correctly, in terms of internal, internal I think we just have our normal processes. As I said, we\u2019re starting from consumer understanding. We make the decision and then we discuss those with our partners.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gere from KeyBanc.","Jason Gere","Good morning. I guess just one question. I was wondering how you acquire customer data for some of the freestanding stores. I know there's obviously a lot of data you can get from the department stores, but I was just wondering how you can leverage some of that information in terms of really trying to keep the momentum going with freestanding.","Especially as a lot of those stores are in some of these malls where you are seeing some I guess weakness in traffic with some of the mid-tier department stores; I was just wondering how you think about that.","Tracey Thomas Travis","So actually it\u2019s easier for us to acquire consumer data from our freestanding stores given the fact that we have the point-of-sale equipment than it is in the department stores where we don\u2019t. In some cases, in department stores, you\u2019re right, we do also have some equipment that allows us to capture the consumer.","But in all of our stores, our freestanding stores, we do. So it\u2019s actually easier for us to capture it in stores as well as online. We certainly do. Our teams look at that information. Our brands look at that information and understand what trends are selling in freestanding stores and whether or not that mirrors or not what is selling in, in department stores and put plans together accordingly.","And those are all areas that we -- as we expand distribution, as consumers continue to shop in multiple points of distribution, we continue to aggregate that information and look at whether or not there are any differential trends that the entire business can benefit from in terms of our strategies and how we allocate resources.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Hi. Good morning, everyone. As you think about the growth of new products and the impacts that they are having, how do you see their influence on the gross margin? And over what period of time should new products essentially reach or exceed the corporate average gross margin and does it differ by category? Thank you.","Tracey Thomas Travis","So Dana, great questions, and I probably should have mentioned this as well when Ali asked his question on margin. Depending on our innovation in a particular year, in some cases, we actually choose to launch some innovation that actually has lower gross margin because that we\u2019ve identified a consumer need in that particular space and believe that, that product will drive incremental sales and will build to be a large franchise, particularly for franchises like Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique and particularly in skin care.","So we have seen in recent years some new innovation that actually is a bit of lower gross profit margin. Clearly as sales continue to build on products that we launched that are new, you\u2019re amortizing the tooling and you\u2019re getting some more favorability in terms of gross profit margin.","But largely they stay relatively close to where they\u2019re at, unless there\u2019s a significant increase in volume, in which case you can get lower cost of goods.","But we do manage and our teams when you think about the number of brands that we have and the number of new product launches that we have where we have had to Fabrizio\u2019s earlier comment, steady increase in the amount of innovation, our teams manage that gross margin mix quite tightly in terms of making sure that we in the new innovation, at least over few years is offset by innovation that also was more margin accretive.","Fabrizio Freda","And I would just would like to add one point to this point on gross margin. At the end, we are a prestige luxury company and so our main task is to have pricing power. And the moment we do a good job, we can do both, we can give to the consumer the super high quality packaging experience they want and the price for it, so that we protect the right gross margin evolution over time. It\u2019s all about pricing power and the power of our brands to sustain it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser from B. Riley & Company.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Hi. I was curious on the U.S. market, given some of the weakness that you are seeing, if you are making any modifications or if you have any initiatives regarding your selling methods in department stores. I know several years ago you made some changes, like more open sell and things like that.","So can you talk about what you're doing to try to help the department stores drive that traffic in beauty? Also, is your investment behind the consultants or the sales force in the stores, is it rising because of the weakness? Do you make more investment there?","And then, finally, you mentioned on the Macy's how you're hoping to help them shift consumption to other stores. But in the near term is that impacting some of your weakness early in your fiscal year in terms of just the sell-in to fewer doors in Macy's? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","So let me start answering this question. As you probably know, Macy\u2019s has announced their intention to close 100 doors, but they did not give a specific calendar when this will happen. So the answer is no. In the first quarter there is no assumptions of the new closing doors, but Macy\u2019s closed I believe 40 or 50 doors so far.","And yes, that is obviously the impact of the first 44, 45 doors that we have closed before in fiscal year '16 in the first quarter. But to your core question for the long-term, we definitely are focused to support our department store partners to improve -- to continue to improve the experience on our brands and in general in the beauty flow of department store.","We have many activities in this area, many in the area of improved services, many in the activity of innovation and distortion, many in the area of connecting social media to the activities and activity in the area of sampling.","In other words, we are really focused in working together how to increase traffic in store which is in this moment the key opportunity.","And then to your second question is what do we see in this market? Yes, we see a lower traffic that what we would like to see in our counters in mid-tier department stores and that\u2019s what you see in our quarter one estimate as well. And we are working hard to support our partners to go back to increase this traffic at every level.","Tracey Thomas Travis","At the same time both ourselves and our partners work pretty closely together on making sure that as we see -- at the same time of growing volume in all the strategies that we are jointly working on to grow traffic to the beauty counters in the stores, recognizing the reality that there are more options today for women to buy cosmetics and beauty products in many different channels, where historically was only more singularly in the U.S. market.","We are also making sure that as you do in a freestanding retail store looking at staff to sales ratios, which any retailer looks at and make sure that those are appropriate for the amount of traffic you see near-term and then investing back in those resources when sales increase. So that too is important both for our partners as well as ourselves to make sure that we are managing profit accordingly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello from Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Hi, thanks, good morning. First question, I wanted to go back to the Lauder and Clinique brands and maybe if you could assess for us some of the progress you guys have made over the past 12 months in turning around those brands.","Is the momentum that you are seeing as we exit fiscal '16 what you expected to see 12 months ago, given the spending behind those brands, given the expansion in specialty multi, the launch of Estee Edit, how those contributed to that? And are you connecting with the Millennial to the extent that you had hoped 12 months ago?","Then, secondly, on Leading Beauty Forward, Tracey, earlier you mentioned that no benefits in fiscal '17. But is there spending in that program is going to run through the P&L that is not being -- that is not extraordinary and being excluded? Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis","So let me start with Leading Beauty Forward, there is a slight amount of spending that\u2019s running through the P&L, but it's not meaningful at this point. Most of the program cost right now are running through restructuring because of the nature of the program which is largely important design oriented.","Fabrizio Freda","And on Lauder and Clinique, a year ago in Lauder and Clinique were declining. Now they are flat and so there has been a significant improvement of trend.","We said they would have started from turnaround in the makeup area of both brands because was the area that was better fit in the other goal which was to attract more Millennial to the brands and we have done it in the U.S.","Lauder and Clinique makeup is growing double-digit, which frankly was declining just a year ago and this is an impressive improvement and also globally both brands are growing their makeup in a very strong way.","Now the skincare also did some progress as we explained in the prepared remarks. However, on the skincare, the two key issues which is Hong Kong continues to decline and the mid-tier department store traffic issue that we just discussed in last half an hour, those two have been a drag to accelerate as well the skincare part, which now we will do our best to do in fiscal year '17.","So good progress on both brands with an excellent start in makeup and some more work to do in skincare. Last point is to your question. So is that what we had forecasted.","Frankly, we have done in line or slightly better than what we expected, but we did not forecast Hong Kong to continue to decline in the way it has declined. We did not anticipate the kind of traffic reduction in mid-tier department store that we have seen in the course of the area. So those two things actually were different than what we anticipated a year ago.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Please go ahead, Steve Powers from UBS.","Steve Powers","Hey thanks, I'm going to try to test your endurance with three quick ones, if I could. The first one is you mentioned Macy's. Across fiscal '17, does your guidance embed any net inventory destocking at the retail level or not? That's the first question.","Second question is if you could just update us, in aggregate, as you think about your own freestanding doors as well as your own online sites, what percentage of sales is the direct-to-consumer business today and how do you expect that to trend over the next three years?","And then finally, with respect to makeup versus skincare, not surprisingly 2017 sounds like another makeup-led growth year, both for yourselves and the industry. But as you think about the makeup ahead of skincare trend, how long do you think that lasts?","I don't know if you can take some learnings from past cycles or other consumer insights, but just as you think about your three-year outlook, do you expect makeup to run ahead of skincare for the duration or is there a crossover point? Thanks so much.","Tracey Thomas Travis","So let me take the first two. As it relates to is there some destocking assumed in our forecast and guidance for this year? Yes, given some of the retail dynamics that are going. It may not be enough, but we do have some clearly in there given what\u2019s happening in the U.S. market in particular.","As it relates to direct-to-consumer, which for us would be our freestanding stores and obviously our e-commerce as well as retailer.com sites, it\u2019s about 17% of our total sales is our direct-to-consumer business and then on the makeup and skin care.","Fabrizio Freda","Makeup and skin care, I think, first of all that makeup will definitely continue to grow and very, very fast. There are two dynamics which are happening, which we believe are for the long term.","The first one is the Asian consumer is using makeup more and more. So the dynamic of skin care versus makeup a global level. The strength of skin care was driven by the fact that the fastest growing demand was coming from Asia and Asia consumer use much more skin care than makeup.","I think this will continue. So nothing wrong with the skincare trend, but the makeup trend in Asia has dramatically accelerated because the billion of Asian consumers are using makeup more and more. This is a very strong long-term trend.","The second is the millennial generation. The data shows that the average millennial use more makeup in more occasions during the week than their mothers. So the more the millennial generation grows in percentage of the total population, the more makeup usage will continue to accelerate.","So those two trends are long term. However, it doesn\u2019t mean the skincare needs to continue being growing less. Actually we see in already the first signs that as soon as the millennial will discover also more of the skin care routine, this can impact the skin care.","For example, our new brands like GLAMGLOW, which are more focused on millennials and are more based on instant benefit skin cares, which are more important for millennials have seen amazing growth when they do a good product launch. So I personally believe also skin care will accelerate in the future driven by positive trends.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session.

During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for the call.","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Fabrizio.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal year 2017 was another successful year for our company. We build momentum in every quarter, pivoted our business through the channels and categories driving global prestige beauty, created exciting new products, reached new consumers, and strengthened our multiple engines of growth. When the year began, we said we expected our sales to accelerate as demands progressed and they did, building each quarter and culminating in an exceptional final quarter and full year.","The fourth quarter results came largely from terrific strengths in China, travel retail and online, as well as from many of our brands including our latest acquisitions. In this new fiscal year, we expect our effective strategy to continue to drive our momentum leading to strong sales and profit growth. For the full year, we delivered sales growth of 7%, approximately 2 points ahead of global prestige beauty, enabling us to once again gain share. This is the eighth consecutive year we generated a strong performance and outperformed the industry, demonstrating the sustainability of our strategy despite inevitable external headwinds.","This year was marked by greater economic and geopolitical volatility and terrorism, which curtailed demand in several countries. The trend of consumers shifting their shopping preferences by channel accelerated, which resulted in declining traffic in some U.S. brick-and-mortar department stores. At the same time, global competition intensified as new beauty brands and thousands of new products competed for a share of consumer wallets.","Despite these challenges, we strengthened our growth engines and created formidable new ones, which was evident in higher sales across our major product categories. Through our seasonal and luxury brands, we have reinvigorated our fragrance category. We also solidified our leadership in the fast-growing makeup category with the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA. These exciting brands anchor our portfolio with millennial consumers who often prefer to shop in specialty-multi retailers and online.","Central to our success was pivoting our business to capture new consumers. We did this by increasing our exposure to the fastest-growing prestige channels, strengthening our brand portfolio, investing in key geography and enhancing our digital and social media communications. Consumers have a growing emotional attachment for their beauty experience, strong loyalty to product performance, a desire for high-touch service and a preference for experiential channels. These are the pillars of our Company\u2019s success that we will continue to build on.","In fiscal 2017, we took decisive steps to gain a more significant presence globally in specialty-multi retailers and increased our penetration by 40%. We have historically been well-represented in specialty-multi internationally, and we reinforced our position with new and existing retailers.","In Europe, some of our brands expanded in Sephora and Douglas. In Asia, our brands went into more Sephora stores in China and Southeast Asia and captured new opportunities with the brand-building specialty-multi retailers that are emerging. Clinique was our first brand in Eveandboy in Thailand and in Olive Young in Korea. In the U.S., our high-end La Mer and Jo Malone brands entered Sephora\u2019s flagship stores and began selling on its website, joining many of other brands \u2013 of our brands that are already successful there.","In addition, Est\u00e9e Lauder and MAC opened in selected ULTA Beauty stores and on ulta.com, which helped them reach new target consumer, especially in smaller cities. E-commerce continued to be vibrant and our business accelerated, growing 33%, with strong global growth. Our brands opened sites in new countries and with various retailers, planting seeds for future gains. In the fourth quarter, we launched MAC on China popular Tmall, and it was the platform\u2019s largest prestige beauty launch.","Our travel retail sales grew more than 20%, generating the best gains in five years due to strong demand for our product and wider availability of our brand portfolio in large productive airports. Passenger traffic grew high single-digits and a resurgence of Chinese tourists helped drive our strong performance. We remain the leader in makeup and skin care combined in travel retail, and our makeup sales soared, which lifted many brands. One of those was Tom Ford. Its travel retail business more than doubled, fueled by Chinese consumer who coveted the brand\u2019s high-end makeup and fragrances.","Our brands continue to be highly desirable. Our best performers were many of our mid-size and luxury brands, which grew double-digits and helped fuel our makeup, skin care, and fragrance categories. As an example, La Mer\u2019s success stemmed from driving trial with compelling innovation and repeat purchases with core products. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand returned to solid mid-single digit global growth for the year, delivering gains in both makeup and skin care. It was well positioned to take advantage of the resurgence in China and travel retail and strengthen its Europe franchises with innovative new products.","Advanced Night Repair, Double Wear, and the Pure Color Envy lipstick lines all grew double-digits. The brand also benefited from effective social media and digital market which led to its top ranking in the L2 China Beauty Index. We strategically invested in key geographies to match success. Countries represented more than one quarter of our sales grew double-digits, including emerging markets of China and Russia as well as developed countries like Italy. We attribute the strong results to locally relevant products and communications and targeted expanded consumer reach.","Thanks to a strong economy and growing desire for prestige beauty, demand from Chinese consumer climbed, both in the local market as they travel the world. Our China business accelerated throughout the year, delivering outstanding growth of more than 40% in the fourth quarter and 90% for the year. A record 133 million Chinese tourists traveled last year, as we see this momentum continuing, which should positively impact our business across the globe. Enhancing our social media and digital engagement is a priority across our portfolio. Our brands leveraged a growing number of influencers. And as we grew our experience, we gain share in our media value, ending the year as the number one prestige beauty company in the U.S. according to Tribe Dynamics.","The intersection of social media, digital marketing, and e-commerce is integral to our brand strategies and we have a digital first mind-set throughout the company at this point. In fiscal 2017, we continue to direct more advertising dollars to the digital space. Nearly half of our visible A&P spending globally was digital, up significantly from the year before. In other areas, we began implementing several programs under our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. We augmented our digit talent, capped expenses, and reinvested in high-growth areas to position us to compete more effectively in the environment that lies ahead.","With the prestige beauty landscape shifting rapidly, we are proactively positioning ourselves to capture the new ways consumers are engaging with beauty. To continue to lead and win, we will leverage our company strengths; our broad prestige brand portfolio, superior product quality, creativity, talent, and brand building distribution all across our many geographies.","Let me now discuss the focus of our fiscal year 2018 strategy. We will continue to connect our brands to high growth, brand-building channels to align with how and where consumers are shopping. We expect specialty-multi, online, travel retail, and freestanding store will continue their strong growth. Dennis will discuss the online segment shortly. In specialty-multi, we have captured a new consumer by matching our brands with global retailers that are the right fit in collaborating to drive trial, repeat purchase and regimen usage.","For example, MAC is opening in Sephora\u2019s top stores in Brazil and we launched in the specialty multi-channel in Asia-Pacific. We are rolling out Too Faced in Sephora in most European markets, including France and, in Douglas, in Germany. In the U.S., La Mer, Jo Malone and Tom Ford will solidify their distribution in Sephora while Est\u00e9e Lauder, MAC and Clinique will extend their presence in ULTA.","In addition, Bumble and bumble is launching on ulta.com this weekend followed by 500 ULTA stores. In travel retail, we are building on our strength in skin care, further growing our makeup and fragrance categories. We are introducing some of our newer brands, opening more doors in high traffic airports, developing new store formats, ensuring we have locally relevant product in major travel corridors. We expect the higher passenger traffic coupled with effective marketing to increase conversion, will lead to strong sales growth again this year.","We are enhancing the experience of our freestanding stores by adding more open sell environments such as in MAC redesign of its Time Square flagship. MAC will offer different shopping option across its stores, which should strengthen productivity. Throughout our more than 1,400 global freestanding stores, we are adding more omni-channel capabilities to connect them with online.","Globally, department stores are an important brand-building channel that provide high-touch service, and we are investing by modernizing our counters in our service model in the best performing doors. Many international department store continue to generate very healthy growth especially those in high traffic touristic destinations like Harrods or Selfridges in London where our business is robust. In several other markets such as China or Italy, department stores are delivering strong gains.","Our biggest challenge has been in some U.S. brick-and-mortar department stores, which are struggling from falling foot traffic especially in smaller malls and touristic driven doors. U.S. department store represents approximately 17% of our global sales last year. And we are encouraged by new signs of strength in some retailers\u2019 top doors. We will leverage debt activity by improving our merchandising, our service, our communication, and our sampling and we are also collaborating with U.S. department stores to boost that business online, which is growing strongly.","We expect our makeup and fragrance categories to lead our growth. As the global leader in prestige makeup, we are leveraging individual strengths of our many makeup brands to cater to different consumers. We will drive our luxury and our seasonal fragrance portfolio by strengthening the brands we recently acquired and supporting and Jo Malone and Tom Ford excellent momentum. In skin care, our sales improved last year and we anticipate even better growth this year supported by exciting innovation and more robust consumer demand.","Looking at our three biggest brands, we expect Est\u00e9e Lauder to, again, deliver solid growth. We also anticipate improvements at MAC, its international business has remained strong. And it plans to open 200 new ULTA stores in the U.S. by fiscal year-end. Clinique has enjoyed good momentum in China and travel retail in recent months in recent response to new launches such as Fresh Pressed Serum with pure vitamin C and we believe its results will also improve. We will continue to reallocate resources and add talents to our social media programs which have become a critical component of beauty marketing.","Our brands are aligning with authentic and locally relevant influencers and amplifying their storytelling to ensure that their content is differentiated and memorable. Consumers are purchasing beauty products more frequently than in the past partly because they can quickly and easily order online. This is especially true for our hero products and franchises, which generate more triumph in bringing new consumer as well as repeat business, which is more profitable. We have robust cadence of launches planned with an emphasis on strengthening core franchises.","As an example, Est\u00e9e Lauder just introduced Advanced Night Repair eye concentrate matrix which incorporates innovative technology and has been well received. It also launched a new formula of its best-selling Double Wear foundation, which is a top recruiting product in many markets, attracting both millennials and ageless consumers. Foundations are a large and high loyalty subcategory and many other brands like Clinique are introducing new formulas. It\u2019s Even Better glow makeup is off to a strong start. MAC Next to Nothing lightweight foundation is a departure from the brand\u2019s full coverage makeups and should continue to be a strong recruitment product this year.","In skin care, La Mer is rolling out two new types of moisturizer to support its iconic Cr\u00e8me de La Mer product lineup including a lotion with a matte finish and we expect a strong consumer response. Clinique launched Fresh Pressed serum and a supercharged version of Moisture Surge a few months ago, each to terrific perception and they should continue to be a major sales driver for the brand this year.","To gain insight and help drive decisions across innovation, social media, and marketing, we are using much more analytics. We expect our investment in advertising to increase and comprise a greater percent of sales with digital media, the fastest growing outlet. We will advance more programs and the Leading Beauty Forward, allowing us to drive further efficiency, provide more fuel, reallocate resources to high growth area in advertising and better leverage sales growth.","In closing, we are extremely proud of our performance in fiscal 2017. I want to thank our global employees and my executive team for their leadership and ability to effectively execute change across the organization, which is an important competitive advantage for our company. We are fortunate to operate in a highly desirable industry they are focused on the many opportunities in our future. We are confident in our ability to win. We will achieve our goals by leveraging our successful strategy that is based on multiple engine of growth, a well-diversified business, superior talent and creativity and unmatched product quality and branding.","As we have shown this past year, we are executing our change agenda with excellence and speed. As we drive our momentum, we will continue to embrace a changing landscape, push the boundaries of possibility and pivot to tomorrow\u2019s opportunity as consumer preferences evolve. As I mentioned, we are instilling a digital-first mind-set throughout our company.","And now Dennis McEniry who has led our online business for the past 17 years will discuss this exciting area. Dennis?","Dennis McEniry","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. We created our dedicated online division almost 20 years ago, and today encompasses a global team of nearly 700 people, working on hundreds of direct-to-consumer and retailer sites across 39 countries. We are responsible for building and operating our direct-to-consumer A&M commerce sites partnering with retailers to fuel their growing online businesses as well as spearheading digital technology, innovation and omni-channel initiatives.","The online division has historically grown sales at an average annual rate of about 25% and is","margin accretive to the company. In fiscal 2017, online sales accelerated, growing 33% to $1.3 billion globally. Many of our brands, in particular Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, MAC and Tom Ford, had an outstanding year online. Too Faced, a recently acquired brand, more than doubled its online sales when viewed on a 12-month comparable basis. And our top four online markets, e-commerce represents approximately 20% of our sales. Globally online represents 11% of total company sales, up from 4% just five years ago.","We continue to outperform total online retail growth in the U.S. and in the UK, our two largest online markets. In China, our third largest market, we nearly doubled online sales and we\u2019re again the top prestige beauty company on Tmall for Singles\u2019 Day. We are also nearly doubled our online sales in other emerging markets such as Russia, Turkey, South Africa and we launched in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and India.","Our fiscal 2017 online growth was fueled by both direct-to-consumer and retailer sites, which account for approximately 60% and 40% of our online business respectively. We launched over 45 direct-to-consumer sites on our own platform and third-party platforms such as Tmall. Our signature High-Touch services that are available online set us apart from our competitors. We combine real-life beauty experts who have extensive knowledge about our products with technology to deliver the best beauty advice online. We also work with artificial intelligence and other technologies in order to deliver a more unique, interactive, personalized tool such as virtual try-on of makeup technology, using augmented reality and facial recognition technology, as well as a botspowered foundation finder tool.","On retailer sites, we saw strong online growth from a number of customers, including Sephora, Selfridges and Douglas. Many of our brands, in particular Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and MAC, had an outstanding year on macys.com. We also successfully launched Est\u00e9e Lauder, Origins and MAC on ULTA.com and Jo Malone and La Mer on sephora.com. We are enhancing our omni-channel capabilities by linking our online platform to our freestanding store and support our newly launched loyalty programs. With MAC Select, Est\u00e9e E-List and My Origins Rewards our consumers are spending more across channels and more frequently, improving our consumer retention rate and driving higher consumer lifetime value.","Mobile commerce continues to drive our results, as it provides consumers with always-connected and always-on commerce. Mobile accounts for two-thirds of our traffic and nearly half of our online sales. We anticipate this trend to accelerate, so we are expanding our mobile team and increasing investments in mobile innovation to provide the best beauty experience. We are working to tie our social media efforts to m-commerce sales with the best High-Touch beauty experts in the industry. This branded beauty experience brings our brands to life in a way that is personalized, locally relevant and fun, all delivered to her mobile device 24\/7.","The online team has a strong track record of delivering consistent double-digit top-line growth and margin accretive profit growth to the company, while navigating a rapidly-changing online environment. Looking forward, we are confident of our proven capabilities positioning us well against our competitors to drive continuous sustainable growth. We have built a strong e-commerce foundation with a global team located in 39 countries, which makes us highly competitive.","Our model gives us a solid platform to deploy more brands in more countries with more products and categories in the future, which will enable us to garner new consumers around the world. We are strategically focused on expanding our brand-building distribution online across both direct-to-consumer and retailer sites. Opportunities exist in capitalizing on industry growth as more consumers shift online, adding new brands in our existing markets, expanding our online platform to the countries we are not currently in.","For example, we plan to expand our online presence in India, Middle East and Southeast Asia this year. A number of our brands, including Jo Malone and La Mer, have many untapped markets to enter. We also have attractive online expansion opportunities from recent acquisitions, including GLAMGLOW, Too Faced, Le Labo and BECCA.","Our strategy also includes a focus on category opportunities. Fragrance is our fastest-growing category, and currently accounts for less than 10% of our online sales. With untapped potential, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, we expect our fragrance brands to drive significant online growth over the next three years.","Our growth opportunities will also be fueled by technology improvements, innovation and advanced data analytics. We are investing capital and resources in key areas including Mobile, omni-channel, digital innovation and marketing technology. To ensure online remains a key engine of growth for the company, we are committed to further developing and building our talent. We have trained over 2,500 people in digital this past year across the company, and the digital and online area has the fastest growth in terms of people head count.","Our online team, which is tightly integrated with our brands through close collaborations, consists of 80% women, 60% millennials and 39% Gen X. It is our priority to foster a team culture that promotes diversity, learning and strong collaboration in order to drive success in a fast-paced environment.","In closing, I want to thank my amazing team for strategic thinking and tireless execution. I also want to thank my colleagues in the company, and our retailers worldwide for their continued support.","Now Tracey will review the company\u2019s financials.","Tracey Travis","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and full year financial results, and then cover our expectations for the fiscal 2018 first quarter and full year as well as our three year target. My commentary today excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges and adjustments including Leading Beauty Forward charges, impairment of intangible, adjustments to contingent considerations and the China tax adjustment, which are all disclosed in our press release this morning.","Net sales for the fourth quarter were $2.89 billion, up 11% in constant currency compared to the prior year period. Incremental sales from our most recent acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA contributed approximately 3.5 points of this growth. Our business in the Asia-Pacific region led our growth this quarter, with sales up 18% in constant currency, driven primarily by accelerated momentum in China.","Sales in China rose more than 40%, as you heard Fabrizio mention, with broad-based growth across brands and channels. All of our brands grew double or triple digits in China this quarter, and our online business more than doubled. Hong Kong continued its rebound with high single-digit growth ending more than two years of declining sales. We also achieved solid sales growth in Japan, Korea and Indonesia.","In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales rose 12% in constant currency, led by a 20% increase in global travel retail. The outstanding growth in the travel retail channel reflects a 9% rise in international passenger traffic and buoyant retail in areas of historical strength for us; notably Hong Kong, Macau and the UK. The strong performance across most of our brand portfolio; in particular Tom Ford, Jo Malone, La Mer, MAC and Est\u00e9e Lauder was driven by new launch activity and targeted expansion in high-performing airports to reach new consumers.","The EMEA region also benefited from double-digit sales growth in many markets, including Italy, France, the Nordic countries and Greece. The UK and Spain also grew low to mid single-digits. In the region\u2019s emerging markets, the Middle East grew strongly as it lapped the downturn that began last March and began to slowly replenish stock. Overall, retail continues to be consistent with the economic situation in the region. Russia was flat, but other Eastern European markets and India rose double digits.","Net sales in the Americas grew 6% in constant currency. Latin America sales rose 20%, led by double-digit increases in Argentina, Chile, Peru; Mexico and Brazil rose high single digits. Sales in North America rose 5% due to the addition of our newest brands Too Faced and BECCA. Excluding the acquisitions, North American sales declined 3% due to continued softness in the brick-and-mortar business of department stores and, to a lesser extent, freestanding stores. Our net sales in online and specialty-multi channels rose double digits.","For the quarter, our gross margin declined 170 basis points from the prior year period, due primarily to adverse product mix, including the impact of the fiscal 2017 acquisitions and the associated inventory step-up. Obsolescence and currency also contributed to the margin decline, while pricing partially offset the decreases. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 250 basis points, primarily due to lower selling expenses that reflected our changing channel mix, along with prudent expense management. These improvements were partially offset by higher advertising, R&D and store operating costs.","As a result, operating income rose 20% and operating margin increased 80 basis points. Diluted EPS of $0.51 was 21% above the prior year and grew 25% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.01 of unfavorable currency translation and $0.04 of dilution from acquisitions. EPS was higher than expected due primarily to the outstanding results delivered by our travel retail and China businesses, stronger growth in skin care and overall disciplined expense management.","Now let me cover a few highlights of our full year results. Net sales grew 7% in constant currency. Incremental sales from our most recent acquisitions contributed approximately 2 percentage points of that growth. Our gross margin decreased 110 basis points. Supply chain efficiencies and pricing were more than offset by the mix of higher-cost new products, the impact of acquisitions including the inventory step-up, higher obsolescence and adverse currency. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 140 basis points primarily due to lower selling expenses and prudent expense management.","These improvements were partially offset by higher store operations costs, stock compensation and shipping expense. Our full year operating margin rose 30 basis points to 15.9%. This margin included 70 basis points of unfavorability comprised of 50 basis points of dilution from the recent acquisitions and 20 basis points from currency translation. We improved our expense leverage of sales growth, and our cost saving programs contributed more than $200 million in savings this year.","Net interest expense rose to $75 million from $55 million in the prior year reflecting our increased debt level partially offset by higher investment income. Net earnings grew 7% to $1.3 billion, and diluted EPS rose 8% to $3.47. Earnings per share included $0.12 of unfavorable currency translation and $0.08 of dilution from acquisitions. At constant exchange rates, EPS grew 11% for the year.","In fiscal 2017, we recorded approximately $143 million after tax in restructuring and other charges for our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. We\u2019ve begun establishing more efficient structures in certain areas of the company, including some of our regional organizations and corporate functions and redesigned our procurement organization to generate further savings opportunities in several areas of spend. Additionally, we realized a $21 million net after-tax gain for adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration and impairments of intangibles relating to some of our 2015 acquisitions.","Lastly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, a favorable change in the tax law in China expanded the corporate income tax deduction limitation for advertising and promotional expenses. As a result, the company released into income its previously established deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately $75 million related to its accumulated carry forward of excess advertising and promotion expenses.","In fiscal 2017, we generated $1.8 billion in cash from operations, representing a slight improvement over the prior year. Excluding the cash costs of Leading Beauty Forward, cash from operations increased 7%. We utilized cash generated as well as $1.5 billion in new debt to repay $300 million in senior notes that came due in May to acquire Too Faced and BECCA and to make a minority investment in DECIEM, a multi-brand beauty company.","We also spent $504 million on capital improvements primarily for retail stores, e-commerce support and counters. We continue to return cash to shareholders, repurchasing 4.7 million shares of our stock for $413 million and paying $486 million in dividends. We increased our dividend rate by 13%, the eighth consecutive year of double-digit dividend increases.","Overall, the 7% sales growth and 11% EPS increase in constant currency we delivered in fiscal 2017 is in line with our long-term goals. Our increased balance and diversification by geography, channel and brand helped us to sustain growth above the industry and deliver our profit objectives.","Looking ahead, we expect global prestige beauty to continue to rise 4% to 5% annually, barring any significant economic downturn. Our goal is to grow at least 1 point to 2 points ahead of the industry by continuing to balance our distribution with higher-growth channels and markets and at least generate 1% of that sales growth from acquisitions over the next three years.","We continue to pursue efficiency and effectiveness in everything we do so we can both reinvest into our key strategic growth drivers, especially consumer-facing activities, and achieve our financial objectives. Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative is well on-track and expected to deliver $200 million to $300 million in annual net savings by 2021, as we told you previously.","Through the redesign of certain areas of our company, the program has already enabled us to accelerate the changes we needed to support stronger digital consumer engagement, enable greater cost leverage and more aggressively reallocate resources into stronger growth drivers. The Leading Beauty Forward program combined with our ongoing cost management efforts allow us to support continued strong top line growth and to target average annual margin improvement of approximately 50 basis points and double-digit EPS growth over the next three years. Over the next three years, we will also continue to pursue working capital improvement to free up cash.","In fiscal 2017, our inventory days to sell increased by 12 to 201 due largely to the new acquisitions and we did not achieve the improvement we expected. And while higher sales growth in certain fast-growing regions and channels next year could create higher inventory in our distribution networks, we have developed more robust action plans to drive improvement in slower-moving SKUs and the acquisition impact should diminish. We now aim to reach approximately 150 inventory days to sell by the end of fiscal 2020.","For now let\u2019s take a look at our expectations for fiscal 2018 full year and first quarter. For the year, sales are forecasted to grow 7% to 8% in constant currency with contributions from all regions and product categories. We expect growth to be led by many of the same drivers we saw accelerate over the past year, travel retail and China, which are expected to drive improved momentum in skin care, the makeup and fragrance categories and the online and specialty-multi channels.","Additionally, Too Faced and BECCA will contribute higher incremental sales through the first half of the fiscal year until they lap their acquisition dates in the latter part of the second quarter. For the full year, they are expected to contribute approximately 2 percentage points to our overall sales growth.","Aside from these strong growth areas of the business, we are also expecting some improved momentum in our large brands. Currency translation is finally expected to be favorable in fiscal 2018 following several years of a strong dollar depressing our result. Based on August 1 spot rates of 1.14 for the euro, 1.30 for the pound and 112 for the yen, we expect currency translation to benefit reported sales for the full fiscal year by about 1 percentage point.","We continue to achieve cost savings through indirect procurement, A&P effectiveness and demo selling within our ongoing programs and we expect to see initial net benefits from Leading Beauty Forward as overhead savings are expected to modestly outweigh reinvestment this year. Some of the savings will be reinvested in digital marketing and advertising, supporting increased activity for many of our brands.","Leading Beauty Forward provides us with the flexibility to invest more in advertising globally and also support consumer-facing IT and brand expansion in fast growing channels. And our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 27%. The impact of the new accounting pronouncement for stock-based compensation is not included in our estimates at this time.","Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.87 and $3.94 before restructuring charges and other adjustments, including approximately $0.09 of accretion from currency translation and $0.01 accretion from the fiscal 2017 acquisition. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 9% to 11%. In fiscal 2018, we expect cash flow from operations of approximately $1.9 billion, an increase of 6% compared with last year.","Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $600 million or 4.5% to 5% of sales, primarily to support counters, gondolas, stores and e-commerce, general infrastructure needs in our supply chain and new technology to enable our digital-first and analytical efforts along with the Leading Beauty Forward initiative.","Our sales in the first quarter are expected to rise 9% to 10%. Key drivers include approximately 4 percentage points of incremental sales from Too Faced and BECCA, expanded consumer reach for many brands particularly in specialty-multi, online and in our international freestanding stores, continued momentum in China, online, travel retail and some European markets like Italy and Russia.","In the U.S., we expect a continued challenging brick-and-mortar environment in certain channels. We expect first quarter EPS of between $0.94 and $0.97, growth of 12% to 15%, including dilution of about $0.01 from acquisitions. Currency translation is forecasted to be neutral to both sales and EPS in the first quarter.","In closing, we are pleased with our results over the past year and the momentum we gained on our strategic objectives. Given the rapidly changing world of global prestige beauty and the dynamic macro environment we operate in, we are thrilled to be creating additional momentum for the future by accelerating the execution of our strategies while delivering strong results.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] To ensure everyone has the opportunity to ask their questions, we will limit each person to one question. Time permitting, we will return to you for additional question [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy","Yes. Hi. Good morning. So Tracey, first I just wanted to follow up on the margins. You mentioned 50 basis points per annum for the next three years. But just putting in the guidance for fiscal 2018, it looks like margins are expected to be flat for 2018. So one, is that right? And could you just expand sort of the reasons for why that is the case?","Tracey Travis","So on a constant currency basis, we expect that margins will improve about 30 to 50 basis points in fiscal 2018. What I said, Faiza, was that on average we expect to deliver about 50 basis points over the next three years. So that could be 30 basis points one year and it could be 70 basis points another year. But the average we expect to achieve over a three-year time horizon is 50 basis points. And obviously that will depend on where our sales growth ranges.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein Research.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, guys. Actually, I have two, sorry. One is, can you talk a little bit more about just the cadence of growth between the first half and the second half of 2018, given BECCA and Too Faced acquisition timing? Are you including any acquisitions in the guidance? And especially kind of your \u2013 curious about your view on the Americas because ex BECCA and Too Faced at 3.5% for the company, for the quarter is down 2% or 3%. So just kind of cadence of how you roll off successfully those acquisitions.","And second, I want to just take advantage, Dennis, of you being on the call. For a while, we\u2019ve asked about Amazon, how that fits into your online strategy. And it sounds like we\u2019re continuing to say that Amazon is not part of the strategy at this point. But my concern obviously is that \u2013 and I think many people\u2019s concern is that you might be essentially advocating your brand and price management on Amazon to third parties who are selling your products \u2013 you might not be selling but Est\u00e9e Lauder can be bought on Amazon. So what would you have to see from Amazon to decide to sell there? Thanks for taking the two.","Tracey Travis","So let me start with the acquisitions and Fabrizio might add on to this. But we called out obviously that they will contribute 4% in the first quarter and again, we\u2019re speaking about Too Faced and BECCA. Different lines or different product lines of ours have somewhat different seasonal cadence in terms of their growth algorithm. So, and for the full year, they will contribute 2%. So we acquired Too Faced and BECCA in the November-December timeframe of last year.","And so certainly in the second half, we would expect for total company our growth to moderate about a point or two from the first half due to the fact that we will have Too Faced and BECCA in our sales growth numbers from prior year.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. And on the contour of the cadence, in fact, the activity also \u2013 the base of the second six months would be stronger than the base of the first six months. As you remember, we had the first quarter last year at plus 2%, 3%. And so that\u2019s the other factor that we would need to expect. So in our estimate, we do expect a stronger top line in the first six months from the second six months. But we expect also very strong and solid second six months and as we said, a 7% to 8% for the year.","On the second question, on your question on Amazon, I mean, we distribute into brand-building distribution, which exercise the key drivers of our prestige beauty including High-Touch services. And so we are ready to distribute in channels where those criterias are fully respected. We do distribute in some global e-commerce platforms like Tmall where those criterias are respected. At this point we do not distribute in Amazon, and in our fiscal year 2018 plan and estimates, there is no distribution in Amazon included.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you. Good morning. I was actually hoping you guys could comment on any effects you might have seen from department stores such as Macy\u2019s rolling out discounts on cosmetics. First, have you seen a lift in your sales from this? And then second, what is your view on this strategy? And how have you been working with some of your retail partners as they\u2019re facing headwinds?","Fabrizio, you touched on this a bit, but I was hoping you could drill down a little further on some of the strategies that are being implemented to offset the weak foot traffic. Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, no, absolutely, no. We are really strongly collaborating with our partners in department store to increase traffic. And I mentioned that \u2013 but I mentioned merchandising. We are relooking at merchandising activity and we are relooking at our counters, at our system of engagements in store, and we are making some progress, in my opinion. But obviously most importantly is the way innovation gets executed, and the way social media gets executed on the innovation is also an important element to contribute to traffic building again.","The third big factor, we are working very aggressively with our partners with online. And they\u2019re making excellent progress online, and we are making on our business very good progress on e-commerce with them as well, and that\u2019s also important. The other important thing that e-commerce is increasing the frequency of purchase of our consumers because their repurchase is readily available, and sometimes in the past, people would have waited to repurchase their regular preferred product to the next visit.","Now they don\u2019t need to wait. So basically all the gaps of people in usage or repeated usage of product are being filled by the user online. That\u2019s also very true also in the department store channel, and we are leveraging this reality. We are seeing some initial progress in the strong doors, and as I said in my prepared remark, the problem remains in the smaller malls where traffic for the moment is not yet strong. But I\u2019m optimistic that we may see \u2013 we may have in front of us a moment of improvement in this area in fiscal year 2018.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Yes. Thanks, and morning, everybody. Maybe just a follow-up and then another question. So just back to the Amazon question, would it be fair to look at it sort of a different way and say you may be more willing to put select brands like Clinique, which has struggled a little bit in North America, on a platform like Amazon that potentially helps to get the brand to more consumers? I guess, what would be your thoughts on that?","And then just more broadly, on Asia-Pacific, so obviously really strong growth. I\u2019m curious if you could quantify if possible the benefit from geopolitical issues between China and Korea, for example that has contributed just to the overall category accelerating in terms of the results from yours and some of your large competitors, and thoughts on the sustainability of 40% type growth in China?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. So on the first question, as I said, all of our brand \u2013 our company is 100% focused on prestige luxury beauty, meaning that all of our brands without exception are distributed in brand-building distribution proven to have all the driver of prestige. So there will not be exception for brands like \u2013 any brand. And Clinique, by the way, is very much a key prestige brand in our portfolio.","On Asia, yes, 40% is a big number, so I\u2019m not going to say 40% is sustainable. But a double-digit continuous growth in this moment looks very sustainable because there are several dynamics that are playing in the China situation. First of all, the growth in China is depending a lot from the lower import duty that\u2019s been passed on to pricing into the local product. This has pushed the market.","Then the second big dynamic is that the Chinese consumers are passionate about makeup and fragrances more and more. So China historically was really driven by skincare. Today, China is driven by three engines, two of which on a very dynamic growth. So this is proven by our retail growth in quarter four, where we had for example some brands like MAC that just doubled the business in one quarter now, obviously helped by the team who launched. But still, the growth in the same-door brick-and-mortar was outstanding, and the same for our Bobbi Brown and the same for our Est\u00e9e Lauder makeup, where historically Est\u00e9e Lauder was very successful on skincare only is now adding a very important leg in makeup. This phenomenon is going to continue, in our opinion, and that\u2019s why it would be sustainable.","Third point in China, we see growth from department store, from Sephora, from freestanding store, from online; it\u2019s really across and it\u2019s across all the cities. We are in 170 cities. When we look at our online sales, where the purchases come from, an enormous amount of these purchases come from cities we do not operate in brick-and-mortar, which makes the distribution in China efficient, but also the opportunity to grow new consumers come from cities where we do not operate today.","And then finally, the portfolio fragrance is going to get traction for the industry and for us, particularly Jo Malone and Tom Ford at this point. So I believe there is a lot of traction and a lot of fundamentals in China in this moment which is very strong. Now, you asked about Korean brands. Yes, in this moment Korean brands in China are weaker than usual and this may not be the sustainable part of the story. But that\u2019s why I wanted first to explain the sustainable part of the story because I believe that even when the Korea brands demand had to stabilize, I think we will continue to see good traction in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Thanks. Good morning. I guess I just had a question on Asia, in particular, from an operating income perspective. Tracey, could you just speak to some of the drivers in the quarter that led to that slide in profitability? And then as you go into fiscal 2018, what\u2019s assumed in profitability of this region? Thank you.","Tracey Travis","So in the fourth quarter, one of the things that we saw was great new product launch from some of our brands. So the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, as Fabrizio mentioned in his prepared remarks, launched their double-wear cushion compact. There were new launches against Nutritious. MAC had their \u2013 the launch of Tmall, so we had a fair amount of advertising investment in the fourth quarter to support new product launch activity in China and in some other markets in the Asia-Pacific region.","The Asia-Pacific region is a strong and profitable region for us. And to the extent that we had new product launches, and certainly you\u2019ve seen this from us in the past, one of the ways that we, given our new product launch cadence, one of the ways that we certainly start the year strong is by investing at the end of the year against momentum launches that we see.","The other new product that we expect to support in Asia-Pacific this year is the Fresh Pressed launch from Clinique, which also has had tremendously strong momentum. And we expect that to continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.","Russ Miller","Hey. Good morning. This is Russ Miller on for Nick.","Fabrizio Freda","Hi.","Russ Miller","I just wanted to ask on the MAC U.S. business. Can you provide any more details of the state of business there? Is MAC U.S. meeting your expectations, and what are the plans to further improve the business moving forward? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. MAC U.S. is improving, that has still been declining in the last quarter. So our expectation is that the brand will improve by better innovation, stronger social media, improvement in store and obviously activities, which are about the assortment and the marketing plans of the brand, which are in evolution to better match the consumer expectation and the consumer evolution.","And also the distribution, MAC is still very much exposed in the U.S. to the foot traffic of brick-and-mortar department stores. And so this will be for some time. And so we will \u2013 we are working to improve MAC trend in the U.S. as well. But for the moment, we are assuming that MAC in the U.S. will get the majority of the improvement from the marketing I said and from the ULTA distribution that I quoted in my prepared remarks.","The rest of the benefit will come from the international business. Most importantly, I want to underline that MAC online in the U.S., as was explained in the prepared remark of Dennis, grew 29% last year and we are expecting this to continue.","So in summary, better marketing, better in-store activities, more social media, ULTA distributions, strong online are the positives that should create the improvements of MAC And we are for the moment not assuming an enormous improvement in the brick-and-mortar department store part in our estimates but we are working on it actively.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. It\u2019s [indiscernible] on for Andrea today. Just want to dive in a little bit more in the skin care business. Can you talk a little bit more about the accelerators, other drivers of acceleration there with skin care being less strong more recently than historically? Are you seeing a pickup in the underlying market that\u2019s helping to grow the acceleration? And how are you thinking about that market going forward within your expectations for the 4% to 5% growth globally?","Tracey Travis","So, skin care has been picking up and certainly very strongly in the fourth quarter and we do have higher expectations. Some higher expectations for skin care growth this year than we\u2019ve seen certainly in the last couple of years. And there are a few things driving it. The first I would say is strong innovation. So Clinique, La Mer, Est\u00e9e Lauder, all have strong innovation programs that they\u2019ve launched and products that they\u2019ve launched in fiscal 2017 that we expect to carry into fiscal 2018 along with new innovation that they have planned.","The other driver is obviously the momentum that we\u2019re seeing with Chinese traveling consumers. Both in China as well as in the travel quarters and that is driving a lot of skin care growth and consumption as well in various channels of business. We\u2019re also seeing a bit of a pickup in Russian travelers as well which helps our skin care business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hi. A few questions for Dennis. First, just detail-wise, can you give us a sense for e-commerce profitability relative to the rest of the Est\u00e9e organization? And then within e-commerce the difference in margins between DTC versus your partner business? And then the broader question is, and this will build on from the earlier questions, but conceptually there are a number of online retailers, some fairly sizable that have this open architecture beauty assortments and not just premium brands but mass brands also. Can you give us more insight on how you decide which online retailers you\u2019re willing to partner with or not given your prestige positioning? And if they\u2019re large e-tailers you\u2019re not exposed to, does that create risk longer term from a market share perspective?","And then within the e-commerce sites you\u2019re at, how do you protect the prestige positioning given obviously ordering off a website is very different than purchasing a product at a department store. So how do you kind of manage to keep the prestige positioning within e-commerce? Thanks.","Dennis McEniry","Okay. Let me address a lot of that. First of all, the margin is accretive to the company in total. It\u2019s accretive across our own sites and our direct-to-consumer businesses and it\u2019s accretive in our retailer business as well. So all of the components of the business is accretive to the company. Obviously, it varies by business around the world. We operate over 700 sites around the world. So, depending on how long the site has been launched and what sort of scale we have in that particular business or that brand in that country. But we\u2019re really, really happy with the profit accretion of the channel. That\u2019s number one.","In terms of the amount of retailers we work with, we work with over 200 retailers around the world. I personally spend a lot of time with department store CEOs, with the heads of e-commerce businesses in different markets around the world. And frankly the number one consideration in which ones that we focus our effort on are two things: where is the consumer going? And secondly, what is their ability to help build our brands and to build our brand equity? Okay.","In terms of prestige, we focus a lot on building the beauty expertise of what consumers expect in historically in the real world or in the brick-and-mortar world and we bring that expertise online by marrying both real people with real expertise and technology to help them provide really, really outstanding makeup, skin care, fragrance advice online. So we do not believe that it is all about putting up a website and letting people order and then processing packages. The expertise and the people part of it is as important to our brands and to our prestige positioning as anything else that we do on the technology side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thanks. First in terms of just back to the U.S. and promotions, I mean how do you \u2013 obviously, a lot of that is being funded by the retailer at this point but how do you protect against a potential that the end consumer starts to get used to accepting discounts or delays purchases waiting for a deal, which does ultimately impact the health of the category for you guys?","And then on margins specifically for fiscal 2018, I guess I\u2019d like to better understand what kind of benefits you expect from Leading Beauty Forward for this year because you had said that you expect the benefits to outweigh the reinvestment. But 30 to 50 basis points sounds a bit light though obviously to your 50 basis point annual expectation, especially given that FX is turning from a tailwind into \u2013 from a headwind into a tailwind and the hit from M&A should lap as the year progresses. Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. I\u2019ll start with \u2013 to say your question is if the consumer will get accustomed to promotion. I mean, they are \u2013 consumers are segmented, and there are certain consumers that do wait for promotional opportunities to buy and this is not new. This has always been the case. And there are other consumers that don\u2019t. But on average, I just want to make you think that the growing part of the business is the non-promoted one. And the growing \u2013 the fastest-growing channels are the channels that promote the least.","And so in total, I would say that prestige beauty is from a consumer standpoint is an industry that need a moderate amount of promotions. And then where there are excessive promotions is a short-term event that generally doesn\u2019t generate a change in consumer behaviors. And then I think Tracey will address Leading Beauty Forward.","Tracey Travis","Yes. So Leading Beauty Forward, when we announced the program last year, one of the things that we said was fiscal 2018, we would start to see some of the benefits of the program. We expected that we would reinvest those benefits back in talent in some areas and capabilities. So we talked a lot in our prepared remarks about the digital technology and skill sets that we are enabling in the company that are important for us to drive our \u2013 the growth of our brands, certainly, in fiscal 2018 and beyond. So net-net, we are not seeing a flow-through of any of those benefits of Leading Beauty Forward because we are reinvesting them in fiscal 2018. You will start to see more of a flow-through in future years, in 2019 and 2020, and obviously the full benefits of the program in fiscal 2020, 2021.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","So, I also wanted to touch on the U.S. prestige category. So, clearly, we\u2019re seeing more discounting from the department store channel. So, I was just curious from your perspective, has anything changed for the category fundamentals? And as you look at your results recently, have the growth rates \u2013 I guess maybe not your results, but within the industry at all changed in prestige beauty the past few months? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","So I\u2019m not sure I understand completely the question. But no, we don\u2019t see any change in the dynamic of the industry. Actually, let me take the opportunity to explain one important thing. Obviously, the industry is based on trial and repurchase. What the change of the last few years is that the trial activity has become more competitive. There are more brands that have been in some cases promotions, they\u2019ve been more active. And so, the world of trial has become more competitive. But the world of trial tends to be an investment.","The world of repurchase, loyalty, actually has not changed a lot. The loyalty level on our brands are improving in some cases, stable in others. The repurchase rate remains very high for our hero SKUs. So, what\u2019s happening is that the repurchase is still driven by product quality and by product performance and by brand loyalty. And those things are not changing much less. Now, it happened that the majority of the profitability is in the repurchase gain. And so, the brands and the companies that own the repurchase gain are owning more of the profit and more of the cash. And the trial gain which is becoming more competitive is what we are all reacting to, improving our social media activation, our innovation, our activation in-store and all the rest. Promotion is only one element of how this is evolving and, frankly, not the biggest one in my opinion.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, everyone else have done two things, I\u2019m going to go with two things. First is just on Clinique. So, one was just performance in the quarter, but more specifically, I was curious if you could parse out Clinique performance in the channels where there\u2019s traffic. So, whether it\u2019s specialty-multi, also specifically online, things like that. And anything you \u2013 whether you feel like there are green shoots or examples of where Clinique is improving outside of the Fresh Pressed or if the brand still kind of needs a bit more love and attention. MAC freestanding stores, I don\u2019t think we got an update there on the U.S. performance. I know you talked about brick-and-mortar challenges ongoing. And then the final thing was on SMI. Tracey, I think you said that the savings were over $200 million this year. I believe the guidance was $150 million. So, I just want to confirm that SMI came in above plan and if you\u2019re willing to share anything on the outlook for 2018. Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","So, on stats and then Tracey, you take SMI. So, on Clinique. Clinique is growing in Asia. Clinique is growing in Europe. Clinique is growing in Latin America. I\u2019ll ask Dennis in a second to speak about Clinique online. Fresh Pressed has been a success. There are several aspect in the Clinique business which is growing. Clinique in brick-and-mortar U.S. department store is declining. And since this is still an important part of Clinique business, obviously, this is offsetting some of the positive moments. Sorry, then you asked about specialty, Clinique is growing in specialty in the U.S. Dennis, on online?","Dennis McEniry","So, Clinique in \u2013 first of all online Clinique is our second biggest business. It\u2019s been the first business and the first brand that we ever launched in the company and it is growing over 23% globally. So, it\u2019s very strong for us.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. And then on MAC again, as I said before, I already answered the question on what type of positive signs from MAC which is, MAC international and MAC online, ULTA, MAC in the U.S., the improvements in MAC marketing activity, et cetera. But yes, the two areas of MAC which are still taking the brand down are brick-and-mortar brand store and freestanding store U.S. But freestanding store outside of the U.S. keep growing profitably.","So, those are the two areas where we are working to further turn around the MAC However, to be clear, the expectation in fiscal year 2018 is MAC to grow because between the positive and","these two areas still to be fixed, the positive are much bigger than these two areas still to be fixed. And then on SMI?","Tracey Travis","So, you\u2019re right, Lauren, on SMI. We did deliver over $200 million in terms of savings this year and we did expect $150 million. So, we were able to drive additional cost saving programs in certain areas. Next year, we\u2019re expecting around the $150 million to $200 million savings as well. Some of the programs under SMI are dwindling a bit in terms of the opportunity. Some of the actions and programs under Leading Beauty Forward allows us to reignite some of those areas. Indirect procurement would be one of those areas where we managed to get a fair amount of lower hanging fruit in the last two years.","We\u2019ve expanded the number of categories now that we are focused on with standing up a new organization. And that should allow us to continue to drive savings in that particular area. So, the classification in total, both in terms of our ongoing cost saving programs and what Leading Beauty Forward is enabling, we expect to have continuous improvement in not just annual cost savings but certainly the leverage of the company as our sales grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey. Good morning, folks.","Tracey Travis","Good morning.","Fabrizio Freda","Morning.","Jason English","Thank you for squeezing me in. I wanted to come back to margins as well. Congratulations on the 100 bps of underlying margin growth you achieved last year. But it has gotten you to a point where you\u2019re kind of roughly parity with where you were in calendar 2013, so, kind of hovering around at 15.9%. Now, I know there\u2019s been a number of extraneous factors in the battered margins are proven to be headwinds last couple years you tried to overcome.","But many of those issues sound like they\u2019re dissipating, right? FX, no longer the same headwind. Skin care acceleration through the year, you\u2019re talking about more acceleration next year. A number of times throughout the call, you touched on the channel shift and acknowledged that much of that channel shift is margin accretive. And you\u2019ve got Leading Beauty Forward coming at the same time.","So, why couldn\u2019t there be a bit of a catch-up here after the stagnation for a number of years? And is there conservatism kind of embedded in maybe the average 50 bps of expansion over the next few years? Or are there other offsets that we need to be contemplating whether they\u2019d be in the form of how the business is changing, shifting, cost to compete reinvestments, et cetera? Can you help me understand that?","Tracey Travis","Sure, Jason. So, in terms of over the next three years, you\u2019re absolutely correct that we should \u2013 I mean, hopefully, and the macro environment is quite volatile. But as we see currency now becoming more favorable, if currency rates are better than what we have anticipated and reflected in our guidance, there will be upside related to margin. And we certainly would hope to recover some of the margin that we\u2019ve lost from some of the currency hits that we\u2019ve taken over the last few years.","In terms of the acquisitions, yes, our acquisitions, if they actually outperform what we have anticipated then that too will allow us greater margin expansion. Right now as you heard, we\u2019re expecting about $0.01 of impact from Too Faced and BECCA. If they perform better this year, that will improve our margins as well. And then Leading Beauty Forward, to the extent that some of those savings get realized earlier, and we have a tremendous amount of momentum against this program. There has been adoption across the company. To the extent that we can actually start realizing some of those savings earlier, then that that also will impact.","So, I think we\u2019re pretty confident that we have a lot of irons in the fire in terms of improving margin. What we\u2019re not confident of and hence the reason why we are saying around 50 basis points of margin expansion annually, so that\u2019s an average over the three-year time horizon. Again, it could be 30 bps one year and 70 bps or, like you indicated, 100 bps last year, excluding some of those items. What we\u2019re not confident of is the macro environment. So, we have experienced a fair amount of geopolitical tension and volatility whether it\u2019s in our travel retail channel or in many of our markets. And so, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent for us to not consider that that could be a factor this year and over the next few years. So, whether you call that conservatism or whether you call that prudence, that is certainly contemplated in our guidance.","The last thing I would say is we do have a number of new brands that we are building. We\u2019ve done several acquisitions, as you indicated, over the last few years. And we are supporting them in terms of distribution growth and, in many cases, building their presence in markets that \u2013 new markets that they\u2019re entering globally. And so, that is factored into our guidance as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink from Jefferies.","Steph Wissink","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just a real quick question on your channel mix. I think you indicated department stores are about 17%, online about 20%. I\u2019m just wondering if you can help bridge the balance across specialty-multi, freestanding and some of the other venues where you\u2019re distributing? Thank you.","Tracey Travis","So, just a reminder that that 17% was U.S. department stores. Our department store mix now is about 40% globally, a little over 40% globally. And so, this is one of the first years where actually our overseas department store business is larger than our U.S. department store business. On specialty-multi we talked about on the last call, and with Too Faced and BECCA and what they have added to the specialty-multi channel given their presence, we\u2019re at about 11% in terms of specialty-multi is where we ended the year. And then Dennis talked about where we\u2019re at online, which is in the 9% to 10%, and expecting 11% in this upcoming year. So, that generally is where we\u2019re at.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, I would like to take the opportunity of this question to make one thing noticeable, that we have double-digit growth in many of these channels. But if you just take the combination of travel retail, specialty-multi, online, you arrive, just with these three, at well about one-third of the company. And this is growing very strongly and very double-digit, more than 20% each one of these channels, et cetera. So, we are in a situation from a channel diversification that we have more than one-third of the company growing in the high-20s and that\u2019s very, very strong. So, the channel mix is actually a great point of our strategy of multiple engines of growth and diversification and is one of the key element which is building momentum.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from UBS. Mr. Powers, your line\u2019s open.","Steve Powers","Hello. Can you hear me?","Tracey Travis","Yes.","Steve Powers","Great. Sorry about that. Just a couple of quick follow-ups on the U.S. business, if I could. As you look forward to the second half when BECCA and Too Faced become part of the base business, do you expect U.S. growth to return to positive territory at that point? And can that continue? Question number one. And then just to clarify on your 2018 outlook, do you expect new door openings versus closings to be a net tailwind to the U.S. business in fiscal 2018 because there\u2019s a lot of stuff that you\u2019re putting in motion? Or are you still factoring in some net headwind from department store closings? Just some clarity there would be great. Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","So, yes, in our plans, there is a stabilization of the U.S. business without BECCA and Too Faced and absolutely. That\u2019s what we are aiming for and working for. And the second question, we believe that we can open more distribution points than what will be closed. And so, this will be \u2013 is in our numbers. There\u2019s still a net improvement of consumer reach in our plans.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good morning, everyone. As you think about the freestanding store footprint and how it\u2019s growing relative to online, what do you think the potential is for freestanding stores and also specialty-multi channel? How does that penetration develop? And then new product launches, as you look going forward, what brands do you think will have the most impactful launches of in fiscal 2018, and is there any quarters we should look to for that? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","So, freestanding \u2013 go, go.","Tracey Travis","Yes. So, Dana, we expect that freestanding stores will continue to show strong growth. And one of the things that Dennis spoke about is how we are enabling more productivity in our freestanding stores through linking them to more omni-channel capabilities, whether it\u2019s loyalty programs or other things that we are doing to try to keep the consumer in a branded experience leveraging technology and we will continue to do that. So, we certainly recognize that even though online represents 11% of our sales mix, that means 89% is in brick-and-mortar somewhere. And freestanding stores are still \u2013 play an important role.","There is no question that we are making sure, as we look at opening new freestanding stores, that we are contemplating the online growth in the region and how many points of distribution we need in a particular market so that we can make sure we are not over-saturating any market with brick-and-mortar distribution with the fast growth of online. So, that is factored into our retail plans.","As it relates to specialty-multi, specialty-multi has continued to grow quite strongly, both the online sites of specialty-multi which Dennis talked about how he works with all of our retail partners with their online business to make sure our brands are represented well online. But we\u2019re also seeing strong growth in specialty-multi. In the U.S., certainly, ULTA and Sephora, but also in our international markets as well. So, we expect that that, too, will continue as a great alternative for consumers.","One of the things that we see and, again, as both Fabrizio and Dennis mentioned, we are getting much better at tracking our consumer and utilizing our consumer information for decision-making. And we see that whether it\u2019s millennials or Gen X or Gen Z or we, ageless, consumers like to shop multiple channels. And so, there\u2019s more choice than ever out there in terms of shopping. Online is very convenient, but in-store offers a different experience. And certainly freestanding stores offer a different experience than specialty-multi, than department stores. But she likes to shop multiple experiences. And so, we are certainly focused on making sure all of our points of distribution, including online, are well-represented from a branding experience.","Fabrizio Freda","In terms of innovation, we have one of the strongest innovation pipelines. As I said in my prepared remarks, the innovation in fiscal 2018 will be also very focused on reinforcing the existing very strong franchises which are in all brands \u2013 Too Faced, Peach or Better Than Sex, Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair, Double Wear, Clinique taking the Fresh Pressed concept to the next level, et cetera, et cetera. So, there is a lot of buildup. You are now going to see one blockbuster which is a high-return, high-risk. You\u2019re going to see every brand to have three, five, big serious initiative well-focused by category. And the portfolio of innovation of the company to cover all the opportunity by sub-category and region in a much more sophisticated way than we did in the past, thanks to better analytic and better preplanning.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein Research.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, guys. Thanks very much for the follow-up. Just want to go to the impairment charges of $31 million on Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle and Olio Lusso. What percentage of the purchase price of those brands did that represent? And clearly, that\u2019s typically because the business didn\u2019t perform quite as well as you\u2019d thought. So, I\u2019d love to understand why and if it\u2019s helping you think about the future acquisitions in any way. Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","No. Frankly, this is very small. I mean, only one small fragrance brand is really in these impairment. And then one very small brand that was part of the acquisition before. And most of the other brands are growing double-digit, triple-digit, out of our [indiscernible] where we\u2019re including the small brands where we have an impairment on. They are all growing double-digit or triple-digit. And in the case of the impairment, it actually is a timing issue. So, frankly, no. We believe our acquisitions have been very successful and there is only one brand that has a small delay which in the context of the many acquisition that we have done is frankly not relevant. We are very satisfied with acquisition and we believe that BECCA and Too Faced and the other acquisition we have done particularly in the fragrances, or GLAMGLOW for example, are extremely successful and will continue to be a big part of our growth.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Daniel Rachmanis, President, Latin America. Daniel will give a strategic overview of this region.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges. You can find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website.","I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio now.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to say that for the fourth consecutive year, our winning strategy steered our company to new heights of success. We delivered strong results in fiscal 2013 with solid sales gains and double-digit EPS growth, and our improvement was broad-based. Every product category grew in every region. This performance enabled us to gain share in global prestige beauty and strengthened our industry leadership. We delivered these results despite challenges in several important international markets and some lower growth in the U.S. Yet overall, our brands thrived, thanks to well-received product innovations, personalized High-Touch service and compelling advertising. Our sales rose 6% in local currency, 2 percentage points more than prestige beauty did worldwide, and EPS increased 16% to a record $2.64. Most of our brands contributed, fueled by targeted investment behind products in fast-growing channels and countries. We improved our leverage of consumer insights and our digital reach, which helped us connect with consumers of widely differing backgrounds in more than 150 markets, including many who were new to our brands.","And we appealed to global consumers through local lens, with products and communications tailored to their desires and customs. By focusing our resources on our biggest and fastest-growing opportunities across consumer segments, categories, channels and countries, we achieved record financial results and hit some major milestones.","In fiscal 2013, our sales topped $10 billion for the first time in our history. Globally, we gained 30 basis points of share, with gains in skin care and makeup and in Asia\/Pacific, Western Europe and Latin America. By maintaining our financial discipline, we leveraged the higher sales and grew operating margin to an all-time high of 15.2%. Net earning passed the $1 billion mark for the first time. Our total stockholder return was 23.7%, which was better than the S&P 500.","From a brand perspective, the standouts during the year were our luxury brands, La Mer, Jo Malone, Tom Ford, which together, grew about 20%. La Mer new Moisturizing Soft Cream helped drive the brand's total sales and attracted new consumers. We believe that more than 50% of people who bought the soft cream were new to the brand, and the product lifted sales of the brand's moisturizer category 30%. Combined, our 3 largest brands grew 5%. Este\u00e9 Lauder and Clinique gained share globally in both skin care and makeup, while M-A-C enhanced its position in makeup. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand generated double-digit growth in travel retail and Asia. Clinique's fastest growth was in North America, and M-A-C business grew sharply in every single region. In Latin America, M-A-C's makeup collections have been gaining in popularity, and across the region, it is our #1 brand.","All of our categories advanced. Our skin care was the fastest growing and most profitable. Our overall growth continues to be supported by innovation. 16% of the company's sales came from innovations in new products. We believe our newest products have great potential and expect more of sales this year to come from fiscal year '14 launches.","Prestige beauty gained over mass in several countries, including the United States and China. Several of our brands gained share in North America, and our brands had the top 9 SKUs in skin care and the top 5 in makeup, according to NPD. We gained share in China, where our 14 brands collectively grew 23%, as well as in Asia overall. Este\u00e9 Lauder, the prestige beauty leader in China, gained share. And Clinique made terrific progress, also increasing share in its distribution. We had an encouraging year in Japan, where our business continued to recover and we gained share in our distribution. As we have discussed throughout the year, Korea was challenging, and our domestic sales there fell sharply.","Our region covering Europe, the Middle East & Africa grew overall, with emerging markets such as the Middle East expanding double digits. We, again, demonstrated our ability to achieve growth in strong markets as well as soft ones. In the U.K., prestige beauty outpaced mass, and we experienced healthy sales growth and share gains. And in Italy, where prestige beauty declined, we had robust sales due to strong innovation and new door openings.","Through a wide range of prestige distribution channels worldwide, our brands are able to reach consumers in the most engaging and appropriate ways by region and country. One of our big wins was e-commerce, where we, again, had significant growth and crossed a milestone. Sales surpassed $0.5 billion. Sales rose in both our own brand sites and retailer sites. Travel retail started out more slowly than we had anticipated, but sales growth accelerated throughout the fiscal year. Our retail sales outpaced total beauty sales in the channel, and we have tripled the pace of passengers' traffic.","Having now completed 4 successful years of our long-term strategy, let me give you a sense of our progress. Sales has climbed 40%, and our operating margin more than doubled. We completed a 4-year restructuring program, saving $781 million, which was more than 50% greater than the original forecast. Some of that savings, along with better managing the growth in expenses, freed up substantial resources to invest in advertising and marketing. Since 2009, we have increased advertising, merchandising and sampling by almost $900 million, which went to developing creative print, TV, digital advertising and exciting in-store displays. This model has created greater awareness for our brands and helped lift sales significantly.","We are confident that the next phase of our strategy will allow us to continue growing sales and profits, enabling us to set a new long-range operating margin target of 16.5% in fiscal 2016. As we start this new fiscal year, we will stay the course. We are guided by our strategy, which remains solid, and we are making some refinements based on changing market conditions and new insights. We foresee stable global prestige beauty growth, increasing approximately 3% to 4%. We believe Southern European markets will remain soft and Korea will continue to decline, but not to the same extent of last year.","Starting in our recent fourth quarter, we have seen some lower prestige beauty growth in the U.S. Despite this challenging condition, we still expect to grow at double the rate of global prestige beauty. We are positioned to maximize the potential of the power of our brands and estimate constant currency sales gains of 6% to 8% this year.","To fuel the growth, we will exploit our best opportunity for our brands. They are: to win in large markets and in core department store channel, further penetrate smaller cities in emerging markets, create exciting innovations, be locally relevant, re-energize the fragrance business, advance our retailing concept and gain in high-growth channels. To expand our leadership in our heritage markets, we plan to look for granular opportunities to target multiethnic consumers more effectively because they are expected to drive the majority of prestige beauty growth through 2020. In the U.S. and the U.K., we will continue to work with our important department store customers to refine our assortment to reflect regional differences in trend, consumer ethnicities and distribution.","China is expected to remain one of our fastest-growing markets as we continue to expand distribution to smaller cities. We have made progress with our skin care business in China, and we raised awareness and educated consumer about our makeup and fragrance offering. Skin care will remain our biggest opportunity, since it is used by 94% of Chinese women. Long term, we see good potential to build up makeup, which is only used by 16% of Chinese women regularly today, and also fragrance, which 47% of Chinese women use only occasionally. As part of that effort, we recently brought Zegna into China, and Jo Malone will launch this fiscal year.","We also plan to broaden our presence in smaller cities in other emerging markets, including the Middle East and Russia, as we diversify our distribution and introduce more locally relevant products. This promises to be a major year for attention-getting innovations, and our 2 biggest brands already have launched blockbuster products. Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion, commonly known as DDML, is the best-selling prestige moisturizer in America. Now Clinique has created the first reformulation since the original product was introduced 45 years ago. The new product, called DDML+, features new technology and much enhanced moisturizing benefits but has the same look and texture.","Este\u00e9 Lauder major global launch is the new version of its iconic Advanced Night Repair that combines the latest technologies to create its most advanced serum. The new ANR will continue building this important franchise. In conjunction with the launch, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand commissioned a clinical sleep study that showed poor sleep quality negatively affects skin function and appearance and can weaken the skin's natural repair capabilities. ANR helps maximizing skin natural night repair processes and helps women wake up to younger-looking skin.","Both of these new products are being heavily supported with major advertising investment, including TV, in many markets, which should help with sales momentum in coming quarters. These blockbusters illustrate our intent to create fewer but bigger launches mapped to the largest market and consumer opportunities. We have many other innovations that will debut these coming months, some based on new technologies, other on local insights, and they span regions, categories and brands. Some of these new products will be fragrances, which we are giving increased attention and intend to grow more rapidly this year. Fragrance represents about 1\/3 of the worldwide prestige beauty sales and is expected to be the strongest area of industry growth after skin care. We believe it can be a larger and more profitable opportunity for our brands as well, particularly in emerging markets such as Latin America and the Middle East. In the past few years, we focused on improving fragrance profitability. Today, we are well positioned to resume faster growth, leveraging the new cost structure we have implemented. We have many activities underway to expand our share in the fastest-growing and profitable ultra-prestige segment. Tom Ford is expanding distribution, particularly in the European region, and we'll introduce a collection of Ford Private Blend scents designed for the brand's entry into Asia.","Also in the luxury area, we expect Jo Malone global popularity to continue sending its sales up sharply. The AERIN brand will launch its first scent in November in a 5-piece upscale collection to be sold in select specialty stores in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Marni and Zegna, recent additions to our portfolio, will expand their geographic presence, and another newcomer to our fragrance portfolio, Tory Burch, will launch next month. We expect our Aramis and Designer Fragrances Division to grow double digits and to strengthen its designer brands, including Donna Karan, Coach, Tommy Hilfiger. With Michael Kors' success in apparel and accessories, along with our new launch activities, we believe our sales of the brand fragrances will also strongly accelerate. We will build scale and profitability in ADF by optimizing its portfolio by region and business model.","In our third fragrance pillars, those that are part of our beauty brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder will begin rolling out Modern Muse in September to the U.S., U.K. and certain other markets. This mark its first major fragrance launch in a decade, timed to take advantage of the important holiday season. Est\u00e9e Lauder will generate buzz with an extensive TV, print and digital marketing campaign.","On the retail front, we intend to leverage M-A-C's expertise with freestanding stores, develop new concept and strengthen our High-Touch services as we open more stores globally for many of our brands. Freestanding stores selectively complement our wholesales business, and in some regions of the world, we are building equity for our brands that traditional retailers can then build upon. We are trying to create a more cohesive experience for consumer with engaging merchandising across retail and wholesales locations. Our brands are approaching freestanding stores in various ways. M-A-C, for instance, has created several different store formats that vary by size, location and target consumers that allow it to maximize its penetration. For example, Aveda will expand its presence in Japan and Korea with its own stores. We are the leader in prestige beauty and e- and mobile commerce, with sites across 20 countries. In fiscal '13, we had triple-digit growth in mobile sales and site visits. This year, we will launch e- and m-commerce operation in new markets, including Poland, Israel, Malaysia and Taiwan, and several brands will expand their digital sales to much more countries.","Travel retail business is expected to increase double digits as we capitalize on the growth in skin care and Asia, focused on opportunities in makeup and accelerate our widening fragrance portfolio with key franchises in travel corridors. We are well situated. Prestige skin care and Asia consumers are the fastest-growing segment in the travel retail channel, and they are our areas of strength.","We continue to improve our social media skills and find exciting ways to engage consumers. A dramatic example of this was in May, when M-A-C created an online-only event to sell a coveted Rihanna lipstick. The brand sold out the collection online in North America in less than 3 hours, and the only way a consumer heard about the sale was through e-mail, social media and M-A-C e- and m-commerce sites. Not a penny was spent on traditional advertising. We are looking forward to 2 more M-A-C Rihanna collections that will launch this fall. They will have an online component and be available in stores.","We have always been a growth company. But over the past 4 years, our mission was to make that growth more profitable and sustainable, and we clearly accomplished that goal. Having established a firm foundation, we are in an even better position today to focus on our top line growth, with the added advantage of having greater advertising firepower to ignite our brands and promote their latest innovations. With our creativity and innovation, a wide geographic reach and the ability to react swiftly to the best opportunities worldwide, we believe we can continue growing faster than prestige beauty. At the same time, we will continue to improve our operational capabilities so that we can further enhance our service to our retail customers, as well as our consumers.","I'm extremely proud that our company has achieved such important historical milestones, and we couldn't have done it without the constant hard work and dedicated efforts of all our employees. I want to thank them for believing in our vision, executing our strategy so well and making The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies what it is today.","Now I will turn the call over to Daniel.","Daniel Rachmanis","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. I joined the company in 2007, after 20 years in the industry. I was chosen to lead our newly established Latin American region in 2009 in order to build on our company's 50 years' history there and capitalize on the promising opportunities we see now and in the future.","Our first priorities were to strengthen the teams in our 5 affiliates and develop best-in-class regional capabilities in finance, supply chain, human resources, consumer insights, digital and store design. We have made good progress in all these areas. Today, the Latin America region includes 17 countries, from Mexico down to Argentina. Since this regional structure was created, we have doubled our net sales to approximately $260 million, totaling approximately 3% of the company sales, and we have enjoyed a compound annual growth rate of 22%.","In fiscal year '13, our sales growth was 11%, twice the rate of prestige beauty in the region, driven primarily by Brazil and Peru. We view Latin American's role in the geographic portfolio of the company as a profitable engine of growth. We have grown sales, and we'll continue growing twice as fast at the average of the company while, at the same time, being accretive to the company's profitability.","Also, the investments we make in Latin America drive awareness for our brands among the millions of regional consumers who then buy our products in profitable channels such as travel retail and in destination cities across the United States and Europe. We estimate that for every $1 we sell in Brazil, for example, we sell another $1.50 in travel retail and North America. With the strong results we have generated, we now have a solid platform for additional growth in the coming years.","To give you a sense of the possibilities that lie ahead, today, we sell only 10 of our brands in the region, and not all are sold in every country. In fact, in Brazil, one of the fastest-growing beauty markets in the world, we sell only Clinique, M-A-C, Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan and Michael Kors, and we see terrific opportunity for additional brand expansion. Latin America is a $24 billion beauty market and the fastest growing among all global regions, with a 10% CAGR in the past 4 years. However, 89% of the market is mass. That said, the prestige category has been growing faster than mass as millions of people have joined the middle class. In fact, Latin America's middle class has increased by 50% in the last 5 years to 165 million people. We believe we can convert many people in the new middle class to our aspirational prestige beauty products.","Within prestige beauty, fragrance and makeup are growing the fastest in the region since they represent an entry into the luxury market for the aspirational mass consumer. The growth of prestige beauty is also being driven by new distribution channels such as specialty-multi and e-commerce.","From a category standpoint, fragrance accounts for nearly half of this beauty mix, followed by makeup and skin care. Over the past couple of years, we have become the #1 player in the still small prestige makeup and skin care segment with a combined share of 54.2% for the 12 months ended March, up 230 basis points from the year earlier. This strong performance provides us a solid base to continue recruiting emerging prestige consumers from mass.","On the contrary, we are still very under-penetrated in the larger prestige fragrance category, so we see a strong opportunity for growth in that area as we roll out new franchises and increase our advertising. In coming months, we will launch Uomo by Zegna in Colombia and Brazil, the new Michael Kors collection in Brazil and Tory Burch in Mexico. Brazil is the #1 fragrance market in the world, yet we also see promising opportunities in other categories. For example, Brazil is the second-largest global market for hair care products, and we believe 1 or more of our hair care brands could do well there, so we are exploring our options.","Naturally-based products are also extremely relevant to Latin consumers. We just opened our first Origins counter with our partner, Liverpool department stores, in Mexico City. Given the excellent initial results, we plan to expand to 50 doors in the country over the next 5 years.","In terms of distribution, across Latin America, the largest channel is door-to-door at 50%, followed by supermarkets, perfumeries, department stores and pharmacies, but the channel mix is different from country to country. Department stores are the strongest players in prestige distribution in the region, and they represent 53% of our business. Perfumeries represent 10%. Freestanding stores are a fast-growing channel for us, and M-A-C's retail stores account for 20% of our total distribution mix, mostly in Brazil.","With our leadership structure firmly in place and a clear view of our growth potentials, we have developed a robust strategy with several strategic pillars to accelerate our business. Since we already lead in the prestige segment, our largest growth opportunity will continue to come from sourcing new consumers from mass. We will accelerate several proven and successful initiatives to increase trial and loyalty among emerging prestige consumers, including greater accessibility of our products, better pricing awareness, flexible payment options, smaller sizes and value reframing. Similar to many other countries, we know that many aspirational consumers live in high-growth secondary cities, particularly in Mexico and Brazil. We intend to increase our reinvestment in those areas through more profitable and cost-efficient formats, including freestanding stores.","In Brazil, M-A-C's 30 freestanding stores provide a profitable base for growth. That's why we plan to expand M-A-C's geographic presence in Brazil to 50 stores in 30 cities by fiscal 2016. We are also opening the brand in 3 new countries this year: Ecuador, Uruguay and Paraguay.","The second pillar of our growth strategy is developing the right distribution channels by country. While we expect to continue winning with our traditional department store partners, we also plan to lead in fast-growing emerging channels, namely e-commerce and specialty-multi.","We launched our first brand e-commerce site 2 years ago for Clinique in Brazil, and sales have steadily grown. Later this year, we plan to unveil our second e-commerce site in the country, this time for M-A-C. Looking further out, we expect to launch e-commerce in Mexico and Chile in fiscal '15. We also have 10 marketing sites for our brands throughout the region, and we have a local presence on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter in many markets.","The specialty-multi channel is changing the retail environment and creating new distribution opportunities for our brands. For example, Sephora is rolling out in more stores in Mexico and Brazil, and Smashbox, Clinique, Bobbi Brown, Est\u00e9e Lauder and our fragrance brands are leveraging this new distribution.","Another critical component to our continued success will be the further development of the freestanding store channel. Our regional stores allow us to build brand awareness, fully express brand equity and provide High-Touch services to our consumers. They also serve to recruit and educate the new consumers we want to capture in advance of the arrival of traditional retailers. We currently operate 37 of our own stores, and another 43 are run by our partners. In the next 3 years, we expect to double the total number, including stores for new brands such as Aveda and Jo Malone.","The third pillar of our growth strategy is our portfolio management by country. We are tailoring our go-to-market model according to the potential we see in each specific country. In Mexico, a well-established core market, we are the #1 player in prestige beauty. The key to our success has been our ability to develop relevant concepts and products, such as specific foundations shaped for Latino consumers and special skin care products for oily skin. M-A-C's waterproof mascara and color collections have resonated strongly in Mexico. We are also exploring opportunities to optimize the travel corridor linking Mexico to the Southwestern United States, where 13 million Mexican tourists visit every year. During the next 3 years, we plan to grow our retail store presence in Mexico, invest in secondary cities and launch e-commerce. We believe we can continue our current double-digit sales growth in the country.","The countries that we consider our strong growth engines are Brazil, Peru and Colombia. With an average 35% growth per year over the past 4 years, Brazil is one of the company's fastest-growing major emerging markets, and our share has increased dramatically over the past 2 years. Brazil is the third largest beauty market in the world after the United States and Japan, but is growing much faster. However, we are still playing in a tiny segment, since mass represents 98% of the total $12 billion Brazilian beauty market. The country is dominated by very strong local players that offer masstige products and have strong business models. Despite these well-regarded competitions, we were encouraged that M-A-C was recently voted the most loved cosmetic company in Brazil and the second most admired brand in all categories by a respected Brazilian trade and retail magazine. And we are seeing an important trend of consumers trading up to more aspirational foreign brands.","Although we've had strong growth, distribution in Brazil remains challenging. Department stores are nonexistent, perfumeries are fragmented and losing share, and the new prestige distribution is still emerging. Going forward, our distribution strategy in Brazil will focus on freestanding stores, specialty-multi and our e-commerce business.","In Peru, we are growing 40% a year as our chain of retailers expand in the country by opening malls and department stores. In Colombia, Clinique is the market leader in prestige beauty and M-A-C is expanding into prosperous secondary cities like Cali and Medellin.","Lastly, over the past 4 years, we have successfully reduced the relative weight of the more economically volatile countries on our portfolio, including Venezuela and Argentina. They are expected to represent only 11% of the regional sales this fiscal year. We will continue to manage these countries cautiously and direct our efforts and investments toward more stable countries.","As you see, we are still at the beginning of our journey, with a vast majority of the Latin American beauty market left to pursue. In that context, I believe The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' brands are uniquely positioned to consolidate and accelerate their leadership in Latin America.","I would like to close by recognizing and thanking our 2,400 employees across the region for their passion and dedication to our brands. Thank you.","And now I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Thank you, Daniel, and good morning, everyone. I'll briefly review the highlights of our fiscal 2013 fourth quarter and full year financial performance and then frame for your expectations for the year ahead. As usual, my commentary on the financial results excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges.","For the fourth quarter, net sales rose 7% to $2.41 billion. Excluding the impact of currency translations, sales grew 8%. Net earnings increased 40% to $96.8 million compared with $69.2 million in the prior year quarter, and diluted EPS was $0.24, above the top end of our expectations. The challenges that emerged in our third quarter with the latest wave of SMI have been resolved, and we have begun work on the last major wave of SMI implementation, which is scheduled to launch in July of 2014.","Regarding sales, every region contributed to sales growth in the quarter. Sales in our Americas region increased 5% in local currency, with mid-single-digit growth in North America and high single-digit growth in Latin America. From a channel perspective, our North American sales at retail were mixed, with the strongest growth realized through multi-brand specialty stores, luxury department stores, online and our own freestanding stores. Mid-tier prestige department stores and salons were softer this quarter. The prior year included a reversal of a provision for sunscreen returns, which lowered growth in the Americas by approximately 2 percentage points in the quarter.","In the Europe, Middle East & Africa region, sales increased 13% in local currency. We achieved double-digit sales gains in the developing markets of Turkey, the Middle East and South Africa, but also in many established markets in Western Europe, including Italy, Germany and the U.K. Our sales in the travel retail channel rose 15%, slightly ahead of sell-through. The region's growth was partially offset by declines in Switzerland and in Russia.","Sales in the Asia\/Pacific region rose 5% in local currency. Double-digit gains were achieved in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Thailand and Vietnam. China grew sales 7% as retailers sold through the inventory build from the SMI rollout earlier in the year. Growth at retail remained strong at nearly 20%. Japan increased sales by 5%. Korea continues to be weak. However, declines are more modest now that we have anniversaried the initial downturn in the market. Our gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 80.3%, primarily related to obsolescence.","Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 220 basis points to 74%. Selling cost decreased 80 basis points, and advertising, merchandising and sampling fell 120 basis points, reflecting the planned cadence of marketing increases to earlier in the year, as we have discussed with you previously. Operating income rose 54% to $150.3 million, and operating margin increased 200 basis points to 6.3%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.1% compared with 15.8% in the prior year.","For the full fiscal year, net sales rose 5% to $10.2 billion. Excluding the effects of currency translation, sales grew 6%. Net earnings gained 16% to $1.04 billion, and diluted EPS increased 16% to $2.64. Every region and major product category contributed to our sales growth again this year. Gross margin increased 70 basis points to 80.2%. The increase came primarily from 40 basis points related to positive pricing and mix and 20 points from favorable cost of goods.","Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 30 basis points to 65%. We increased advertising, merchandising and sampling 10 basis points, reflecting our continued commitment to support our brands' new launches. Collectively, all other costs fell 40 basis points as the benefit of cost savings and productivity improvements more than offset other investments.","Since fiscal 2009, our operating expenses have improved 250 basis points, while at the same time, we invested an incremental 230 basis points in advertising, merchandising and sampling. This means that all other expenses have declined by 480 basis points, a significant achievement.","Operating income rose 12% to $1.54 billion, and operating margin increased 100 basis points to 15.2%, another record achievement. Our savings initiative contributed $73 million in fiscal 2013 and totaled $780 million over the 4-year span of the program.","Net interest expense declined 10% to $54.8 million, primarily due to lower rates, and our effective tax rate for the year was 30.7%. We recorded $17.8 million in returns and charges associated with restructuring activities in fiscal 2013 and believe that charges related to this program are substantially complete.","Net cash flows generated by operating activities increased 9% to $1.23 billion compared to $1.13 billion last year, primarily reflecting higher earnings. We invested $461 million in capital projects, mainly for counters, retail stores and systems. We returned 100% of our free cash flow to stockholders in fiscal 2013, which went to repurchase approximately 6.7 million shares of our stock for $388 million and pay out $419 million in dividends, which reflected a 37% increase in the dividend rate, as well as the incremental outlay from a transition to quarterly payments.","Days sales outstanding increased by 2 to 44 days. Inventory days to sell rose to 183 compared with 164 days last year, primarily to support both the SMI transition and planned future growth.","Fiscal 2013 marks the end of a 4-year period where the company focused on restructuring, resizing and realigning the business model. Going forward, we expect to build on our success and leverage the investments we've made in R&D, consumer insights, geographic expansion, SMI and productivity to continue our growth trajectory. We expect global prestige beauty to grow at 3% to 4% in fiscal '14 and 4% to 5% annually thereafter, and we continue to believe we can exceed this growth by at least 1 percentage point.","More of our growth is expected to come from innovation, reflecting the emphasis on bigger, more impactful launches, as well as locally relevant developments. Our small and medium-sized brands are continuing their momentum and are likely to make a greater contribution to growth as they expand into more countries and more doors. Developing markets should provide a greater share of incremental sales as they grow in size and their populations continue to achieve greater wealth, and we have continued to see accelerated growth in many of these markets in fiscal '13. Skin care and makeup will remain our largest categories, but fragrance should continue to grow and contribute more as we renew our commitment to the category and launch new brands and products.","These drivers of strong top line growth, combined with increasing productivity and prudent reinvestment, should allow us to deliver operating margin expansion to 16.5% in fiscal 2016 and double-digit annual EPS growth for the next 3 years.","Let me now talk about our outlook for fiscal 2014. Sales are expected to grow 6% to 8% in constant currency. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact our full year sales growth by approximately 2%. Our estimate assumes weighted average exchange rates for the full year of $1.24 for the euro, $1.50 for the pound and $0.01 for the yen. Our estimate also includes approximately 2 percentage points of growth from pricing. The combined benefits of pricing and operating leverage are expected to drive operating margin expansion by 40 to 50 basis points for the full year.","Continued cost discipline allows us to invest for sustained growth and efficiency. This year, we plan to further strengthen our capabilities in consumer and shopper insights, our research and development, retail stores, supply chain, human resources and information systems. We expect advertising, merchandising and sampling to remain fairly consistent as a percent of sales annually, with a different cadence of investment by quarter this year, and we do have the flexibility to invest incrementally behind activities that demonstrate good momentum during the year.","Our fiscal 2014 tax rate is planned at 30% to 32%. We are forecasting full year EPS in the range of $2.74 to $2.87. Depending on the magnitude of exchange rate movements, the approximately 2% negative currency impact on our top line equates to about $0.10 of EPS. Excluding this foreign exchange impact, our EPS is expected to rise by 8% to 13%. As a reminder, in fiscal 2013, we had some onetime benefits that will negatively affect the comparison to fiscal '14, including $23 million of other income related to the 2007 sale of Rodan + Fields, which was equal to about $0.04 of EPS.","In fiscal 2014, we plan to generate approximately $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations. Our capital plan of $525 million will largely support consumer-facing investments in counters, retail stores and e-commerce, as well as back-office support for systems and supply chain.","In our first quarter, we expect sales to grow 5% to 7% in local currency. Translation could hinder growth by approximately 1%. Major product launches, including the new Advanced Night Repair, Modern Muse and DDML+ should help drive growth. We also expect our marketing investments to be substantial, given the innovation activity in the quarter that we are supporting, which should aid to our sales -- should aid our sales momentum throughout the year. Therefore, we anticipate that EPS will come in between $0.67 and $0.71 in the quarter.","As we said earlier, wave 4 of our SMI rollout is scheduled for July of 2014, which is the first quarter of our next fiscal year. This group includes our North America order-to-cash business, our travel retail division, Japan and the Middle East and represents approximately 18% of our sales. As we've seen previously, we expect retailers to increase their orders in advance of the go-live to mitigate any potential disruptions from the transition. The impact of this potential shift in orders will be to increase sales in our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and full year. As we have done in the past, we will provide an estimate of the shift when we get closer to the date and have a better indication from the retailers of what this shift will be. The guidance, however, that we have given today does not include these incremental sales and profits.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just want to talk about the growth rate that you're expecting for this year. So relative to the 3% to 4%, you're saying 2x, plus 6% to 8%. You mentioned a big incremental increase in advertising in Q1, but can you provide some color on the cadence for the remainder of the year? And then also, can you provide some perspective on where you expect your share gains to come from? Is it stronger in one region versus another, or product category? And do you expect to source most of your share gains from bigger players or from smaller brands?","Tracey Thomas Travis","Well, for the full year, our advertising, marketing and promotion as a percent of sales will remain flat. So we do see a shift, as I had mentioned before, in the quarterly spend. And again, as we have mentioned before, supporting our launch activity, which is substantial, obviously, in the first quarter. Fabrizio mentioned DDML and Advanced Night Repair, which launched in July. We also have Modern Muse, which is the first relaunch in some time of a fragrance by the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand in September. So the combination of those 3, as well as some of the other licensed brand fragrance activity that we have, is increasing the spend in the first quarter. It should normalize over the balance of the year to create a flat percent of sales for advertising promotion and marketing.","Fabrizio Freda","In terms of share gains, we assume to continue growing share in Western Europe, Asia, Latin America, and we believe we will stabilize our share situation also in the U.S. thanks to the innovation programs of the next 12 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to zoom in a little bit more on the U.S. Fabrizio and team, can you guys give us your perspective on what's caused the deceleration of the prestige category? And then within that, maybe touch on channel mix. I know last year, I think you said that your U.S. business, around 9% of those sales were coming from online. Where do we stand with that today?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. So the -- first of all, the deceleration of the U.S. business that we have seen started in May. The U.S. business has been growing in prestige as per NPD at about 6.9% in the first part of last fiscal year, and then in quarter 4, it's 2.5%, and then June was minus 1%. So it's been clearly a softening in that period. Now we believe this just been a reduced traffic for several macroeconomic reasons, and we already see some improvements, and we believe that back-to-school and then later, the holiday season, should bring the U.S. market back to solid growth, although we believe will be a growth below what we've seen in fiscal year '12 and the beginning of fiscal year '13. In terms of channel mix, we are continuing expanding very strongly in e-commerce, and e-commerce is growing 20%-plus, and we believe this will continue. We are also growing in our freestanding stores at double digit, and we are continuing expanding in specialty-multi successfully. And -- however, independently from the soft last couple of months of the fiscal year, the -- we grew about 6% in the U.S. in fiscal year '13. So a pretty solid growth, and we believe that probably, this growth will be reduced but will remain solid over the fiscal year '14.","Tracey Thomas Travis","So just to add on to what Fabrizio said, as we have communicated all year, our online business has grown 2.5x to 3x what our regular business has grown. So in the U.S., it's approximately 10% now versus the 9% last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So from a margin standpoint, your fiscal 2014 EPS guidance implies only about 40 basis points of margin expansion, even at the high end. Given your favorable pricing; channel mix; operating leverage; the drag from SMI, I would assume, is improving; why can't you do better than that? And what are the negative offsets to those positives I mentioned from a margin standpoint?","Tracey Thomas Travis","So you may recall that we made the decision a quarter or so ago to extend SMI. So we do have an extra quarter of SMI this year that we did not expect to have previously. So that is creating some incremental expense. Largely, we have offset that incremental expense. We also have planned advertising increase, obviously, for the year, and as I mentioned right now, planned flat for the balance of the year. But we have other investments that we're making as well. We're making an investment in our HR systems. We're making investment in some of our marketing areas, as well, to support the growth in fiscal 2014 and beyond. Making some investment in our innovation areas as well. So that's the reason why the margin expansion is 40 basis points, 40 to 50 basis points. And we expect that, that will continue over the next 3 years. Once we have fully implemented SMI and start to really leverage it, and we expect to do some of that this year -- so one of the benefits that the delay has given us is the opportunity to focus on the first 3 waves of the rollout and really optimize some of the tools and the deployment of SMI and SAP, and that is expected to yield a benefit as well this year and certainly beyond.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Guys, wanted to ask a little bit more about your thought process on just the incremental spend in 2014, because you are clearly increasing spend, but the top line isn't growing much faster than you have been without the spend. So I'm trying to get a better sense, I guess, of -- is it because it's just more difficult out there, so competition is greater and consumers are tougher? Or indeed, you're spending more for the future, whether it be innovation or distribution gains? So I'm trying to get an understanding of the mix between those 2. And I ask that particularly in the context -- you had it in your prepared remarks for the past 4 years, being very strong from restructuring and spend-back perspective. But now, as we look forward, we are, I think, having to expect a little bit more of a leverage on your current expenses. So I'm trying to tie those 2 together in terms of your spending more this year, growing the same this year and then going forward, we're expecting more leverage, I guess, on your current expenses. So I'm hoping to get some help tying those together.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, let me explain what is the idea behind that. We definitely are preparing for an acceleration of top line growth. And this year was 6%, and we plan 6% to 8% next year. Now the acceleration should also be read in the context of the overall market, meaning we are very confident that the sum of our activities will provide the acceleration, I will give you some details in a second, but the market behind it is still some signs of softness. And Southern Europe, we believe, will continue to be soft. Korea will continue to be soft. And frankly, for the moment, we suspend our judgment on the U.S. temporary softness that we have seen in May and July, and we assume that this will not recover all the way to the levels of the U.S. that was last year. So with these assumptions -- that's why we say the market. If this assumption holds, the market will grow 3%, 4%, and we are saying 6% to 8%. So we are saying we will grow double than the market one more year in -- and to grow double than the market, frankly, we need the innovation and all the other -- and the investment in the advertising that we have created. Without that, it would be very difficult to beat the market in that way. Now obviously, if the market will grow better, it will be stronger over time, then we can see even better leverage from our investment in advertising and innovation in our top line. And we will see -- and we'll do, obviously, the best we can. The details I wanted to give is that, obviously, Korea, the current U.S. trend, Southern Europe are somehow concerning. But on the other side, we expect strong growth in developing areas like China, Middle East, Turkey, Latin America, as you heard. We expect double-digit growth in travel retail again in the year and a continuation of 20-plus percent growth in online. We are looking to our luxury group of brands like La Mer, Tom Ford, to continue to grow 20% more. And our innovation, as I explained, should be a strong driver. So we are, in my opinion, again, not only improving our productivity and ability to leverage our -- with growth our cost, but also, we're in a position to exploit our growth portfolio. Because even in a moment when we had a quarter of soft in the U.S., we have strong growth in China offsetting it. And Korea is down, Japan is back up. So the strengths of our portfolio that cover different regions, different categories, different channels is really one of the things that make us comfortable with a strong growth over the years, but obviously, reflecting the reality of the market in every given moment.","Tracey Thomas Travis","The only thing I would add to that is, Ali, and you mentioned this, we are seeding distribution for those mid-tier brands to continue to achieve the kind of growth that we've experienced this year both from a comp standpoint, they're doing terrific, but also from a distribution opportunity standpoint now that Jo Malone and La Mer continues to have momentum -- and Tom Ford and some of the other brands that we have at that -- next year, Aveda, for instance, that Daniel mentioned in terms of perhaps an opportunity for Latin America. So we are investing more in distribution, both for our newer brands as well as in emerging markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask quickly just on gross margins in the quarter in terms of sort of puts and takes there, why it was not up as strongly as it's been or why it was actually down a little bit. And then just back on ad spend, is it going to be in different regions and channels in fiscal '14? And how do you measure returns and efficiencies on the spend, considering the decision to maintain or to increase as you go forward?","Tracey Thomas Travis","Okay. So on the gross profit margin, there were a couple of different impacts. The mix favorability wasn't as great this quarter as it has been in previous quarters, but there was a favorability. So in addition to that, as we have called out, our inventory is at higher levels than certainly we had anticipated this year with some of the delay in the SMI conversion. So we ended the year with higher inventory. So we did make sure that we were properly provided, from an obsolescence standpoint, for that. And the last area is we did have a slight unfavorability in manufacturing variances for the quarter. But again, for the year, as you saw, we showed tremendous margin -- gross profit margin expansion. So it's more of a quarterly phenomenon than, certainly, an annual.","Fabrizio Freda","In terms of our advertising and promotional spending, we are very deliberate and strategic about the resource or location. We have a very thorough internal process to measure the return of these investments, and they vary a lot depending on, for example, which area of the world we are launching. If we do a big launch in China, this is normally more advertising intense than the Middle East, as an example. Or which brands. If we have a launch in M-A-C, it's obviously less advertising intense than Est\u00e9e Lauder. Or the importance of innovation. If we launch a big -- like Advanced Night Repair relaunch, that's much more advertised than the next variant of BB cream. So it's very, very deliberate, and it depends from market, from kind of category and from the kind of innovation that we are getting better and better in measuring the return on investment of what we do.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","My major question is about the first half overall for fiscal '14. Can you tell us if the -- if we put the second quarter together with the first quarter, if the earnings for the first half of the year will grow roughly in line with your guidance for the year? And I'm just -- I'm assuming that there is a shift in timing of marketing away from the second quarter back to the first quarter, and maybe if we look at the 2 together, they'll be in line with the year? And then also, China, you under-shipped in the first quarter relative to sell-through at retail. Would you be back in the second quarter to shipping in line with sell-through at retail in China, so we'll get an acceleration in sales there?","Tracey Thomas Travis","So Alice, I'll start off and then let Fabrizio chime in. We are currently not giving second quarter guidance. I would, though, remind you that we had an SMI shift last year, where we actually pre-shipped product in the second quarter for the third quarter go-live of SMI release 3. So we -- just keep that in mind when you're looking at your model and modeling out the quarters. Certainly, from a mix standpoint, the first quarter, from an advertising, marketing and promotions standpoint, will be the highest as a percent of mix relative to the other 3 quarters. But that -- but we'll certainly be prepared to update second quarter when we have our next call.","Fabrizio Freda","In term of China, I mean, it is difficult, frankly, to provide reconciliations by quarter of every single country in this way, but we are pretty happy of our trends in China and pretty satisfied for the fiscal year that we are closing, meaning fiscal year '13. We grew 20-plus percent in China, again, at retail, and our same-door grew 5% at retail. So China is doing pretty well. And our strategy there is about reaching new consumers, the new growing middle class, via the ability to penetrate new cities and continuing increase distribution and also reaching the many traveling Chinese consumers that want to travel outside of China, which we often speak about, which has been 40 million in the closing year, but also the ones who travel within China, which we should not forget, at 350 million every year. And before, they were used to all buy in Beijing, but now they find the product in their own e-commerce site or in their own city. And obviously, this -- so they buy less in Beijing and more in their hometown, and we are favoring this process. That's why we should look at China as a whole and over time, and not divide it quarter by quarter, piece by piece, because a lot is depending on this incredible phenomenon of distribution expansion in the cities. Just to give you a data on this one, we have expanded, in 2013 fiscal year, 11 new cities in China. And we plan in fiscal year '14 to expand another 14 new cities in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you talk about the trends on the Asian margin front? Because, obviously, I think this quarter was an anomaly. But can you just sort of explain what happened in the quarter and kind of how you're going to look at the margin profitability in Asia going forward? And then just a housekeeping item, is there any share repurchase included in your guidance for '14?","Tracey Thomas Travis","So certainly, on a reported basis, obviously, we have the impact of exchange on the margin in Asia in the quarter. In addition to that, obviously, we spoke about the fact that the shipments in China were a bit less in the quarter because of the amount of inventory that the trade was still working through. So the retails continue to be strong, but our shipments were less, given the shipments that were made in Q2 to support the rollout of Q3 in China. So the foreign exchange, Korea, obviously, being down significantly, as we've talked about, all impacted the margins in Asia\/Pacific. It is a tremendous high-growth region for us, as you know, and it's a profitable region for us. So we certainly expect that to continue into fiscal 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Couple of things. On the big push behind fragrance over the next year-plus, what impact do you expect that to have on your margins? My understanding historically is that there's a lot of A&M that goes with it. But if you restructured in that business, is it possible for that to meet or beat your current average margins? And then the second question is on Europe. Excluding travel retail, you must have seen enormous share gains. And I was wondering what particular product might have driven that and if some of what you're seeing in Europe is Middle East shoppers and things like that. So just a little understanding of what happened in Europe that was so strong.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, sure. Let me first answer the fragrance question. Is -- our fragrance portfolio is better in margin overall, but the different components have different margins levels. So the high end, like Jo Malone or certain brands like Clinique, they have definitely the opportunity to be accretive in terms of margin as they grow. Other brands, more the designer fragrance portfolio, as you know, as an example, are in a position where they're not accretive, but they are in a much better margin position. So the impact, also, of the accelerated of fragrances will be to enable our acceleration of growth because this is an important category, which embrace 30% of the global market, and we need to be able to grow in this. This growth will allow us to leverage our cost base in a better way across the company. So it's not necessarily being accretive as a category, but it definitely is going to be important in certain parts of it and also in terms, as I said, will be also accretive, but is going to be important to accelerated growth and leverage our cost base over time. In terms of what's happening in Europe, we are doing very well, as I said. I gave in my prepared remarks the example of Italy, but we are doing very well in many developed markets, even the ones which are very soft. And so what's happened is that we're winning there. We're winning there with our innovation because we are investing in this difficult moment. And so in this way, we are building market share. This, for us, is a big strategic decision because never, never miss to exploit a crisis is our way of thinking, in a sense, that we -- our market share in Europe is not very high in all of these markets. So that's the moment where we have the opportunity to establish us as bigger player in Western Europe, and then benefit of it for the many years to come when we are starting from a higher market share when those markets will recover, as we believe will happen at a certain moment in time. The other thing which is happening in this area is huge success in emerging markets. The Middle East is doing very, very well. For us, it's 20-plus growth. Turkey is doing very, very well. South Africa is doing very, very well. So -- and the Russia situation has stabilized. So in this situation, we see EMEA, as we call this region, doing pretty well, despite the softness in Southern Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Fabrizio, you guys have been so innovative on the product side, and I just want to talk a little bit more on the marketing side as well. Could you give us a sense of how you are thinking about your digital ad spend overall, how that's trended from last year to this year and maybe, ultimately, where you think your total ad spend can go and maybe some of the innovation behind that to drive these excellent e-commerce sales?","Fabrizio Freda","So -- you mean the advertising in the digital part. So our digital budget in advertising is increasing significantly. It's tripled in the last year. So we are spending much more in digital, and we will continue to increase our digital spending. Obviously, there are some of our brands, which use digital online communication, digital advertising and all the e-commerce activities as their main communication activity. Example, this is very important area for M-A-C, while there are other brands, which are using more TV or more print. So this is, again, not -- I cannot speak about -- the company average, in other words, doesn't give you a real sense of the reality. It's by brand, our decision making, and our return on investment is calculated by brand. So -- but on average, we are definitely increasing our investment in digital in a very significant way.","Operator","Your next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Could you talk a little bit about the 2% in sales from pricing? Does this mean you're raising the price with the innovation that's coming on DDML and Advanced Night Repair? And are these actual price increases, or with the introduction of new fragrance, is there also a positive mix shift because the fragrances are more expensive? And then just a follow-on, could you give us an update on Osiao?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. On pricing, the 2% is more or less in line with the cost inflation. So overall, how the 2% is driven is a mix of some regular price increases in certain countries, where the inflation and the reality of the market allow us to do that, and some of the innovation comes through higher prices. And then finally, there are also some price decreases, meaning 2% is the average. But to be very clear, we are decreasing price, including of some of this new innovation in certain markets, particularly in Asia, where it was appropriate to decrease the prices. We are increasing the prices in other markets, where it was the right decision. And then the innovation mix is positive. Some innovation is higher priced, some is lower priced. So price is a pretty sophisticated exercise. The result of it is an average of 2% to cover our cost inflation, and that's, obviously, our minimum objective to go forward. That is not an average number that we use. We use a very specific number by brand and by activity.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Wu with Telsey Advisory.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Can you perhaps talk about your R&D spending goals in FY '14 and any new hires or changes that you plan to make in the department and which sort of product attributes you plan to focus the innovation on? And just secondly, can you update us on your new distribution, especially in the specialty beauty retailers, and how the testing of Est\u00e9e Lauder at Sephora North America is progressing and also your plans to increase distribution there? And also, similarly, with La Mer in Sephora China and France?","Fabrizio Freda","Are you answering the first question?","Tracey Thomas Travis","In terms -- can you repeat your first -- the first part of your question?","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Tracey Thomas Travis","It was on the R&D and our R&D spend. So we are slightly increasing, as a percent of mix, our R&D spend this year. And again, our R&D spend is certainly disclosed in our financial statement so that you know what we're investing. And a good portion of that, as Fabrizio said, as we looked at our strategy over next 3 years, new products and innovation have always been a critical element of the company. And we have a tremendous amount of leverage and momentum to increase that now. And it's been a stated focus of the organization for the last few years, and we've achieved good results in that area. So we are seeing a slight increase in the percent of spend of R&D this year versus last year. Certainly, a portion of that, as you mentioned, will be incremental headcount, and we are -- and the R&D team is certainly executing against that. In terms of Est\u00e9e Lauder in Sephora in North America.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. In terms of our distribution, so the test on Sephora Est\u00e9e Lauder is continuing and was planned for 18 months, and so we probably make a final decision in the next 6 months. And in terms of our distribution plan overall, we are increasing distribution next year, and we have done it in fiscal year '13 and we'll continue to do next year in a very significant way in some emerging markets, as I said, in secondary cities, in smaller cities around the world. And in the new growth channel, expanding e-commerce, expanding travel retail, expanding specialty-multi, including our partner, Sephora, in many parts of the world, all this is up. And just to give you maybe the sense of our 6% to 8% growth, 2% come from pricing, as we just discussed, and 1.5% to 2% will come from distribution expansion. The rest will be organic growth. And so distribution is increased -- is a very important piece in our model. And I want to take the opportunity because I forgot to answer Osiao before, and so for fairness, I want to say that we continue our test of Osiao. We are encouraged by the results, but we are still in a testing mode on this brand.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just want to follow up on your comment that there was going to be -- Tracey said there's growth coming from some of the small and midsize brands, and I didn't know if that specifically referred to fiscal '14 that, that starts to accelerate, or was it a longer-term comment? Because it's particularly interesting in the context of this enormous launch activity in both Est\u00e9e and Clinique just even in the first quarter.","Tracey Thomas Travis","So it is a longer-term comment, Lauren. And the kind of growth, as we had shared with you, that those brands had in fiscal 2013, we certainly expect that they will have continued momentum, both based on their innovation programs for fiscal '14 and beyond, as well as the distribution opportunities for those brands. They're obviously not as widely distributed. And Jo Malone in the U.K. is doing tremendously well. Tom Ford has had some terrific success. Aveda has been a call-out for us all year with some of the new products that they've launched, and there's still a tremendous amount of international opportunity for the Aveda brand. So we're very excited about not only our heritage brands and all of the wonderful innovation that we have this year planned for them, and certainly that should make for an exciting year for Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and M-A-C, but also for that next year. So we have -- we are continuing to diversify our portfolio. Over the next 3 years, we actually expect the mix of those brands to be a higher-percent penetration.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. And I just want to add on this point that this is a deliberate strategy. We have 3 very big and successful brands: Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and M-A-C. And we need to continue building the rest of the portfolio to critical mass and critical size, and we are very successful. The moment we do that, brands like Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Jo Malone, the moment they reach this critical mass level, they contribute enormously more in absolute terms, obviously, to the growth of the company. And this is happening, and this is making us, again, stronger in terms of ability to grow and ability to penetrate different categories, spanning from skin care to makeup to hair care to fragrances, in the correct way.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo Securities.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to take advantage of Daniel and ask about Brazil. Historically, it's a direct selling and mass market, but how do you see the market evolving over time? And specifically, do you see door-to-door share of the market deteriorating over time? And then also, can you gain material share with your own stores, or will you require additional department store build-out before it really becomes a material part of the company's business overall?","Daniel Rachmanis","Yes, you're absolutely right. Door-to-door is the main distribution channel for beauty in Brazil. And if you look at the results of some of the door-to-door players this last year, indeed, we have seen some slowdown in their sales growth. On the other side, the prestige market is growing much, much faster than mass in Brazil, almost 4 points faster, and that's the area where we are focusing on. We see emerging distribution, such as specialty-multi and e-commerce, developing in Brazil. We see the middle class demanding better products, better services, and I believe our brands are perfectly positioned to offer those better products and better brands going forward, as prestige distribution in the country increases. So very clearly, we are in Brazil for the long term. It's one of the key markets. It's one of the largest consumer markets in the world. So I think we're just touching the surface of our opportunities as we launch new brands and develop distribution in the country.","Fabrizio Freda","I just would like to add one concept that was in the prepared remark of Daniel that Latin America, for us, is small but provides great opportunity for growth in the future. And our strategy, like in many emerging market, is to grow profitably from day 1. So we are maybe taking less advantage of the speed of addressing the market because we are growing more gradually, but we are growing profitably so that the growth of this market will be accretive to the company average. And we have chosen this strategy for the several reason that Daniel has explained in the prepared remark.","Operator","Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two things. First, on travel retail. Tracey, I think you said that the 15% was ahead of sell-through. And is that just intentional because of the timing of SMI or -- maybe you can explain that gap? And then second thing, someone asked about share buybacks, and I don't think you answered the question whether the earning -- the EPS guidance for 2014 includes buybacks or not.","Tracey Thomas Travis","So in terms of travel retail, there are different -- slight differences in timing between sell-in and sell-through. They're never quite exactly matched from quarter-to-quarter. So no, it had nothing to do with SMI as it relates to fiscal -- the end of fiscal '13 and fiscal '14, since the next wave is, obviously, beginning in July of 2015, Wendy. But we certainly expect continued strong double-digit growth from travel retail in fiscal '14 and believe that it's an exciting channel for us. In terms of our share repurchase and the guidance that we've given, yes, some of it -- there is a slight amount of share repurchase, primarily to offset dilution in -- from our equity program.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to stay on the inventory question in terms of sell-in versus sell-through. I think in the past, you've talked about sell-in trailing sell-through by about 2 points. That was most acute, I think, in travel retail. That's been, I guess, solved this quarter, and I think also in Europe. So could you give us a sense of what sell-through looks like in Europe at this point versus sell-in?","Fabrizio Freda","At this point, our sell-in and sell-through are aligned. Even in travel retail, what you mentioned is the beginning of last fiscal year, when there was destocking, then the stock normalized over the year. Travel retail finished in a balanced way. And the same thing we see in Europe. In this moment, I think, our stock situation is pretty balanced versus what it's been in the past few years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alec Patterson with AGI RCM.","Alec Patterson","I was just curious about your strategy in Korea. It seems like a market which has got maybe more structural issues in terms of the prestige category. And so how are you thinking about handling that? And to what degree does that impact the travel retail segment of Korea?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, that's a great question. I completely agree. Korea is -- there is a structural thing. The structural thing is that during this recession, or at least this very difficult economic situation that the country went through, consumers started to trade down. And so the -- and some local brands did a good job to attract particularly young consumers. So we are working on a rethinking on the way to manage our brands in the future, go back to advertise them in the correct way, analyze the right distribution opportunities and, particularly, manage innovation in a much more locally relevant way, able to attract all the young, emerging consumer segments and their way of thinking. And so that's why we are guiding Korea as continuing to be soft next year because we absolutely need time to fix this market for the long term. However, we will fix this market. This is a very important market for us and for the long term and will have influence on total Asia over time. So we are working very diligently to adapt to the new reality and continue growth in Korea in the future. Onto the travel retail side, on the contrary, there are good news. Our Korea travel retail, as we explained last time, is 13% of the global travel retail and is growing again, because the travel retail is recovering faster, with the -- also the currency situation is improving there. So on the travel retail side, we are doing better and we are growing again, so it's an area of recovery.","Operator","Your last question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I have a still -- a question with regards to -- and it had been alluded several times during the call, which is the difference between shipments and like-for-like sales, if you will. And I still fully don't understand essentially -- if you can help us understand, division-by-division, the following, and I'm going to give you a list because I've been kind of like not fully tracking what the crumbles of information that you had given: What was your shipment to department stores in the U.S., given that retail sales were flat? What was your shipment to Western Europe, given that the industry is flat? And what is your shipment in travel retail, given that it's growing only at 10%? And in the case of Asia, why is it that -- I understand that you mentioned about the destocking in China because you overshipped at the beginning of the year. But you mentioned that your retail sales in Asia were up 20%, and that is an acceleration from what you just -- what you saw in the first 2 quarters that you said that same-store sales were growing 2% to 6%. So I'm confused with regards to what is same-store sales, what is shipments. So if you can clarify this in a more systematic way, as I said, department stores in the U.S., if you please, Western Europe, travel retail and China, that will be very, very helpful.","Tracey Thomas Travis","Well, Javier, I'm not sure we can clarify all of those individual areas. I mean, there are certainly differences in timing. As you know, shipments precede sell-through, and shipments are for comp doors as well as new doors. So to the extent that we, along with our retail partners, project sales to occur, and therefore, we ship them product, if the environment changes suddenly, there is a difference between retail sell-through and our shipments that ends up curing itself when we ship less product in a subsequent quarter. So certainly, there are different dynamics that have occurred over the last year, 1.5 years, if you will, between the different channels and the different environments in North America, in travel retail and in other parts of the world. But it all normalizes out over the course of a year or so. So I think that, as you look at our patterns of shipments year-over-year, other than the major call-outs as it relates to destocking that occurred last year and created some challenges for us earlier in the year, very specific to travel retail, by and large, our shipments year-over-year and the retail sales pattern year-over-year is the same with the exception of when we have promotions and launches, and that will obviously affect some of the year-over-year piece. So again, I would remind you that shipments also include new distribution, not just same-store sales. It may be a bit confusing. And perhaps, we will certainly look at clarifying, when we're talking about retail sales, we're talking about our -- the sell-through, if you will, versus the shipments. And so -- but certainly, we can spend some more time with you later on in the day and walk you through that in more detail. If we can provide greater clarity, we'd be happy to do that.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea","Good morning, everyone. On today's call, we have Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Kunes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Thia Breen, President of our North American affiliate. Thia's going to recap the holiday season and discuss our strategic progress in North America.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Except when noted, our discussion of our financial results and our expectations are before restructuring and other charges. You can find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website. ","And I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, and welcome to our Fiscal 2012 Second Quarter Earnings Call. First, I want to acknowledge the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Evelyn Lauder, who was the heart and soul of our company. She was best known for her work in fragrance development and breast cancer awareness, but she was truly a pivotal architect of our vision, values and culture. Her incredible strengths, compassion and generosity will leave a lasting legacy on all of us personally.","Now let me turn to the quarter. I'm pleased to tell you that our company once again achieved strong double-digit sales and profit growth, and the second quarter results was largely higher than the top of our expectations. Importantly, our terrific performance was broad based across geographies, categories and brands. For the period, our sales rose 10%, and our earnings per share were $1.01 after the recent 2:1 stock split. ","We are now in the third year of our strategy and extremely gratified that we continue to achieve solid gains worldwide regardless of economic conditions. This clearly demonstrates that we have a winning and sustainable strategy and that consumers are drawn to our unique and innovative products and High-Touch service approach.","As a company, we continue to increase share in many large and critical markets, outpacing both mass and prestige competitors. Here in the United States, our largest market, our brands increased share by 40 basis points in the high-margin prestige skin care category, where we had focused much of our resources. We also improved our competitive position in key categories in countries across Asia and Europe, including China, France, Germany, Turkey and Italy.","Spending by affluent consumers remained buoyant this quarter, particularly for the kind of affordable luxuries that we offer. Sales of our higher-end brands, including La Mer, Bobbi Brown, Jo Malone and Tom Ford, enjoyed chart double-digit growth globally. What's driving consumers to our brands, whether in Shanghai, London, Los Angeles or Milan, is a winning formula that combines incredible innovation, brilliant advertising, local relevance and improved High-Touch services.","We have attract thousands of new multiethnic consumers, increased our repeat business and even launched products that created new subcategories. We began this approach about 2 years ago by strategically advertising several cutting-edge skin care products from Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique with the more frequent use of TV. Now we have taken the same approach to makeup. Using a full spectrum of television, digital and print ads in key markets worldwide, we recently started aggressive campaigns for foundation products. And later this year, we'll promote eye and lips products on television, in numerous websites as well as in magazines. ","Our advertising is compelling and creative. Early results for the new makeup ads are extremely encouraging. For instance, at the end of the first quarter, Clinique ran a commercial in the U.S. for Even Better makeup, which helped lead foundation sales and its entire makeup category. The TV ads, our first for makeup, followed a major TV campaign for the continuous skin care product, Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector. And some ads promote the 2 products together.","Clinique makeup sales in North America grew 13% this recent quarter, confirming that our advertising works and draws new consumer to our innovative products. We've also been collaborating with our retail partners to reinvigorate the beauty floor in North America department stores, and results continue to be robust. Both Est\u00e9e Lauder's and Clinique's sales in the channel climbed high single digits. Much of this is driven by sourcing demand for prestige skin care, and Est\u00e9e Lauder enjoyed great success. Its North America skin care sales jumped 23%.","During the holiday season, total U.S. retail sales rose 4%, according to the National Retail Federation, in line with prestige department stores. However, prestige beauty sales did even better, up double digits. Our holiday business was strong, and Thia will elaborate on our many successful efforts in North America.","In fast-growing Latin America, where luxury brands are booming, we saw exceptional growth, especially from Brazil, an exciting growth opportunity for us. In Brazil, our company is growing the fastest in prestige in gaining share in makeup, skin care and fragrance. M-A-C is #1 in makeup and has expanded distribution through freestanding stores and e-commerce, which is planned in the coming months. ","Our fastest growth was Asia\/Pacific, where virtually all countries contributed. In China, we continue to see solid opportunities for success by building awareness and distribution and bringing in new brands and products. The company sales rose an impressive 44% this quarter on top of 29% last year allowing us to add a point in share. The outstanding gains were led by Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer and Origins and their desirable skin care products. Some of the highest sales came from door expansion. We entered 10 more cities, bringing our footprint there to 52 cities.  Looking ahead, we are mindful of factors that [indiscernible] the base of future growth in China economy. ","Our European region grew on the strength of Travel Retail and higher demand in the Middle East and Italy. Our brands advanced in the region through their product services offering and expanded distribution. For example, in Italy, overall prestige skin care retail growth, less than 4%. But Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder had double-digit gains, demonstrating the consumer response to our superior offering even amidst tough times. Expanding its High-Touch concept, Clinique opened its first Service As You Like It counter at Galeries Lafayette in Paris, which generated significant media buzz. And Bumble and bumble opened a new retail average through 10 John Lewis stores in the U.K. Higher passenger traffic and successful marketing activity fueled Travel Retail, particularly in America and Asia. We are pleased that with these results, it seems the channel\u2019s had exceptionally strong growth in the prior year quarter. While we believe we are outpacing our competitors in Europe, our outlook reflects continued cautions of a slowing market growth as a result of the economic uncertainties that are dampening consumer sentiment there.","Turning now to our fragrance business. We had strong results in the Americas and Asia, particularly in our luxury brands and from scents that we have created for specific markets. Our hair care category grew nicely on the strengths of a promising new collection for Aveda and Bumble and bumble expanded retail distribution. Across our product categories, our e-commerce business rose double digits in all regions. We have brand sites in 15 countries and continue to roll out sites globally.  As our digital effort increased in importance, we are widening our corporate and brand presence in social media. ","Even with our strong sales growth, we have maintained our financial discipline and our focus on creating greater efficiencies and productivity. As a result, we achieved a gross margin improvement of 150 basis points, reaching nearly 80%. And our operating margin rose 50 basis points to 22% of sales.","Building our capabilities remained an important strategic priority, and we successfully launched another wave of our Strategic Modernization Initiative in affiliates across Europe, Asia, including Italy, Spain, Korea and Australia. Our Smashbox and Bumble and bumble brands also went live. We had terrific, terrific success implementing SMI today. We are encouraged it's going so smoothly, and we expect to eventually reap the benefits of new efficiencies throughout our organization. ","As planned, we are substantially ramping up our global advertising spending in the third quarter due to the timing of major launches and to support existing franchises. We believe these additional investment in advertising will allow us to maintain our strong growth in the fourth quarter in spite of a softening business climate.","One of the exciting new introduction we will advertise is a skin care product from Est\u00e9e Lauder brand developed specifically for the European market called Revitalizing Supreme Global Anti-aging Cream. It's based on exclusive technology and created after extensive consumer research about what European women want, which is a multitasking cream. This is a great example of our mission to be both locally relevant as well as creativity driven and consumer inspired. Increased advertising spending will also go towards commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair franchise, as well as toward Clinique Even Better skin care and makeup products.","Separately, we are proud at Est\u00e9e Lauder's most recent big success. Idealist Even Skintone Illuminator won the Marie Claire Prix d'Excellence award last month in France. The award is given to the most innovative cosmetic products and is a prestigious honor. These products continues to help drive Est\u00e9e Lauder's skin care business in France.","Our high advertising spending behind our most desirable skin care and makeup products is carefully chosen depending on the country and region. In every case, we are locally relevant and invest our money where we think we can have the greatest input. For instance, Clinique is our main focus in the U.S., Est\u00e9e Lauder in China, M-A-C in Brazil.","We put our resources behind the most promising brands in the fastest-growing markets, and when circumstances changes our investment due too, we are nimble and flexible and attuned to market conditions globally. Over the past 3 years, we have generated higher sales by pushing the best opportunities at any given time at every given place around the world. ","In our new global business model, our increased sales generates improved productivity, profitability and value creation. We are a growth company, and our bottom line reflects our ability to leverage our highest sales growth for increased profitability. We believe this financial model is sustainable, and we see strong growth ahead. That condition stems from our continuous emphasis on innovation across product development, packaging, High-Touch services, advertising, merchandising, and now, digital media. We are confident we are well positioned to exploit the growth potential of prestige beauty across our categories and regions. Today, our best opportunities lies at the crossroad of our state-of-art aspirational skin care products and the growing appetite of the global Chinese consumer for the best of beauty.","With half of the fiscal year behind us, we are confident in our ability to obtain our goals and financial guideline. We are taking up the bottom of our full year earnings per share estimate by $0.03 to $2.16 to $2.23 a share positively. ","This more positive outlook reflects continued momentum in our underlying business, which we believe we compensate for expected softer markets in Europe and the stronger dollar.  One of the areas where they're most excited about is the fantastic growth in our largest market, the United States. We believe this market will remain vibrant and should help to mitigate slowing in other regions. ","Now Thia will talk to you about some of the promising opportunities we see in North America.","Thia Breen","Thank you, Fabrizio and good morning everyone. First, let me give you a little background about myself. I've been with the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies for more than 30 years in several brands and various positions. Most recently, I was the Global President of the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand until 2009, when I was honored to be chosen to lead the company's newly created North American affiliate. Since then, working with my experienced team, we have reignited growth in our home market, which is by far our largest, while improving profit margins. I'm pleased to say that our efforts have been a great success.","In fiscal 2011, North America had its best performance in a decade with sales growth of 9% and record profits. Thanks to our sustainable strategy, that trend has continued. Our holiday business was strong and broad based across categories, brands and channels. Sales in our core channel, U.S. department stores, rose a healthy 8%, and online maintained its rapid pace, up 24% this quarter.","Many of our brands' special holiday sets performed well. Importantly, as the leader in U.S. prestige beauty, we're gaining share against mass and building strong share gains in skin care which is one of our strategic priorities. In fiscal 2011, total U.S. prestige skin care and makeup gained 2 points against mass brands. In skin care, Clinique, Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer increased share against many major prestige and mass competitors. And across our brands, we gained share in our largest accounts.","Clinique is the largest beauty brand in the United States in both mass and prestige. And with our large portfolio of diverse brands, much of what we do sets the tone for the overall beauty industry. Our fragrance share in prestige declined in the recent quarter, which was the result of a planned reduction in promotional activity and underperforming products. We're optimistic about the upcoming launches and the continued success of our higher-end fragrance brands, including Jo Malone and Tom Ford.","Our success has been achieved by careful design. As I'm sure you recall, the U.S. department store beauty business had languished for many years, but when we embarked on our multiyear strategy in 2009, we worked closely with our retailers to change course. With U.S. Department stores accounting for 2\/3 of North American sales, our business in that channel is clearly of vital importance. By creating an affiliate in North America, we've been able to support retailers with one strong voice on behalf of all our brands, allowing us to be more efficient and effective.","Internally, our brands are sharing and leveraging ideas and resources, making for a more cohesive entity. Our carefully honed strategy has reinvigorated our department store growth and also fueled higher sales in other channels. The pillars of the strategy involve pulling customers into stores with compelling and frequent advertising that features our brands' newest and most innovative products. Once consumers come to our brands' counters or websites, we offer personalized, High-Touch services for a customized fit, improved navigation and cutting-edge tools that lead to a pleasurable shopping experience, higher sales and repeat business.","Last year, we improved our media mix, putting more money into TV, print and digital campaigns and taking some out of promotions, and it paid off. The average sale per launch in the U.S. jumped by 67%. When shoppers come to our counters, they may be surprised to discover it's not the same old experience anymore. ","Clinique is rolling out elements of its Service As You Like It format depending on the size of the door. The brand has installed more than 1,000 iPads at its counter that can recommend 180,000 possible product combinations based on skin concerns. By the end of the fiscal year, Clinique expects to have 1,500 iPads at about 1,250 doors in North America.","Sales at the stores with iPads are running 3% higher than trend which is a terrific result. Est\u00e9e Lauder has created a separate studio that offers excellent lighting conditions to match the right foundation to skin tones. The Bobbi Brown brand highlights Bobbi's picks, her favorite cosmetics and collections to help consumer choice. Each of our brands is rethinking its in-store experience to appeal to today's consumer, and several exciting pioneering concepts will debut later this year. ","Our strategy has not only brought new consumers to our brand but also into department stores to shop for beauty for the first time. As part of a mix, we've attracted both a younger and more diverse consumer.","Here's a case in point. During the recent launch of Idealist Even Skintone Illuminator, Est\u00e9e Lauder recruited many new consumers. Nearly 1\/2 were new to the brand and more than 1\/4 hadn't previously purchased at a department store beauty counter. The company's flagship brand also reached a more ethnically diverse group.","In North America, we've also boosted sales in other distribution channel. Our 500 freestanding stores express a brand\u2019s equity in the most meaningful way and establish a direct connection with consumers. M-A-C's 2-year-old Times Square location is so busy with locals and tourists that it's the brand's highest-grossing store in the world. Several of our other brands that operate retail stores also have secured prime locations in highly populated areas.","Our e-commerce sales are expanding rapidly. The North American online business continues to be robust, thanks to both our own brand websites as well as retailer partner sites. The sales in multi-brand specialty beauty stores are also amongst our fastest growing. In recent months, we added several brands in Sephora, including Origins, Bumble and bumble and Bobbi Brown. Our Aveda and Bumble and bumble hair care brands launched major national print campaigns last year to introduce new products, and those ads helped drive consumers to salons, freestanding stores and Sephora. ","Lastly, we are refocusing our efforts on Canada which is the company's sixth largest country and where we see a major opportunity. We established an affiliate there last July to create a dedicated focus on Canadian consumers and retailers to improve our competitive position.  Canada's growing beauty business is vastly different than the U.S., so we have to adapt to its culture. For instance, 40% of prestige beauty sales in Canada come from high-end beauty boutiques within drugstores compared to virtually none here. We will use some of the strategies that have been successful in the U.S. to help drive sales and gain share in Canada. These include running TV commercials to advertise Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique products for the first time and supporting department stores as our key retail channel using some of the merchandising and High-Touch approaches that have worked well in the U.S.","To expand our brand's presence, we'll continue our growth in Shoppers Drug Mart, an important retailer for prestige beauty and in Sephora as it expands in Canada. We also intend to launch our brands' e-commerce sites. To build on our North American momentum, we continuously improve our capabilities, particularly in consumer insights and consumer relationship management skills. We implemented our first strategic research programs in Canada to get a better understanding of the Canadian consumer, so we can create product and programs that are locally relevant.","We are also designing targeted marketing programs to reach multicultural and multi-generational groups of consumers and are seeking opportunities to expand into new and existing channels, strength in our social media skills and improve our merchandising and in-store capabilities.  We have reduced beauty advisor turnover to the lowest level in a decade and implemented programs to attract and retain our best talent, resulting in more effective sales force and several million dollars of savings. ","We expect fiscal 2012 to be another record year in North America with strong growth across all our major prestige channels. We're excited about the company's future in its largest markets, as we look to leverage our portfolio and strengthen our leadership position. ","Now I will turn the call over to Rick.","Richard W. Kunes","Thank you, Thia, and good morning, everyone. My discussions on the quarter and the outlook exclude restructuring and other charges. Additionally, all earnings per share information reflect the 2-for-1 stock split, which was effective on January 20. ","As Fabrizio discussed, we had another solid quarter with broad-based growth among all of our regions and most key categories. In local currency, sales rose 10%, the high-end of our guidance range. Currency translation was minimal, resulting in reported sales growth of 10% to $2.74 billion. ","As expected, some retailers, primarily in Asia\/Pacific, ordered extra inventory before the January launch of SAP in several of our affiliates. This increased our second quarter sales by $30 million, or slightly more than 1 percentage point and operating income by about $23 million is equal to $0.04 per share.  These sales would have likely been made in our third quarter. Net earnings for the quarter rose 13% to $401.1 million compared with $355.8 million in the prior year quarter and diluted EPS was $1.01 compared to $0.89.","Our skin care category continued to thrive. Sales rose 13% in local currency and grew double digits in the Americas and Asia\/Pacific. A strong innovation pipeline and continued support of existing products fueled skin care gains at the Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique brands. The strength of La Mer also contributed to growth in the category. ","In makeup, local currencies sales rose 12%, primarily driven by our makeup artist brands as well as Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder. The makeup category grew double digits in every region. Clinique used skin care technology and newly launched products to benefit the makeup category. The launch of Tom Ford beauty also contributed. ","Our fragrance business declined 1%, excluding currency, as growth in Asia and the Americas was offset by a decline in the European region. The high end of the category performed well, with strong double-digit growth at Tom Ford and Jo Malone. Increased sales from recent launches were more than offset by lower sales of certain existing fragrances.","In hair care, sales rose 9%, reflecting solid growth at Aveda, notably in international markets, as well as the expansion of Bumble and bumble and Sephora in the U.S. Partially offsetting these gains were lower sales to the direct response TV channel for Ojon. On a geographic basis, our sales in the Americas remained robust throughout the holiday season and grew 9% in local currency. Virtually, all brands contributed with particular strength from our top 3 as well as our luxury group. The United States rose 9%; Latin America grew 19%, led by exceptional results in Brazil; while Canada declined modestly.","From a channel perspective, our online business had a terrific holiday period, with sales up 24%. Multibrand, specialty beauty stores rose strong double digits, while department stores rose high single digits and our own stores were up mid-single digits.","In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, sales climbed 7% in local currency. Growth by market varied, reflecting circumstances specific to each country. Travel Retail expanded 15%, reflecting 5% growth in international passenger traffic and strong execution by our brands at point of sale.  Travel Retail had a very difficult comparison this quarter after growing 45% in the prior year.","Solid growth was delivered in several key markets. The Middle East and Africa rose nearly 25%, Turkey was up more than 30% and Italy rose mid-teens. Spain and France rose high single digits, and Germany delivered a very respectable mid single-digit growth. Our U.K. sales were flat, as retail slowed and stores kept inventories lean, reflecting uncertainty in the economic environment. Russia had terrific growth at most retailers but continued to report lower net sales due to destocking at a major account. The relative strength of the Swiss franc is causing consumers to shop across the border, hurting sales in the local market, and Greece remains weak overall due to continued austerity and political turmoil. Early orders to mitigate potential SAP disruptions added $3 million to the region's sales in the quarter.","The Asia and Pacific region led the company's growth this quarter, as sales rose 18% in local currency. Growth was again driven by China which jumped 44%. New brands, doors and cities, as well as double-digit, light-door store sales growth fueled the momentum. We also saw strong sales increases in Hong Kong, Korea, Australia and Thailand. Japan declined low single digits. Early orders to mitigate potential SAP disruptions added $25 million or about 5 percentage points to the region's local currency sales this quarter.","Our gross margin improved 150 basis points to 79.9%. The increase was primarily driven by positive mix of 130 basis points, manufacturing variances of 20 basis points and currency of 10 basis points, partially offset by higher obsolescence charges of 20 basis points. These figures include the benefit of cost-savings initiatives of $29 million.","Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 100 basis points to 57.9%. The primary drivers were advertising, merchandising and sampling expenses, which increased 70 basis points to support the company's biggest innovations and impairment charges of 20 basis points. These figures reflect savings of $7 million from our cost-reduction programs. As a result, operating income rose 12% to $603.1 million and operating margin rose 50 basis points to 22% of sales. We realized total savings of $36 million in the quarter from our cost savings programs and still expect to save $115 million to $140 million for the full year. Net interest expense was slightly higher than last year at $17 million this quarter. ","In mid-January, we repaid $120 million in senior notes, with a 6% interest rate, with cash from operations. This is expected to save us around $7 million annually and was already reflected in our guidance for the year. In November, we settled a commercial dispute that was outside of our normal operations for $10.5 million, which is recorded in nonoperating income. This item, along with the $6.7 million in impairment charges, was not included in our guidance. Our effective tax rate was 32.5%. ","We reported $6.1 million, or $0.01 per share, in restructuring and other charges in the second quarter. For the full fiscal year, we expect to record charges of between $25 million and $40 million. For the 6 months, net cash flows from operating activities was $610 million compared to $508 million last year. We spent $182 million in CapEx, $522 million to repurchase approximately 11 million shares of our stock and paid our stockholders $204 million in dividends. Our days sales outstanding at December 31 were 45, up 3 days from last year due to timing of collections, while inventory days fell by 3 to 165 days.","As Fabrizio mentioned, we have built into our forecast continued slower market growth in certain Western European countries and a stronger dollar. However, our business overall is healthy, and our vitality is broad based, allowing us to mitigate weaknesses in one area with strengths in another. ","We run our business on a full-year basis, and for the year, we forecast local currency sales growth of 9% to 10%. The operating leverage from higher sales and cost savings are expected to be partially offset by planned increases in advertising and investments in new systems. This translates to an operating margin improvement of about 100 basis points for the year. The full year non-GAAP EPS is forecast between $2.16 and $2.23 per share, equal to growth of about $0.17 to $0.21 -- 17% to 21% rather, versus last year.","For the year, we continue to expect to generate more than $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations and invest about $400 million to $450 million for capital expenditures. We still estimate our effective tax rate will be between 31% and 33%.","We have a number of items that will cause some unusual comparisons in both sales and profits in our second half. First, the third quarter sales growth comparison is affected by the pull forward of $30 million in orders to the second quarter this year, ahead of the January launch of SAP. The prior year reflected an additional $42 million in sales ahead of an April launch of SAP. These 2 factors are expected to reduce third quarter sales growth by slightly more than 3 percentage points and EPS by $0.09.","Second, currency comparisons are expected to be more difficult in the second half. We are now assuming weighted average rates of 133 for the euro, 78 for the yen and 157 for the pound for the full fiscal year. The euro, in particular, is expected to weaken in the second half. ","Lastly, the cadence of our planned advertising spending this year is weighted to the third quarter, which should help maintain our sales momentum. We expect to increase our advertising spending in the third quarter by about $80 million or the equivalent of $0.14 per share.","Taking all of this into account, our third quarter sales growth is forecasted at 4% to 5% in local currency. Reported sales could be negatively impacted by about 1 to 2 percentage points due to the currency translation. We anticipate EPS for the third quarter to be between $0.28 and $0.32.","We are pleased with a strong first half of the year. Our adherence to strict productivity guidelines and carefully targeted reinvestment should enable us to deliver our financial objectives for fiscal 2012. And that concludes my comments, and we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Investment Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question pertains to the outlook and the guidance, I guess, for Europe, but in particular, for Asia and the pretty dramatic sequential slowdown you're expecting. And is it, I guess, expecting or guiding for? Is there anything that's fundamental to you that you see? Has there been a delay in your orders? Do you feel like there's any place where you're losing share? The numbers out of Sasa, I know with the Chinese New Year weren't great. But is there something specific to you that you're seeing that makes you so cautious? Or is it just an undue level of conservatism as you look to the next 2 quarters?","Fabrizio Freda","Wendy, no. I think that -- again, we will try to make available the very specific number of the reconciliation of the input of SMI changes. And so anyone who wants to call Dennis later to ask really every single detail, please do it. But let me summarize the outcome. That's not the way our business is coming in. After an outstanding first quarter in comp at plus 14%, after readjusting all the movements of stocks by quarter because of SMI, we have basically grown every quarter between 8% and 9% which is an outstanding number and fully in line with our original expectations. And we don't see any slowdown in that sense, we just expect movements the way we just explained. So internal markets, what we see very specifically is that we do see softness of the markets in Europe. So originally, we were expecting a beauty market that would grow in the year in the range of 4%. Now because of the European softening, we see a beauty market that will grow 2% or 3%. But our growth in this market is actually accelerating, and we are building market share. So the differential between the market and our growth actually remains the same. So that's why I'm saying it's basically 9% per quarter. This is the reality of what we see. The second thing we see is a stronger dollar. And because of the stronger dollar, we, obviously, lost some comparison in the second quarter. Net our stronger business results than expected are compensating for some softening in the base market and for the stronger dollar. But we don't see any weakness in our  business. Actually, we are building market share in the large majority of the strong markets of the world that counts. And namely, we are winning big in China which is our top priority. We are winning big in Travel Retail, which is our key profit driver. And we are building market share in Europe, but we have been -- our own growth is softer, but we are building some significant market share in strong markets like France and Italy that will be fundamental for our future. And then as you heard from Thia, our biggest market, North America, is in excellent shape.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just following up on that. China, specifically, I think you said the growth was 44%, which is a sequential acceleration, not only just from the first quarter but for all of next year last year. I mean, is there a point where law of large numbers is going to kick in, and we should think of China as a considerably slower-growth market? Or do you still think you're talking 20%, 25%, 30% type growth rates there for some time to come, albeit in a maybe slowing economy? But the fundamentals of the category, do they still remain that robust?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. We see China remaining very robust. I mean, it's a country that is probably having a GDP that will go from 10% to 8%, which we feel is still very robust. And our same-door growth in China was 14%. So we see this market to continue same-door probably in the high single digit or double digit. But because of the expansion of number of cities there, of new consumers that become more affluent that enter the category, and because importantly, of the continuous increase on traveling Chinese consumers, we see that China and Chinese consumers will continue to be a very strong growth driver of our market. Despite that, we are assuming that some points of softness in the same-door growth that China will deliver in the next 1 year or 2, that's what happened in the last couple of years. But this will not change in any way, the fact that China will be fast-growing and a very important part of our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on some of the launch activities. So I guess, first thing is in the press release, it sounded like there were some spending that even happened in the second quarter to support upcoming Q3 launches. Then you've, obviously, talked about the big investment in Q3 specifically. So could you just give us -- I know there's the European global -- the global skin care product, there's the Advanced Night Repair anniversary. But what are the type of -- some that are big ones we should be watching for? And are the timing of those kind of mid to end of the quarter? Or are they kind of a full quarter benefit?","Fabrizio Freda","So we will be launching products in every quarter. It's clear that the third quarter this year contains a couple of very important launches that were not present that equal this stance last year that's why we see a particular increase on advertising in the third quarter. And I mentioned in my prepared remark that the supreme cream of Lauder in Europe is, obviously, a very important one that makes a big difference, but also the Clinique launches in foundations and the Clinique newly created support for makeup, which is not going to pay out very well, is also another one. But to really correctly answer your question, I want to clarify that in every single quarter this fiscal year, we're spending more in advertising, merchandising and sampling than the previous year. It's just that this differential last year was pretty important in the fourth quarter, while this year, the biggest differential is in the third quarter. And this is because of calendarization of our launches. But every single quarter, we spend more in advertising this than last year.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great. Is the supreme cream launch -- is that also in the U.K.? And is there hope that, that helps  reaccelerate the business? Because I know, surely, macro concerns, but it was a pretty big deceleration sequentially in the U.K. So what's the thought there over the next year or so?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. Also in the U.K., we have very, very important launches. The supreme launch will be first in Continental Europe, and then we will decide how to expand it in other countries. But in the U.K., there are, a set of very, very promising launch in the next 6 months as well. So it's a strong, solid program. The U.K. market, by the way, is part of the markets where we are referring to when we say that we see softness in Europe, also, we see some softness in the U.K. market. But again, I'm trying to use the right words. We don't see any collapse in markets, we see softness. And to clarify the softness, we see the markets growing 1 or 2 points below what we originally expected because of the current consumer feelings and political turmoil, but not more than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Fabrizio, can you just give us some perspective. As you think about the next couple of years, is there a cap on the spending level? Are you targeting a certain percentage from the sampling, the advertising standpoint? Just trying to get a sense in terms of the incremental spend over the next couple of years and how you're looking at that.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. It is, obviously -- we have targets in terms of percentage of sales of what we'll believe will be reasonable for the advertising level. But I want to explain the dynamic -- or the way we are increasing advertising spending. If you look at our cost structure, you will see that every single cost line is going down with except of advertising, merchandising and sampling, which is going up. And then as you know, we are investing in SMI mini systems, and we are investing in some new capabilities in the area of R&D, digital and consumer size. But the real big investment are advertising and SMI. The -- all the rest, we are saving money. The second element to understand is that when we say that we reduced promotions, which we are actually doing, so that we can invest more money in advertising, you will see the impact of production -- of promotions, sorry, reductions in cost of goods. And so when you see gross margin continue to progress very well, this includes also a reduction of promotions. While on the contrary, the increase in advertising is all visible in the OpEx line. That's why the path of the gross margin improvement is in reality also allowing a advertising increase, because it's exactly how to switch from promotion to advertising that we are driving locally.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","My question is about your operating margins. If I adjust out the forward sales of $30 million and operating profits of $23 million, I'm backing out adjusted operating margins that are basically flat with the year ago at 21.5% or so. And I'm wondering why we're not getting margin expansion at such an important part of your story, and what I should expect on an adjusted basis for the second half?","Richard W. Kunes","Sure, Alice. If you -- and that's one of the reasons that we went through that sort of lengthy explanation of the sales shift. And I think that Dennis can certainly refresh you with those numbers, if you want to give him a call. But I mean -- and if you look at our fiscal year, we're growing our sales 9% to 10% in comparable currency. We have 150-basis point gross margin improvement, roughly 100 basis point improvement in operating margin, a 20% growth in EPS, $1.1 billion of cash flow. So we think those numbers, in total, they were actually a very solid year. We're not overly concerned about the third quarter operating margin. It's really due to the factors that Fabrizio's explaining from an...","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I'm talking about the second quarter. The one you just reported. If you take out the $30 million and $23 million  that were forward shipments and the profits on those, it looks like your operating margins were not up in the second quarter.","Richard W. Kunes","Again, in the first half of the year, I think our profitability increased by about 25%. So I don't think we want to get in too hung up on the quarter quite honestly, Alice. And you know that we've always treated our business on an annual basis, and this year, in particular, because a lot of these shifts. I don't think it really warrants any more explanation, honestly.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then my other question is about fragrances. I understand you're shrinking that business very intentionally. Should we assume it continues to be flattish? Or are your launches going to make it start growing in the second half?","Richard W. Kunes","Well -- and I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that the fragrance grew 11% in the quarter last year, and this year was slightly down. We continue to strategically think about our fragrance business with the long-term objective of eventually gaining market share and turning that business around to grow in a profitable way. And I think that some of the activities that you've seen that have happened have been focused on the reductions of promotions around the fragrance business, which has dropped our volumes somewhat, especially during the Christmas time. But we think it's -- the long term, it's a smart move to make and the right strategy for the category. And we should see some increase in -- due to launches and in some other activities in the second half of our year. We'll see some growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, on the fragrance piece. I just want to get a little clarity, I guess. I mean, is this a situation where it's kind of like 2 steps forward, 1 step back? I mean, there were some low-hanging several hanging fruit to capture in fragrance, and now you kind of have to retrench a little bit and make some more structural change before we see a better trajectory going forward? Or am I making too much of 1 quarter on a tough comp?","Fabrizio Freda","I think that you're making too much of 1 quarter. The simple thought is, again, look at the year. In the year, we'll make -- continue making some decent progress. I'll have -- also this year, by the way, is not finished. We are trying to make our fragrance mix more efficient, which again is also about making less of a promotional business and more of a business-driven by great fragrances and great equity and profitable. Obviously, the key to the holidays, meaning the November, December period is where the larger majority of the promotions are concentrated. So if we need to do these strategies, reaching for a promotion, you will see a bigger impact in our second quarter than in any other quarter. So please don't attach so much to the quarter movements in the business like ours, because we are trying to drive some fundamental strengthening of our business model. And this really doesn't happen month by month, but we have to look at this as a year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, is it possible to quantify what Russia did to sales and profits in the region, and whether you think that will come back in the next quarter or 2, or if it's a permanent reduction, or there's something wrong with the retail climate there? So a little more flavor on Russia. And then secondly, just on the fragrance. It does seem that the category grew very strongly in North America and Europe last year, sort of unexpected recovery. Do you want to play bigger? Do you need to play bigger behind some of the more mainstream brands? Are you reevaluating that strategy at all?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. The answer is yes to your -- let me start on your second question. Yes, the category has started growing again very nicely, and we want to continue playing in this category and making this category being profitable for us and growing nicely for us in the future. But the key point is that we want to play in this category more and more in the future profitably. And that's why we are focusing on new strategy on our Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique brand. And we will continue building our 80th brand on our key designer. And we have added 3 designers that we believe will be very strategic to our business. And particularly, we believe that Marni and Zegna will be very strategic in Europe and Asia and the addition Tory Burch, very strategic and continually revitalizing our North America business. So the combination of our existing designer plus the designer, the new strategies on Lauder and Clinique. And finally, I should add a very successful trend on our high-end, meaning Jo Malone and Tom Ford. The combination of these will definitely give more strength to our fragrance business in the future, and that's our firm intention. But profitably, not promotionaly, but even so, probably you will see us playing less aggressively in areas like big holiday season, big promotional moments and more aggressive in sustained fundamental growth. On Russia. Yes, Russia is -- our retail in Russia has been outstanding, in fact, in the quarter, so -- and the market has continued to grow very nicely. And the market share of our brands has been growing. So the Russia, in the quarter, is really specifically attributable to one big retailer deciding a destocking action. And we believe that this will be, over time, being -- going away.","Richard W. Kunes","And just 2 things to add to that. One is that you will see that we will grow our profits faster than our sales in the fragrance category, which is our object long term just as Fabrizio described. So you'll see that result this fiscal year. And Russia, in total, is a little over 1% of our company's business. So just wanted to make you aware of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Could you talk about the change or the reduction in turnover amongst U.S. sales? I forgot what you called them, the people who work in department stores. A few years ago, I remember that, that number might have been as high as 75%. So can you discuss how it's changed over time? And what's the sales and profit impact of that change is?","Thia Breen","Sure. And you remember correctly, it was in its upper 70s in terms of the turnover of our beauty advisor. So first of all, these department stores are our primary channel in North America, and we have High-Touch beauty advisors, makeup artists, Clinique consultants, which are key drivers of our growth. And we've seen 18 months of solid growth and -- which we believe will certainly continue. And department stores have been great supporters of our strategy in terms of High-Touch and in terms of beauty advisors. And moving more customers from mass into prestige. So when we talk about the High-Touch, we have -- we've invested in terms of point of sale and our overall imagery, and the consumers responded. And whether it\u2019s Clinique's Service As You Like It or the Est\u00e9e Lauder Foundation Finder, this consumer loves what she's seeing at the counter and it's -- and she's responding. And certainly, this turnover reduction has been very much by design. We have incorporated a much more -- with the North American affiliate, a much more consistent approach to interviewing. We've had much lower turnover as a result of that. And you're right, it's the lowest turnover that we have seen in a decade, which makes it more efficient for the field. They spend far less time trying to recruit and hire and develop the counter staff, if you will, and it's a much more pleasurable experience for our consumers as well, because they come back to the counter and see the same person. So this High-Touch and the reduction of turnover has been a key component to the kind of growth that we've seen in North America.","Operator","So our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton with Caris & Company.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can you just -- on the fragrance business, in terms of potential structural changes in the business. That business, part of it, for you, is a heavily licensed business as the whole industry is. Is there anything coming up in terms of license renewals or points at which you might renegotiate things that could stepwise change the profitability of the business?","Fabrizio Freda","No. These -- as I said, we just got 3 new license agreements, and those are very important. Those are all concluded, and we're already working on this project. That's the biggest change in our portfolio. Apart from these, our focus now is to make our existing designers become more and more successful -- is to build a great business for the new designers that entered our portfolio, and as I said, continue building aggressively on our high-end part of the portfolio, Jo Malone and Tom Ford, and revitalizing our cosmetic brands, Lauder and Clinique fragrance business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I would like you to expand a little bit of what's happening in Travel Retail. And if you can help us understand the sustainability of this implied increase in conversion rates that you are seeing since the June quarter. If I have my numbers correctly: Shipments grew 15%; lapping, 45%; and last year, you shipped 35%, when air passenger traffic was also up 5%, accelerating from the 10% we saw in the June quarter. So do you have enough visibility over consumer takeaway at Duty Free counters and of their level of product inventory? Or I am -- my concern's whether you may be overstating these conversion rates, and therefore creating a risk of product returns or inventory writeoff in the future.","Fabrizio Freda","No, I think we are in very good control. Travel Retail is one of our most clear, well-managed channels. And we are very well in control of our shipments, and we have very tight relationship and understanding of the stock level in our retailers. Our actual quarter results has been plus 15% in this channel after last year, plus 45%, I think, so on a very, very difficult comp, so an amazing result, if you look at the 2 years. And also, keep in mind that the traffic increase, which is the key benchmark was in the quarter about 5%, 6%. So we have been growing 3x traffic, which means we've been continuing converting people at the plus 15%, after a plus 45% last year. Also, as I explained in other times, in Travel Retail, we are building huge market share, because the increase of traffic in Travel Retail is mainly driven by Asian consumers, which are very keen of skin care and makeup. And in the Travel Retail channel, our market share in skin care makeup is definitely more significant than the one in fragrances. So basically, the market is growing in our direction. And that's why it's a combination of traffic growth, plus consumer conversion, plus market share growth that we see in our numbers. And obviously, if you look at the actual year-to-date in Travel Retail, our number is plus 24% and the estimate for the full year is still well above 20%. So it's a very solid channel and a solid channel growth, well ahead of increase in traffic.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just want to clarify something, Fabrizio, you talked about earlier. When you talked about some of that softness in the category, I think a couple of times, you said you were doing better. And so I guess, I was trying to figure out is that better, you're still -- meaning you're still gaining share, growing faster than the category? Is that better on an absolute basis sequentially? So could you clarify that comment for me?","Fabrizio Freda","Sure. I think that actually means both of your comments. Better -- we are raising our 8% to 10% forecast for our sales to 9% to 10%. So basically, we believe that our top line will be strong and lastly less risky than we considered in the previous call. So we are stronger believer. So the battery is better than what we believe before, in terms of risk in this case, because we are only taking up the bottom part of the guideline and better versus competition. Because we are growing market share in every one of these market and better in terms of GAAP versus market, meaning, before we were expected to grow in every quarter to know after reconciliations, 8% to 9% in a market that was growing 4%. And now we continue to grow 8% to 9% in a market that grows 2%. So better versus the market. So better versus the market, better versus competition and better -- slightly better at least in risk assessment versus our previous guideline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just in terms of the China commentary, can you elaborate on that? Is it really just sort of the GDP slowdown? I think the comment was mindful about conditions that could slow growth in China. So is anything beyond just the potential GDP slowdown?","Fabrizio Freda","No, I -- and again, we don't see any risk, big risks in consumption increases in China. I was thinking about slowdown -- it was slowdown and meaning sales in same doors or in markets, which within China are pretty well developed, like Shanghai, Beijing and some other big cities. And again, slowdown means that doors that we're growing at 12%, 15%, now are growing at 8%, 9%. So again, it's softening -- is the right word or slowdown, but it's nothing that is worrying. The point, as I already explained, is for us, even if there is few points of slowdowns in the overall consumption in same doors, the opportunity for growing distribution and to reach new consumers is so strong that we still believe that China, for us, will continue to be a strong contributor to growth. And by the way, we are speaking now the next year. But then in the long term, I want to clarify, this is even more true. I believe China and Chinese consumer, in general, will be, if you take a 3- to 5-years look will be, by far, the strongest drivers to growth in the category globally.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rainey Mancini. Please go ahead, sir.","Rainey Mancini","Good morning. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; Stephane de la Faverie, Global Brand President of Est\u00e9e Lauder; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges, the impacts of the recently enacted U.S. tax law, and other adjustments disclosed in our press release. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call.","And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you, Rainey, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal year 2018 was an outstanding year for our company. By focusing on strategic priorities and investing in our multiple engines of growth, we delivered double-digit sales and earnings per share gains in all four quarters. In constant currency full year sales rose 13% nearly twice the rate of global prestige beauty and diluted EPS increased 24%. This was the ninth consecutive year of records sales and one of our best performances in the last decade.","Coming off an excellent fourth quarter, we expect our strong growth to continue in fiscal year 2019. Our success last year was broad based with higher sales in every region and every major product category which is consistent with our long term growth strategy. What made our performance particularly strong were our over achievements in Asia and in Skin Care globally. We strengthened our hero franchises with new products, expanded in fast growing brand building channels and invested in the areas that touch younger consumers.","Our growth was all the more remarkable given the challenges we faced. Competition intensified from new brands and business models and those closures and weak traffic affected certain brick-and-mortar department stores in the U.S. and UK. On a macro level, Brexit and other tensions caused the greater political and economic volatility. Our results speak to the soundness of our strategy, the sustainability of our business, and the resilience of our organization.","Sales climbed globally in virtually all our brands. La Mer reached an exciting milestone. Its net sales topped $1 billion for the first time. We have now four brands in our portfolio whose net sales have crossed the billion dollar threshold and each grew globally. Est\u00e9e Lauder had a stellar year achieving record global sales and growing an outstanding 22% in constant currency, demonstrating its huge worldwide appeal.","Est\u00e9e Lauder generated strong growth in Skin Care and Makeup and across markets and consumer groups. Stephane will elaborate in a few minutes. Clinique's growth was driven by solid growth of Skin Care gains particularly moisturizers, its largest subcategory and its hero franchise Moisture Surge.","Clinique had strong gains in many emerging markets and in Asia where its hero franchises grew more than 30%. Clinique continued to diversify its distribution and TMall became its largest door in Asia. We are upbeat about Clinique's outlook. Its Skin Care nutrition program this year will be especially strong and leverages strengths of growing consumer interest.","M.A.C delivered global growth, which was supported by strategic investment in advertising to accelerate the brand in fast growing areas of Asia and travel retail. This winning strategy is similar to the approach we took with our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand several years ago which is paying huge dividends for the brands now.","M.A.C sales in China more than doubled and its first full year on TMall it was the top selling prestige makeup brand. Although M.A.C continued to struggle in North America, we actively began turning it around by expanding it further in specialty multi retail in the U.S. and Latin America strengthening its innovation program. We are optimistic about M.A.C's future expected to deliver stronger global growth in fiscal year 2019. ","Many of our small and midsized brands grew sharply and several are on track to become billion dollar brands within the next few years. We grew our recent acquisitions with successful new products and expanded distribution which attracted new consumers. We increased our focus on innovating in Skin Care, believing there will be a resurgence in the category. As consumer demand grew we were ready with products for different concerns and age groups and products with instant benefits which made the compelling visuals online.","Our effort resulted in Skin Care being our fastest-growing category fueled by La Mer, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, as well as Origins and GLAMGLOW. Maximum categories growth came from Asia Pacific and travel retail where we gained share. Many of our brands also grew in North America. La Mer creative digital content and authentic storytelling helped to build greater awareness which led to share gains in every region and China, importantly in markets where we can accurately measure more than half of La Mer consumers were new to the brand.","Est\u00e9e Lauder's strong sales boosted its global rankings to number one in prestige skin care and number two in total prestige beauty for calendar year 2017. Our makeup business remained healthy with Tom Ford and Est\u00e9e Lauder leading the growth along with M\u2022A\u2022C in Asia. Our newness brands Too Faced and BECCA expanded internationally, mostly in specialty multi retailers and Too Faced opened its first freestanding store which is located in London. With improving retail trends and greater presence in direct to consumer channels Too Faced grew 22% in fourth quarter and with strong innovation it is well positioned to post strong results globally in the year ahead.","Our luxury artisanal [ph] brands continue to drive our fragrance growth led by Jo Malone London and Tom Ford which introduced successful scents in open new doors. Jo Malone solidified its position in the UK, its home base where it gained share. Just last week Jo Malone launched on TMall and sales during the first few days have been very strong. Combined, our newest brands Le Labo, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, and By Kilian contributed already approximately one quarter of the total category growth.","We have a neater growth in Hair Care as we tapped into the natural wellness trend with its plant based product. Successful launches and hero franchises such as Invati played a key role. Our innovation was concentrated on fewer, bigger launches in the largest subcategories with a focus on supporting our best selling hero franchises. This strategy produced terrific results. Sales from our top 30 new skin care product and initiative rose more than 30% from the year before.","We continue to expand in the fastest growing prestige channels, travel retail, online and specialty multi. In travel retail, in calendar 2017 we gained share across all categories, became the top ranked beauty company in Asia Pacific airports and reinforced our global leadership position in Skin Care makeup. Our successful travel retail strategy benefited from higher global passage and traffic. Chinese travelers are important shoppers in the channel and their increasing travel helped in its growth across our portfolio.","Once again our online business strived, with our own brand side retailers, size and third party platform all growing that we have more than 430 million visits to our brand dot com sites this year and these sites have become more than just point of sales. They are also influential editorial [ph] platform and equity building vehicles. During the year we opened 200 new online doors globally and launched ecommerce inside new markets. We truly are a global enterprise and nearly three quarters of our markets generated gains.","As sales outside North America had expanded our international business has become one of our best growth engines, now accounting for nearly 70% of our sales. Emerging markets around the world have been a significant growth vehicle. Sales in our emerging markets jumped 24% and accounted for 15% of our total business. We intend to continue to invest in many of these markets in fiscal year 2019 laying the ground for our continued growth as the purchasing power of the middle classes continue to increase.","Our Asia-Pacific region generated the fasted growth led by an acceleration in China and the resurgence in Hong Kong. Our China business grew rapidly in every category, every channel and in virtually every brand. China net sales well exceeded $1 billion for the first time. The country's prestige beauty growth is benefiting from heightened interest from Gen Z a millennial consumer with considerable spending power and an appetite for high quality luxury products and we tapped into that opportunity. For example, more than 40% of Chinese consumers who were new to La Mer are in their 20s.","We had mixed results in Europe, Middle East, and Africa with strengths across developed markets like Italy as well as several emerging markets like Russia we gained share in Western Europe and in Eastern Europe, but sales fell in the Middle East where our results were also affected by our decision to adjust inventories of multiple brands. The UK market slowed as Brexit affected consumer confidence, which primarily impacted certain brick-and-mortar departmental freestanding stores.","We increased investment in new winning channels. Online was a bright spot driven by retailer.com. M\u2022A\u2022C was our first brand on Asus [ph], an online company that caters to younger consumers. It was followed by GLAMGLOW, Too Faced and others. Prestige beauty was buoyant in North America and in each major category we had brands that gained share in the U.S. La Mer in Skin Care, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Too Faced in Makeup and Jo Malone and Tom Ford in fragrances. We have been building our distribution towards faster growing channels and the scales started to tip in our favor. Our incremental sales in specialty multi and on our brand.com sites were greater than the decline we experienced in bricks-and-mortar department stores.","Our business trend in U.S. department stores overall showed improvement from the year before and our sales on their online sites are rising rapidly. However, total U.S. department stores sales declined mainly due to the liquidation of Bon Ton. Over the past two years we have successfully offset the loss of more than 150 million in annual net sales in North America from the closing of Bon Ton, Sears [ph] Canada and other department store doors. Despite these challenges we had growth in North America in fiscal year 2018.","Our Clinique brand was the most impacted by the loss of Bon Ton and those in our other department stores doors. Nonetheless, Clinique recouped a large portion of the business by staying in touch with consumer emigrating them to other Clinique doors. In total, Clinique North America retail sales increased by focusing on fast growing channels, product categories and new consumer segments.","Our strategic investment in advertising spending on all our brands helped get our products noticed. Now each brand has a digital presence and digital accounted for nearly two thirds of our ad spending, up sharply from about 50% the year before.","People are the heart of our company and we announced our benefits to be loyalty and attract the best talent. We expanded our benefits around adoption, child and elder care, an awarded a special bonus to employees who don't receive equity-based compensation to recognize their terrific contribution.","As we realign the company focus to strengthen our position in the areas that will lead future growth, we hired and developed talented employees with the skills needed in these new areas. We also began offering learning and training opportunity online through our LinkedIn Learning helping our employees build competencies in a variety of areas. We are proud that our commitment to our employees is being recognized. Our company was named the top rated workplace by the job site Indeed and recognized by Forbes as one of America\u2019s best employees for women.","Fiscal year 2018 gave us a lot to celebrate, but we are now focused on the future. To that end, we updated our 10-year compass which identifies industry and demographic trends. These insights confirmed the strategic focus areas where we have invested to build growth and where we plan to continue over the next few years including skin care, online, traveling consumers, digital marketing and omni-channel retail. We will continue to seek growth globally among a more diverse and growing middle class, especially in growth markets like China and in our U.S. home market.","We are the number one prestige beauty company in the U.S. which still remains the largest market and where we are focused on regaining share. We continue to build distribution in high growth channels and leverage better data and analytics to tailor our product assortment by retailer and by specific doors. This helps us address hyper local demand by having the right products on the right shelves with relevant messages. We forecast continued growth in our EMEA region with strengths in both Western Europe and emerging markets along with a return to growth in the Middle East.","Our innovation pipeline is powerful and focused on hero franchises elevated packet [ph] and new technologies deployed against key sub categories. We expect this without our growth become more balanced across our four product categories. Fast moving technology innovations continue to enhance the luxury beauty experience and we are advancing features like Augmented Reality and voice assisted shopping which are gaining favor among consumers. Behind the scenes, we are focusing on improving our capabilities in data and analytics. Using cutting edge tools and techniques we are connecting data and insights to measurable actions across our brands.","Now I want to update you on the review of certain testing related to product advertising claim support that we discussed in our last call. The review is ongoing and based on the review to date the company does not believe that this matter will be material. In addition, we are closely watching the evolving global issue concerning tariffs and trade including Europe and China important markets for us where we intend to remain focused on our long-term growth. We believe we will have some flexibility to address the potential impact of existing and proposed tariffs and remain committed to satisfying global consumers with our quality products.","Our strategy is solid has been validated by our updated compass and should allow us to continue to deliver strong topline and double-digit EPS growth over the next few years. Our growth will be supported by Leading Beauty Forward which is projected to deliver greater savings than originally planned. We will invest a portion of the savings in area driving the next stage of growth including digital advertising, social media, talent acquisition, technology and other capabilities. At the same time, we are driving efficiencies throughout the organization and leveraging growth enhancing our profitability. Tracey will give you an update in a few minutes.","Global prestige beauty is exciting, dynamic and fast growing with a proven successful strategy and brands and products that are coveted around the world we expect to continue to drive industry leading sales and gain share. I want to thank my leadership team and all the company global employees for truly remarkable results even in the midst of ongoing challenges. We look forward to delivering another year of strong top and bottom line results.","I am happy now to introduce Stephane de la Faverie, Global Brand President at Est\u00e9e Lauder, who will discuss our iconic brands, stellar year and the strategies that have kept it relevant to the new generation.","Stephane de la Faverie","Thank you Fabrizio and good morning everyone. I joined the Est\u00e9e Lauder Company over seven years ago and was honored to become the Global President of the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand two years ago. Today 72 years after its founding our flagship brand is not only the largest in the company but one of the fastest growing as well.","Est\u00e9e Lauder is stronger than ever and demonstrates that our authentic roots make the brand relevant for women of all ages, backgrounds, and ethnicities around the world. The brand strategy which is fully aligned with the company's 10-year compass has resulted in accelerating growth. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales increase culminating in growth at nearly 22% in constant currency for the full year.","The brand gained share in virtually every market around the world. The main element of our success our focused on hero products, digital marketing, and social engagement and fast growing channels. Our winning strategy is also concentrated on the turnaround of our home market, the U.S., and the acceleration of our business as we serve and delight emerging middle class Chinese consumers around the world. The first element of our strategy is our focus on hero products which has reinvigorated the brand, generated strong double-digit growth in both skin care and makeup globally.","Skin Care outpaced the growth of the overall brand for the year. The brand's largest franchise Advanced Night Repair has been growing high double-digit in virtually every market and channel. The July 2017 launch of Advanced Night Repair, Eye Matrix Concentrate has been a resounding success and helped solidify our leadership in the eye treatment subcategory. Everyone of our top-five skin care franchise is growing and addressing different consumer benefit and needs.","Makeup grew at about the same rate as the overall brand enabling Est\u00e9e Lauder to gain share globally largely driven by our Double Wear foundation franchise. The collection has been supported by newly activated communications around a wider range of size and form such as Cushion Compact to address the needs of consumers worldwide. Our success in the recruitment and retention of all consumer age groups is evidence that our strategy to modernize the brand has paid off. Today Est\u00e9e Lauder consumers are about one-third millennial, one-third Gen X and one-third ageless. This mix puts us in a strong position to continue to win in all prestige channel and in our key product categories around the world.","In addition, the brand global spokesmodel celebrates women of all ethnicity and ages to help the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand win in virtually all markets. Our newest face is a Anok Yai, a Gen Z who was born in Egypt of the Sudanese decent. She joins Millennial actress Yang Mi from China and our longstanding American model Carolyn Murphy to name a just few.","The second part of our strategy is our focus on being a truly digital first brand. About two-thirds of our global media spend is in digital and social helping us to reach new consumer on platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Weibo, WeChat and TalkTalk [ph]. We are partnering with major digital and social players worldwide to leverage improved consumer insights and data to enhance our storytelling to connect in a deeper way with consumers and build campaign with even stronger returns on investments.","In addition, we have activated the use of influencers. We have super influencers including our latest celebrity model Karlie Kloss and [indiscernible] our Digital Native Global Beauty Director. We utilize influencers in many markets and leverage our beauty adviser, who have been trained to become what we call Est\u00e9e micro-influencers. Taken together, the voice of the brand has been unleashed in a more authentic and powerful way. The strategy has helped us to better connect with younger consumer at the point of search and decision making which is done on social and digital platforms.","And third, we continue to evolve our distribution in fiscal 2018 over 50% of our business came from fast growing channel, which includes specialty-multi, online and travel retail. In specialty-multi our expansion into Ulta in the U.S. has allowed us to reach younger consumers, many of whom are new to the brand. Today half of our consumers are Ulta millennials. Our global online business grew 60% and represent more than 10% of our total sales and even more than 20% in the U.S. and China. Online is growing from our own brand.com sites, retailer.com and third party platform like Tmall which allows us to connect with new consumers every day particularly in smaller cities where we have less physical presence, which makes our consumer reach extremely efficient.","We are also experiencing a rapid acceleration in travel retail where our Tmall doing exceptional work to support the desirability and the equity of the brand by connecting with consumers throughout their journey, starting at home into the airport and at their final destinations. From a geographical standpoint, I am proud to say that net sales in every regions are growing, including a solid performance in North America for the year. In fiscal \u201918 the Estee Lauder brand passed 1 billion market retail for the first time in the U.S. and gained share in Makeup in 10 out of the last 12 months.","In the U.S. we\u2019re the number one prestige beauty brand in over 350 department stores and the number one brand on retailer.com nationally. In addition we continue to hold top ranks in skin care and age specialist and foundation sub categories. Thanks to our laser focused strategy on hero franchises, online acceleration and the rapid diversification of our distribution, we gained over 1 million new U.S. consumers who are younger, more diverse, and more affluent than the average existing consumer of the brand. We believe we have successfully turned around the U.S. business and are poised for continued growth going forward.","The Estee Lauder brand now generates 80% of its business outside of North America and we've been particularly successful in Asia Pacific. We continue to be the number one luxury beauty brand in the region led by exceptional performance in China. For the second consecutive year we were the only brand ranked as Genius by the L2 Research Firm which placed us as the top brand in Digital IQ. These performances are fueling our already strong brand equity and desirability with Chinese consumer around the world.","In addition we continue to serve Chinese consumer with a deep understanding of their needs and diversity by creating relevant products and communication uniquely designed for them. Estee Lauder is also outperforming in the U.K. growing 5% in the context of the flat prestige beauty market. Our Double Wear liquid formation is the top luxury beauty SKU in the market. We also have strong momentum in our markets in our Europe and Latin America region, thanks to a consistent global strategy.","Last but not least, as part of our Leading Beauty Forward initiatives, our teams around the world have been relentless in reallocating resources effectively to focus on consumer engagement activities while delivering increased profit margin to the company. We reduced certain selling costs by increasing productivity in profitable distribution channels, rationalizing non-profitable [indiscernible] and accelerating our distribution shift to less costly models.","Our promotion expense has also been significantly reduced as a percentage of net sales. As a result, we dramatically increased our advertising spend especially in digital and in addition we continue to price in line with inflation and further improve our gross margin.","In summary, thanks to a strategy aligned with the company, we believe our success is repeatable and sustainable. Our great progress in fiscal \u201918 was largely driven by same-store growth, no distribution expansion, as well as an increase in repeat repurchase from existing consumer, high new consumer acquisition, especially among younger ones and strong creativity and innovation.","All of it taken together makes the Estee Lauder brand a sustainable and profitable growth engine for the company and at the same time demonstrates that big brand can grow fast while building desirability and exclusivity around the world. I would like to personally thank my extraordinary boss Jane Hertzmark Hudis, my amazing team, and my colleagues around the world for their commitment to the iconic Estee Lauder brand and to our success.","And now I will turn the call over to Tracy.","Tracey Travis","Thank you, Stephane. And I believe many of the elements of the strategy you just articulated are already inspiring the plans of our other big brands. My commentary today excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges and adjustments including those related to our Leading Beauty Forward initiative and the new U.S. tax legislation.","All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency unless otherwise stated. Starting with the fourth quarter, net sales rose 12% to $3.23 billion compared to the prior year, all regions grew with the largest contribution coming from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Net sales in the region rose 16% led by a strong double-digit increase in global travel retail.","The momentum achieved in the travel retail channel reflects a 6% rise in international passenger traffic, share growth in all travel retail regions, as well as double-digit gains across virtually all of our brands. In addition to travel retail, the EMEA region also benefited from double-digit sales growth in Greece and India as well as solid growth in Italy, Russia and Benelux. This growth was partially offset by weaker results in other markets notably the Middle East, the U.K. and Germany.","Our business in the Asia-Pacific region rose 24%. Continued momentum in China and Hong Kong, both with strong double-digit growth largely drove these results, which was broad based across brands, product categories and channels. We also achieved solid sales growth in Japan, Australia and Thailand. Net sales in the Americas grew 2%, Latin America rose 8% led by double-digit increases in Mexico and Colombia which were partially offset by a sales decline in Brazil.","Sales in North America rose 2% as growth in Canada brand.com and specialty multi retailers were partially offset by continued softness in department stores including certain door and retailer closures as previously discussed. The continued rebound in Skin Care led product category growth this quarter. Skin Care sales grew an outstanding 26% with strong contributions to growth from innovation within key hero franchises such as Estee Lauder, the Estee Lauder brands Advanced Night Repair franchise, La Mer's The Moisturizing Cool Gel Cr\u00e8me and Clinique's dramatically different and Moisture Surge franchises. Origins and GLAMGLOW also contributed to the growth and all regions grew Skin Care sales.","Net sales in Makeup grew 2%. Many of our brands reported higher sales. Estee Lauder benefited from the continued success of Double Wear foundation, Tom Ford Lip and Eye products drove growth in Asia-Pacific and travel retail, Too Faced launched Super Coverage Concealer and extended shades and its Born This Way Foundation line and La Mer launched its Luminous Lifting Cushion Compact in Asia. These gains were partially offset by declines from M\u2022A\u2022C and Clinique. M\u2022A\u2022C's outstanding grow in Asia in travel retail was offset by continued weakness in the U.S. and U.K. in bricks-and-mortar as well as inventory rebalancing in the Middle East.","Sales of fragrances grew 9% led by the continued strength of our Luxury and Artisanal brands. Jo Malone\u2019s limited editions Blossom Girls collection was popular in Asia in travel retail and a variety of Tom Ford fragrances resonated across all regions. Le Labo continued its strong comp door growth and expanded its reach in the Middle East, Australia, Europe and travel retail.","Our Hair Care sales rose 6% primarily driven by Aveda's launch of Invati Advanced, the professional color line Full Spectrum Demi+, and the relaunch of Cherry Almond Shampoo and Conditioner. Bumble and bumble\u2019s expansion in specialty multi retailers also aided growth in the category. For the quarter, our gross margin improved 20 basis points compared to the prior year due primarily to favorable pricing and mix partially offset by higher obsolescence and the higher cost of some new products.","Operating expenses increased as a percent of sales by 110 basis points primarily reflecting the significant planned increase in advertising support behind digital activities partially offset by efficiencies in selling operations. As a result, operating income rose 3% and operating margin decreased by 90 basis points. Diluted EPS of $0.61 was 20% above the prior year and grew 11% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.05 of favorable currency translation.","Now let me cover a few highlights of our full-year results. Net sales grew 13% of which incremental sales from our most recent acquisitions contributed approximately 2 percentage points, our gross margin decreased 10 basis points as favorable manufacturing costs and foreign exchange transactions were more than offset by the full-year impact of the fiscal 2017 acquisition.","Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 80 basis points primarily due to greater efficiencies in our selling model. We strategically redeployed these savings into digital advertising, social media and influencer outreach. Our full-year operating margin rose 70 basis points to 16.6%. This margin included 40 basis points of favorable currency translation and 20 basis points of dilution from the fiscal 2017 acquisitions.","Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative and ongoing cost saving programs contributed more than $270 million in savings which helped offset the strategic investments we made to support future growth. The changes in our P&L reflect the accelerated restructuring of our cost structure to increase our flexibility to both reinvest in areas of profitable growth and to mitigate risk.","Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 22.3%, an improvement of 540 basis points over the prior year driven by excess tax benefits on share based compensation and the lower U.S. statutory rate. Net earnings grew 31% to $1.7 billion and diluted EPS rose 30% to $4.51. Earnings per share included $0.20 of favorable currency translation and at constant exchange rates grew 24% for the year. In fiscal 2018, we recorded approximately $193 million after-tax or $0.51 per share in restructuring and other charges for our Leading Beauty Forward initiatives.","We are making remarkable progress on the program and have identified additional opportunities with existing initiative as well as new ones. We plan to approve specific initiatives under Leading Beauty Forward through fiscal 2019 and complete them by the end of fiscal 2021. We now expect to incur charges of between $900 million and $950 million before taxes in aggregate over the life of the plan.","Through this plan, we've established more efficient and effective shared services and procurement organizations which are generating savings and allowing us to invest in critical areas of the business for future growth. We now expect the annual net benefit before taxes to range from $350 million to $450 million which represents an improvement in the cost benefit ratio. This will afford us greater flexibility to meet our profit objectives while also continuing to invest for sustainable growth and manage additional risk.","We also recorded three items related to the new U.S. tax legislation which we consider non-recurring. These charges the combined impact of which is $427 million or a $1.14 per share are provisional and are expected to be finalized within the one-year window allowed by the Tax Act.","Moving on to cash flows, cash generated from operations jumped an impressive 43% to $2.6 billion, reflecting our outstanding earnings growth, improvements in our working capital management, and the benefit of certain one-time items related to tax refunds. We utilized $629 million for capital improvement primarily for consumer facing counters and gondolas, retail stores and e-commerce support, as well as supply chain improvements and IT.","We\u2019ve returned cash to stockholders at an accelerated pace in fiscal 2018. We repurchased 6 million shares of our stock for $759 million representing a significant increase versus the prior year. We paid $546 million in dividends reflecting a 12% increase in our dividend rate, the ninth consecutive year of double-digit dividend growth. In total cash returned to shareholders rose 45% compared to last year.","Overall fiscal 2008 was an outstanding year for our company. Our sales growth of 13% far exceeded our long-term target of 6% to 8% annual growth in constant currency and was enabled by our improved insight in analytics on where to invest.","We delivered 50 basis points of organic operating margin growth in line with our objectives. Importantly, we did so well making strategic investments to build capabilities and support our brands for the long-term health and sustainability of our business. We delivered double-digit growth in earnings per share in line with our long-term targets. We saw 12 day improvement in inventory days to sell. We recruited new talent and invested in our existing employees to align our capabilities to future needs.","So looking ahead, Global Prestige Beauty growth have been exceptional in recent years and we do expect it to rise in the range of 5% to 6% annually over the next few years, barring a significant political or economic macro event. Our goal is to grow at least 1 point ahead of the industry with possibly 1 percentage point of that sales growth contribution coming from acquisitions over the next three years. Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative was launched two years ago is providing the fuel to innovate, accelerate changes to meet future demand, and engage effectively with consumers.","We continue to target average annual margin improvement of approximately 50 basis points and double-digit EPS growth over the next three years. Capital investments have historically averaged between 4% and 5% of sales annually. We do expect this level to increase to between 5% and 6% per year over the next three years as we invest more to increase the capabilities and capacity of our supply chain, enable enhanced consumer experiences with our new technology and invest in our facilities to optimize some of our work spaces.","We are dedicated to pursuing working capital improvement to free up cash particularly in inventory. Our progress in this area has been slower than expected. This was partially due to the complexity and shifting geographic mix of our business. Our strongest growth is coming from geographies further from our manufacturing facilities, increasing inventory and transit time. We now plan to reach approximately 165 inventory days to sell by the end of fiscal 2021.","Now let's take a look at our expectations for the fiscal 2019 full year and first quarter. We are implementing the new revenue recognition accounting standard beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year. We will adopt the new standard on a modified retrospective basis. There are cumulative adjustments to retained earnings. This method does not require us to restate prior year periods. However, throughout fiscal 2019 we will provide a bridge between the new standard and the old one.","The guidance we are providing today reflects the new standard, but we have also bridged to the comparable growth expectations we have for our business. The new rule will impact where we reflect certain costs in the P&L along with the timing of revenue recognition. As such, our sales and profit growth, as well as margins, will be affected. Additionally, our initial revenue deferrals based on this implementation will impact fiscal \u201919 results.","The main impacts are the costs for certain promotional goods such as samples and testers will be reclassified from advertising and promotion to cost of goods. Certain payments to customers such as the cost of in-store demonstration will be reclassified from selling, general and administrative expenses to a reduction in net sales, and the timing of our revenue recognition will be impacted primarily by customer loyalty programs and certain promotional goods provided to retail customers.","The overall effect on fiscal \u201919 is expected to be a reduction of net sales and increase in cost of goods and a reduction in operating expenses. This will negatively impact sales growth for the year by approximately 1 percentage point, decrease gross margins by 260 basis points, and decrease operating margins by approximately 30 basis points. Earnings per share growth is expected to be negatively impacted by 2 percentage points for the year due primarily to the change in timing of revenue recognition on some promotional programs.","The changes in the timing of revenue recognition for certain promotional goods will also cause variability in our quarterly sales this year. We anticipate that revenue deferrals in the first half of the year will begin to be recognized in revenue in the second half of the year. For the year net sales are forecasted to grow 7% to 8% in constant currency and excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standards at the high end of our long term goal.","Pricing and targeted expanded reach are expected to each contribute approximately 2 points to our growth and the strength of our existing business will account for the remainder. We expect growth to continue to be driven by Asia Pacific, the beginning of a turnaround in the Middle East and improvement in North America. All major product categories are expected to grow with the greatest contributions from Makeup and Skin Care our two largest categories.","Currently translation is expected to turn unfavorable in fiscal \u201919 as the dollar strengthens. Based on June 30 spot rates at 1.16 for the euro, 1.31 for the pound and 6.63 for Yuan we expect currency translation to negatively affect reported sales for the full fiscal year by about two percentage points. We expect to continue to achieve cost savings through indirect procurement, AMP [ph] effectiveness and selling costs within our ongoing programs and from Leading Beauty Forward, which are expected to increase to approximately $350 million this year.","Some of the savings will be reinvested in increased digital marketing and advertising to support strong growth as well as for the expansion of our smaller brands. Cost savings provide us with the fuel and the flexibility to both invest more in capabilities, advertising and brand expansion as well as deliver margin growth.","As we mentioned on our second quarter call, additional provisions of the U.S. Tax Act become effective for us in fiscal 2019. We now expect that the fiscal 2019 effective tax rate will be approximately 24% which includes the impact of a lower U.S. statutory rate as well as our current estimates related to the provisions from the Tax Act that go into effect this year.","The impact of the accounting for stock based compensation is not included in our estimates. Diluted EPS is expected to range from $4.62 to $4.71 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.20 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency and with comparable accounting we expect EPS to rise by 9% to 11%. In fiscal 2019 we expect cash flow from operations of approximately $2.4 billion, slightly lower than fiscal \u201918 due to the prior year one time benefits for tax refunds and the first installment of the toll tax.","Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $835 million or 5% to 6% of sales as discussed earlier. Our sales in the first quarter are expected to rise 9% to 10% in constant currency using comparable accounting for revenue recognition. Currency translation and the accounting change are each expected to negatively impact growth by 2 percentage points to 5% to 6% reported including both of these items.","We expect first quarter EPS of $1.18 to $1.21 including dilution of about $0.04 from currency translation. EPS growth in constant currency in comparable accounting is forecast to rise by 7% to 10% for the first quarter.","In closing, we are clearly pleased with our outstanding results in fiscal 2018 and are excited about the momentum behind our strategic initiatives. Global prestige beauty is a fast moving and competitive industry and the macro environment grows more volatile by the day. Our ability to adapt in this rapidly changing land landscape is a testament to our sound strategy and to our amazing people.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thanks good morning and a lot of great content in those remarks. I guess my question first is on the U.S., you called it out being positive in the fourth quarter, can you talk a little bit more about the dynamics that you're seeing between the department stores and then the growth in particular you've been seeing within specialty multi and online? And then Tracey, as you think about the guidance for fiscal \u201919, what are you assuming for the growth rate within the Americas? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","So on the U.S. we do see improvements, mainly coming from the strong retail.com of our department stores and we are encouraged also to see brick-and-mortar business in North America department store doing better than last year. However, in addition remember that we are facing the liquidation of 250 stores of Bon Ton that have significantly impacted our business.","For perspective, Bon Ton just in the fiscal year \u201918 was for a $68 million in net and as I said we had to face the closure of the equivalent of $150 million in net of department store doors in the past two years, so this has impacted, but despite that we have been offsetting this with the improvement in retail.com of department store and by the very good performance that we see in specialty multi and in our online sites.","So we are committing, we're really committed to continue collaborate with our department store and with our specialty multi-traffic to continue drive traffic. And also I want to say that we have and the Leading Beauty Forward, we have restructured our sales force and the new sales force has just been deployed early July and we have reduced the paper work and administration activity resulting in a 70% increase in consumer facing activity and product served and more tailored to each store starting this August. So we are pretty positive on what we're doing to turn around the business in the U.S.","Tracey Travis","And as it relates to the Americas for fiscal 2019, we're expecting low single digit growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good morning. So first off Tracey, can you give us the impact to earnings from FX if you use spot rates today, I\u2019m estimating another $0.08, $0.09 of earnings impact for the full-year, does that sound like it's in the ballpark and then hopefully that's just the clarification question, so hopefully that doesn't count as my question. ","The broader one Fabrizio, I wanted to get your thoughts on the potential for tariffs on the U.S. beauty industry in China, you mentioned specifically you've assumed some impact in your fiscal 2019 guidance, so I was hoping you could be more specific there, and are you basically sort of assuming an impact just from already announced plans or are you assuming there may be some factors that emerge that are transparent today either directly or indirectly on consumer spending whatever it may be that have an impact on your outlook for fiscal 2019? Thanks.","Tracey Travis","So on the currency, I'm not sure I picked up exactly on your question, but we expect a negative currency impact this year of $0.20 and obviously we experienced a positive currency impact in fiscal 2018.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. On the tariffs, so the tariff in China has not been yet implemented, it is only a proposal. So first of all it is not clear if the proposed tariffs will be implemented or not. But for information currently less than one-third of our products that we sell in China are currently originated in the U.S. On the other side, if tariff were applied we will be also impacted from imports of components from China into the U.S.","The other thing to consider is that we have 80% gross margins, so the impact on tariffs on this kind of industry will be less onerous than what happens on commodities. We believe we can mitigate the impact of tariffs if they had to happen through some flexibility within our guidance, our manufacturing footprint, our LBS programs. And we will do our best to manage tariffs if they happen without impacting pricing directly, because we will stay oriented to the long-term. We want to continue serve the Chinese consumer in the long-term, continue growing market share in China and we will stay focused on that.","I want also to clarify that we are already managing tariffs in Europe which actually is a bigger business which are fully reflected not only in our guidance and in our fourth quarter partially, in our fourth quarter, but definitely in our guidance for next year and we are managing these also doing our best not to do price increases because of tariffs or relative to tariffs. So that\u2019s our situation, but we continue to hope that tariffs will not be applied also because beauty is not a category of tension and represents benefits for all countries.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Christina Brathwaite","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Christina Brathwaite on for Andrea. Thanks for taking our question. So I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the reason the forward saving signs, can you just dive into what the drivers are there or you had some more incremental savings and should we expect that to sort of flowing through into Americas possibility we were surprised that trended negative this quarter. So any kind of color on when that can stabilize, that would be great? Thank you.","Tracey Travis","Yes, so let me answer both of those questions. And as it relates to the Americas just recognize that in the Americas segment we also have our corporate expenses. So bonus accruals for the corporation, we have some of it is our global production expenses related to some of our advertising programs flow through our Americas segment. So those are some of the drivers along with some incremental spending for programs to support some of our brands in the Americas.","As it relates to Leading Beauty Forward, some of the additional programs that we've added and we've spoken about them before, enabling our creative team to create more digital assets, so really transforming the processes and the technology in our creative areas in order to be able to create more digital assets, restructuring some of our field organization to actually create more support organizations for them so that they can spend more time out in stores coaching and selling with our beauty advisors and with our selling staff.","In our supply chain area, we're investing to increase the agility and speed of our supply chain, certainly managing all of the complexity that we see in our global network as well as the frequency with which innovation is happening in our portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein Research.","Ali Dibadj","Hey guys, I have a few questions just about your momentum and just to get a sense of whether that's going to continue and really like two dimensions, one is I want to get underneath what's happening between your strong top line guidance for next year and at least about your consensus EPS growth and I guess taxes, your tax rates changing and all that, but what is your like-for-like EBIT margin percentage going to change? There is a concern among investors that yes, you're growing, but you\u2019re buying your growth and factoring investments will have to continue to increase whether it would be on M\u2022A\u2022C or channel shifts and other stuff you shouldn\u2019t be doing.","It's just that your margin is going to be under pressure as you invest a lot more. So that is one part of momentum and the second one is if you have seen anything at all to temper the enthusiasm of the Chinese consumers globally obviously a big part of your top line and your margin mix across travel retail and Asia-Pacific. I mean we certainly have heard some companies voicing some very, very recent like past couple of weeks worry about the Chinese consumer getting little bit more concerned around trade wars and everything else impacting their businesses. So thanks for those on momentum.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, let me start just the overall on the first and Tracey will give you also her specifics. We are really committed to the 50 points of margin growth in the next years and what we see we will deliver, we will deliver these. There are impact on taxes, accounting, currencies, and we are managing through these and I hope you realize we are trying to put it on the table in the most transparent possible way, the assumptions that we are taking in managing that complex amounts or restatement.","But as far as the ongoing business the combination of Leading Beauty Forward programs together with the merging equities aspects or many of the new channels in markets in which we are expanding should guarantee us to continue increasing half a margin points and invest in growth at the same time.","To be clear, the promotional discounting as percentage of the sales is going dramatically down, so our investment is all about brand equity building and we have gone for a few brands that we have advertised with 30 brands in our portfolio advertised, so creating the power of long-term growth in the new kind of channels that we are addressing. So to be clear this wing of channels goes with this wing of support with the consumers and they go hand in hand and are providing us a stronger and you know growth than in the past and as I said, thanks to the other elemental margin the 50% margin. Tracy if want to add?","Tracey Travis","No, thank you. I think you answered it well. So if you, Ali think about fiscal \u201918 we actually delivered 70 basis points of organic margin expansion. So we did have positive currency benefit of 40 basis points, the acquisitions did suppress our margin by about 20 basis points, so when you look at all of those factors we delivered about 50 basis points organic operating margin in line with our objectives.","So to Fabrizio's point, on average our model suggests that we can comfortably deliver 50 basis points on average of operating margin expansion and continue to invest in all of our growth areas. That certainly is enabled by Leading Beauty Forward and some of the work that we're doing under that program over the next few years.","Fabrizio Freda","On China, today we do not see a sign of slowdown of Chinese consumer into sales out there, neither in China mainland nor in the traveling corridors that we are monitoring. So I have - we want to clarify that the assumptions in our guidance for the year assume a certain level of normalization of the growth of China and travel retail in the rest of the fiscal. But in terms of the power of the long term opportunity, I remain completely convince the China market has the potential of a double digit growth year-after-year because the fundamentals drivers are not changing. They are rising or the need the class, the love of luxury and beauty particularly.","The ability of the online execution in China to serve the 650 cities where we do not have physical distribution and the ability to have our physical distribution designed in the most productive way of the world with the super high productivity because only focus on high traffic areas and the rest is served by online, so that model is extremely powerful it has long term potential.","Now it may go to up and down depending on the overall economy trend in the U.S. or other potential impacting in the short term obviously yes and that's why we are assuming a certain normalization next fiscal year, but these remains one of the biggest long term opportunities in front of our company in my opinion.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie.","Caroline Levy","Good morning. Congrats on an amazing year. I would like to just get your assumptions for what's going to happen in the European department store environment in fiscal \u201919 and maybe even longer term it looks like the U.K is facing a bankruptcy today I don't even know if it's a chain that you're operating in but do you see it going the way of the U.S. and are you prepared for that in the way that you've done your projections and maybe just the last thing on how it might be different from what we've seen in the U.S. please?","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, first of all what is very different from what we have seen in the U.S. is the penetration of department stores in Europe. So if you mean U.K. I will talk to U.K. in a second, but in Western Europe of the penetration of department store is very, very limited. So, the amount of selling square meters per person are really completely different. So the impact in Europe even if there was the same worrying trend that we have seen the last years in the brick-and-mortar retail in the U.S. It will not have anywhere similar impact.","The other thing is that the - frankly the online penetration in Western Europe is individually lower than the one that is in the U.S. And so the ability of moving sales online in Western Europe for the moment has been inferior and because of that the brick-and-mortar is more solid and less exposed to sudden changes in this area.","As far as the U.K. is concerned there are some department stores which have been affected by crisis, how is a Fraser is the most significant one and we are monitoring - we are in House of Fraser for perspective in proportion to the U.S. is that the comparison you are making also Fraser is less than 10% of our U.K. business and is more in proportion is what Bon Ton was for the US but this for the moment we don't have signs to this retailer will close actually we have signed that would be restated and that some doors we've closed it will be rationalized for a business that could be even stronger after this rationalization.","But in the U.K. the same thing is happening, meaning sales are growing the luxury part, they are growing more in the online area, the online channels and so the mitigating factor we're doing so much earlier and better in online there that obviously this is compensated. The other part which is more specific to Estee Lauder, is that don't forget that in the U.K. we have Boots which is a significant percentage of our business and so our business in the U.K. is less concentrated in department stores.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Yes, can you hear me?","Tracey Travis","Yes.","Steve Powers","Okay, great. Hey, so first just to clean up on the guidance Tracey and then a longer term question. The first one is, you just - can you talk a little bit more about why the revenue recognition change has a $0.10 impact this year and is that something you'd get back in 2020 or is that more of a permanent step down a catch up from where you ended 2018? That\u2019s the clean up question.","And then thinking more I guess strategically for beauty, I was wondering if you could just expand more on what you see as opportunity in emerging markets outside of China, clearly in fiscal \u201919 you would contend with a significant amount of macroeconomic volatility, but even with that, I think your guidance implies opportunities for growth in that block of markets and as you think about your 10-year compass recognizing the importance of markets like the U.S. and Western Europe and China, I'm just curious as to your expectations for other emerging markets as a driver of growth for Estee Lauder? Thanks.","Tracey Travis","Okay, so as it relates to revenue recognition and the $0.10 of EPS impact, it is an accounting and reporting issue only. It is a shift in terms of when we can recognize revenue relative to our promotional programs, so it requires us to defer a portion of our revenue until certain promotional activities have occurred, which is different than how we were accounting for it in the past. So it is a shift forward and we would expect though being under this guidance next year will be comparable but it will also shift some revenue forward but at least fiscal \u201920 and fiscal \u201919 will be comparable.","Our commercial activities will not be impacted. There is no change to our shipping patterns or to actually the timing of promotional activities. Just and spend related to those activities will not change as well. It's just a recognition of revenue, so it is a shift.","Fabrizio Freda","And as far as emerging markets, we really believe that the emerging markets will continue to be a driver of growth. However, emerging markets are by definition more volatile and that's why we look at it as a portfolio where we have several emerging markets. We are building in each one of them at a different speed and with the flexibility of allocating resources every year to the one that represents the best opportunity not only of growth but also return on investments. So is portfolio markets where we use enormous amount of flexibility depending on the situation with the clear long term goals to have strong market share in each one of them in the medium term.","So today we have reached already 50% of business as we said before growing 24% we expect this to continue. In the next year what we have in mind is that we see continuous accelerating opportunity actually exciting I should say in India where we are growing all the way in Russia, in this moment is very strong. We see the opportunity next year to stabilize Middle East that has been a drag to our overall portfolio and we see the opportunity to restart growth in Brazil and obviously we are waiting to see the elections in October, November, but that could be a great opportunity. We expect to continue success in Mexico and other areas where we are doing really, really well and amplify the portfolio of new markets in Asia like the Philippines, Indonesia where we are seeing some amazing growth in this moment and great opportunities for the future.","But as I said, there will be every year one or two of these markets that would be an issue and one or two that will be in those areas a tremendous opportunities and you should see us as having the flexibility to direct our investment as needed year-after-year while we stay focused on the long-term.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Good morning, thanks. First, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on the investments that you\u2019re doing in M\u2022A\u2022C in North America and then talk about your profit expectations are for 2019 in the U.S.? But more broadly the U.S. has obviously been a struggle for some time and I know you're not interested in expanding into the largest online provider, but what is the line on the stand on incremental retail expansion beyond like the Ultas and the Sephora and such, I mean would you consider partnering with other retailers potentially specialty apparel other ones to sort of spur activity in your home market? Thank you.","Tracey Travis","So Olivia, I\u2019ll start. In terms of M\u2022A\u2022C, and as you're aware, we have expanded M\u2022A\u2022C and Ulta it\u2019s doing quite well. We will look for further expansion there. The brand is doing quite a bit as well in terms of their social media programs to improve the productivity per door of the business here in the U.S. and as it relates to specialty and whether or not we would partner with the specialty retailer, I mean certainly the M\u2022A\u2022C brand has done that in the U.K. with ASUS.","If there were one here that had the same type of characteristics that we look for in terms of a third-party presence for our brands on line, then we would consider that as well, but there is a tremendous amount going on with the M\u2022A\u2022C brand in terms of everything from in-store experience to driving their online business more and certainly other considerations.","Fabrizio Freda","And again, I want to add just innovation, so M\u2022A\u2022C is working on innovation in the U.S., it is working on improved digitalization in the U.S. and so it\u2019s not only distribution swing, it is not only an improvement distribution, it is an improvement in every single hospital the brand that we are working on and we believe we'll deliver results.","In terms of which retailers to do with frankly in this moment in the U.S. we've really focused on growing same door in the best possible way is a matter of as I said we have the new sales force with much more attention to consumer facing activities we can improve our activity in-stores on all fronts and we can support our current retail partners to deliver much more from our brands and continue the online expansion where we are doing fantastic in the U.S.","And the current model or brand.com or retail.com is working very well and leads the way of third-party platforms of high quality we definitely consider them and with that strategy the Lauder brand if you heard the presentation of Stephane, it is exactly the strategy the Lauder brand is following the U.S. and Stephane just explained what the great results the brand had, may be Stephane you want to clarify that again?","Stephane de la Faverie","Yes, absolutely Fabrizio, I think like in the U.S. like we mentioned in introduction, I think we've seen now a sustainable turnaround of the brand and actually we see our like-for-like growth in-store being actually super than our overall growth. So basically the half and the renovation that we put on the shift of distribution for accelerated like fast growing channel is actually proven that today there is a sustainable growth without necessarily needed today to increase distribution, but like Tracey said, if opportunity comes then we will explore them.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey good morning folks. Thank you for squeezing me in. I guess I want to followup on Olivia\u2019s question around the Americas profitability because maybe I missed it, I don\u2019t think you addressed that? The margins have clearly come under a lot of pressure. You mentioned that this year you have some of the corporate expense allocation there which was a headwind particularly in the fourth quarter, can you quantify that to give us underlying read for the business?","And then thinking on Forward, we've got growth in online, we've got growth in specialty multi. But it seems like that\u2019s going to be balanced or potentially more than offset by de-leveraging your freestanding stores or department stores, is there a path to margin recovery that will get you back in sort of historical high single digit range or is this sort of permanently rebased or even worse is there a glide path where it can continue to be pressured on the forward?","Tracey Travis","I will start, Jason. In terms of the North America team has done a terrific job in terms of recognizing the retail environment and the declining traffic as well as Fabrizio said the door closures that we've experienced in the U.S. with right sizing and resizing business in order to stabilize margin and then start to improve margins.","So in the fourth quarter, the bulk of the decline was related to corporate expenses and the North America business was relatively flat in terms of profit. In terms of what we expect going forward, we do expect as I said we do expect North America to deliver or the Americas to deliver low single digit growth. So we do expect North America as well to deliver low single digit growth.","And with some of the continuing work that they're doing as it relates to executing some of the Leading Beauty Forward initiatives and some of the other programs that they're working on to really improve door productivity in the remaining doors and certainly the top doors in the U.S., we do expect to start to see margin recovery in the Americas and in North America for sure.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes. And in terms of the balance of the distribution, the question there is, and I said it in my prepared remarks the scale is changing in our favor, so this being fiscal year 2018 has been the first year where the extra sales we built in fast growing channels were superior to the sales we lost in brick-and-mortar department stores and freestanding stores.","So that\u2019s the key thing that happened. So if you exclude the impact of the very big door closures from the year as I explained $164 million over two years, $68 million in fiscal year 2018, if you exclude this balance, these closures the scale is in our favour. I mean we have now the right platform of distribution to grow same doors in the correct way for the future.","So a lot will be about the power of our innovation, the power of our investment in media, the power of getting traction from the brand and then keep in mind the door closures also were pretty good in maintaining the consumption on our brands even when the door closed.","However, there is a transition period when door closed where this has to happen that can have a short term impact on sales that happened already in fiscal year 2018.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great, thanks, good morning.","Tracey Travis","Good morning.","Fabrizio Freda","Good morning.","Lauren Lieberman","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Clinique and some of the metrics you have given brands like Estee Lauder and M.A.C in terms of those brands performance in some of the stronger doors, so if you would look at Clinique I guess particularly in U.S. and closures exclude the departments that brick and mortar department store channel, are you seeing any sort of positive encouraging signs on Clinique and how it\u2019s resonating with different consumer demograph or cohorts in terms of age group, I know you mentioned what is your target any other franchises how they\u2019ve been doing? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, okay, Tracey indicates I should answer this one.","Tracey Travis","I won\u2019t, so I can answer I mean Clinique is doing incredibly well in Ulta it\u2019s doing very well online, so in the U.S. Clinique we are certainly starting to see as you indicated Lauren a pick up outside of the department store channel. The innovation this year and certainly heading into next year is quite strong. So we\u2019re quite excited about what we've seen thus far from Clinique, Moisture Surge they continue to innovate under that franchise, it's doing very well Dramatically Different which is their legacy franchise they introduced a new jelly product which is my daughter is particularly fond of, so that too is doing quite well and their fresh pressed franchise is also doing well.","So they've got a lot of great Skin Care heading innovation heading into next year and they've got some exciting new innovation that will let the brand downs and tell you about going forward and so we're very encouraged by the signs that we see from Clinique this year and again as Stephane indicated, we certainly have a track record for having a large brand resume growth in North America and in the U.S. even with the current environment.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes and I just want to add I'm really passionate by the work that Clinique is doing in this moment. I think you will see Clinique results in North America in the next year is getting better and better. The innovation as Tracey said is really promising in my opinion particularly the Skin Care innovation.","And I also want to remind that Clinique is the most affected of all our brands to disclosures. So the results of Clinique being able to grow retail in the last quarter in the North America in presence of Bon Ton since April basically not taking shipments and not working and in the closures of what happened in Sears in Canada in the previous period and in other doors closures. So Clinique has been offset all of these and stabilize or grow depending by category in a way that as soon as this negative will moderate we will see the power of Clinique acceleration.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula","Hi, good morning. Few questions on China. One of two first, of all Tracey give us context as to how large China is, I know it's growing very rapidly it is down nine, 10% of company sales and what did it grow in fiscal 2018? And then I have a followup. Thanks.","Tracey Travis","Okay, so you\u2019re spot on. China is about nine - little over 9% of our sales now with the results that we saw in terms of China growth. We don't comment on individual country growth but rest assured that China grew very very very strong double digit in fiscal \u201918 so great performance in China.","Steven Strycula","Okay and then a followup for Fabrizio. I just wanted to understand, it sounds like you're getting a lot of incremental consumers across China even with Tmall\u2019s presence. Can you give us a sense as to how Tmall\u2019s your ramp on that platform has impacted different tiers of cities like Tier 1, Tier 2 versus Tier 3 and Tier 4 and how at all has it impacted department store sales within greater China? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","Yes, the growth of China has been extraordinary like doors and so our department store in China have as we speak the strongest light door growth, they ever had in the 10 years. Tmall in that sense is not negatively impacting the department store growth. The reason for that is that as you indicated we are in about 118 cities with our physical distribution in China today across all our brands.","Obviously 118 is the number of Lauder that other brands match less so when you go to brands like M.A.C. and others we are still in I think around 50 or whatever 60 cities, so there is enormous amount of physical distribution opportunity within the top 100, let\u2019s say 120, 150 cities of China. But the Tmall reached 650 cities and from the data we see the large majority of our sales in this area came from the cities where we do not have physical distribution.","And that\u2019s is a very efficient model because the physical distribution in the 118 cities is very efficient because the productivity per door is high and growing and that the new consumers in the city where physical distribution is not yet there or where the level of productivity will not justify physical distribution for the time being can access the brands via Tmall or via brand.com. This model is working and creates this increase of consumer in a very efficient way and also with reasonable capital cost.","Operator","Our final question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Thank you. Stephane just wanted to touch on this, as you think about the Estee Lauder brand and the improvement that it has made, how do you think about the distribution channels for this business, what should it ultimately be and how do you see the margin opportunities? Thank You.","Stephane de la Faverie","Thank you for your question. I think what I was trying to highlight in the presentation that we are is, we've been able to have this amazing growth without increasing distribution. We have some shift of distribution in some areas of the world as we really believe that today our really growth is coming from on one side strengthening our position in the existing distribution, especially focusing on all our flagship doors around the world, but at the same time making sure that we sell the consumer in the fast growing channel like specialty multi online and travel retail.","And we really believe that this new distribution that is growing faster than the average is really helping us today to increase the desirability and the equity of the brand overall in the world. So, today the opportunity is in front of us.","The Estee Lauder brand is basically like building on all these opportunities and really believe again that makes the model a very sustainable and profitable model actually for the company going forward and the most exciting thing is showed a path for all big brands actually to be able to just like apply the same strategy and to grow like that globally.","Fabrizio Freda","And I just wanted to underline that being able to grow 22% without increase of distribution since our profitability is a lot influenced by same-door sales this obviously speaks highly for the ability of the Lauder brands to continue improving profitability.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcasted.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Fabrizio and Tracey will review our third quarter results and full-year outlook and then discuss the new initiative we announced this morning called Leading Beauty Forward.","Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, our nine-month and full-year comparisons have been adjusted for the impact of the prior-year implementation of our Strategic Modernization Initiative, and the discussion of our financial results and expectations are before restructuring and other charges. You can find the reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website.","During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Fabrizio.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we delivered solid performance with strong gains, particularly from our makeup category and international business. In constant currency, sales grew 6% and earnings per share rose 5%, before charges, to $0.76. Based on our results to-date, we are on track to achieve our sales and earnings guidance for the full fiscal year, excluding charges.","We continue to benefit from a highly diversified business with multiple engines of growth and the flexibility to move investment quickly to support areas that provide the best returns. We continued to fuel makeup, a vibrant category, where we have achieved constant currency double-digit gains every quarter this fiscal year.","Social media is helping to drive makeup sales with how-to-do videos, tips from consumers that influence us, and beautiful visuals of makeup transformations. Our company has thousands of talented makeup artists, who are a competitive advantage for our brands and help drive consumption through personal lessons in-store as well as online, where they can demonstrate the artistry to a broader audience.","M\u2022A\u2022C Instagram, for example, features photos submitted by its global artists, illustrating their creativity and talents tied to products and trends. This kind of social media interaction creates an ongoing dialog between the brand and its consumers and helped drive sales.","We are the largest company in global prestige makeup, and all our makeup brands grew this quarter. Each of our three diverse makeup-focused brands has a distinct character and channel profile. For example, one-third of M\u2022A\u2022C sales came from its free-standing stores. A majority of Bobbi Brown sales came from global department stores, and Smashbox has a strong presence in specialty-multi retailers. And there is further opportunity for growth across all prestige channels.","In addition to its popular fragrance collections, our Tom Ford brand has a fast-growing and much-desired makeup business. Sales of Tom Ford luxury makeup products rose more than 50%.","Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique also achieved global growth in their makeup portfolios. Est\u00e9e Lauder delivered good momentum in the European region as its Double Wear foundation continued to be a strong seller. In North America, the brand launched the Est\u00e9e Edit exclusively in Sephora stores and on Sephora.com. The Millennial-targeted line generated terrific media attention and there is a full cadence of strong promotional activities planned throughout the fourth quarter.","At Clinique, the brand extended its successful Pop Lip colour collection with new formulas and attracted young consumers with a digital campaign that included interactive music videos with a rising Swedish pop star.","Growth in fragrance continued to come from our luxury scents. Jo Malone and Tom Ford had terrific results. Both brands generated double-digit growth in every region. The success of these brands supports our strategy to position our fragrance portfolio towards the profitable higher-end tier, an area where we are gaining share. Our artisanal luxury fragrance brands, Le Labo and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, contributed higher sales, as did the AERIN collection of fragrances.","Recently we acquired By Kilian, a sophisticated Paris-based brand that we believe further strengthens our leadership in fast-growing luxury fragrances.","Turning to our geographies, our international business was stellar, and virtually every market grew. During the quarter, I visited several countries to gauge consumer sentiment and visit stores. One trip was in the UK, which had robust sales in the quarter, far exceeding prestige beauty growth. While there, I spent time in Birmingham and saw how our brand successfully tailored their product to the city's diverse multicultural population. Consumers in the UK have a great passion for beauty and our brands have responded in ways that appeal to a wide range of demographics, which has helped to re-enforce our leadership position in this market.","The European region remained robust with growth in nearly every country and particularly strength in Italy, where all brands contributed with double-digit increase. The tragic attacks in Paris, Turkey and Brussels understandably dampened some tourist activities in the quarter. But, I'm proud of the tremendous strength and resilience our organization in this country showed during these very difficult times.","Although, fewer tourists contributed to a falloff in retail sales in French airports following the Paris attack, our total net sales in travel retail for the quarter were strong, enjoying the results of our diversification strategy by region, category, brand, and type of airport. And retail sales in the channel were solid and broad-based. They rose double-digits in-house of the top 30 travel retail markets in the world.","Currency fluctuations continued to affect travel patterns in our travel business. We continued to see stronger growth in some markets where the currency was weakened, including Japan, Australia or Canada, due to a greater number of inbound tourists. Weak currencies in Brazil and Russia led to a decline in travel by those populations and affected sales in the travel corridors that they frequent. However, local market sales in these two countries grew double-digits as more consumers purchased products close to their homes.","I just returned from Korea a few days ago and was amazed by the energy and excitement there that beauty produces. Since the fear of MERS has abated, tourists are returning, especially the Chinese. Our business in Korea has turned around very nicely from a year ago, up double-digits this quarter, and I was very pleased to see that we are gaining share.","Demand for makeup is accelerating strongly and our brands are successfully competing head-to-head with Korean brands. Four of our brands introduced cushion compacts, which are extremely popular with Korean consumers. Bobbi Brown's cushion compact did so well, it became 15% of its Korea business and contributed to the brand's foundation sales doubling in the country.","During my visit, I partners at Dr. Jart+, an impressive brand that is seeing strong demand, and gleans insights into consumer desires and opportunities for growth. As I visited the stores in Seoul, I couldn't help but notice that sales of artisanal luxury fragrances are booming, including our own Jo Malone brand. I'm excited about the opportunity this trend holds for the newer fragrance brands in our portfolio.","We recently launched GLAMGLOW in Korea, and avid consumers are actively using social media to talk about the brand and post photos. Korea is a center of innovation for beauty, and there are many new trends and ideas that our brands can leverage and bring to consumers in other areas of the world.","Looking now at our emerging markets, our China business was healthy as most brands grew solidly and retail sales gained momentum. The online channel had the fastest growth and accounted for nearly 10% of sales. Sales in makeup and fragrance continued to accelerate, creating greater diversification in our Chinese business. As an example, Jo Malone business more than doubled, with strong momentum in both department stores and freestanding stores.","Our other emerging markets continued to generate excellent growth, rising 20%. Among the best performance were South Africa or Brazil. M\u2022A\u2022C continues to be a trail-blazer in sub-Saharan Africa as introduced prestige beauty products and personalized services. It has entered many countries in this area, most recently Zambia.","To fuel our company's global momentum, we continued investing in fast-growing channels. We opened new freestanding stores and launched several E&M commerce sites for our brands, mostly with retailers. GLAMGLOW, for example, began selling its products on Nordstrom's website.","We also increased our presence in specialty-multi. In the U.S., Clinique continued expanding in Ulta, Est\u00e9e Lauder launched its Est\u00e9e Edit product line in Sephora, and several brands added more locations in Bluemercury. Isetan opened a new specialty-multi store concept in Shanghai, and several of our brands are present.","Our creativity and innovation were central to accomplishments in the quarter. Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask was well received, particularly in Asia, and boosted the brand's important Advanced Night Repair franchise.","Clinique Pep-Start Eye Cream, which brightens and primes the eye area for makeup, debuted exclusively in Sephora in the United States and was the number one eye cream there in February and March.","Beyond products, our brand continued to forge creative collaborations. M\u2022A\u2022C is designing a makeup collection inspired by the singer Selena. And Est\u00e9e Lauder is teaming up with fashion designer Victoria Beckham for a full cosmetic collection. This collaboration brings great vast to our brand, especially on social media, and we expect them to draw new consumers.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey to give more details on the quarter.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will briefly review our fiscal 2016 third quarter results and then I will cover our expectations for the full-year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges.","Net sales for the third quarter were $2.66 billion, up 6% in constant currency compared to the prior-year. Our newest brand acquisitions contributed approximately 10 basis points of this sales growth. As Fabrizio mentioned, our international business remained quite strong as nearly all of our international markets grew this quarter, led by the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.","Net sales in EMEA rose 11% in constant currency with double-digit growth in most developed and emerging markets. The region continues to benefit, in part from the weak euro, making it a more attractive tourist destination, as well as from the benefits of strong execution of its strategic initiatives.","The UK, Nordic and Italy were the largest contributors to growth among the developed markets in the region, and the Middle East, Russia, South Africa and Central Europe led double-digit gains in emerging markets in the region. Our online business was particularly strong across all EMEA markets this quarter.","Our net sales and the global travel retail channel rose 9%, reflecting strong retail trends in most countries in Europe and Asia, which were partially offset by continued net sales declines in Hong Kong, Brazil and the United States. Overall passenger traffic growth in travel retail across all regions remained solid, despite shifts in consumption patterns between countries due to currency.","Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 5% in constant currency. Every market in the region grew except Hong Kong, which was down double-digits. Korea was the largest contributor to net sales growth, rising 14% in the quarter, followed closely by Japan, Australia and Taiwan. China rose 5%, led by 70% growth in E&M commerce sales.","Online sales across all APAC markets rose sharply this quarter. Our net sales in Hong Kong declined more than we had anticipated as tourists from the Chinese mainland continued to decrease. Excluding Hong Kong, the region sales would have grown nearly 9%.","Net sales in the Americas increased 2% in constant currency. Brazil, Mexico and Canada all saw strong double-digit growth. As currencies in these countries continue to weaken against the dollar, local market consumption remained strong.","Sales in the U.S. rose low single-digits. Continued strength in our online business, specialty-multi and high-end department store channels were largely offset by sharp declines in tourist-driven retail doors and continued softness in traffic in the brick-and-mortar business of mid-tier department stores.","Once again, makeup sales led product category growth, rising 11% in constant currency. Double-digit growth from M\u2022A\u2022C, Smashbox and Tom Ford led the increase, while particular strength in the lip and foundation categories drove makeup growth at Bobbi Brown, Clinique and Est\u00e9e Lauder this quarter.","Sales of fragrance products rose 7% in constant currency. Double-digit gains from our luxury portfolio, Jo Malone, Tom Ford and Le Labo contributed the majority of the growth. The Michael Kors Gold collection and Tory Burch stood out among the designer fragrances. This strength at the high-end of the fragrance category was partially offset by lower fragrance sales from Est\u00e9e Lauder and the remaining designer fragrances.","Hair care sales increased 3% in constant currency. Aveda benefited from initial shipments of its new Invati for men products as well as higher sales of more recent launches and existing products. The brand opened new doors in travel retail and added salons and freestanding stores in Europe. Bumble and bumble experienced solid growth in all channels.","Skin care sales were flat in constant currency, reflecting the continued weakness in Hong Kong and the ongoing shift in increased consumer spending from skin care to makeup. Additionally, Est\u00e9e Lauder's skin care business declined slightly in the quarter due to tough comparisons with prior-year launches in the U.S. and in Asia. There were many bright spots in our portfolio for skin care. La Mer and Origins grew skin care double-digits, as did skin care lines of our M\u2022A\u2022C and Bobbi Brown makeup brands.","Our gross margin increased 50 basis points to 81% of sales. The improvement came primarily from supply chain savings and lower promotional expenses, partially offset by channel and category mix. Operating expenses as a percent of sales increased 110 basis points to 66% compared to the prior-year quarter.","Selling and store operations costs to support our retail store growth, as well as general and administrative costs primarily from employee-related costs, consulting fees and our prior acquisitions, drove most of the increases. These were partially offset by our value creation from our Strategic Modernization Initiative and a deferral of some advertising and promotional expenses to the fourth quarter to support higher expected sales growth in that quarter.","As a result, operating income decreased less than 1% to $399.2 million, and operating margin fell 60 basis points to 15%, due entirely to foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 3%.","Net earnings also decreased approximately 1% below the prior-year quarter to $274.9 million. Diluted EPS of $0.73 was 2% above the prior-year, reflecting the benefit of a lower share count. Our stronger-than-expected EPS was largely driven by a combination of continued expense management and a delay in some advertising and promotional spending for Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique to the fourth quarter. Earnings per share for the quarter include $0.02 of dilution from acquisitions and $0.03 of unfavorable currency translation. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased 5%.","Let me now turn to our outlook for the full fiscal year. The sales shift related to last year's SMI rollout will impact full-year comparisons to the prior-year. I will discuss our expectations adjusting for the impact of the shift, as always.","Our forecasted growth rates, both before and after the shift impact, are available in today's earnings release. Also excluded is the impact of restructuring and other charges.","For the full-year, we expect sales to continue or to grow 7% to 8% in constant currency, including 50 basis points from acquisitions. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact our full-year sales growth by approximately five percentage points. Our estimate assumes spot exchange rates as of the end of April of $1.14 for the euro, $1.44 for the pound, and $1.09 for the yen for the remainder of the fiscal year.","Diluted EPS is now expected to range between $3.09 and $3.14, or $0.02 more than our last guidance range, reflecting a slight moderation in the currency impact. Adverse currency translation is now projected to affect EPS by about $0.27. Excluding the currency impact, we continue to expect EPS growth of 10% to 12%. Our EPS range includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from acquisitions.","Our strong performance to-date gives us the confidence to invest more in the fourth quarter to support additional advertising and promotion, primarily for Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique. While we continue to pursue value creation from our SMI program, which is now expected to deliver $175 million of cost savings this year, we also look for ways to further improve our cost leverage in the future.","Fabrizio will now discuss the initiative we announced in our press release today.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Tracey. The multi-faceted initiatives that we call Leading Beauty Forward is designed to provide additional fuel for long-term growth and profitability. It will build on our strong foundation and leverage capabilities we have developed in important areas, driving our business, including digital, retail and creative.","Leading Beauty Forward will support the continuing success of our strategy in an increasingly fast-paced, complex and competitive prestige beauty environment. It is designed to sustain our momentum by reducing costs and freeing up more resources to invest in brands, capability and most profitable opportunities, while better leveraging our growth.","As we look toward the future, we believe the best way to capture the growth opportunity of tomorrow is being proactive today. This initiative is a carefully-measured next step in our long-term strategy that will allow us to continue to lead in the prestige beauty industry. We expect Leading Beauty Forward to sustain our sales, operating margin and earnings per share growth beyond the goals we have set throughout fiscal year 2018.","Clearly, how we do business today and how we must be prepared to do business in the future is very different from what it was just seven years ago when we launched our current strategy. The fast-moving landscape requires a mindset and a way of operating that increases speed and flexibility, is creative, streamlined, cost-efficient and designed to serve global consumers in new ways.","To that end, as part of Leading Beauty Forward, we plan to redesign select areas of our go-to-market organizations in the regions, affiliates and brands to increase agility and strengthen their capabilities.","As more of our consumer engagement moves to digital platforms, the markets will need the tools and authority to respond quickly to opportunities and bring our expertise in local relevance closer to consumer. Stronger skills in innovation, digital, social media and creative capabilities will allow them to differentiate our unique brands even further by tailoring products and services to specific consumer segments and channels.","We also will redesign select corporate functions to increase their efficiencies by making them leaner, scalable and less costly, while continue to deliver excellent services to our brand and businesses. We are evaluating the creation of a global and regional shared services among certain functions to simplify processes and focus on more strategic activities.","We also plan to continue to optimize some of our supply chain operation to create a more efficient structure. These actions are expected to reduce our operating expenses, freeing up resources to invest in our brands, channel, consumer-facing activities and potential acquisitions.","An important goal of Leading Beauty Forward is to support and grow our brands. To accomplish this, we will invest in activities that will resonate with consumers, including innovation to develop new product and services, unique point of sales assets, effective social media dialogs and compelling advertising. We will also support our newly-acquired brands to expand their presence and products and continue to build our small-size and medium-size brands, so they become leaders in the industry.","As employees focus more fully on being creative and strategic, we will enhance our learning and development programs, so they have the best skills to lead in critical areas. The redesign will regrettably include reducing position in some areas. We also expect to add talent in the departments we plan to strengthen and to retain all other employees.","In total, we estimate at this time a global net reduction of approximately 900 positions to 1,200 positions, which is about 2.5% of our current workforce. As the company continues to grow and invest in new positions in the future, the improved process from these initiative are expected also to better leverage future productivity.","We are launching Leading Beauty Forward from a position of exceptional strength. Since we began our new strategic cycle, our sales have increased by more than 50% and our growth rate has outpaced that of global prestige beauty.","Key to this performance is the much more diversified and balanced business we have created with growth engines across our brands, categories, channels and geographies. With insights from our 10-year compass, we anticipated many of the trends influencing the industry's rise.","We also modernized our processes and technology infrastructure. Our Strategic Modernization Initiative has been deployed through most of our organization, creating greater visibility to information that let us manage our business in a more cost-efficient manner. We developed a wider spectrum of capabilities, strengthening our talents in areas such as R&D, supply chain, information technology, retail, digital and consumer insights. Leading Beauty Forward is designed to build on these achievements, to further increase our efficiency and effectiveness.","Global prestige beauty is thriving. Growing industry with new channels, emerging geographies and the influence of younger consumers. With the convenience of the Internet, the expansion of specialty-multi retailers dedicated to beauty, particularly in the U.S., how consumers shop is changing rapidly and competition has intensified.","Lower barrier-to-entry resulted in more than 250 new niche brands launching around the world last year. And the sheer number of beauty products vying for consumers' attention is vastly increasing. The design of our new structure should generate greater productivity through better cost leverage of our sales growth.","Importantly, Leading Beauty Forward will recreate ongoing savings and reinvestment to help continue our momentum in this fast-growing and more competitive market, which should mean greater sustainability and less risk in meeting our future growth targets.","As the global leader in prestige beauty, we are poised to take advantage of opportunities that lie ahead by taking charge and leading change. Leading Beauty Forward further positions our company to continue winning in this rapidly-changing arena, where the ability to anticipate developments and react cheaply and nimbly is more essential than ever. We expect to sustain our strong growth and lead not only our company but all of the prestige beauty forward to greater heights. Tracey?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you. So, as Fabrizio just discussed, Leading Beauty Forward is a multi-year initiative designed to help us fuel our growth momentum and create a more efficient cost structure to sustain our margin progression beyond fiscal 2018.","During the course of the initiative, over the next few years, we expect to take charges of approximately $600 million to $700 million. We expect to begin realizing initial benefits from the program in fiscal 2018, but will continue to maintain our flexibility to invest in opportunities and mitigate risk.","At this time, we do not expect this to affect the long-range guidance we provided last summer other than the related restructuring charges. Once fully implemented, we expect to generate annualized net benefits of $200 million to $300 million, currently anticipated to be fully realized after fiscal 2019.","We expect to reinvest a portion of those savings behind the capabilities we need, that Fabrizio just discussed, to continue to succeed in the rapidly-changing global prestige beauty environment. We will, as we usually do, update our three-year strategic outlook and share our goals in August. The update will include the impact of this initiative, any adjustments to our strategy since last year, the addition of recently acquired brands and changes in currency rate assumptions.","We are pleased with our results so far this year and we believe Leading Beauty Forward will play an important role in supporting our continued sustained growth momentum for the long-term.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Our first question today comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, Fabrizio, I had a question on innovation. If you are to characterize the pipeline going back five years, three years, and then today, how would you explain it to us?","And I'm really coming at this from a point of it takes time usually for the pipeline to get filled versus the product actually hitting the marketplace. So, I just wanted to get some context on how you feel about the pipeline today versus maybe five years ago.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I feel very strong. I think our pipeline versus five years ago, I would say, is almost doubled in terms of the power of extra business. We have a very clear internal process where we look for sufficiency of our innovation pipeline versus our next three years, five years goals. And I can tell you, we consider our innovation pipeline more than sufficient.","Now the characteristic of the pipeline has changed in some way also. First of all, today the pipeline is much richer in makeup because as you heard, the makeup category is in this moment a fast-growing in the world and also very fast changing. So, there is some outstanding innovation pipeline in makeup, and the makeup pipelines tends to be done by many smaller products versus few very big products, which is more typical of the skin care pipeline. So, that's a change and we have adjusted to that change.","Our skin care pipeline is strong; but again, within skin care, the pipeline is more focused on what we call instant benefit skin care versus the long-term anti-aging, and that's changed. And third, but probably very, very important, our pipeline in the fragrance business is changed. It is done by much more high-end luxury artisanal fragrances which will allow us, in my opinion, to continue gaining market share in the high-end profitable fragrance business.","And finally, in hair care, our pipeline, particularly in the styling, more profitable part of hair care, is stronger than ever. So in that, I feel positive about the sufficiency of the pipeline, and also I feel positive by the fit of our pipeline to the future of the markets as identified by our compass.","Operator","Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Obviously, you're seeing very strong growth in makeup, as is the category. Can you discuss how long you think this cycle of makeup category strength can continue as you look out over the next few years? And what's driving the category growth?","And then on the e-commerce side, how sustainable do you think the strong growth is that you're seeing on that business? You were kind of earlier than a lot of peers in focusing resources there on that channel. So, I guess, is there any risk going forward that competitors start to catch up with you? Or do you think you're widening your gap versus peers in terms of the way you manage the business? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, on makeup, first of all, I believe this is a long-term trend. The makeup category is growing, driven by several aspects. The first one is that the Asian consumer, the Asian women are becoming more avid users of makeup. And so this is an enormous amount of growth, potentially, that will develop \u2013 it is developing now and will continue to develop in the next years.","The second big trend is that the Millennials are, on average, using more makeup than the previous generation, so there is an increase of consumption per individual in all markets, including developed markets. And this is a long-term trend, also because what it is driving, the more usage of makeup, is what historically has been our strength in our business model, which is education and customization.","But now the education is available also via online, exactly our e-commerce activities, and via social media, which is booming the amount of how-to videos, different trends, et cetera. So, the combination of this more amount of trends information and how-to information with the Millennial generation point of view, is pushing makeup up. I think this will continue for a long period.","In term of our activity in e-commerce, we continue to do very well. I think we gained substantial competitive advantage; but not only in the execution in market, also in the capabilities. We have a very strong e-commerce team that is developing amazing work, which are divided into technology people that can develop sites and develop activity in a very fast pace around the world from our centralized offices in New York, in a very \u2013 with investment that now will pay out for the long-term that we had done in the previous years.","And we had great quality of execution in the creative silo (36:15). So, on top of the number of sites, the ability to penetrate the markets, frankly, we have the capability and the quality of execution that for the time being set us aside, in my opinion, from the industry. Tracey?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And we also have a very good partnership with all of our retailers around the world to make sure that our products are displayed and presented well on the retailer dotcom sites as well.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Olivia Tong from Bank of America.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning. First, Fabrizio, I want to go back \u2013 get into advertising a little bit for this particular quarter. Because coming into the quarter, you probably planned to increase A&P support in the businesses of course to continue driving sales and support some of the product launches. But the sales growth did decelerate a little bit, probably a little bit more than people had expected. So, can you help with some \u2013 provide a little bit more insight in how you go about making decisions on A&P spend? Because that line does continue to move around a fair bit quarter-to-quarter.","And then also in terms of the Chinese tourism, do you think you're making up the shortfall in Hong Kong from lack of Chinese tourists in other areas? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, first of all, in terms of the sales for the quarter, we continue to believe that we will deliver the fiscal year in the 7% to 8% range, which means if you look at the numbers that we assume actually an acceleration of the sales trend in the fourth quarter. So, the sales by quarter depend a lot by initiatives, launches, and what happens in specific markets.","And the way we take A&P decisions is really, we base the decision off if we believe there is enough rate of return on that investment in that moment. For example, in quarter three, the things that we saw going less strong than we expected was Hong Kong, and so when we add markets that decrease their growth significantly, we do decrease our spending there and we keep the spending for better moments where there is better market traction.","So, what you're seeing in the third quarter, very specifically, is reduced spending in Hong Kong from our side. The second area where we saw less traction was U.S. mid-tier department store brick-and-mortar where we clearly saw less structure, together with all the tourist doors in the U.S. that particularly influenced by the absence of Brazilians and Russians that was a very dramatic change. So, when we see these dramatic change, we obviously adjust our investment.","The second reason was, in this case very specific is some product launch initiatives on Lauder and Clinique that we decided to move in supporting them in the fourth quarter which is the other reason why we are moving the investment from one quarter into another.","Personally, I see this as a strength. We have the agility to move our A&P investment by quarter depending on the market situation and the product launch situation, and this make us more efficient and more effective. And we stay consistent on our year ago that we will commit to do our best to deliver, that's not changed. But by quarter actually we see agility and flexibility as strengths.","On the Chinese consumers, now we are definitely doing much better with Chinese consumer in other areas where they are going. For example, in Europe, as we have seen, there is a growth of our European business which is partially driven by tourists and the tourists are also Chinese. We have seen Korea coming back and Japan being pretty strong.","So yes, we recovered some of the sales. However, not all of them. We have a very high market share in Hong Kong. Very, very high market share. And our market share, for example, in Japan is half of the market share we have in Hong Kong.","So in that situation, we obviously cannot recover the Hong Kong losses completely in other areas. And that's what you're seeing in this moment as a phenomenon. But it's a temporary phenomenon and as soon as Hong Kong will stabilize in other markets where we are now building market share like Korea, we'll achieve the levels we believe are achievable, that things will accelerate again.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you just talk about some of the U.S. NPD trends? Because it's not just Est\u00e9e Lauder, but the bigger brands like still continue to lose market share from some of the smaller niche brands. So, is there a strategy in place to find a way to kind of outflank them?","And then maybe most \u2013 I don't want to say problematic, but it seems like M\u2022A\u2022C is declining quite a bit in the U.S. \u2013 I shouldn't say quite a bit, but it's declining. So, can you just talk about the M\u2022A\u2022C U.S. versus international split and if the international growth can offset some of the softness in the U.S.?","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, starting for M\u2022A\u2022C, M\u2022A\u2022C is really doing very, very well internationally. M\u2022A\u2022C is growing strong double-digits in every single market of the world and is \u2013 the temporary flattening of the retail trend in the U.S. is being more than offset by a booming international business.","The temporary flattening of the U.S. trend is driven by two aspects. One, as I said, is the fact that the lower traffic in mid-tier department store is one of the driver. And the other is tourists. I mean, M\u2022A\u2022C business is driven by tourists of the world that visit the U.S. in a significant way, because the brand is very, very popular around the world. So, the important decrease of tourists, particularly Brazilians and Russian, as I said, have temporarily limited the retail of M\u2022A\u2022C also because these stores were very strong in the base period that we are comparing this to.","But overall, in total, M\u2022A\u2022C continues to be absolutely one of the strong drivers of our success around the world, and we have programs to ensure that this will continue.","In terms of the success of the small-size brands in the U.S., this is a fact that as I explained in my prepared remark, that the combination of easier access to consumers and more availability of investment \u2013 money at a lower interest rates, have created a lot of new launches of brands. And the possibility of social media to bring these brands' attention to consumers is taken down the barriers-to-entry. So, the way we are reacting is first of all, reinforcing the business in our strong brands.","Second, participating to this with our mid-size smaller brands, including acquisitions. Smashbox was one of these brands when we acquired these brands and now, in fact, it's growing at double-digits in the context of this.","And then finally, it's the diversification of our distribution. We have freestanding store, more specialty, continued success of online, and our support to mid-tier department store to accelerate, to re-enforce that business model to be able to better attract Millennials and better activate the floor in order to become even more competitive as to this development of smaller brands and of new channels. This is one of the changes that I was describing before that requires adjustment in capabilities and investments in supporting our brands growth.","Operator","Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. If we take a look at your margin performance over the past couple of years, it seems to have moderated a little bit here in terms of the year-over-year increases, and I realize there's FX as well as the acquisition impact in that. But, it really seems to have slowed, particularly since the end of the 2010 to 2013 restructuring program. And so, I guess as we look at your new restructuring program, is that a sign, maybe, that the incremental margins on organic revenue growth is lower than what it was?","And I guess if that's the case, there's been a discussion and you guys have talked about the costs of growth not having gone higher, but the math would seem to indicate that again, maybe that incremental margin isn't as high as it had been historically. Any thoughts on that?","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, first of all, I'll let Tracey give more answer. But, first of all to say that this fiscal year we have 50 points, the half a margin point, just affected by currency. And 30 basis points just by acquisitions. So, 80 are affected by currency and acquisitions. So yes, that's a new fact in the margin evolution. But then the combination of our business and cost savings is actually producing the power to continue growing margin. Obviously, if currency and acquisition will stop affecting it negatively, this would be more visible.","The other thing is there is also a mix change in our business. So, we have more freestanding stores and we have more makeup versus skin care that also are changing the impact of mix in our business. So, we need to continue to deliver our growth, we need to become more efficient and effective and manage our overall cost structure better. That's part of what we are announcing today and we are going to do. Tracey?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, I think those are the two differentiators, John, in terms of the timeframe that you referred to. Both the restructuring program previously, which allowed us to reinvest back into the business and really drive and support what was a skin care moment, particularly in Asia, and the period post that corresponded with a slowdown in Asia and Asian consumption, particularly in China and Hong Kong, as Fabrizio spoke about, which certainly slowed our skin care business, particularly with our large brands like Est\u00e9e Lauder and to a lesser extent Clinique. So, that is a margin difference in terms of our business performance relative to the previous timeframe.","One of the things that the Leading Beauty Forward program does for us, because we are and certainly our ten-year compass has allowed us to continue to understand that there are very, very significant growth opportunities for us from a total company standpoint \u2013 it allows us the freedom to invest more in those opportunities, irrespective of the margin and deliver our margin goals well into the future.","So, it's a very exciting program. But certainly it is proactive on our part, looking forward in terms of where the growth opportunities are and making sure that we can support them with capabilities, we can support them with other investments and still drive the business and the profit expectations.","Operator","Our next question is from Lauren Wolff from Piper Jaffray. Lauren Wolff, your line is open.","Lauren M. Wolff - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Apologizes. Thanks for taking our questions. We have a couple for you this morning. And I'm calling on behalf of Steph Wissink. The first question we have I guess we have seen an ad spend shift into Q4 related to Est\u00e9e and Clinique. Is that tied to specific product line introductions or in response to other channel plans? And then secondarily, just examples of speed and agility, is that largely in the product development and marketing pipeline?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, I think on the A&P, Fabrizio did speak with that \u2013 speak to that a bit earlier, Lauren. It is tied somewhat to some of the launches that we are expecting from particularly Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique in the fourth quarter. It's also tied a bit to some stores that slipped in terms of store openings from Q3 into Q4, primarily related to M\u2022A\u2022C; so those are the primary drivers.","And as Fabrizio mentioned also previously, the slowdown in Hong Kong and a couple of other markets slowdown, North America, we've seen the last few years post-holiday traffic has been quite slow and it has taken longer to start to see traffic flow back into particularly the department store channel and particularly the mid-tier department store channel. So, those factors are what caused us to think that the A&P spend that we had initially planned for Q3 would be better spent in Q4.","Operator","Our next question is from Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hello, everyone. My question has to do with your expansion of freestanding stores in the third quarter. My understanding is that you had opened 90 out of the 250 target that you set up for the year by the second quarter. 90 by the second quarter. So, if you can tell us how many stores you opened in the third quarter, in what regions, what was the contribution to growth, and whether \u2013 what is slotted for Q4 is what it's going to drive the re-acceleration of the top line growth? Thank you.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So Javier, we opened net 25 stores in the third quarter, a little bit less than what we had expected, and as I just mentioned, more of those will shift to the fourth quarter. We don't comment on the incremental sales by channel related to growth from our different channel activity outside of travel retail and online.","But certainly the incremental stores will contribute some to the growth in the fourth quarter. A pickup in performance in the U.S. is also expected to drive more of the fourth quarter growth as well and in particular our bigger brands, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique, in addition to M\u2022A\u2022C.","Operator","Our next question is from Caroline Levy from CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Well, thanks so much. Good morning. Two questions I have to ask on China, of course. If you could talk a little bit about the shift in channels. And obviously, online is doing really well, but could you talk about your strategy within department stores? How many freestanding stores you're opening beyond the Tier 1 cities and whether over time, you think freestanding stores will be throughout the country or online? How big could online get there?","My second question is simply on innovation in skin. I'm just wondering, if you're changing the way you look at that innovation, given the challenges to the growth in the category now?","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So on China, we have been growing 5% our net sales this quarter and 8% our retail sales. So retail sales, 8% in China is good, is strong, and the profile of our growth, first of all by brand, is that all brands are growing double-digit, with the exception of our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, which is the biggest brand in that profile.","So, first of all, even before distribution we are diversifying our brand portfolio that goes with the distribution, because different brands are in different distribution. And we are diversifying geographically, because as I explained, our timing was through also this quarter, we are opening new cities and new geographical area of China. We opened one new city, we opened 13 new doors just in the quarter three.","In term of the channels, online is doing well and will continue to do well. Today, we have now 10% of our business by now in online in China, versus 12% in the U.S. So, China is catching up with the U.S. at the speed of light. We are opening more freestanding store. In this moment, it's mainly on M\u2022A\u2022C and Jo Malone. But in the future, we may decide as we see the opportunity to have also other brands, increasing the number of freestanding stores, particularly in the cities where this is appropriate and there are no alternative distribution solutions.","I personally believe that the future of freestanding store in China will go directly to omni-channel, meaning the stores will be connected to the online brand dotcom activities and will be one basically omni-channel opportunity that will bring the brands in many more cities with pretty efficient freestanding store models which are not the traditional big freestanding stores in cities like in the developed markets.","And finally, we believe the specialty channel over time will also develop in China. And today, we are much more penetrated and developed in the specialty channel in China that we were in the U.S. at the beginning of the specialty channel development. So, well diversified by region of China, well diversified by brand or better diversified by brand in our strategy and well diversified by channel is our goal for the development of the China markets.","Now in the innovation on skin care, as I explained before, yes, we are looking at skin care in a different way, reflecting the new consumer trends and reality. As I said, when you take skin care as a whole, there is a bigger and faster growth in what I call skin care for immediate benefit or skin care as a base of makeup. And there is less growth in this moment in the intense anti-aging skin care part. For the same reason of makeup, a lot of the growth is driven by Millennials, which are more interested in this part of the skin care.","So yes, big part of our innovation pipeline is also driven in the skin care benefits, which are more modern and more Millennial. Take an example, the New Dimension launch of Est\u00e9e Lauder is not about anti-aging, it's about really the shaping of the face, depending how consumer want. Or think of our fastest-growing skin care segment, which are masks.","Masks \u2013 or even we have a brand GLAMGLOW, which is completely focused on masks, and masks is a product you use to get immediately after ten minutes, the benefit that you're looking for, be it luminosity, moisturization, irritation or brightening, et cetera. So skin care for immediate benefit, which is closer to makeup in reality, in term of benefit for the consumer, is the fastest growing trend. And our pipeline in these areas are the strongest they ever been.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Altobello from Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thank you. Good morning. First question on Hong Kong. Fabrizio, you mentioned earlier that you think that's going to be a temporary phenomenon, but it's been going on now for five or six quarters. Is there anything that you're seeing that leads you to believe that that should get better anytime soon or is that going to be with us well into fiscal 2017?","And then shifting gears to skin care a little bit. You just mentioned the new reality in that category. Is there anything that could be done to re-accelerate the category? Or is that going to be demographically challenged for some time? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, okay. On Hong Kong, so I don't know what I don't know. I'm saying it's temporary because Hong Kong is a gray market with an enormous internal demand of local consumers. And it's a very attractive market for Chinese, in general. So, it has been declining substantially in the last period. I believe at a certain moment it will stabilize.","I personally don't have the expectation that we'll go back to big growth fast, but I do have the expectation that this trend will stabilize. And it will stabilize also because the local consumption is actually continuing to increase, and so is the mix between local consumption and tourist, particularly Chinese tourists, that at a certain moment will stabilize.","And I just came from Hong Kong. As I said in my prepared remarks, I was in Asia last week, I visited Hong Kong and Korea, and the other thing that gave me confidence is the strength of our team there, which is managing this very difficult time in its fantastic way, increasing their activities on local consumers to help our business to stabilize without waiting for tourists, but just increasing our market share with locals, which I think is the right strategy, and I have great confidence in our team to be able to stabilize the trend as soon as the market will allow.","On your skin care question is \u2013 I think I've answered already several times \u2013 the skin care, obviously, is and remains the most important categories overall and will continue to grow. As I said, the fastest growing part of skin care is the skin care which is more relating to immediate benefits, which is the skin care, which is of higher interest for Millennial.","We had to adjust our innovation, our technology, our activities and planning for the future to the balance between more drastic anti-aging benefits and more immediate benefits. We are doing that via our portfolio brands. Some of our brands are much stronger in anti-aging, like Est\u00e9e Lauder. Some other of our brands like GLAMGLOW are completely focused on immediate results skin care. And some of our brands like Bobbi Brown have a strong skin care business, which is actually that skin care is a base of makeup. It is to support the makeup habits of women.","So, we are attacking skin care on multiple fronts: anti-aging; base of makeup; instant benefit, thanks to our portfolio brands and thanks to our innovation pipeline. I feel very strong about our long-term skin care trend, but it's a fact that makeup in this moment is a much faster growing category. And we are, again, I see as a strength that we have the agility to adjust and refocus our investment resources depending on the biggest trends we see.","Operator","Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. I just had one clarifying question on the door openings and second on the investment spending. So first on the doors, just I wanted to confirm that 250 doors is still the right number for this year. So there would be 135 doors opening roughly in the fourth quarter?","And then secondly, if that's the case, that would actually suggest that a lot of the step-up in spending budgeted for this year is really affiliated with those doors more so than necessarily a specific step-up in advertising. So, if you'd comment on that, it's great. And within the AMS line, I know it's not reported quarterly, but on a full-year basis, if you could talk about how that mix has maybe shifted over time. If there is some reduction in some buckets, like sampling or merchandising, with less reliance on department stores, but an increase in the kind of core advertising dollars, that would be really helpful. Thank you.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Lauren, I'll start, and then I'll let Fabrizio add. In terms of the door openings, you're right, approximately 130 doors in the fourth quarter, possibly a little bit less. And yes, we do see and expect to see a step-up in our store-related expenses, so selling expenses, store ops expenses related to many of those store openings.","We also do, though, however, expect to see a step-up in A&P expense related to some of the programs that we are supporting in the fourth quarter, and it runs the gamut in terms of the spend. Certainly there is some sampling that's involved in that A&P spend, so we did talk about the fact that promotion was down in the third quarter. We do expect it to be up more in the fourth quarter related to some of the programs that we're supporting.","Fabrizio Freda - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And in terms of advertising, I mean, we are \u2013 there is an increase of sampling, to be very clear. Sampling more and more important, given the dynamic of the consumer and given also the channels that we are going in. There is an increase in loyalty programs and the ability to link consumers to loyalty activities, particularly that goes along with freestanding store and online and e-commerce. There is an increase of this and a decrease of all other kind of promotion, which are more typical of brick-and-mortar.","And in terms of swing, I would say you need to look at what's happening for us is like our magazine print advertising is more or less stabilizing; but our TV advertising is decreasing and is increasing of equivalent or more the digital social media advertising.","So summarizing, it's a stabilization of the magazine advertising, a decrease of the television and an increase of the digital social media. That's the trends we see now. Obviously, this mix is very different by country in the world and by brand. But in general, this is the big trend we're seeing. So more sampling and more digital social media.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded and webcast.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Dennis D'Andrea. Please go ahead, sir.","Dennis D'Andrea - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Since many of our remarks today contained forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges.

I'm pleased that in the second quarter we delivered our financial targets. Our sales grew solidly, up 5% in constant currency. It was a meaningful acceleration from the first three months. In constant currency, our adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 5%, reflecting strong growth in high profit channels and disciplined expense management coupled with phased growth leverage.","During the quarter, we enhanced many important strategic growth levers which created positive momentum across our diversified business in our brands, channels, geographies and categories. These gains were fueled by strong strides in our innovation, social media and digital engagement. We continue to make priority investments through our Leading Beauty Forward initiative, which is proceeding according to plan. I will elaborate on each of these in a moment.","Our two biggest challenges currently are the brick-and-mortar business in U.S. mid-tier department stores, which continues to be impacted by soft traffic and a slowdown in consumer purchasing in the Middle East. Additionally, Hong Kong continued to be soft, and we remain cautious about the impact of political issues and terrorism affecting our business in certain markets. We also continued to be penalized by the strength of the U.S. dollar.","Despite these headwinds, we continue to successfully activate many of the elements of our strategy, which give us confidence in the strength and sustainability of our business growth. The first successful element of our strategy is the positive momentum of our diverse brand portfolio, and we continuously build from this strategic advantage.","In the quarter, our best performers were our mid-sized and luxury brands, which continue to gain devoted consumers and strengthen their desirable product offering and services. They are headed on a path to become big brands. Tom Ford, La Mer, Jo Malone, Darphin and the brands we acquired in the past few years generated impressive constant currency double digit growth globally. Tom Ford products were particularly well received, and the brand grew in every category in every region.","Two of our big brands generated improved sales and grew globally in constant currency. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand sales increased mid-single digits with positive growth both in skin care and makeup. Est\u00e9e Lauder Revitalizing Supreme+ was the largest U.S. skin care launch in calendar 2015 according to NPD. The brands' makeup sales increased in every region and globally were up double digits led by foundations and lip products.","Est\u00e9e Lauder brand grew in every region, which included an acceleration in China and in travel retail. Makeup fueled growth in the UK where the brand has a high makeup penetration.","M\u2022A\u2022C. global business also grew in constant currency, as we had anticipated. The brand international business further accelerated with double digit gains in most market as well as in travel retail. In the U.S., M\u2022A\u2022C. sales showed improvement versus the first quarter, but still declined, due primarily to weak traffic in brick-and-mortar mid-tier department store and its tourist-focused freestanding stores.","We expect M\u2022A\u2022C. international sales to increase further in the second half of the fiscal year with continued rapid online growth, creative innovation, expanded consumer coverage in overseas markets including launching in new cities, improved merchandise in store and accelerating its successful efforts in social media. Our aim is to strengthen the brand competitiveness in the U.S. while investing behind its international momentum.","We also strengthened our portfolio with the acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced, two of the fastest growing prestige makeup brands. With a strong millennial following, they extended our presence in specialty-multi retail, which is one of the fastest growing channels for prestige beauty.","Too Faced joined our company in mid-December, just as it was introducing its Sweet Peach collection, which became its most successful launch ever. The collection attracted nearly 100,000 consumers online who waited up to four hours to make a purchase. We were excited about the prospect of maximizing the potential of BECCA and Too Faced forward, as we are doing with our other new brands.","The other acquisitions we made over the last two years are growing rapidly. We continue to integrate them into the company while we expand their consumer coverage and offerings. As an example, we launched Le Labo in Nordstrom and created a new fragrance set, which were popular gifts and best sellers online.","Our important strategy of diversifying our distribution to expand our consumer coverage is progressing well. We are evolving the company distribution footprint to meet consumers' changing shopping patterns. We are accelerating the execution of the strategy as some U.S. department stores closed unproductive doors while our most profitable channels delivered outstanding performances, including specialty-multi retail, travel retail and online, all of which rose double digits in the quarter. We have deep experience successfully managing our business across a wide variety of distribution channels, for example in the UK and in many European countries.","In a fast-growing specialty-multi retail channel, we are increasing our presence by launching more brands globally to reach new consumers. In the quarter, we launched Est\u00e9e Lauder initially in 30 ULTA stories in the U.S. and on ULTA.com and had very strong results. Clinique's expansion in the channel included more than 50 new doors with Sephora in JCPenney where it was the number one skin care brand in those doors. Outside the U.S., Clinique launched in the largest specialty-multi retailer in Korea.","In travel retail, our strategy to make our limited distribution brands more widely available and offer a broader portfolio of brands in the channel has yielded outstanding results. We have broadened our makeup offerings in travel retail to capture growing demand while Jo Malone growth has helped drive a reinvigorated fragrance business, and we are introducing some of our newer artisanal fragrance brands to airport locations.","Our retail sales growth was more than double the 8% passenger traffic growth in the channel, as more than half of our top 30 travel retail markets posted double digit gains. However, it bears mentioning that travel retail remains volatile, as political issues as well currency fluctuation can cause significant changes in travel patterns.","We continue to execute on our e-commerce strategy, which deliver accelerating double digit growth in the quarter, as we supported our own sites and retailer sites with new programs and innovation. Our sales were strong across brand sites, led by M\u2022A\u2022C, as well as retailers and third-party sites.","Traffic in orders rose strong double digits compared to last year. We opened our \u2013 or launched an approximately 100 new sites globally for our brands and products, and began selling online for the first time in Hong Kong, the Middle East, and the Balkans. In North America, several brands had record-breaking online sales during holidays, including Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique, Origins and Aveda.","We continue to focus on mobile engagement and saw significant growth in traffic, which drove m-commerce sales increase of 75% over the Thanksgiving Cyber Monday weekend. Our brands on retailers' site also posted double digit growth in the quarter.","Our online business was exceptionally strong in China, where sales nearly doubled, thanks to a highly successful single day on Tmall. During that event on November 11, sales of our six brand stores on Tmall were twice that of previous year. At Est\u00e9e Lauder, most of the consumers who purchased products that day were new to the brand on Tmall, illustrating the success of our strategy to reach new consumer through different channels.","From a geographic standpoint, two of the largest markets we had expected to improve this quarter did so. Our business in France showed solid growth, and our U.S. sales improved, led by our high-end fragrance brands, which were big winners at holidays. Est\u00e9e Lauder's Blockbuster Set helped drive traffic and sold out weeks before Christmas.","Our sales in China were strong, with many of our brands rising double digits. La Mer was a standout, driven by the successful launch of its Renewal Oil and Skin Color Collection, a key entry in the fast-growing area that bridges skin care and makeup. The Skin Color line is at the incremental sales, and having a positive halo effect on the brands' skin care business.","Makeup continue to be fast-growing category in China, and we are responding to the demand. M\u2022A\u2022C's growth in China was outstanding, as lipstick sales rose strongly. The brand's upcoming launch on Tmall is expected to further drive sales, particularly in cities without brick-and-mortar.","We expect Est\u00e9e Lauder brands' momentum in China to continue. In our third quarter, we plan to launch its best-selling Double Wear Foundation in a cash room compact, (12:51) a package innovation that is coveted by Chinese consumers.","Looking at our categories now. Our three major ones are growing solidly on a constant currency basis. Skin care returned to growth, and we have created a new profile growth engine with a fragrance category, with our now extensive portfolio of high-end fragrances, which includes Jo Malone, Tom Ford, AERIN at Zegna Sensa, (13:20) as well as newer brands such as Kilian, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mall, and Le Labo. They had growth of nearly 30% during the quarter. These luxury fragrance brands were primarily powered by strong new fragrance launches and social media.","In addition, innovation is driving our success across multiple engines of growth, expanding our brands, regions, channels, and target consumer groups. We are leveraging opportunities across the largest, fastest-growing subcategories in areas of consumer benefits while creating a leading new breakthroughs. We are increasing our speed to market and creating more superior products.","Additionally, our research and development team continues to develop new proprietary technology platform, and our innovative concept extend beyond product to also include packaging, delivery systems, merchandising, services, and even new approaches to digital engagement.","One of our numerous products in packaging innovations is Clinique's Fresh Pressed Daily Booster. Launching this month, the Booster represents a new subcategory for our company. The product concentrated vitamin C is intended to be freshly pressed into our moisturizer to immediately brighten and even skin tone. Fresh Pressed should also increase sales of Clinique core moisturizer business, since they are used together.","Our brands are also focusing innovation around hero products and hero franchises, creating new offerings around a core collection is very efficient, and draws renewed attention to the brand priorities. For example, Est\u00e9e Lauder recently introduced new products to reinforce its two biggest franchises, Advanced Night Repair and Double Wear, and it paid off, as both grew double digits. In the U.S., sales of the core Advanced Night Repair Serum rose 17%, boosted by its innovative Intensive Recovery Ampoules. And a new eye mask that just launched last month as part of the franchise should further lift the serum and the entire collection.","I'm proud that several of these products are being recognized for their innovation. Last month, Est\u00e9e Lauder received Marie Claire's prestigious Prix d'Excellence Award in research and development for three products: Advanced Night Repair Powerfoil Mask, Advanced Night Repair Ampoules, and Revitalizing Supreme+. This award honors the most Innovative products of the year.","Our innovation is helped by our brands' and retailers' websites, which play a key role as a marketing vehicle to raise awareness of our new products. Millions of people can research the latest launches and read ratings and reviews before purchasing. We will continue to invest in capabilities to further expand our presence online, and our brands are making important strides to stay on the cutting edge of social media, which continues to strongly influence beauty choices. As an example, in the last years, M\u2022A\u2022C has significantly increased its digital engagement. The number of global Instagram followers of M\u2022A\u2022C has increased by 75% to 40 million and its number of global Facebook fans has climbed sharply.","M\u2022A\u2022C has launched local Instagram's account in several markets including Brazil, Germany and Russia and the content is shoppable. M\u2022A\u2022C's global makeup artists are engaging consumers with locally relevant content, as the brand is using more influencers a user generated cost to augment its messaging. We just announced a collaboration with 10 global beauty influencers and bloggers who will create their own M\u2022A\u2022C lipsticks.","Our brands' actions to drive earned media value through influencers is working well a win made (17:58) gains in all product categories. As a company, we have tied to the number one position in earned media value share in Total Beauty is measured by Tribe Dynamics, which quantifies the value of digital content created by third parties about a brand. We have the largest corporate share in skin care and fragrances and we have tied for first in makeup. We have Tom Ford, Smashbox and now Too Faced a strongly growing share of engagement with influencers, which is reflected in the higher shares in prestige beauty.","In the second quarter M\u2022A\u2022C strongly increased its social influencer engagement, which led to a 30% rise in earned media value. And in another impressive achievement in China, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand was ranked number one and the only genius brand in the recent L2 China Beauty Index, which cited the brand leadership in digital marketing, mobile and social media.","Now let me turn to outlook. We expect to achieve constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% in fiscal year 2017. This includes approximately 1% of incremental sales from our recent acquisitions of Too Faced. We continue to expect our sales and profits to accelerate in the second half. The stronger gains are expected to come from four main factors, including organic growth, regular price increases that took effect in January, increased consumer coverage tailored by brand and contribution from the recently acquired brands.","There are certain brands, channels in countries that we believe will be superior growth engines. They include our luxury brands and the online, travel retail and specialty-multi channels. By market, we expect China to remain strong and Hong Kong should start stabilizing.","As we capitalize on the best growth prospects, we are also managing costs and reallocating resources from lower growth area to priority ones, aided by Leading Beauty Forward. We continue to hire talent where we need skill sets and investing capabilities that will position us to win in the fast moving competitive world of global prestige beauty for the long-term.","With a diversified business that's directed by proven strategy and powered by multiple engines of growth, which we have strengthened even further with our artisanal fragrances and our recent acquisition of fast-growing makeup brands, we are confident in our long-term outlook. Our results will continue to be fueled by the best brand portfolio and the best people in the industry which will drive our winning strategy and continue our leadership in global prestige beauty.","Now I will turn the call over to Tracey.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. First, I will review our fiscal 2017 second quarter results and then cover our expectations for the third quarter and for the full year. As a reminder, my commentary excludes the impact of restructuring and other charges.","As you have seen from our press release this morning, net sales for the second quarter were $3.21 billion, up more than 5% in constant currency compared to the prior year period. Incremental sales from our recent acquisitions of By Kilian, BECCA and Too Faced contributed approximately 90 basis points of this growth, slightly less than half of that from Too Faced.","From a geographic perspective, Europe, the Middle East and Africa saw the fastest growth again this quarter. Net sales rose 9% in constant currency with double digit growth from the travel retail channel, developed markets like Italy, France and Germany and emerging markets like Russia, Central Europe, the Balkans and India. Sales in the UK were also a major contributor to the regions' growth in constant currency, up high single digits.","Last quarter, we called out France and the Middle East as two markets that pressured our first quarter sales in EMEA. As we anticipated, sales in France returned to growth in the second quarter as prior year comparisons eased, although the country continues to experience lower levels of tourism than before. Net sales in the Middle East again fell sharply as distributors in the area continue to align inventory to weaker retail traffic. This trend is expected to ease slightly in our third quarter and more significantly in the fourth quarter as we anniversary the downturn. Excluding the Middle East, the EMEA region grew 12%.","Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was led by a double digit increase in China and the Philippines followed by strong growth in Korea and Malaysia. Both Japan and Australia rose low single digits. Hong Kong sales continue to decline, although at half the rate of last quarter. Excluding Hong Kong, the region grew 7%.","Net sales in the Americas grew 1% in constant currency. Latin America grew 7%, led by strong growth in Chile, Peru and Mexico, while Brazil and Venezuela remain challenged. Canada was flat, and the U.S. declined 1%, representing an improvement from last quarter.","Our sales in both the online and specialty-multi channels rose double digits. However, we saw continued declines in the brick-and-mortar business of mid-tier department stores as well as tourist driven freestanding stores.","Net sales by product category were led by the 11% constant currency growth in fragrances for the quarter, reflecting the success of our strategy to focus on the higher margin luxury and artisanal segment of the category. Jo Malone fragrances again led the category growth this quarter as sales rose strong double digits, reflecting a very successful holiday program and expanded consumer reach.","Fragrance sales from Le Labo, Tom Ford and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle rose strong double-digits. Makeup sales rose 7% in constant currency. The biggest contributor was Tom Ford, which doubled its makeup business this quarter. Est\u00e9e Lauder and Smashbox rose high single digits, and La Mer nearly tripled its small makeup business due to successful launch of a new foundation.","M\u2022A\u2022C's makeup sales grew globally with strong results in travel retail and in Asia-Pacific. The brands in North America business improved from last quarter, but still declined low single digits due to slow foot traffic in its core channels of distribution.","Clinique's sales were also soft as they were adversely affected by a promotional shift and the timing of new product launches. Skin care sales grew 3% in constant currency, a nice improvement from last quarter. Nearly all brands saw growth in skin care this quarter, led by double digit increases from La Mer, GLAMGLOW and Bobbi Brown, and solid contribution from Est\u00e9e Lauder.","Hair care sales fell 7% in constant currency primarily due to the cadence of innovation on hair care products at Aveda. Our gross margin declined 90 basis points from the prior year due to \u2013 primarily to obsolescence, new product mix and currency.","Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased 60 basis points primarily reflecting prudent expense management and general and administrative expenses in addition to our cost savings programs and partially offset by higher store operating costs associated with our retail store growth.","Operating income rose 1% and operating margin decreased 30 basis points. Net earnings decreased 1% to $454 million reflecting higher net interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. Diluted EPS of $1.22 was flat to the prior year, as reported, and grew 5% in constant currency.","Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.06 of unfavorable currency translation and $0.02 of dilution from our acquisitions, half of that from Too Faced. EPS was higher than anticipated due primarily to favorable channel mix and more prudent expense management.","With respect to cash flow and capital allocation for the six months, we generated $824 million in net cash flows from operating activities and we invested $208 million in capital projects and $1.7 billion to complete the acquisitions of both BECCA and Too Faced. The acquisitions were financed with both cash on hand and commercial paper.","We continued to return cash to stockholders using $363 million to repurchase 4.2 million shares of our stock and $236 million to pay dividends. So we are pleased with our Q2 results. Now let's turn to our outlook for next quarter and for the full year.","With the inclusion of our acquisitions, we expect sales to grow between 6% and 7% in constant currency for the fiscal 2017 year, reflecting approximately 2 points from pricing, approximately 2 to 3 points from distribution as we expand the consumer reach of some of our brands, and 2 points from innovation and the acquisitions of By Kilian, BECCA and Too Faced. We expect Too Faced to contribute more than half of this impact.","Currency translation is expected to depress sales by 2% reflecting weighted average rates of $1 or $1.08 for the euro, $1.25 for the pound and $1.11 for the yen for the fiscal year.","Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.29 and $3.33 before restructuring charges, including approximately $0.16 of dilution from currency translation and $0.07 dilution from the recent acquisitions, of which $0.04 is from Too Faced. In constant currency, we expect our EPS to rise by 8% to 9%.","For the fiscal 2017 third quarter, our sales are expected to rise by approximately 7% to 8% in constant currency, including the incremental impact of acquisitions of approximately 350 basis points to 400 basis points.","Negative currency translation is expected and estimated at approximately 2 percentage points. The Middle East is expected to see sequential improvement over the next six months, as I indicated previously. Net sales began to slow sharply in the second quarter last year and declined about 15% in the fourth quarter. We expect to see more normal ordering patterns emerge as inventory becomes more aligned with current sales trends in the Middle East. Hong Kong is another market where we expect sequential improvement as the tourist business there has started to show a stabilizing trend. Our business in U.S. mid-tier department stores is expected to continue to remain challenged.","EPS is forecast to be between $0.65 and $0.70 before restructuring charges. This includes dilution of about $0.03 from currency and $0.03 from acquisitions. We delivered the first half within our sales range and importantly, above our EPS forecast in constant currency. We remain focused on delivering our full year guidance against an accelerating backdrop of political, economic and currency volatility. The political landscape around the world shifted considerably in 2016. We've recognized the potential challenges this changing landscape presents, and there maybe implications for our business in the U.S. and around the world.","While we remain committed and constant in our strategy, we are somewhat cautious in the near-term as a result of the global macro uncertainty. We are very proud that despite the headwinds we have experienced, we continue to proactively manage our business around the globe to deliver excellent sales and profit growth with our amazing teams.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now opened for questions. Questions will be taken in the order in which they were received. To ensure everyone has the opportunity to ask their question, we will limit each person to one question. Time permitting, we will return to you for addition questions. Our first question today comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much. Good morning.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about Leading Beauty Forward, actually, particularly given you guys \u2013 you referenced it a little bit. And my understanding or my interpretation of the program has been that in part, it's about investing for the future in new channels, new distribution and so on and new business systems more for more digital e-commerce freestanding stores et cetera. But the part of the reason we don't see sort of a margin benefit from the restructuring element of this is, you need to keep your infrastructure around, for example, U.S. mature department stores fully intact until this new system is up and running.","Can you just \u2013 is that a reasonable way of thinking about it? And given how sharply the U.S. piece of this is declining, is there an acceleration in sort of being able to take some cost out of this, if you'll call it legacy, distribution model? Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah, no, so thank you for the question, Lauren. Leading Beauty Forward actually is comprised of multiple programs, as you suggest. Some are \u2013 were shorter term and some are longer term, because they require structural changes. One of the things that we are looking at, to your point, is, in light of some of the acceleration that we're seeing in channel shifts in some parts of our business, certainly in the U.S., how we might look to accelerate different components of Leading Beauty Forward. We are aggressively pursuing, expanding our digital capabilities in the company. We are aggressively pursuing looking for other cost savings opportunities under the Leading Beauty Forward program, as well as other \u2013 our other cost saving programs as well.","But Leading Beauty Forward, the reason why we indicated initially, when we announced the program, that there was no cost savings this year and we would see some next year, but it was included within our guidance for next year, was just the timing of some of the longer term items that were planned under Leading Beauty Forward that required some structural change. But certainly, we are looking, as we always do, aggressively to accelerate opportunities as we see them.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah, and just to add one aspect (33:51) that, beyond reducing cost and doing of what Tracey is explained, I believe one of the key benefits in the next two, three years of Leading Beauty Forward, to reallocate resources to the fast-growing opportunity and the fast-growing businesses that we have around the world. So this should further enforce our strengths, on top of creating more cost saving and more margin over the long-term.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Research.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So, I have a couple things. One is, from a top line perspective. At least to our math, based on your disclosures last quarter of sales and growth rates on your acquisitions, all of your acquisitions together this year, including the growth of those acquisitions, should be adding close to 3 points to your top-line growth. So, not just the sales, but the sales and the growth. So does that mean your underlying organic local currency growth is about 3% to 4% for the year? And if yes, how should we think about the, I guess, attainability of your longer term 6% to 8% local currency sales growth target, which I get is only about 5% to 7%, excluding typical 1% M&A, that's on a top-line?","And then the second question I had was on your inventory levels. I'm still just shocked that it's not improving. Your own inventory levels look like they're up about 20% year-on-year, and I guess I'm kind of disappointed and surprised, given SAP is now in place and you should see some improvement, and hopefully it generates more cash flow there. So thanks on those two questions.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","All right. Thanks, Ali. I'll start, and perhaps Fabrizio will join in. And the two questions are actually related, right? In terms of why we're not seeing some of the improvement that we had expected to see this year in terms of inventory. So our underlying business, if you exclude Kilian and Too Faced and BECCA, is more in the 4% to 5% range. So you're correct with your math. And that is for the reasons that we shared in our press release and in our prepared remarks. We are seeing some pretty strong challenges here in the U.S. in mid-tier department stores. The Middle East, which is a very \u2013 has historically been a very strong growth and profit market for us, is challenged, and we've talked about Hong Kong now for the last couple of years. So those are the primary drivers.","We expected a bit of a different mix in terms of the business, so that has left us with some higher inventory levels in some of our brands. In other brands, we've actually had to chase inventory, because they are growing faster than we expected, like Tom Ford and Jo Malone and some of those brands. And we're managing all of that, obviously, to deliver the results that we shared with you this morning.","We are still committed, certainly, to leveraging SAP. It has helped us tremendously as the portfolio has become broader and more complex, to manage in more volatile time. So thank goodness we have SAP and we, along with our supply chain and business partners, can manage the different flows of inventory as situations change around the globe. But we are still committed to the levels of inventory management that we have shared with you at the end of our year last year, as we gave our three-year guidance. And we'll certainly update that in August.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","And I just would like to add one thing on the top-line, which is \u2013 yeah, 4% to 5% organic plus acquisition is what we see today. And actually, all what we are doing in terms of action is to improve the ability of all of these elements to grow faster in the future. Meaning the organic is \u2013 the good news, there are so many very strong drivers of growth within the current organic travel retail. China gains, stabilization of Hong Kong, continue of online, and they're all accretive in term of margin. So the organic, with the activity that we are doing and with actually \u2013 with the decrease of the department store in the U.S., which is, at this point, the most disappointing performance as part of our portfolio, this part is decreasing as a percentage of business. What is increasing as a percentage of business are all the fast-growing channels and fast-growing activity.","So the 4% to 5% can become stronger over time and not weaker, plus the acquisition. Now the acquisitions are doing fantastic. We acquired great brands, both this concept of artisanal high-end fragrances, which as I said in my prepared remarks, altogether growing more than 30% and the new acquisitions like Too Faced, the BECCA which have high growth brand into high growth channels. So the mix of improving our organics with a new change of mix and adapting to the new reality and the strong acquisition actually aims to reinforce our growth potential rather than dilute it.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","And then the only other thing I'll add, Ali, to Fabrizio's remarks is back to inventory, just remember that in Q2, we also have included the inventory from our new acquisition, mainly Too Faced.","Operator","Your next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I have a question on M\u2022A\u2022C. It seems that much of the brand softness in the U.S. has been due to issues that have been outside your control like weak tourist volumes and weak traffic at mid-tier department stores. So, first, would you agree with that point? And then second, in terms of what's in your control, you did mention some success you've had with your social media presence which is great, but curious how effective some of your promotions have been with M\u2022A\u2022C and whether you've had success in attracting new consumers to the brand.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So, no, I frankly disagree that over what's happening on M\u2022A\u2022C is out of our control. There are two things which is happening on M\u2022A\u2022C One, which is a soft traffic in the distribution where M\u2022A\u2022C is present and we need to correct that over time. And so it's kind of in our control. We can correct that. And second, if M\u2022A\u2022C had to make improvements in the social media activity penetration and we are making these improvements. And this is in our control and it's an area that we could do better. We are doing better as I explained and we'll continue to do even better. And the third part is marketing programs. M\u2022A\u2022C quality of collection, quality of innovation will need to improve and continue to improve in the U.S. and we are working on it and some of the things have been already visible in quarter two and more to come in the next quarter.","So it's not only a distribution adjustment, it's also a consumer engagement opportunity and also an innovation programs opportunities and we are addressing all of these three. Then I want to add that on M\u2022A\u2022C we are also working on new freestanding store formats that will address the ability to have freestanding store also in lower productivity situation while low tourist traffic because they will be smaller, more connected online, more engaging for consumers and more profitable.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Just I had a question on the gross margin line. The gross margins came in a little bit light compared to our expectations. Can you help us understand the key drivers for the decline and what your expectations are for the back half of the year?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Sure. So as I indicated in my prepared remarks, gross margin was impacted by some obsolescence. Product mix and in particular some of the programs that we have introduced this year have been a bit higher cost than prior programs so that has impacted our gross margin this year. And then there is some geographic mix in there as well and channel mix, so we have a lot of mix components. And then the last component is currency, so currency in terms of the transaction impact of currency has negatively impacted cost of goods this year and certainly that's what we had anticipated.","In terms of the back half of the year, we still expect to have some gross margin pressure on as it relates to some of the higher cost programs. However, as Fabrizio indicated and as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we do have incremental pricing that we've taken in the second half of the year, so that will help mitigate some of that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Tracey, just to follow-up on your previous comment regarding price increases, if you could just give us some sense of historically how effective those have been and if we should think about it as an effective mix or if it's like-for-like pricing? And then as a counterbalance, how you're thinking about using discounts and promotion to drive conversion even on higher pricing if that's the thing we should think about? Does it give you a little bit more flexibility to use some promotional tactics?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah, no, great question. So our pricing historically has been a combination of mix and like-for-like pricing. I would say probably a little bit more like-for-like than mix although I indicated obviously that we have introduced some higher cost programs which obviously have higher prices in both last year as well as this year. In terms of promotional activity, that's something that we have certain of our brands that have embedded within their operating model, promotions like Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique and the gift with product promotions that they do.","And in certain situations where the environment during certain times of the year becomes more promotional, we have the flexibility within our model to react and respond. And certainly, the U.S. is one of the places where around holiday, it has become more promotional and some of our brands have reacted and responded to that. And then the last place that we will use promotion is in a situation where we do have higher inventory levels with certain brands, and you might see some very short-term promotional activity to liquidate that inventory. So those are primarily the areas we use promotion.","Sets have always been a part of our business, particularly in travel retail, and that's a form of value to the consumer. But by and large, we are not a heavy promotion company, and so we certainly use advertising and digital and social media now to drive traffic with the innovation of our products and the innovation of our marketing campaigns.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","And the only thing I would like to add is that in a moment of evolution where consumers are really sensitive to innovation and to trying new products, one of the area of promotion where we are investing more is sampling. And we really are learning more and more how to make samplings very effective, also models that we call paid samplings which are very effective way to do sampling. So we are increasing sampling. And thanks to this, we are increasing the trial level of our new innovations.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, great. Thanks. So clearly, the 5% to 6% underlying growth that you're guiding to is still impressive versus what we've heard from other companies, but it is below the level you seemed confident in a few months ago, even while Q2 came in more or less along with expectations. So can you just help us better frame where that one muted outlook over the second half of the year is coming from because it doesn't look like your market expectations have changed all that much? You seem muted on department stores in the Middle East coming into the quarter, et cetera.","And then secondly on expense control, which you've talked a little bit about. It looks as though your EPS guidance now reflects the higher FX headwinds that you called out plus the Too Faced solution and nothing else, despite that underlying top-line growth reduction of 200 basis points or so in the back half. So if that's correct, that implies a good deal of expense control to absorb the lower top line. And I know you \u2013 probably you alluded this in your prepared remarks, but could you or Tracey just provide more color on where that \u2013 where spending levels have been reduced relative to the October outlook? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Sure. I will \u2013 let me start from the growth. So we see the market 4% to 5%. Our goal \u2013 our, say, high-end goal has always been to grow at least 1 point more than market, meaning to continue growing market share. And we are delivering that and we believe we'll continue to deliver that in the long-term.","Now to explain the detail of what happened. In reality, we are taking the estimate down 1%. That's what's happening, and we are obviously still deliver 6% to 7% thanks to Too Faced. But there is 1% less expected growth than there were before Too Faced. Now where this comes from and why we believe will accelerate in the second half. This comes from mid-tier department stores in the U.S. that did less than what we expected originally and comes from the Middle East, emerging markets mainly. Middle East, that was really tough, and Turkey.","Turkey was a super high growth market for us and a very unfortunate event of the quarter two make Turkey grow much less than what we were expecting. And so this is what was the 1% less. But on the other side, there were many things that continue to do well actually that did even better than what we expected. So for example, the improvements in Asia particularly in China are even better than expected. The trend stabilization of Hong Kong is very good news. The continued success of Korea is really amazing, and this has huge implication for travel retail. Frankly, the super high growth of travel retail, which show how our strategy is working is even better than what we could have anticipated.","And the online continue to be very strong. So at the end, the net of this is that many of our engines of growth are getting better and better. Two of the things that took us down in the past, Middle East and Hong Kong are stabilizing, and the issue remains mid-tier department store U.S. where we do not anticipate a lot of improvements in this quarter, and that's what is the result.","Of our estimate, you need to add to this that our acquisitions are very strong and they could do very well and even better, and so that's the other element of strength that we are adding to the second semester in our ability to deliver our goals.","Now, Tracey, on the EPS?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yes, and so on the expenses, as I spoke previously, one of the things that we have done certainly is try to ramp up our cost saving programs in light of some of the softness we're seeing in some parts of the business. So some of the planned expenses that we had had in some parts of the business we have certainly pulled back on. We have cut back on travel, we have cut back on some of the consulting projects that we had planned to do this year that have been cancelled, and some of the hiring in certain areas that we had expected to do. So those are the primary areas that we've addressed in terms of expense management.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning, and thank you. I'm wondering what your advertising and marketing spend looked like year-over-year and as a percentage of sales, and if you can just help us think through the third and fourth quarter as to how that might flow? And do you see year-over-year maybe a decline in the fourth quarter?","And the other question is around this gross margin, just the risk that has peaked given that a lot of your growth is coming from more extensive input and that you're driving sampling and so on. I'm just wondering if \u2013 we seem to have been missing margin goals for a number of reasons. I don't how much of that is currency and how much is just the change in portfolio?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Okay.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So probably I could (52:06) start and say our absolute advertising spending is going to be more or less stable across the year and will be \u2013 is assumed to be a bit stronger actually in the second six months, so in the six months we have in front of us, particularly in the third quarter because of innovation launches and activities.","In terms of percentage of sales, so we'll slightly down in the year and this percentage is driven also by mix, meaning our advertised \u2013 or more advertised brands, I should say our traditionally advertised brands are becoming a lower percentage of our total business and our brands which are supported by different tools from social media to sampling and to others like in store activities are becoming a bigger percentage of the business. Because of that, you should assume an overall stability for the next months of our absolute investment, and a slight reduction of percentage of sales.","In gross margin, Tracey, you want to comment on that?","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah, so in terms of gross margin, Caroline, as you know, and clearly we talked about some of the factors that are driving it this year, but you're right, the last couple of years, it's been relatively flat. That happens to correspond with a mix shift in terms of the significant growth of makeup and fragrance, and the slowdown in skin care. So we do have different gross profit margins depending on the category.","We do also have certain of our cost activities that are targeted against cost of goods, and we do expect that that will continue over the next couple of years. And again, clearly, if the skin care mix picks up, that will also help gross profit margin. So I do think we can see, and we do expect to see, some increase in gross profit margin, but as long as makeup and fragrance are driving the best growth from a category standpoint, it will be somewhat suppressed.","Operator","Your next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for \u2013 thanks for the question. I'm going to try to jam two in here. First, sort of a follow-up to the margin questions, or maybe it's a follow-up to Steve Powers' sort of flow through question.","Fabrizio, in your answer to Steve's question, it sounded to me like you were saying there's also a mix shift by channel happening, so while you're getting slower growth, your slower growth is in lower margin channels, your faster growth is in higher margin channels, and this is helping to mitigate the bottom line impact of the slower top-line growth. So question one, is that a reasonable interpretation?","And then second question, back to sustainability of top-line, 4% to 5%, we hear you on that sort of underlying. You've done 3.5% in the first half, on average. You're guiding to 3.5% to 4% in the third quarter and your full year guide implies something in the 6% to 8% range by the time we get to the fourth quarter. So how do we get comfort in the pace of acceleration, and should we view even the slightly lowered guide as still carrying a degree of risk? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So on the first question, the answer is yes. The evolution of our channel mix is accretive. But not only to margin, it's also accretive to growth potential, because we are swinging a bigger percentage of our business into higher growth channels, from what we see. So there is a positive margin and positive growth. And to your point, to your second question, I think \u2013 I believe I already explained. The key thing is that the key area of acceleration are pricing. We had pricing in January, which had about 2 points of acceleration. We had a lot of new \u2013 particularly for new brands \u2013 new distribution opportunities which are planned to start being impacting the business in the second semester, and there are 2, 3 points that will come out of new distribution.","And this new distribution, I do mean \u2013 new distribution, for example, Tom Ford, Jo Malone in new countries, new cities. So it's not cannibalizing distribution, it's really coverage of consumer. That's why we call it consumer coverage opportunities. Plus, this includes some of the mix acceleration, meaning the moment Est\u00e9e Lauder brand successfully built doors in ULTA, and they were very well, these automatically create more distribution which grows better. So there is more of this in the second semester. Then there is strong organic growth, the innovation that is working, as we have explained our prepared remark, will now continue to impact and grow in multiple areas.","I believe the good news is that skin care is growing again and is adding this engine \u2013 and the other good news is that the engine we just created with these fragrances \u2013 high-end fragrances \u2013 continue to grow (57:51) very well, and we continue to accelerate growth on a higher base.","Plus, as I explained, Middle East and Hong Kong , they've been two negatives in the first six months, should be better in the second six months. And finally, the base is lower, frankly, particularly in quarter four. The base is lower, and so we believe that the combination of these things will bring our organic growth to the level that we are estimating. On top of that, the new acquisitions, Too Faced and BECCA, are doing very well, so \u2013 and we believe they will add the very significant sense of comfort to the ability to deliver the right growth, and by the way, this will continue into next fiscal year.","Operator","We have time for one more question from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Just following up on that, I mean I think \u2013 this is two quarters in a row where you've come in at the low end of your guidance, and yet some of your peers are saying the market's improved. And so I'm wondering, number one, what your commentary is on that. Do you think you have the right forecasting ability et cetera, et cetera, just to boost our confidence, if you will, in terms of the guide for the back half?","The other question I had, Tracey, you've talked in the past about the point of, as you expand into specialty-multi, there is a risk that the productivity of your doors or your counters in department stores will drop and I'm wondering if, in the U.S., you are seeing that as you expand distribution, as you open up more of your own freestanding stores. Are you facing a problem at some of the mid-tier department stores, and is that putting pressure on your growth? Thanks.","Tracey Thomas Travis - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","So let me start with the second question, Wendy. One of the things that our team is very careful about is the doors that we do open in specialty-multi and the distance they are from certain department stores. So we do look at the impact of cannibalization of doors and we haven't seen it. When we look at whether it's Clinique's performance or whether we look at Est\u00e9e Lauder, which is now starting to perform or expand in ULTA as Fabrizio said. We're not seeing that cannibalization. The net of the double points of distribution if you will are accretive and are growth for the brands.","One of the things that and we have talked about in the past, Wendy, is that there is a shift in the retail landscape obviously in the U.S. where there is space being taken out of department stores that are closing doors and obviously we are working with them and managing to try to shift that business to online or to other department store doors. But then our specialty customers like Sephora and ULTA are adding doors every year and so we are adding our brands in those doors as well as they expand. And that's a shift I think we'll see for the next couple of years in the U.S. It's driven by consumer and consumer traffic patterns. It's certainly not driven by any of the actions that we're taking with respect to our business.","If anything, we're trying to be where our consumers are shopping and they're shopping in multiple points of distribution. So I think what we're seeing and how we're managing it is the right way to go for both parts of our business. But, painful at least here in the near-term this year.","Fabrizio Freda - Estee Lauder Cos., Inc.","Yeah. And going back to the first part of the question is, yeah, we came at the low end of the guidance, but the guidance has a high end and a low end, so I would now conclude is that we have issues forecasting. The issue is the one I explained. The issue is that versus our competition. We are absolutely overexposed to mid-tier department stores in the U.S. particularly. And this very high exposure and we have been obviously hit harder than others on the soft traffic that this channel has experienced in the last year. And that's why we are trying to react to. We are trying to continue to diversify our business globally in order to be able not to be over-dependent by any channel, any country, any brand.","And to have such a well diversified portfolio that we can deliver our 1 point ahead of market or more growth independently from any other area of the business or any specific area of the business. So frankly I'm very proud how we are pivoting the company in terms of online, TR, specialty-multi distribution, how we are pivoting the company in terms of social media versus historical or traditional way to engage the consumers, how we are pivoting the company to penetrate the makeup boom in a very aggressive way, how we are pivoting the company to split up and change our innovation models. We are pivoting and we are pivoting while continue to be one of the fastest growth companies in the consumer industry.","I personally am very proud of my team in the way we are managing this. although we do recognize that we were at the low end of our estimate and we are overexposed to the soft and usual mid-tier department store in the U.S.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.

And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.","Fabrizio Freda","Thank you Rainey and good morning everyone. We delivered another outstanding performance in fiscal year 2019 as our strategy based on multiple engine of growth continued to be a winning model. We have created more investment opportunities and improved our ability to quickly reallocate resources among different growth engines. Improved data analytics combined with our long-standing creativity fueled our successful product innovation and digital marketing which led to double-digit gains in net sales and adjusted earnings per share in all four quarters. For the year sales grew 12% once again above the rate of Global Prestige Beauty further strengthening our industry leadership. EPS climbed 21%, our second consecutive year of EPS growth over 20%. ","We finished the year with strong fourth quarter results driven largely by the same geographies, brands, and channels that fueled our performance in the previous quarters. We also had a modest improvement in trend in our U.S. business despite a tough environment. In fiscal 2020 we expect another year of strong above industry sales growth, margin expansion, and double-digit EPS gains. We believe Global Prestige Beauty will remain one of the most exciting consumer product areas driven by strong demographic trends and desirable products and we will remain completely focused on this sector. Our performance was not worthy considering the volatility and challenges in some of our most important markets. As you know they included trade tensions, uncertainty surrounding BREXIT in the UK, a difficult environment in North America with increased competition and slowing beauty sales overall, and certain department store challenges both in the U.S. and the UK.","Thanks to excellent execution our talented employees worldwide managed through this environment to deliver strong results. Our broad based gains reflect diverse growth drivers, the desirability of our high quality products, compelling marketing, and innovation successes. In fiscal 2019 we continued to execute against our strategic priorities which powered our highest sales. Our skin care category was outstanding across brands, markets, and channels. The growing number of middle class consumers in China and other emerging markets embraced Prestige Beauty and they were avid users of our brands. We prioritize the investment in the fastest growing channels and Travel Retail and online continue to grow strong double-digits. Our direct to consumer business accelerated. Sales from new product innovation reached an all time high and our digital marketing and social media activations were highly effective. In addition our sales growth was supported by more than 380 million of cost savings and our Leading Beauty Forward initiative enabled us to invest more in advertising and other brands building areas. Tracey will give more details about this initiative in a few minutes. ","Now I will highlight some of the factors that drove our improvements. Our 10 year compass forecasted continuing strong demand for skin care and we matched our innovations to the biggest opportunities across consumer segments and channels. One of our strategic priorities is to reach a wider range of consumers and several skincare launches including Clinique iD, attracted younger and more diverse shoppers. Our brands also attracted more diverse consumers through elevated marketing. Our Est\u00e9e Lauder brand created locally relevant bilingual communications to attract Latina consumers in key U.S. markets. During one such campaign for the brand's revitalizing supreme plus moisturizer sales to Latina consumers rose significantly and led to a 35% jump in sales for that product. ","Looking at our geographies our strategy of serving the growing middle class in many emerging markets with locally relevant products was highly successful. Sales rose in virtually all of our emerging markets worldwide led by China, India, the Middle East, including Turkey and Southeast Asia countries. And as a group they grew over 30%. Our growth in China was outstanding. All categories and channels grew and virtually all brands posted double-digit gains. Our online sales rose significantly in China and we introduced our Tom Ford Beauty and Jo Malone London brands on TMall. Tom Ford was our biggest launch to date on the platform. ","We continued to expand our business in the fastest growing channels during calendar 2018, our company became number one in Prestige Beauty in Travel Retail worldwide. And throughout fiscal 2019 we had broad based growth across our top brands, regions, and categories in the channel. Growth was primarily driven by robust like doors gains and expanded targeted reach also contributed. The Pretail business where passengers can order products online and pick them up at the airport upon their departures or return has taken off strongly. Pretail is centered in Asia for now but is expected to grow worldwide. ","Our online growth was also broad-based and as brand sites, retailer sites, and third party sites all grew double-digits. We increased our brand presence on select third party malls and sites and our brands enter new markets. The priority of our online business comes from our three largest markets the U.S., China, and the UK. However in total our smaller online markets had become an increasing meaningful contributor to growth. Our online sales in countries such as Spain or Greece, Israel and India are expanding rapidly and hold great promise for the future. Our online sales grew at least double-digit in everyone of the approximately 50 markets where we have by now e-commerce operations. ","Our brand sites are more than a platform to sell products. They are valuable media properties. They collectively attracted this year more than 400 million visits allowing our brands to engage with consumer through rich storytelling, elevated assets, and high touch experiences. This builds equity and loyalty which creates value that extends to sales in other channels. Data driven marketing will make these sites even more compelling as we tailor our messages to different consumers. Our brand sites together with third party platform and our freestanding stores in brick and mortar comprise our direct to consumer business which rose sharply. The three channels combined had approximately 1.3 billion visits last year and we are leveraging them as equity building platforms. ","Our product innovation was powered by capabilities we have developed in data analytics and consumer insights. Combining data with our creative process resulted in terrific innovation success. Our new product launches reached a record penetration, about one third of net sales. In addition the number of success launches increased as did our speed to market. Our innovation was focused on bigger, more impactful products in large part supporting our hero franchises. We continue to focus our advertising spending on digital marketing and social media to strengthen brand equity, drive repeat purchase, and generate trial. Digital now comprises nearly 75% of our media spend, it was highly expected. For example, in China the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand was ranked a genius brand for the third straight year and La Mer was number one in global engagement in luxury skincare. ","By making progress across our strategic priorities we drove higher sales throughout our portfolio. For the year brands represent more than 80% of our total net sales posted increases as they attracted new consumers and improved retention rates. Three of our four largest brands each with sales well over $1 billion grew strongly globally. Fueled by its popular hero franchises our largest brand Est\u00e9e Lauder had terrific success. Our sales rose more than 20% for the second year in a row with double-digit gains in skincare and makeup. It posted highest sales in all regions additionally all channels. La Mer products and digital communication attracted many new consumers. It generated double-digit growth in every region. In Asia Pacific it was the fastest growing top 10 brands in Prestige Beauty. Strong innovation in product and marketing accelerated Mac's global growth and its makeup offsetting were particularly well-received in Travel Retail and all over in Asia. Clinique focused its innovation on moisturizers, a high usage and high loyalty subcategory which drove the brand skincare business higher in every region. ","Two key launches where Clinique iD a breakthrough innovation that led consumer customize their moisturizer and Moisture Surge Eye Concentrate which helps the Moisture Surge franchise grow very strongly. We also strengthen our portfolio of small and mid-sized brands and our luxury brands resonated strongly. By focusing on developing high quality products, communicating our brands authenticity, and strengthening our repeat purchases rates. We successfully scaled our brands and added $1.2 billion in incremental sales to the top line. Strong demand enable us to raise prices across our portfolio which contributed two percentage points of sales growth. ","During the year we also committed to delivering greater value through our citizenship and sustainability programs. We announced new goals at our Investor Day and are continuing to incorporate our efforts throughout our brands, regions, and functions, as well as on corporate level. Recently we added a Corporate Responsibility Scorecard on our website to track our initiatives. We have been recognized for our achievements including being named number one on Forbes list of the best employers for women and included in Barron's top 100 sustainable companies. We celebrated 25 years of Mac Viva Glam campaign which has cumulatively raised that 500 million to help people with AIDS and HIV in more than 100 countries. ","Finally with our strong cash position and financial success we raised the dividends by double-digits for the tenth consecutive year. Fiscal year 2019 was a fantastic year yet even more significant is the progress we have made since we launched our current strategy a decade ago. Let me recap some of our key accomplishments. Since 2009 our net sales more than doubled from 7 billion to nearly 15 billion rising on average 8% a year which is the top of our long-term goal. EPS growth averaged 21% two and a half times our sales growth. Our share of Global Prestige Beauty reached 15.3% up 2.3 points making us the clear global leader. Our total shareholder return topped 1100%. Total cash returned to stockholders exceeded 10.5 billion and cash flow from operations skyrocketed from 700 million to 2.5 billion. ","In addition to these financial results we further diversified our business and built a more flexible financial model. We developed processes to drive more collaborative teamwork and invested in human capital including recruiting external talent to bring fresh perspectives. Our workplace is now more diverse and inclusive and we amplified our family values. These changes have created a more streamlined integrated organization and a stronger foundation that we believe will enable us to continue our growth trajectory. As we start fiscal year 2020 we are continuing to adapt our strategy to reflect a continuously changing environment. We plan to fuel our strengths in the brands, categories, channels, and geographies that are performing well, accelerate growth in areas that are underperforming to turn them around and with the guidance of our compass and utilizing data and technology anticipate new opportunities and trends as they emerge and act on them quickly. ","Our over arching goal is to reach diverse global consumers of all ages and reinforce our connection with loyal users. To do this we will prioritize growth in the emerging markets and fast growing channels, strengthen our hero franchises, and create new ones, engage through our social media, and reach digital assets and expand our omnichannel capability to seamlessly connect our online and offline businesses. In addition we are striving to stabilize our North America business despite the current soft environment. We believe our creativity and innovation will continue to attract and retain consumers. Our innovation program is focused on expanding our hero franchises across our categories. In our largest one skincare some new products include Clinique Smart Clinical MD a moisturizer that visibly risk out and revolumize and a reset concentrate in Est\u00e9e Lauder advanced retail line. The luxury segment in skin care is among the fastest growing which is why our high end Tom Ford beauty brands is launching its skincare collection to complement its very popular makeup and fragrance lines. And La Mer is launching a Neck and D\u00e9collet\u00e9 Concentrate and updating the regenerating serum. ","We expect continued strong growth in China and in other emerging markets including India, Turkey, Southeast Asia as we tap into the growing middle class with our desirable brands. We will expand online in these markets to reach consumers who don't have brick and mortar distribution options and offer more locally relevant products. We believe China's growth will remain strong although we expect some deceleration from the rapid pace of the last two years. But as China's growth moderates we expect other emerging markets to contribute more. Likewise we expect our Travel Retail business to continue to be a growth catalyst. But we are anticipating our growth rate to moderate. We also are intent on turning around the parts of our business that aren\u2019t performing to our expectations. Prestige Beauty in North America and the UK remains somewhat soft especially makeup where we are a leader. That said we aim at improving our performance this year as we further rebalance our channel mix and win in key subcategories. We will build on our leadership position in Prestige Beauty by targeting a broader range of consumers within local areas and creating compelling campaigns. ","As we embark on the second decade of our strategy we are focused on winning today while at the same time continue transforming our business to lead in the future. Maintaining our leadership in such a dynamic industry requires constant reinvention which has been a hallmark of our company for decades. We are optimistic about the outlook for Prestige Beauty and foresee continued healthy growth, thanks to favorable demographic especially in emerging markets and a continued shift from Mac to Prestige. As the best diversified player in Prestige Beauty we are in a unique position to capture greater global share. Nonetheless we are confident that in the short-term economical, social, and geopolitical uncertainties could impact our results. ","In closing I want to thank our leadership team and our highly talented employees all over the world for delivering such a terrific year. Throughout our brands and function our employees excelled in their roles and successfully navigated difficult environments. These skills differentiate our company and our people to give us a competitive advantage. We are proud that we have much to celebrate but more importantly we are excited about our bright future ahead. Now I will turn the call over to Tracey. ","Tracey Travis","Thank you for Fabrizio and good morning everyone. As a reminder my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and now for the quarter results. Net sales for the fourth quarter rose 12% with strong growth in our international regions and growth across all product categories. We saw a continuation of the outstanding growth in China and Travel Retail that we saw throughout the year and North America improved slightly. Our Asia Pacific region continued its strong net sales growth this quarter up 23% with all product categories rising double-digits. Nearly all markets grew and more than half of the markets grew double-digit. Regarding China, the continuation of robust growth reflects the superb execution of new innovation along with strong digital advertising campaigns. Nearly every brand rose strong double-digits in China as did all channels. Among the other large markets in the region Hong Kong rose double-digits and both Japan and Korea rose mid-single-digits. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region rose 20% led by a strong double-digit increase in global Travel Retail. International passenger traffic remains strong particularly in Asia and our travel themed collections sold particularly well. The EMEA region also benefited from strong growth in emerging markets led by Russia, Turkey, and India.","The Middle East rose sharply following an inventory rebalancing in the prior year quarter. Growth in Western European markets was mixed. Increases in Italy, Greece, and France were partially offset by modest declines in the UK and Benelux. Net sales in the Americas declined 4% reflecting a slight improvement in North America trend compared to our prior third quarter. Prestige Beauty overall in North America continued to be soft particularly in the makeup category. We achieved double-digit net sales growth online with contributions from both retailer and brand sites but we're challenged in brick and mortar retail. Latin America's net sales declined as growth in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru was more than offset by declines in Mexico, Chile, and Venezuela. ","Skincare again led product category growth this quarter. Net sales grew 19% with continued strong increases from the Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer brands globally. Est\u00e9e Lauder sales were driven by success in our hero franchises notably advanced night repair, nutritious, perfectionist, and micro essence where the franchise benefited from the launch of its micro essence with Sakura Ferment in Asia. La Mer had success from the relaunch of the concentrate and garnered increased awareness through its global Blue Heart campaign supporting clean oceans. Net sales in makeup grew 8% led by strong demand in Asia and Travel Retail. Many brands contributed to growth particularly Tom Ford beauty, Mac, and Too Faced. ","Tom Ford lips and eye makeup drove growth and the brand launched a Cushion Compact Foundation in China supporting foundation as another strong pillar of growth for the Tom Ford brand. Tom Ford Beauty's recent launch on TMall also contributed to make up growth. Mac resonated well across Asia, several EMEA markets and Travel Retail and grew sharply in the Middle East due largely to anniversarying in inventory reset in the prior year quarter. Too Faced growth was broad based geographically driven by the successful launch of Damn Girl Mascara. The brand also continued its global expansion adding Doors and Travel Retail in Hong Kong during the quarter. Fragrance net sales rose 3%. Higher sales of Tom Ford, Jo Malone, and Lullaby Fragrances were partially offset by declines in certain designer brand fragrances. Tom Ford signature fragrances maintained good momentum. Jo Malone London launched Frangipani Fragrance with its blossom collection and Lullaby continued to selectively expand its global reach while maintaining strong like door growth. ","Our hair care sales rose -- net sales rose 1%. Higher net sales from Aveda Shampure, rosemary mint, and cherry almond lines select new doors in Italy and strong growth online were mostly offset by soft U.S. sales from Bumble and Bumble. Our gross margin decreased 230 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year and increased 10 basis points excluding the change in accounting. Favorable pricing and mix impacts were mostly offset by higher obsolescence and shipping costs to support the strong growth in Asia. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 240 basis points or 50 basis points excluding the impact of the new accounting standard. Increases in advertising to support new initiatives were more than offset by savings and selling in-store operations. ","Operating income rose 10% and operating margin increased by 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of a new accounting standard, operating income rose 17% and operating margin improved by 60 basis points. This was achieved even while making strategic investments to support a strong start to fiscal 2020. Diluted EPS of $0.64 increased 5% compared to the prior year and grew 8% in constant currency. Earnings per share for the quarter included $0.02 of unfavorable currency translation. Diluted EPS excluding the impact of the accounting change was $0.68, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year or 15% in constant currency. ","So that concludes remarks regarding our fourth quarter. Let me now discuss a few highlights of our full year results. Net sales were 12% in constant currency. Growth was broad based as you have heard from Fabrizio. Aside from the diverse growth by brand, market, and product category our sales in virtually all channels grew. Travel Retail and online continued to deliver strong double-digit growth further diversifying our overall distribution mix. These channels now represent 23% and 15% of sales respectively. Department stores globally represent 35% of sales today with North America department stores now 13% of our global sales mix. ","Our gross margin declined 200 basis points to 77.4% but rose 10 basis points excluding the impact of the accounting change. Favorable pricing and mix were partially offset by increased obsolescence. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 300 basis points or 70 basis points excluding the impact of the accounting change. Significant savings and efficiencies in our selling model allowed us to increase digital advertising, social media, and influencer outreach. Our full year operating margin rose 90 basis points to 17.5%. This margin included 20 basis points of favorable impact from the accounting change offset by 20 basis points of dilution from currency translation. Our Leading Beauty Forward initiative and ongoing cost savings initiatives contributed more than 380 million in savings which fueled the strategic investments that will support our future growth.","We have continued to create more flexibility in our cost structure to reinvest in areas that support profitable growth, mitigate risk, and deliver margin expansion through greater leverage of our cost base. Our effective tax rate for the year was 21.5%, an improvement of 80 basis points over the prior year primarily driven by the lower U.S. statutory rate. Net earnings grew 17% to $2 billion and diluted EPS rose 18% to $5.34. Earnings per share was negatively impacted by $0.19 from currency translation and positively impacted by $0.04 from the accounting change. Excluding both of these items earnings per share rose 21% for the year. ","In fiscal 2019 we recorded approximately $190 million after tax or $0.51 per share in restructuring and other charges for our Leading Beauty Forward initiatives. As of June 30th we concluded the approval of all major initiatives under the program and we expect to substantially complete all of them by the end of fiscal 2021. We now expect to incur charges of between 950 million and 990 million before taxes and achieve annual net benefits of between 425 million and 475 million before taxes. Leading Beauty Forward has been an unqualified success. The scope of the program grew over time to approximately 70 initiatives and encompassed most of the organization. Some examples of the transformation achieved by Leading Beauty Forward include improved global customer care that leverages new technology and enhance customer data to deliver a seamless cross-channel brand experience and more personalized care, integrated shared services across the business through our One Source Service Center. ","One Source delivers a suite of services across H.R., legal, finance, and point of sale support.

New centers of excellence together with new tools enable our field teams to spend more time in store to drive sales and coach talent and expanding indirect procurement efforts to new categories of spending and using enhanced technology to accelerate our savings opportunities. These are just a few of the key wins to date and they are not only producing expense savings but changing the way we work to drive sales and improve the customer experience.","Moving on to cash flows, cash generated from operations was slightly below last year at 2.5 billion reflecting our earnings growth and offset by higher inventory to support the rapid growth and longer lead time international markets, the timing of other working capital components and higher cash paid for taxes. We utilize 744 million for capital improvements primarily for consumer facing counters, gondolas, and e-commerce support as well as supply chain improvements in IT. We return cash to stockholders at an accelerated pace. We repurchased 11 million shares of our stock for 1.6 billion twice as much as the prior year. We paid 609 million in dividends reflecting a 13% increase in our dividend rate. So as Fabrizio said, we are obviously pleased and proud of our fiscal 2019 results and the momentum our overall business has throughout the year.","Looking ahead to our expectations over the next few years, Global Prestige Beauty has been exceptional in recent years and we expect it to rise again in the range of 6% to 7% annually over the next few years driven by a growing middle class globally with increasing disposable incomes. Our net sales goal is to grow 6% to 8% annually with possibly 1% of the growth over three years coming from acquisitions. Over the next three years we continued to target average annual margin improvement of approximately 50 basis points and double-digit EPS growth. ","Now let's take a look at our expectations for fiscal 2020 full year and first quarter. As we enter our fiscal 2020 we must consider the escalating macro issues that could have an impact on our business. The ongoing tension and unresolved trading terms between the U.S. and China, the looming concern and consequences of a hard BREXIT in October, and recent protests in Hong Kong and other markets are all examples of factors that could impact our fiscal 2020 results. For the year, net sales are forecasted to grow 7% to 8% in constant currency at the upper end of our long-term goal of 6% to 8%. Pricing is expected to contribute approximately two points to growth, expanded targeted consumer reach is expected to add two to three points of growth, and the strength of our existing business will account for the remainder. ","Strong growth in Travel Retail in China is expected to continue yet moderate as we anniversary two years of extraordinary growth and with the increasing macro and geopolitical uncertainty. We also aim to stabilize the brands and regions that were more challenging in fiscal 2019 and position them for future growth. All product categories are expected to grow again with greater balance and growth among the categories. Based on June 28th spot rates of 1.14 for the euro, 1.27 for the pound, and 6.88 for Yuan we expect currency translation to have a negligible impact on reported sales for the full fiscal year. This will obviously change if the currency markets becomes more volatile. We expect to deliver productivity savings of between 2% and 2.5% of sales including benefits from Leading Beauty Forward and our ongoing cost containment efforts. These savings give us the flexibility to invest more in digital marketing and advertising to support innovation, recruit new consumers, and drive brand awareness as we expand our developing brands into new markets and focus more heavily on emerging markets outside of China. ","With the leverage from strong top line growth and our ongoing cost saving programs we are well positioned to make needed investments for the future while also delivering margin expansion. We estimate that the fiscal 2020 effective tax rate will be approximately 23%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $5.90 and $5.98 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.05 of accretion from currency translation. In constant currency we expect EPS to rise by 9% to 11%. In fiscal 2020 we expect cash flow from operations of approximately 2.7 billion and capital expenditures of approximately 900 million or 5% to 6% of sales as we invest more in our supply chain, enable enhanced consumer experiences, and invest in facilities to optimize our workspaces. Our sales in the first quarter are expected to rise 9% to 10% both as reported and in constant currency. We expect first quarter EPS of $1.56 to $1.59 including a penny of accretion from currency translation. EPS growth in constant currency is forecast to rise by 10% to 12% for the first quarter. ","In closing while we are cautious about the increased macro tensions we remain confident about the continued momentum behind Global Prestige Beauty and our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives. We continue to create increased flexibility in our expense base, to invest behind the greatest opportunities we have, to continue to drive long-term sustainable growth. The flexibility in our P&L and our increasing cash flow generation also position as well to navigate a more volatile environment. And with that I'll conclude our prepared remarks and we'll be happy to take your questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Wendy Nicholson from Citi Group. Your line is open.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi, good morning. I guess my question has to do with the U.S. business specifically. Everything else is just going so great, but it just seems that that business is stubborn in terms of turning around and growing for you. So I guess number one specifically in your guidance for full year 2020, what are you expecting, what's baked in to your outlook for the U.S. business specifically, and what do you think it takes to get growth not just for you but the category overall, are you taking too much pricing, is there too much competition, and you need to buy a bunch of smaller brands, do you need to exit more department stores, what do you think fixes the problem there? Thank you.","Tracey Travis","Okay, Wendy, so I'll start in terms of what's included in our guidance and I'll let Fabrizio speak about what we're doing to improve the North American business. So in terms of our guidance we are expecting a slight improvement from fiscal 2019 in terms of North America. Remember that part of the challenge we had in North America in fiscal 2019 was the closure of Bon-Ton so that certainly cost us about a point of growth in North America. And we continued throughout the year to work on a number of different changes in our organization in order to position ourselves well for future growth. But it's obviously a pretty dynamic environment in North America given the soft traffic. So with that I'll turn it over to Fabrizio.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah, I think your question Wendy is what was the -- the issue is still that we have 50% of business in North America in a part of the market which is under pressure in terms of low traffic and declining business. And so what is happening is that this wing to the high growth areas is taking time, particularly it is taking time because the overall environment is very soft as you heard from everyone in North America. Just to give you an example, in our global Travel Retail business which is going fantastically well in Asia and in Europe is flat to declining in the U.S. So it is really the U.S. environment overall which is under pressure and that's why it is taking a bit more than what we wanted. So what we have in mind for fiscal year 2020 is stabilization of our business. We believe first of all we have seen some progress already in quarter four where we have started investing particularly on Mac and Clinique and we have seen some sequential improvement. ","Also I want to underline that the launch of Damn Girl of Too Faced in the U.S. make Too Faced grow nearly 30% in a very tough quarter for makeup in the country so showing the power of this brand. And there are many other positive sign. In the strategy we already explained in the past meaning our strategy to work more online which is growing by the way very well continue to build our specialty channel and obviously invest more in innovation which is specific to the subcategories which are relevant in the U.S. And we are doing this very well with some initial success. So in net I am very optimistic for the long-term ability to make U.S. again a growing business for us. But it will be good one day to be helped by less soft environment to accelerate the speed of that process. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good morning guys. So my question was around top line. First I guess just short-term, you highlighted the top line guidance for fiscal 2020 included a number of [external] [ph] risk factors in the U.S., UK, Hong Kong, and China. Yet you're still at the high end of your long term sales growth outlook. So I was just hoping you could parse out a bit more detail for what you've assumed along those risk factors given some of them looks like they could be sizable and perhaps directly comment on Hong Kong so far this quarter since that's played out to some extent? ","And then second from a longer term strategic standpoint on top line, we've clearly seen very strong growth rates from Prestige Beauty in China but a couple of years ago we had seen an acceleration in the U.S. Prestige Beauty market particularly in make up behind social media, e-commerce, sales, etc. Now that looks like it's rapidly dissipated. So I just love to get your view on sustainability of the key growth drivers of Prestige Beauty in China and understanding that U.S. is a very different market if that might have some application to China as you think about the growth rates longer-term? Thanks.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah, let me start answering the second question. I mean I think you made the point that the world of makeup and skincare I think is already volatile. Meaning that depending on consumer trends you could see growth in a certain category in another in a given market or in other. So the strengths of our strategy is exactly what we have defined as multiple engines abroad. So our ability to fast allocate resources and strengths to whatever is growing in a given moment. So when U.S. was growing strongly in makeup we leveraged that growth at that time with Mac particularly in the brands. Now we are leveraging the growth of skincare in Asia and as these trends will evolve gradually over the years we will be able to focus on the fastest growing growth elements. So that's exactly at the heart of our strategy and at the heart of our resource allocation strategy. Said that, the growth of skincare in Asia is here to stay for the long-term and again there could be moments of volatility here and there depending on the situation around the markets. But it is definitely a very strong long-term trend because Asian consumers are very heavy users of skincare. They're very interested in high quality products and most importantly the Asian consumer using skincare are much younger, and so each consumer you conquer in skin care in Asia has much higher life value than what happens in other markets of the world. That's why this is definitely a long-term trend. ","As far as the makeup situation in the U.S. the makeup situation is at the exclusion of makeup in the U.S. some years ago, it was also driven by the explosion of social media and by the enormous availability of how to do videos all of a sudden online [indiscernible] consumers. Now this phenomenon, its currently now has reached a plateau and stabilized. That's why now makeup will need to continue growing based on the historical trends by the way are the strongest strengths we have which is quality of product, quality [notation] [ph], and continuous brand building. So in summary I believe that the sustainability of the growth that you see is there and that's why we believe that that our 6% to 8% overall long-term growth is sustainable and will be sustainable for a long-term.","Tracey Travis","And I would just add Dara in terms of how to think about our guidance for the year, China and Travel Retail are expected to still grow double-digit, just not as strong a double-digit as they've grown in the last couple of years so again reflecting some moderation. The comfort that we have in guiding at the higher end of our range is recognizing now everything that Fabrizio just said in terms of the middle class and the growth of the middle class and the consumption behavior as it relates to Prestige Beauty. The fact that emerging markets now and faster growing channels are a higher percentage of penetration of our business, so we are benefiting more from the momentum of those markets and we are less exposed to some of the slower growth channels in particular than we have been historically. So yes, while a moderation is certainly the right guidance for us this year given everything that's going on in the environment, we're still very comfortable with a 7% to 8% top line growth. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy from Macquarie. Your line is open. ","Caroline Macquarie","Thank you so much. Good morning and congratulations on an exceptional decade Fabrizio and the team. You know despite everything that's been going in China and Hong Kong it's just unbelievable to see this mixed management that's just driving your business. And I'm wondering Fabrizio if you could help us understand some of the actions you're taking within China and Hong Kong to protect against any negative fallout from what's going on at a high level because it obviously looks a little out of control from this side but your Hong Kong data was phenomenal, everything looks great in your business, so just a little help on that would be great?","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah, I mean we are learning from what we see and how we manage reality. Let me give you Hong Kong examples. Hong Kong had another moment of protest and crises few years ago as you remember. In that moment coming out of the moment we realized that our Hong Kong business was a bit more disposed to tourists and not having enough high penetration on local. In the last year during the recovery of Hong Kong we had actually readjusted that. Today our business in Hong Kong which by the way Hong Kong including Travel Retail is less than 4% of our business globally at this point. This is also because of the strong growth of China and the others, that's the percentage today. And it is much more local than used to be. So for example how we are mitigating Hong Kong protest risk in this moment. First is that we have seen that when the tourist don't shop, they shop somewhere else. So we are working to recover part of that potential loss from tourist in other markets. ","Second, today we have a bigger share of local business and local business is less subject to this kind of protest because people still buy what they need to live in a normal way locally. And so we are mitigating that with good local activity and local marketing and local relevant products. And in doing all of this we also have today the ability to reallocate resources to the trends meaning financial resources, invest more or less in a given category in either area. Even by area in places in Hong Kong we have the flexibility to invest more or less by area. To give you another example Macau is not affected in this moment by the turmoil in the business. So that's the kind of things that make us more capable of mitigating volatility that we have seen historically and it is all being developed strategically. However, I want to close on my example of -- our priority in this moment in Hong Kong is actually the safety of our employees and of our consumers. And that's where we are focusing our efforts and that's where we definitely manage our priorities in the market. ","On China, I mean China we've been investing in China for the long-term and we are in China for the long-term. We have over 6000 employees, basically 99.5% Chinese. We are very local in everything we do. We are locally relevant, we have local activities. Like any other area of the world we are a local relevant organization in everything we do. And so we mitigate the risks with local presence, local relevancy, and again with our ability to invest in the market we are investing substantially in the many emerging markets particularly in China. And these investments are important to the countries we participate in. So that's the way we are mitigating. We are a truly global company which are local in every market we operate in and very respectful of every kind of consumer and market dynamic we see around the world. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula from UBS. Your line is open. ","Steven Strycula","Hi, good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. So a quick question on the UK. We haven't spent as much time focusing in there but for context should we think about that being around 8% to 10% of company sales, what have you noticed anything in terms of change in consumer confidence in the local marketplace and how do you source products and manufacture them for that region?","Fabrizio Freda","So first of all -- is less than 10% to 8% of the company, it is more in the range of 5% of the company sales, our UK business. And the potential impact of a hard BREXIT as of October as it is planned is already included in our guidance and that's in fact one of the risks that we see globally that we are including in our guidance and that has to do with the moderation of the growth thus in our guidance versus the current trend by quarter in the last year. So UK is -- then we are very well organized. In case of a hard BREXIT we are ready to operate. So we have done all the investment needed to make sure we are ready to operate our business in both situations. And finally we believe that the UK will continue to be mitigated by the fact that the hard BREXIT risk which has obviously a risk on local consumption on the other side has an impact on the currency that you're seeing which is benefiting the tourism and our sales to tourists in the UK which is an upsetting factor. That's why we forecast in moderation but not a dramatic one. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, hello everybody. And I echo the congratulations to all on your results. Could you please elaborate on the traffic and the conversion in Travel Retail which I remember you discussed on the Analysts Day there has been -- the conversion has been very strong. But can you update us on the most recent trends and as a follow-up to that we also saw an increase in inventory and I understand that you always wanted to increase the service levels especially because of the growth in Asia. But is it also related to any deceleration or inventory level given the volatility there? Thank you. ","Fabrizio Freda","So, you want to take it. ","Tracey Travis","Yeah, I'll start with the inventory. So no, it's not related to any recent deceleration, it really is because of two years of outstanding growth that we've had and where much of that growth has come from which is in Asia and Travel Retail. So that certainly raises are in transit inventory levels and certainly raises our inventory levels. Inventory is and we've talked about it for a number of years. So the good news is we've been able to make quite a bit of progress in terms of cash, cash generation, and cash flow from operating earnings over a two year time horizon even without having benefits from inventory turnover. We've made a lot of progress in terms of the working capital elements of accounts payable in particular and you might recall that last year our cash flow growth grew over 40%. So while it was flattish this year largely because of because of inventory, we have and are putting more sophisticated processes in place to improve the accuracy of our forecasting and certainly looking at supply as well in terms of getting supply bit closer to demand in the future.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah, and on Travel Retail is -- first of all our Travel Retail business has been growing very strongly. Also last quarter we saw no slowdown in retail. And the growth has been as I said before very strong indeed back in EMEA and actually there was a decline in the Americas. And the business is growing across all brands and the most important concept is that the same doors are the fastest growing part of the business. So our Travel Retail business is growing because we are winning market share in same doors. We are adding new distribution where relevant particularly new brands that we are deploying to the channel and that the channel is requesting. And importantly as you said we are increasing conversion of traveler into buyers, into shoppers. The conversion continued to improve. We are not going to give specific numbers on conversion but continues to grow. One of the key driver of conversion is the success of the pretail system where consumers can order online and then take the products in the airports. ","This is growing very well in Asia particularly for the time being we forecast that this will be a global methodology to buy in this channel in the future. This is obviously driving conversion because consumers -- you know some consumer arrive to the airport late, arrive to the airport stressed, doesn't want to shop, they want to go to a lounge or they want to do other things. And the farther you can buy online before going and then getting there actually is increasing the amount of consumers which are willing to buy something in the airport and that's one. The other big thing that we are driving, we are doing to drive conversion is the advertising in the airports and that's very important and drives obviously conversion. ","But the most important of all drivers are the investment we are making in the country of origin of all our products. You know the travelers they shop the best, tend to be the one from emerging markets. So Chinese as we know, the Russian, Brazilians, Middle Eastern, and that the hour in new investment and accelerated investment in emerging markets have an indirect positive impact from the fact that those travelers when they travel they also want to buy the brands in their visiting airports or in visiting countries where they go. So the big driver is our increased investment in the country of origin which is accelerating the face of our Travel Retail business. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Your line is open. ","Ali Dibadj","Hey guys. So if I look at your guidance 78% constant currency for 2020 on the top line and then 9% to 11% constant currency pour on the EPS line. And I compare that to fiscal year 2019 whereas 12% of the top line and a large gap 21% growth on the EPS line excluding ASC and other stuff. If I go to 2018 it was 13% of the top line and then 24% on the EPS line. So lots of leverage between the top line and the bottom line, the big gap in growth for 2018 and 2019 but less so for 2020, and I just want to get a better sense of why that might be, is it being careful of changes in the mix of the categories or geographies, is it that you expect incrementally more investments and if so where? And I particularly ask that in the context of extremely successful Leading Beauty Forward savings and continue rationing it up there. So that's kind of a shorter-term part of that investment question but then the longer-term part is really just getting a sense of whether you think your current broad investment levels given how you've been able to kind of react more quickly to markets, whether the current investment levels you think are the right ones for your long-term aspiration of continued market share growth in the category as the Prestige Beauty industry evolves? Thank you.","Tracey Travis","Alright so let me start and then Fabrizio can join in. You know really the difference Ali between fiscal 2019 where we grew top line at 12% and our fiscal 2020 where we're guiding 7% to 8%, the incremental leverage that we get on the incremental sales that four or five point of sales is highly accretive. So we -- and one of the things to your point that we've been working on under Leading Beauty Forward is to make sure that incremental sales are more and more accretive to the bottom line. So that's really the difference in terms of the margin expansion that we saw in fiscal 2019 relative to what our guidance is in fiscal 2020. You know as it relates to our investment levels, we certainly continued to invest to support -- we have a portfolio of 30 brands, they are at all different stages of development and we also have emerging markets that we're investing in as well in terms of driving brand awareness and with consumers. So, we certainly expect that we want to have the flexibility when the opportunity is there to invest behind those brands and behind those markets from a growth standpoint. But as Fabrizio said, when the growth isn't there for whatever reason we also have the flexibility to pull back and we have more of that flexibility today than we have had previously. ","But when you think about what we've done with our expense base over the last few years with our cost saving programs and with Leading Beauty Forward, we have significantly diversified our portfolio. We've expanded into new channels of distribution and we've done that while continuing to drive margin. Those new channels of distribution required investment. The same thing with new markets, as we've expanded brands into new markets that too has required investment. So all of the work that we've done over the decade that Fabrizio spoke about in his prepared remarks really has been quite remarkable in terms of our ability to manage to continue to drive margin, continue to allocate more investments in the right areas to drive top line growth going forward. And we expect that we will continue to be able to do that in the future.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah, and just very clear. The only thing I would add on the investment side is that over time we have invested much more in advertising and now I would say that every one of our brands has some investment depending on where they are and how, which part of investment. These investment are mainly now in digital. 75% of our investment now are in digital social media influencers and they're revealing to be highly productive. And now they're highly productive because we are doing a very good job in advertising, quality on asset, in targeting but frankly they're very productive because we have learned much better how to focus our investment where there is growth. Because when you expose your investment to growth they have a much better rate of return. And that's what is happening in this moment and that's what we manage daily. We did that accuracy but frankly we didn't have available in the past. And also want to underline it why we have increased our advertising. We have kept our promotions flat and why we have increased our advertising and kept our promotion flat, we have delivered 90 points of margin improvements showing that we have been capable of reallocating cost and taking cost out of the fixed areas into the variable areas which again is one of the key driver of the flexibility I am speaking about in resource allocation. So, in net I personally believe that what we have done with advertising investment in our P&L is one of the key driver of our recent acceleration and is going to be one of the key driver of our sustainable success in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is open.","Lauren Lieberman","Great, thanks, good morning. ","Tracey Travis","Good morning Lauren. ","Lauren Lieberman","I wanted to talk a little bit actually about Leading Beauty Forward and then also other kind of ongoing productivity efforts which may not be end of that bucket. But I guess first would be that specific to Leading Beauty Forward I think statements came in ahead of guidance this year, you raised slightly the expected savings range versus what you have been articulating at the Analyst Day. So I wanted to hear a little bit about what's driving that upside surprise in Leading Beauty Forward? And then you mentioned ongoing productivity also contributing in fiscal 2020. So if you could talk about areas where that work is coming through because I think for retail all the points that you've just made around investing in new channels and new markets there's also the other side of that equation which is reaching a point where you can kind of take resources away from some of the slower or no growth areas of the business. So I want to talk a little bit about that shift that I think is kind of at that inflection point? Thanks.","Tracey Travis","Okay, so let me start. In terms of the upside from Leading Beauty Forward really it's the addition of new programs and so we also took the cost of the program up to your point Lauren along with the savings expectation. So as I said in my prepared remarks, the momentum that Leading Beauty Forward has had over the three years that we've been managing the program has been quite strong. And as we look across our business and identify areas of further opportunity for transformation that is really what has driven that success. Everything from digitizing our creative process with some initiatives to the ones that I called out in the prepared remarks like indirect procurement, shared services, etc. So that's really what has driven the upside surprise. In terms of future programs again, we still haven't reached the full potential of Leading Beauty Forward from a savings standpoint. Next year will be a big year for completion of a lot of programs and then with the tail being in 2021. And so we'll see even greater savings that we will realize from the program through those efforts. ","Fabrizio Freda","And I just would like to add the point that you said on advertising is where are we leveraging the cost, why we are spending more in advertising. First of all our selling line is going down. Our selling line is going down because we are doing some good work of rationalization. And also because our channel mix require less selling line spending and more advertising spending today. That was in the past. So that's been a big but a Leading Beauty Forward supported this work in a very big way. Second, in the past our organization which is so focused on managing by brand which is the right thing to do forever because brands have to be authentic and distinctive. However in the past we have duplication in the back office cost that were not needed. So we need to manage by brand front not necessarily the back -- and moving forward in rationalizing the back office cost and limiting or avoiding duplications. ","The third bucket is advertised as I said the rate of return of our advertising given our ability to focus more on growth channel, etc. has increased and we spend a lot in AMP and the rate of return in AMP has improved. And finally innovation, you have seen the great innovation and the returns we are having in innovation but our spending innovation is not increasing at the same pace of our success innovation. So our ability to use that, we have invested in creating the right data. I think our ability to focus innovation is to create a better rate of return of our innovation investment. At the end our company is really focused on delivering quality products to get high repeat rates. And I come back to the last point which is our repeat rates are increasing. And when repeat rates of quality product are increasing it is a great, great element of value creation over the long term and allow us to invest wherever we believe is appropriate to sustain future growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. ","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and also congrats on a strong quarter. So I wanted to go back to your China business and I just want to get a sense of what you guys are currently seeing on the ground in China and whether with all these headlines and some of the geopolitical concerns you are seeing and more volatility in your business in China I mean related to that, just curious if you guys have been at all surprised by the continued resilience of the China business?","Fabrizio Freda","So the short answer is no, we are not seeing any slowdown in China at this point in time. And in the fourth quarter China as we commented in our prepared remarks was very, very strong. And I'm not surprised. I mean as I have been saying a lot and I believe we explained in detail in Investor Day, the fundamental for long-term sustainable growth with Chinese consumer are absolutely there and they are super strong. The middle class, the demographic, the fact that the young consumers in China spend more than the older one. The huge opportunity we have in front of us on tier 2 and 3 cities which is completely untapped. Actually I should say tier 3 and 4 cities which is completely untapped. At least numerically for luxury goods. The fact that the system we added 121 seating and thanks to our online operations and TMall sales to 650 cities this dynamic make China access consumers even when the productivity of that specific city is not ready. In fact the productivity of our stores in China is the best in the world. And as you know a lot of our profitability has to do with same door productivity and with single door productivities. ","So all of these dynamics are here to stay and then our market share is improving. Just to be clear importantly we gained 80 points of share with significant increases of market share of Mac, La Mer, Tom Ford in China in the last year. So it is clearly a very well oiled system. Now the question of the moderation beyond the point that there is now a higher base and we need to reflect reality on that, the question of the issue is more about the questions out there in terms of the economic situation in China, in terms of the trade sanctions and the impact that trade sanctions could have on consumption in China. So there are economical and geopolitical reasons why we expect the moderation and also because we believe that now the base of growth is super strong. And we need to be realistic about the future. But as Tracey already said we are completely convinced that there are the fundamentals for double-digit growth in China with Chinese consumers for the sustainable future.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ","Bonnie Herzog","Alright, thank you, good morning. I just had a quick question for Tracey on capital allocation. Just looking at some of your metrics it really does seem like you're in an optimal position here to either continue to step up shareholder returns or maybe execute on M&A. So, curious as to which you potentially see as most attractive today given what you're seeing out there on the acquisition front? Thanks.","Tracey Travis","Yeah, I know Bonnie, thank you. So in terms of capital allocation yes, I mean it's a decision that we take along with our board every year in terms of the best uses of our very strong cash generation. Last year obviously we made the decision that we would step up share repurchase because that was the best return and certainly has proven to be the case for us. We did take a pause last year as it related to new acquisitions. A) I would say the valuations had gotten a bit lofty and B) you know our strategy on acquisitions we don't need acquisitions to grow. You know I did say in my prepared remarks that we would expect one point of growth to come from acquisitions over a three year time horizon. But the organic strength of our business is such that that certainly it also has a tremendous amount of momentum. So we have the benefit of looking for acquisitions that are strategic to our portfolio. We look for whitespace opportunities as it relates to acquisitions. I mean acquisitions that obviously we can get the right return on investment on. But, again the cash generation if there isn't an acquisition that's out there certainly we relook at our cash distributions across dividends and share repurchase activity and make a decision accordingly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Steve Powers","Hey, great, thanks, good morning. First let me just a bit of housekeeping and follow-up to I think Lauren's question. Leading Beauty Forward charges came in I think 65 million to 80 million higher for the year than what you had guided at the end of the third quarter. So, apologies if I missed it but just if you could highlight some of the drivers there that would be great? My real question is on your biggest brands and what you expect from them in 2020, maybe just a little bit more of a health check, I guess from my perspective Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, even Mac seemed broadly healthy on a global basis but I love a little bit more from you on how you're viewing them in any pockets of higher opportunity that you see? And then Clinique which sounded like a point of relative optimism at your Investor Day back in March, it just still seems a little bit softer so I'd love to get your views there as well and how you think the contribution of Clinique will compare in 2020 to the year just completed? Thanks.","Tracey Travis","So starting with Leading Beauty Forward, as we came upon the end and the close of the program in terms of accepting new initiatives we did have a number of new initiatives in the fourth quarter that were added to the program. And again those initiatives are expecting to generate an acceptable return. We have return thresholds underneath the program. So some of those were in our retail area as it looked at -- as we looked at retail rationalization as well as some strengthening of our freestanding store operations. So, and there were others as well that were added at the end of the year.","Fabrizio Freda","Yeah, in terms of brands we spoke about our top four brands in the year. When I said that three out of four we're growing at 80% of sales represented by brands we're growing. Quarter four was actually an improvement so what we said to the Investor Day is actually happening in quarter four. In quarter four total four of our largest brands had grown in constant currency and two rose double-digits. In old order brands representing over 94% of sales grew in quarter four. So we are really on a roll on all of our brands portfolio. And as far as Clinique, I remain optimistic for the brand, for a stabilization and then growth in the future. But we are good. As we said Clinique is growing in steps and now the priority is skincare which is the base, the fundamental also in terms of profitability for the brand. So we are first building moisturizer, skincare, and then we will pass to the rest and continue to build a brand using the same dynamic we're using on the other brands. ","Also keep in mind for Clinique, the Clinique is the most disposed of our brands to North America and North America is the softest market overall, particularly in makeup and emphatically makeup is one of the area that we have not yet turnaround for that reason. So it is all very specific, very much we are in line with our long-term goals and what's happening. Then we have extraordinary brands also in the mid group for example Tom Ford or Jo Malone had a terrific year, having a terrific performance. I personally believe there will be soon very top big brands in our company so meaning that we will go from middle to big in the next year. And even in our small brands and new brands there are some highflyers. Take Le Labo, Le Labo is one of the really highflyers in our young brand portfolio. ","So we have an extraordinary brand portfolio and I think we have learned how to continue building it, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is on fire as I said in my prepared remarks and we expect that the strengths of our brands will continue to operate in fiscal year 2020 and in fiscal year 2020 we expect some improvements in the areas which are still to be improved as Tracey said. And namely is Clinique U.S. and Mac U.S. the two that we are focused on looking for improvements. But the rest is frankly on fire.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. ","Erinn Murphy","Great, thank you, good morning. I guess my question was around TMall, could you just maybe reflect on what you think made Tom Ford's launch so successful on that platform and then with less than 50% of your portfolio on TMall any rollout plans in 2020 for other brands within your portfolio and how you think about it longer-term? And then just sorry Tracey one follow-up, I may have missed this, in the U.S. can you talk about what you saw specifically with specialty multi? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","Start, so now TMall is an exceptional partner and we are having very good business with them. The strengths of TMall is that we control our business and the ability to deliver the right equity for the brands in intercommunication. The Tom Ford launch had an enormous amount of super outstanding quality creative assets produced for the launch of TMall that created a lot of traffic and a lot of conversion from visitor to purchaser. And that's what was driving the success, the creative aspects that were done by the Tom Ford team together with the China team and obviously under the direction of Tom Ford personally who is an amazing creative leader. This combination was very exciting for the Chinese consumers. And so the result was high traffic, high conversion, and that's what drove that success. So we are seeing more of this. I think we have learned together with our TMall partners how to create the right level of traffic interest conversion on TMall platform also for the future. And to your question of do we plan to launch more brands, yes, in the future we will launch more brands. It depends also from the brands that we will launch in China in the future to continue building our Chinese portfolio.","Tracey Travis","And regarding specialty multi Erinn, in the quarter in North America specialty multi was up about 1%. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks. Congrats on a strong year and thanks for squeezing me in. ","Fabrizio Freda","Good morning, thank you. ","Jason English","You're welcome. Two quick questions, first building off the question on TMall, given the control you have there out of curiosity, do you record the sales there at retail sales price or wholesale and if it's different then, if it is retail is there a mixed benefit you're seeing? And then second question is really on holistically looking at the margin profile for next year, at the midpoint it looks like you're guiding to roughly 70 basis points or so of EBIT margin expansion based on my back of the envelope math, not far off of I think the underlying 90 that you achieve this year but you're getting less productivity savings as a percentage of sales and you're expecting less leverage from the incremental sales, the four points Tracey that you highlighted suggesting there's some other offsets there that are helping you deliver that robust growth, can you give us some more context and quantification around those? Thank you.","Fabrizio Freda","I'll start from your first question while Tracey will answer the second. So we recorded retail sales of TMall and in my prepared remarks I spoke about our direct to consumer business. Our direct to consumer business is all retail for us and our direct to consumer business is our freestanding stores, is our brand.com like est\u00e9elauder.com and TMall and other platforms, other TMall where we are in control. And that part of the business is growing and that part of the business I want to repeat that had 1.3 billion visitors in the year. So imagine the amount of data that we have, the amount of equity building communication that we can do, and the impact. And a positive impact of all of this on in general what the consumer decide to buy even in other channels and in other situation in the course of the year. So it is a very powerful dynamic that helps also our wholesale business.","Tracey Travis","And as it relates to the productivity savings and the margin expansion you're spot on Jason, not surprisingly in terms of what we are initially expecting for margin expansion in fiscal 2020. Again having top line sales growth of 7% to 8% versus 12% we are seeing less leverage based on sales but still some. Some related to obviously our continuing cost savings and the ramping up more of Leading Beauty Forward savings along with other cost programs. And then a little bit of mix benefit as well in order to drive that 70 basis points. ","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session.
