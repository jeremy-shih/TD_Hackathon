[Operator instructions.]  I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead.","Donald Bullock","Good morning.  I\u2019m Don Bullock, senior vice president of investor relations.  Welcome to Eaton\u2019s first quarter 2013 earnings conference call.  Joining me this morning are Sandy Cutler, chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, vice chairman and CFO.  As it has been our practice, we will begin today\u2019s call with comments from Sandy, followed by a question-and-answer session.","Before turning it over to Sandy, I\u2019d like to cover a couple of items.  First, I\u2019d take a moment to draw your attention to page 2 of the presentation for today\u2019s call.  Our presentation today contains certain forward-looking statements. Comments included on page two of the presentation outline factors that could cause the actual results to differ from those statements.","These factors are also noted in today\u2019s press release and the related Form 8-K.  In addition, this presentation also includes certain non-GAAP measures as defined by the SEC. A reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP equivalent is provided in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.eaton.com. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sandy.  ","Alexander Cutler","Great.  Thanks, Don, and thank you all for joining us this morning.  Delighted to have this chance to cover with you our achievements related to the first quarter.  Maybe just a couple of comments to proceed talking through the presentation, which I hope you have all had a chance to download this morning.  I\u2019ll be working off of those slides.","If you\u2019ll turning to slide three, this is labeled highlights of our first quarter results, a couple of comments.  First, this is the first full quarter of results reflecting our acquisition of Cooper Industries, and as such you\u2019ll note that we\u2019re reporting in our new segments that we had outlined to you in our last earnings call.","You\u2019ll also note, for those of you are used to following our earnings calls that we\u2019re not providing any quarter market growth or out growth information on a quarter basis.  The process of both the acquisition and then pulling together all this information has just made that very difficult for us to do at this time.  ","So with that, let me start off with a couple of points on this first chart, and I\u2019m on chart number three, operating earnings per share of $0.84.   Obviously compares very favorably, above the top end of the guidance that we provided for the first quarter and against the consensus of $0.79.  Sales were $5.3 billion, obviously a record, benefitting quite a bit from the acquisition of Cooper and the other acquisitions we concluded last year.  About 40 points from acquisition, a negative one, from forex, and a negative 5 from organic growth.","Operating cash flow was $100 million, and for those of you who\u2019ve followed us for some time, you know the first quarter is always our weakest quarter in that regard.  We make our largest portion of our pension contributions in the first quarter.  Thank you about $208 million.  And it\u2019s also the quarter in which we rebuild working capital coming off typically a burn down of working capital in the fourth quarter.","And I think very importantly, and I know you\u2019re all interested in this subject, the Cooper integration remains right on track, both from a revenue point of view, from a cost reduction point of view, from our recognizing the working capital and associated tax benefits.  Synergies of about $15 million in the first quarter.  You\u2019ll recall that we\u2019re talking about 90 for the full year this year.  That equates to about $0.03 all on its own.  Full year forecast, keeping the same, it\u2019s $90 million.  ","And as you think about the first half versus the second half, one of the important sources of slightly higher profits in the second half this year than the first half is the fact that we would expect these acquisition synergies to accelerate in the second half.  On the whole deal,  we would look at the first half being slightly dilutive, and that $0.15 accretion, we call for basically all happens in the second half of the year.","If we turn to chart number four, labeled comparison to first quarter guidance, fairly easy reconciliation versus the $0.75 midpoint of the guidance we provided for the first quarter.  Volumes were lower, about $50 million lower than we thought, and the easy way to think about that is that\u2019s primarily Europe, I think a theme you\u2019ve been hearing from many companies, led to about a negative $0.03.  A lower tax rate, you saw it was about 5%.  ","And one of the big influences in that number is the 2012 R&E credit for both Eaton and previous Cooper dropping into the first quarter.  That\u2019s about $17 million.  It equates to about 4 rate points.  So if you want to think about the 5% tax rate in the first quarter, if you added those four rate points back, you\u2019d be at roughly 9%.","And then the higher incrementals.  A little stronger operating margins from the business than we anticipated, and lower corporate expenses.  As you\u2019ll recall, we guided to about $83 million of corporate expenses per quarter on average through the year of 2013.  We came in at about $70 million.  So a positive $0.10 for that.  ","So obviously up $0.09 from the midpoint of our guidance.  We think it\u2019s really solid execution, and what I think has broadly been characterized by many companies as soft global markets.  We think it sets a really solid foundation for the rest of the year.","Moving to chart number five, comparison to first quarter 2013 to Q1 of 2012, a couple of, I think, important issues to think through here.  Obviously the acquisition adds revenues and adds segment profits, but as we\u2019ve talked about on a number of occasions, the impact of higher shares, higher purchase price accounting and amortization and higher interest to achieve that.  So let\u2019s just walk through the chart real quickly.","Incremental acquisition volume contributing about $0.59, and that is the total of the five acquisitions that we completed last year.  So about a $1.6 billion of volume there.  Lower tax rate, 5% this year, about 15.6% last year.  It\u2019s a positive $0.13.  Better incrementals in terms of the continued progress of all our work on productivity.  You see about $0.05.  ","The next two line items, higher number of shares, that\u2019s the 475 million shares in the first quarter versus the 340 million last year, about a negative $0.34.  The purchase price accounting and higher amortization, about $0.24.  And if you just skip that lower core volume number and drop to higher interest for a minute, that\u2019s about $47 million of higher interest.  So if you take the $0.34, the $0.24, and the $0.12, you\u2019ve got about $0.70 of below the segment higher costs as a result of the acquisition.  ","And then lower core volume, down about $190 million from last year, and as we talked about all through last year, we saw markets, and hence our volumes, declining quarter to quarter in our vehicle and our hydraulics business last year.  Recall it was a much weaker second half.  And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re seeing here, is the lower volumes in those two businesses in particular.","If we turn to chart six, I think no big surprises on this chart from those of you who already read the earnings release in detail.  I\u2019d point out just one number for you to think about here.  That\u2019s our first quarter 2013 segment operating margins of 14%.  That compared to the roughly 12.1% in the fourth quarter.  That\u2019s a very good start for us, and as you\u2019ll see in most of our segments, we\u2019re in very good shape against our full year guidance starting right at the beginning of this year.","I\u2019ve mentioned before the acquisition volume of roughly 40 points, then you see the weak end market opportunity with the core volume down 5% and forex being a fairly small change this year, just one point.","Diving right into the segments, I want to provide you a little bit more detail on these, because we recognize we\u2019ve got some new segments here that take a little getting used to in terms of knowing what businesses are where.  ","First, the electrical product segment, I\u2019m on chart number seven.  This includes several of the traditional Cooper businesses as well as some of the original Eaton electrical businesses.  So for those of you who are familiar with the [Busman], the lighting, the B Line, wiring devices, and safety businesses of Cooper, they are in this segment now.","You see a good start to the year this year, with a 14.7% margin.  It is difficult, we recognize, for you to compare first quarter \u201913 to the previous year, because the previous year would not include the Cooper products.  So you\u2019re looking at a 15.7% margin in terms of the Eaton products that would fall into this segment a year ago.  ","In the first quarter of \u201913, you\u2019re seeing a 14.7% margin that are both the Eaton products plus the Cooper products.  I would simply tell you that when you look at the Eaton products within here, the margins were slightly higher than they were a year ago, and so we\u2019re pleased with that continued progress.  ","I\u2019d reference you down to the slightly green colored box under sales growth, the acquisition contribution here being some 92%.  That\u2019s about $820 million of incremental volume that\u2019s come into this segment for acquisition.  ","What\u2019s going on in the business at this point?  Continued strength, we see, in the end markets in the U.S., in the Middle East, in Latin America.  It\u2019s more mixed in Asia-Pacific.  We\u2019ll talk a little bit more about that at the conclusion of my comments.  And then I think the big news here really is not news.  It\u2019s just Europe continues to be weak.  We\u2019re not seeing any form of recovery.  It\u2019s slightly weaker than we perhaps thought it was going to be when the year started.","Our combined bookings were down about 3%, and this particular segment is heavier than the next segment we\u2019ll talk about in terms of items that are stocked by distributors.  And we are fairly confident that we saw distributor destocking occur in the first quarter here in the U.S. and in Europe, as people are minding their stores tightly, trying to figure out what volume will look like in the second quarter of this year.","If we move to chart eight, electrical systems and services segment, again in this particular segment the traditional Eaton businesses that were included in this segment, plus the Cooper legacy businesses of Crouse-Hinds and the Cooper Power Systems business.  ","Once again, you have this mismatch of what\u2019s included in the first quarter of \u201912 versus first quarter of \u201913, because \u201912 did not include the Cooper information.  However, I would tell you, when you look within those margins, the Eaton margins improved fairly significantly within this segment, so that it\u2019s not simply a mix change here.  There\u2019s also a driver of performance here.","Once again, market conditions pretty much the same, as I just characterized for the products segment.  Bookings up in this particular segment by about 2%.  We also came into the year with a very strong backlog in this particular business.  You tend to have more backlog in this segment than you would have in the product segment.","Once again, if you drop to the slightly green colored box in the left-hand lower corner, you\u2019d see acquisition contributing about 80% to the sales increase.  This is both Cooper, Rolec, which was a Chilean acquisition we did, and Gycom, which was the northern European, really Scandinavian, Nordic countries, acquisitions we did last year.  So again, off to a really good start here with a 14.1% margin right off the bat in the first quarter.  ","Now, moving to hydraulics, and here we\u2019ve got a little easier comparisons year-to-year because you don\u2019t have quite the reconfiguration of the segments having added in the very large Cooper acquisition.  Sales of $756 million, up from the fourth quarter, where we were $693 million, so up about 9% from the fourth quarter.  ","Quite a rebound in terms of the operating earnings in this segment, 11.9% versus the 7.4% that we reported in the fourth quarter.  I think you\u2019ll all recall that in the fourth quarter we booked about $17 million of restructuring.  They were aimed at both helping us resize the overall business, closing two plants, and downsizing two other plants.  And I think you\u2019re already seeing the beneficial impact of that in our margins.  ","The acquisition number, again, in the lower left hand green box, that 13%, represents just under $100 million of additional volume that came in from Jeil and the SEL acquisitions, the two acquisitions we completed in our hydraulics business last year.  ","Market\u2019s up modestly over the fourth quarter, but I think the bookings information is perhaps the most important information we could talk about here in this segment.  That 8% compared to a very strong first quarter 2012, and then you\u2019ll recall the year ran off after that.  But the sheer volume is up nearly 30% from the fourth quarter bookings levels.  So we really believe that we are seeing this business beginning to turn in this regard.  ","And when you look within that 8%, not surprisingly.  The distributor reduction is sort of a mid single digit number.  The OEM number is just over 10% negative.  And when you dive inside the distributor data, it\u2019s not much different by region.  But when you do dive inside the OEM data, it\u2019s very different by end market, with, as you would expect, the construction market still being quite weak.  ","But the big turnaround versus the fourth quarter being ag.  Where it was a very significant negative in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s a very significant positive in the first quarter.  So once again, after four quarters of consecutive bookings decline, we\u2019ve seen a very significant quarter to quarter increase in the bookings in our hydraulic segment.   ","Moving to section 10, chart 10, aerospace segment, [unintelligible] volumes compared to fourth quarter was $434 million in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s $434 million in the first quarter.  But a significant improvement on our margins.  Recall, in the fourth quarter, when we reported that 10.4% operating margin, we had booked about a $4 million, or 90 basis points, restructuring.  It was really dealing both with our organization structure and one small plant closing.  We\u2019re very pleased with the 14.3% operating margin here in the first quarter.  ","I think, here again, examining the bookings is perhaps one of the most important items as we think about the future here.  Bookings up 7%, which is a great quarter.  Continued weakness in commercial aftermarket.  And so the story is very much the same here.  Very strong OEM activity.  We were frankly a little surprised that our strong OEM activity was not only on the commercial, but we also had a very strong quarter in terms of military platform bookings as well.  So really solid quarter in our aerospace business.","Moving to our vehicles segment, and you\u2019ll recall this segment represents now all of the traditional Eaton products in both the truck business and the vehicle business.  A very solid quarter again here, $939 million of volume, up 8% from the fourth quarter when we reported $871 million.  Our margins moved up from 11.3% in the fourth quarter to 14.1%.  ","You\u2019ll recall in the fourth quarter our fourth quarter reflected restructuring of $17 million of expense, or about 200 basis points.  We had done some resizing in South America and resizing in Europe in light of both the market conditions we saw in those areas in the world.  ","So again, a really solid start in this business, and clearly this is one of the businesses where it\u2019s easiest to understand the market driver that we\u2019re placing our forecast upon this year is that the first quarter, NAFTA heavy duty truck demand was 55,000 units.  We still have a forecast of roughly 270,000 units per year.  That means by the fourth quarter we\u2019d be at a run rate of about 78,000.  So quite a ramp as we go through the year.  And as you\u2019ve seen, the bookings have been coming in to support that forecast.","So now if we turn to chart 12, no change.  On this chart, in the upper portion of this area of the chart - and we\u2019d be prepared to talk about any of the individual industries if you want to during questions - I would just simply note the new box at the bottom of this page, where we say we now expect market growth to be toward the lower end of the range.  ","As you\u2019ll recall, we had said that our outlook for the weighted average of our end markets was 2-3%.  We think it\u2019s likely to be closer to 2%.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s probably a surprise to any of you with all the economic data that\u2019s rolled out over the last month and a half.  Obviously the confirmation of the weak GDP here in the U.S., the fact that the China numbers came out a little lower than some expected, and that Europe seems to be mired in molasses still at this point.  ","And so we think still the prudent basis for our forecast is the lower end of this range.  I think the very good news is with a little slower market start this year, our execution is proving our ability to make it up in terms of higher productivity and pulling in these synergies as we have.  ","If we turn to chart 13, this is unchanged.  This is our margin expectations by segment, really no new news here.  Chart 14, full year guidance remains the same, a range of $4.05 to $4.45 in terms of our operating EPS with a midpoint of $4.25.  What is new on this chart, obviously, is this is our first specific guidance for the second quarter.  You saw it in our press release this morning, $1.05 to $1.15 operating earnings per share with a midpoint of $1.10.","Chart 15.  This was our full year guidance.  It took you from the $3.94 to our guidance of this year of $4.25.  No change.  We simply just provided this for ease of your comparisons.  And chart 16 is the comparison of our first quarter of this year to our second quarter, and I\u2019ll walk you through the steps in terms of what supports our guidance for the second quarter.","First quarter, obviously we just reported our $0.84 operating earnings per share.  We noted in our press release, and if you look back over many years for Eaton, you\u2019ll see a fairly strong seasonal impact where our sales generally increase between 5% and 10%.  It varies a little bit every year.  And what you\u2019d find is that this additional $0.28 of higher core volume, as the [unintelligible] that we\u2019ve talked about this year, 33%, gets about 7.5%.  So it\u2019s roughly $420 million.","You\u2019ll also recall, and when we gave guidance for this year and reported our fourth quarter earnings in our last call, we identified that the purchase price accounting adjustment for the inventory charges coming out of the acquisition of Cooper, that we had expensed an element of those in the fourth quarter and then we expect that the final piece, roughly $33 million, or $0.06, to be expensed in the first quarter, which indeed it was and it was included in our $0.84 results. So we will not have that $0.06 repeating here in the second quarter.  ","Additional acquisition synergy realization, I mentioned to you we realized about $15 million in the first quarter.  We are ramping up to get to that full $90 million this year.  We\u2019ll be at about $20 million pace here in the second quarter.  That adds $0.01 in the second quarter.  ","Our tax rate, I mention to you it was 5% in the first quarter.  It will be closer, we believe, to about 10% in the second quarter.  Again, we won\u2019t have the R&E credit that we did have in the first quarter.  ","And then corporate expense, I mentioned to you that we ran at about a $70 million level in the first quarter.  That\u2019s below the average of what we thought we would run at per quarter this year.  And so we\u2019re including the forecast here again of about $83 million.  That\u2019s up $13 million from the first quarter.  That means about $0.03.  Those are, I think, the fairly straightforward five items that lead to the reconciliation between our first quarter $0.84 and the second quarter $1.10.  ","If you move to chart 17, no changes here.  This is the same guidance that we provided you with at the beginning of the year.  Again, just for your reference and ease of materials.  If we move on to chart 18, then, just a couple of points in terms of summary.  Q1, not just for us but I think you\u2019ve heard more generally, it was a slow start, and what we would characterize as sluggish global markets.  ","Now, you\u2019ll recall that many people felt we were conservative when we started this year saying we thought end markets would grow on the order of 2-3%.  We think that\u2019s the right place to be, and it leads us to the right orientation in terms of our resources and our productivity requirements.  So very much on track with what we thought.","The Cooper integration, obviously an enormous undertaking, is going really really well, and we\u2019re just delighted with the progress our team is making there.  And I would say this is a year where our performance is far more dependent upon our execution than global growth.  We did not come into this year assuming global growth was going to bail us out.  We came into this year with the expectation that we would have fairly nominal global growth.  ","We do have the benefit in a couple of businesses of some fairly strong quarter to quarter growth that\u2019s related more to individual market activity than it is to global growth, per se, and I would call out North American heavy duty truck as an example of that.  Or the strong seasonal in our electrical business, which tends to come in much stronger in the second, third, and fourth quarter than it does in the first quarter.","But nonetheless, we\u2019re really pleased with the first quarter, $0.84.  Really got there based on execution.  And then a question I know a number of you have is that when will our 10-Q be available.  We thank you for bearing with us in terms of all of the complexities of pulling the accounting for these different firms together at this point, through this large acquisition.  We\u2019ll have it available later this week.  And hopefully it will have more information that you\u2019ll be seeking that will be outlined fully in the 10-Q.","With that, Don, why don\u2019t we open things up for questions?  Oh, I should mention that on page 20 of this packet, we did, again, include, just for your reference, no change here, the synergies expected from the Cooper Industries acquisition and just felt that would be helpful for you to have this reference document there for your work.  So with that, Don, why don\u2019t we go ahead and open things up?  ","Donald Bullock","I\u2019ll turn it to the operator, who will give us instructions, and then we\u2019ll open it to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]","Donald Bullock","Our first quarter today is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.  ","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Sandy, you just mentioned 2013 is much more highly dependent on your execution than global growth.  Could you just set some light on where you see the greatest execution risk as you progress through the year?","Alexander Cutler","I wouldn\u2019t characterize them as risk, because I think we\u2019ve got teams [well around them], but certainly the integration of an acquisition the size of Cooper Industries is one that is obviously on all of our target lists.  We also acquired four other companies last year.  ","And so each of those five have to be successfully integrated.  I think the first quarter is a good indication of how well we\u2019re doing on that.  We\u2019re very much on track.  And you may recall that we actually increased our guidance, if we go back into the February, early March, time period for what we expected to get from the Cooper acquisition this year.  ","I\u2019d say second, there are a number of restructuring programs that we kicked off with the roughly $50 million of restructuring costs that we booked in the fourth quarter.  Those are also going quite well.  ","And then the area that I\u2019m particularly excited about, the vast array of new products that we are launching this year, included in part of that is how we expect to be able to drive higher bookings activities.  And if I just had to pick a couple out of our electrical business, this whole suite of [unintelligible] automation and control solutions that are targeting machine builders, off and running well, and for those of you who went over to Hannover Fair, you really saw that reception there.  ","Our new [series of] modular [SF63] medium voltage switch gear, another big plus.  For those of you who were at Lightfair just this last week, you saw us kick off another LED platform with something we call Wave Stream, that\u2019s the brand name, for our new [edge-lit] LED lighting products.  Really offered at a very attractive price range, and really taking that technology into recessed lighting, where it has not yet really penetrated.  ","And then I would just end with just one other big one to be thinking about here, and that\u2019s you\u2019ve heard us talk about this really premiere energy efficiency we have in three phase.  Large, high power apps.  We\u2019ve now moved that down into a product line that\u2019s much more sort of the midsize.  So it really brings that efficiency to the smaller data centers, where there\u2019s a fair amount of activity.  ","So those are the kind of issues we\u2019ve got our eyes on in terms of execution.  I\u2019d say they\u2019re off to a great start this year, and I think our team well understands the market\u2019s not going to make the difference this year.  It\u2019s really creating our own growth and creating sources of profits.  And that\u2019s where this large acquisition really gives us an additional leg up relative to many others, because we\u2019ve got a lot to work on, where we create additional profitability.  ","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs ","And in your prepared comments, one end market question, you did talk a little bit about distributor [EBITDA] in U.S. and Europe.  And just trying to square that away with your commentary that the fourth quarter you expect non-res and specifically U.S. non-res markets to be up 4-5% this year.  So help me understand those dynamics and what then what\u2019s the [unintelligible] in the marketplace today?","Alexander Cutler ","If you think about our electrical business having kind of two types of activity, I\u2019m going to talk about how they throw through channels, not the kind of products.  Those products that are stocked on distributor shelves, a very healthy part of our business, and one that we were really very pleased that the Cooper acquisition bought us an even bigger percentage of those kind of standard products, if you will, that\u2019s where we saw, in January and February in particular, fairly active destocking by distributors, both here and in the U.S.  ","Now, we think that partially was people readjusting to the fact that maybe the year wasn\u2019t going to be the kind of year that some of our distributors thought it was going to be originally.  Frankly, I think they\u2019ve come back a little bit more to where we thought the growth rates were going to be this year.","But I think, too, it\u2019s so hard, when you watch all of the issues of sequestration or other government challenges going on here and in Europe, that doesn\u2019t give distributors a lot of confidence about putting more inventory on their shelves.  So unlike many quarters, in the first quarter, when you see a rapid acceleration of sales quarter to quarter, we didn\u2019t see as much of that this year.","I would say on the non-residential side, that tends to be product that is not stocked as much.  That tends to be the assemblies business, if I could characterize it.  It\u2019s bid to a particular job or transaction.  There, pretty good bid activity, and so that distributor stocking issue doesn\u2019t tend to hit it as much.","You\u2019re exactly right, we did come into the year with a non-res forecast of roughly 4-5%.  And that has always been private put in place that we\u2019ve talked about.  I think the piece that everyone\u2019s got their eye on right now is what\u2019s the government kind of stream of activity.  And obviously with sequestration in place, we think that that\u2019s a bit of a negative.  ","So when you look at the total non-res, which would be government and private put in place, probably a number that\u2019s more like 3-4% versus a number that\u2019s like 4-5%.  But I would say frankly that\u2019s tuning that sometimes that tight a tuning doesn\u2019t really change things that much for us.","Donald Bullock ","Our next question comes from David Raso with ISI.  ","David Raso - ISI Group","[Just trying to see into] the implied second half growth, and also a question on the modeling for amortization of intangibles.  Just trying to think through the growth in the second half of the year.  It seems to be implying maybe high single-digits, low double-digit.  And I backed into that based off of what you just said first quarter to second quarter on core volume.  ","So can you help us understand if I\u2019m doing that properly?  I can completely appreciate the vehicle business, truck being up a lot year over year in the second half, and maybe hydraulic to some degree as well.  ","But can you help us walk through that second half acceleration of growth?  Maybe try to nail down a little bit more what are you expecting from the electrical businesses in the second half, maybe aerospace?   ","Alexander Cutler ","Sure.  And I think the way to think about this, David, if you take our first half, the $0.84 and the midpoint of $1.10, that\u2019s $1.94.  And then if you subtract that $1.94 from the $4.25, you get $2.31 in the second half.  So roughly 46% of the earnings in the first half, 54% in the second half.  I think you\u2019d find that\u2019s within about 2% of what we\u2019ve generally run most years, if you go back.  ","Of that $0.37 increase in the second half, roughly $0.17 of it comes from the Cooper synergies.  And that\u2019s the difference between the first half and the second half.  I told you it would be slightly.  When I say Cooper synergies, it\u2019s that entire balance of $0.15 for the year.  So that\u2019s got amortization, it\u2019s got increased shares, it\u2019s got the interest costs.  It\u2019s got all that in it.  So you get a little bit of a negative on that in the first half.  You get roughly $0.17 in the second half, so now you\u2019re dealing with a $0.20 difference, half to half, if you will.  ","And the largest portion of that $0.20 difference then comes from the acceleration specifically on the North American heavy duty side, because our forecast of $15 million retail sales for light vehicles here in North America hasn\u2019t changed much.  We came into the year thinking that the European automotive market would be only down maybe 2%.  We think that\u2019s likely to be more like a 6 and a 7.  So that\u2019s kind of taking away any plus you find on the automotive side of that marketplace.  ","So you come back to the heavy duty truck, and then you come back to the seasonality here where you tend to get that electrical business, as I mentioned, that tends to kind of come up.  That 7.5% is not a bad number for that business.  It kind of comes to that second quarter and third quarter being relatively similar, and then it comes off just slightly in the fourth quarter.","And then lastly I would say the hydraulics business, which we believe, but we can\u2019t certify, obviously, that we\u2019re seeing the bottoming of this bookings activity.  And if we\u2019re right in that regard, we\u2019re going to start to see some volume pickup there.  ","Aerospace we\u2019ve assumed not a lot of volume change.  It\u2019s pretty, I think, dropped through to the bottom line.  It\u2019s not a substantial difference.  So I think you\u2019re really looking at vehicle, hydraulics and electrical as being those three drivers.","David Raso - ISI Group ","And I do appreciate that, but maybe Rick, just help me make sure I have these numbers right.  The core volume was down $190 million in the first quarter, correct?","","Alexander Cutler","","Roughly, yeah.  ","David Raso - ISI Group ","And if I grow that $125 million in Q2, that means Q2 will give me about a positive $130 million year over year on core.  So I go into the second half of the year in the hole about $60 million to try to get to the full year core revenue growth guidance of $900 million.  So based on the older core growth in the second half to get to $900 million?  And I understand some of the businesses year over year, they are going to grow a lot more in the second half than we\u2019re seeing in the first half.  I\u2019m just making sure I understand the core growth dynamics in the second half of the year.","","Alexander Cutler","","And I think, David, maybe we ought to go offline to kind of work through all the specific numbers.  I tried to give you the kind of overall where we are.  We\u2019d be glad to do that subsequently.","David Raso - ISI Group ","And then last, the amortization question.  The $107 million in the first quarter, which is just a little higher than I would have thought.  Can you help us think that through, the full year number?","Richard Fearon ","David, we continue to think the number is in the neighborhood of $420 for the full year, so it will be at this level or maybe just a little bit under this level in some of the later quarters.","Alexander Cutler ","And that\u2019s not any different than we indicated in our earnings conference call.","Donald Bullock ","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.  ","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","I guess just firstly on China, I remember you mentioned on the earnings call in January that you\u2019d seen some encouraging order intake activity.  Looking around other companies that have reported, it feels like sort of domestic focus, stuff like construction\u2019s a bit better, but stuff that\u2019s tied more to exports, like factory investment, industrial output, is still very weak.  I just wondered what your update was on China.","Alexander Cutler ","Yeah, your memory of our comments is exactly right.  We had talked about specifically on our hydraulics business in January, which is one of our insights into the construction equipment business there in China, that things have ticked up in China.  ","I\u2019d say unfortunately they ticked up and kind of stalled in China, and so we, like others, would, I think, characterize China as not recovering on the pace that it looked like it might have starting off beginning of the year.  It is beginning to recover, and 7.7% GDP growth is nothing to sneeze at, but it\u2019s not the 10-12% everyone would love to see.  ","Our own business in China, if you look at our actual shipments for China in the first quarter, were about flat with a year ago.  But when you go within it, I think more instructive is the vehicle businesses are up pretty nicely.  And so you saw a pretty good quarter of activity there.  ","I would say that most of the infrastructure oriented businesses, be that our electrical or our hydraulics businesses, were off just slightly in terms of the shipment, and all that brings together to be roughly flat.  So I think our assumption for this year on China of roughly an 8% GDP increase feels about right to us, but it\u2019s not accelerating really really quickly.   ","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse ","And then just within the electrical systems and services segment, you obviously had a very, very nice margin jump in Q1, and the margin in that segment in Q1 was sort of already slightly above your full year target.  I just wondered if there was anything in terms of seasonality that we need to be aware of or if you could give any sense of what the base full year margin in 2012 for the systems and services [unintelligible].","Alexander Cutler ","Our challenge in 2012 is giving it to you with both Cooper and with Eaton, and that\u2019s what we can\u2019t at this point.  But what I could tell you, because obviously it is a noticeable change between the 9.2% we reported last year, which was the traditional Eaton businesses, and the 14.1% now, is that it was just the Eaton products, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve got consistent data.  We saw a several point increase in margins.  ","And some of the work we\u2019ve been doing in terms of continuing to work on productivity and introduce new products, and so this isn\u2019t simply a mix change of having added in the Crouse Hinds and the power systems business into that segment.  And so we\u2019re really pleased and we think that is quite sustainable.  ","So when we look at that full year number, obviously, of a 14% margin, we started off the first quarter, which typically is a little weaker, with a very strong quarter.  Now, it\u2019s also a reflection of the fact that you\u2019ll recall the really outstanding bookings versus market demand that we had in the second, third, and fourth quarter.  And you\u2019re seeing us come right out of the block with obviously being able to ship from this very strong backlog.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse ","And then just lastly, electrical products.  The bookings were down about 3% in Q1.  Core sales were down about 4%.  For Q2, is your guidance sort of embedding that that gets about flattish year on year for revenue?","Alexander Cutler ","Our thinking, again, is that at this volume, if you take our two businesses and put them together, there\u2019s roughly 7.5% increase.  That\u2019s not a bad surrogate for the electrical business as well.  And obviously as the construction market comes up in terms of just the bad weather issue is always an issue in this business, is that you get a bigger quarter there in the second quarter.  ","So our conversations with distributors, and we\u2019ve had many, is that we think the inventory correction that went on this winter is maybe a little overdone.  And there\u2019s an opportunity in that regard as we enter the bigger building program.  ","You know, we haven\u2019t talked about one particular market here, because I think there is understandable focus on non-res.  I think we\u2019ve all got to keep focus on the fact that residential is, while not back at the levels we experienced in the 2006 and 2007 heydays, is coming back to more respectable levels.  ","And these are kind of 20% increases year-to-year, and that residential really starts to move more quickly as you get into the second and third quarter from a construction point of view.   ","Donald Bullock ","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. ","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets","The better incrementals, is that in one or two segments?  Or is that pretty broad-based?  And how do you think about the sustainability?","Alexander Cutler ","We still think the right number, Jeff, full year, is to think about roughly this 33% incremental.  And you\u2019ll recall in our guidance at the end of the fourth quarter the reason we used the 33% this year and the previous year had been 28% was that we expensed $50 million of restructuring, which we don\u2019t anticipate doing this year, and we get the savings from that.  So we still think the 33% is the right number in that regard for this year.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets ","And then the order resiliency and some of the strength you talked about last year in electrical systems and services, what\u2019s really driving that?  And where do you think you\u2019re seeing the outperformance?","Alexander Cutler ","If you think about our fourth quarter, our fourth quarter where we were talking about the market having - I\u2019m talking to electrical right now and I\u2019m putting the two segments together.  We talked about growth had slowed in the second half of last year, and we think that it has carried over into the first half of this year.  It\u2019s consistent with kind of our overall forecast, talking about growth slowing toward the back half of last year and then being fairly low this year globally.","Our bookings continue to be better than market conditions, and we think there are a number of reasons to think that will continue.  But you may recall in the fourth quarter last year we had overall bookings up like 7.5% at a time where the market was barely growing.  ","Now, most of that got driven by some of what I\u2019d call the systems businesses, and large projects that we were successful in booking.  We didn\u2019t see quite as much of that in terms of that outgrowth in the first quarter, but we don\u2019t see anything fundamentally that changes that competitive positioning.  ","And based upon a number of the products that I mentioned earlier to Joe\u2019s question, we are launching an unprecedented array of new products in our electrical business between the base Eaton business and the legacy Cooper business, a number of which are right in the dead center of these big energy issues.  ","And we\u2019ve talked a lot about LED in lighting.  We were well up over 20%in terms of the LED content, in terms of LED product content, in our first quarter.  This whole new edge lighting for recess application we think opens up the biggest segment of the lighting area, and we\u2019re right out front if you\u2019ve had a chance to read anything about out what went on at Lightfair.  So we\u2019re really quite bullish in terms of the new products and what that\u2019s going to drive for us here.  ","Donald Bullock ","Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.  ","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies","I might be getting a little bit ahead of myself here, but I wonder, Sandy, as you\u2019ve had another quarter under your belt to look at Cooper, whether you see any evolution in your thinking about potential synergies in, say, \u201914 or \u201915 and maybe even comment on the sales side as well.","Alexander Cutler ","I\u2019d say not at this point.  What I would say is, and I\u2019ve said it in a couple of forums, that the transaction and the business is everything we hoped it would be and more.  And that\u2019s why we were comfortable increasing our original estimate for 2013 from $75 million to $90 million.  That\u2019s why we were comfortable increasing our mature year total [unintelligible] pretax earnings up another $30 million.  So we\u2019re up to $290 million.  ","Then we\u2019ve maintained $160 million on the tax side.  So all that feels really good.  It\u2019s a little early, still.  We\u2019ve got elements of our team that are very heavily involved, I guess I would say, in all of the blocking and tackling to make this happen.  But the customer reception, the channel reception, what we see in the cost reduction, we\u2019ll get everything that we\u2019ve talked about.   ","And I think so importantly that the broader array of capabilities we\u2019ve got right now has done nothing but strengthen us in that regard.  So I\u2019d say a little early in terms of taking that next look at the \u201914, \u201915, \u201916.  We\u2019ll revisit that as we get out toward the end of the year and get a couple of quarters under our belt.","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies ","And then it sounds like you\u2019re saying the destocking in the electrical side has sort of run its course, and maybe even got a little overdone.  Similar comments on hydraulics?  I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth.","Alexander Cutler ","No, I think all these issues, whenever you have channel destocking, there is a point where you get down to a minimum that you have to have to be able to satisfy kind of daily sales.  And obviously hydraulics went through four quarters of negative bookings, and over a year, I think you get that pretty well shaken out.  ","I\u2019d say the market that\u2019s been hardest for us to call in hydraulics, in terms of not only the distributor channel but also the OEM channel, how much product they\u2019ve got, finished product, at their dealers, has been China.  ","And I would say our insight is not perfect in that regard, because I think we\u2019ve been fooled a couple of times over the last year or two, trying to be sure we had our hands on that.  It feels like that\u2019s starting to turn, but that one always takes a little longer than we think.  ","I would say here in the electrical business, we\u2019ve got a pretty good handle here in the U.S. and Europe through our major distributor partners as to where they are in that regard.  You can\u2019t get down much under a 30-day stocking.  You just can\u2019t handle the kind of volumes.  ","So our best thinking on this at this point is we saw it in the first quarter.  We think we\u2019ve understood it.  We spent a lot of time with our channel partners, and we don\u2019t expect to see another quarter of it in the second quarter.","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies ","And then April, has that kind of unfolded the same way?","Alexander Cutler ","Yeah, it\u2019s a little unfortunate for us right now, with bringing all our systems together between our traditional electrical business and Cooper.  We\u2019re not quite as fully integrated as we will be in a couple of months.  So I don\u2019t have quite as much up to date data for you there.  But I think the tone is reasonable here in the second quarter, and it feels like the season.  ","I would say the one business we\u2019ve not talked about here on the call, which has been one of the points of weakness in the electrical industry in the U.S. has been the utility market.  And I think versus some of the forecasts that were out from the industry associations that forecast utility demand, the first quarter was a weaker quarter in terms of utility demand.  And our own thinking for this year is that while it will be a good year, it\u2019s probably not going to be a record year.  And that\u2019s all reflected in our guidance at this point.","Donald Bullock ","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel Nicolaus.  ","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus","Can you comment, we\u2019ve seen declines in copper prices and declines in steel prices the last couple of months at least.  Can you talk about how that flows through pricing in both of your electrical segments and in general?  I would assume it\u2019s easy to pass through pricing on electrical products.  Am I thinking about that the right way?","Alexander Cutler ","You\u2019re right in terms of clearly versus a couple of years ago.  The drumbeat doesn\u2019t seem to be a move up on commodities.  So clearly I think you\u2019re seeing pricing in the markets obviously be a little bit more conservative on that as well.  We tend to buy, as we\u2019ve pointed out, more on the spot markets than we do on the commodity markets.  ","Now, the spot markets have come down, but not quite to the degree that the future markets have in that regard.  But we are in a little easier commodity market at the present time than we were a couple of years ago when they were rocketing quarter to quarter and it was very difficult to stay up with them.  ","That\u2019s obviously helpful in a time period where growth is as slow as it is on a global basis.  And so yeah, I\u2019d say when you look at this overall environment, I\u2019d say slow growth, more stable commodities.  And that really puts the load on us in terms of executing well.  And that\u2019s exactly what we think we were able to do in the first quarter.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus ","If I could just jump over to aerospace, you commented that you had had a strong order quarter from out of the military side of aerospace.  I think everybody\u2019s expecting strength on the commercial side, but maybe not on the military side.  If you could give some more color around that and whether or not you think it\u2019s sustainable?","Alexander Cutler ","Well, our own forecast, again, is that we\u2019ll see the military markets come down by about 6% this year.  We have not changed that view of where things are going to be.  You just can\u2019t have every supplier having increases in the military market and come up to a negative 6%.  That\u2019s not going to work out.  ","We do believe that a number of the platforms we\u2019re on are the platforms that are going to be consolidated around, such as the Joint Strike Fighter or the new tanker.  A number of the heavy lift rotorcraft.  And it\u2019s on those platforms that we secured additional long term commitments, and that\u2019s really what helped with this very strong 7% quarter.","So whether it was commercial transport, business jets, military fighters, military transports, we had a very good quarter in that regard.  Now, just recall, remember again in the aerospace business you often get orders and they may ship over some period of time.  So it\u2019s almost never in one month and out of the next.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus ","And it looks to me like you paid off the only debt maturity you had for this year.  You\u2019re likely to generate $1 billion plus in cash, even after the dividend, for the remainder of the year.  Can you talk about the priorities for that cash?","Alexander Cutler","Yeah, we have just one more slug of debt, term debt, that we can pay off this year.  Rick, do you want to comment on that?  ","Richard Fearon ","That would be in May.  We\u2019ve got $300 million in May, and another $7 million in October.  So another $307 million.  But your point is correct.  We have quite substantial cash flow even considering that, and our priority, as we\u2019ve said, both for financial and managerial reasons, is that our priority is to use the cash flow to pay down as much debt as we can, including, to the extent that it makes sense, and we can get to it execution, perhaps even paying some debt down by buying it off-market.  We did a very small amount of that in the first quarter, but we will continue to look at that as the year progresses.","Alexander Cutler ","And that\u2019s the agenda, obviously, what you\u2019ve seen us do already this year.  A 10.5% increase in our dividend we announced in the first quarter.  We said that as we went through this period of time where we\u2019d be largely out of the M&A market, to the points Rick made, that we maintain our overall commitment in terms of our capital expenditures.  That\u2019s roughly $700 million this year.  ","Our commitment in terms of increasing our dividend in line with our future expectation of our earnings, that was the 10.5% increase we made in the dividend this year, pay down the debt to get us back to a solid A.  It means we stay out of the M&A market for any appreciable activity here for a couple of years until we get there.  So that\u2019s very consistent with what we laid out going back to last May, as what would be our game plan in terms of the balance sheet.  ","Donald Bullock ","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan.  ","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan","","When you were giving your comments, you said over here.  Are you guys in Ireland?  Or are you in Cleveland?","Alexander Cutler ","We seem to be in the air all the time.  No, we\u2019re in the States right now.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan ","I wanted to ask you, Sandy, if you\u2019d give us a little bit more color on the two electrical businesses and their exposures to government spending.  I know that Eaton\u2019s core business did well over the last couple of years on a lot of retrofitting of government buildings.  Can you just give us a little color now on both businesses and their exposure?","Alexander Cutler ","Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a major business there.  I\u2019d say the major business really is aerospace you\u2019ve got a fairly significant piece that relates to military spending.  I would say that when you try to think about the non-residential market in the U.S., and of course this gets a little complex in terms of whether you include road building and other things.  But the type of stuff that uses electrical equipment, to our best estimate, and believe me this is an estimate, so please don\u2019t take this to a decimal point, there\u2019s 25-30% of the total market that sort of relates to where government tends to have an influence.  ","I\u2019m talking about federal government here, primarily.  But there is some state government in there as well.  And that is an area where you\u2019re right, there has been some very significant energy efficiency mandates.  ","And honestly, those mandates have not changed.  So the question is how are they going to be funded.  And those mandates apply both to government buildings plus there are incentives available for people if they\u2019re building more effective buildings in terms of the private marketplace as well.  ","We\u2019ve not seen an enormous change there yet, but our expectation has been that that will slow down.  It\u2019s going to get crimped in this budget issue, and that\u2019s why we say we think about our non-res markets maybe 3-4% with that included at this point.","But frankly, those pressures have been being felt, we believe, in the federal government, really since the second quarter of last year.  So I don\u2019t see that as a big game-changer at this point.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan ","And would electrical products be the business that will be more impacted by that?  Or would it be services?","Alexander Cutler ","I would say that it\u2019s probably more the systems and services, more of that would tend to flow in that.  But there are businesses that are over in the product business that would have product that would go in there as well.  So a business such as lighting, for example, which is in our product segment, clearly part of the big push is to try to get far more energy efficiency.  And one of the best plays anybody can have is to think about relighting these buildings.  So I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably the one in there that\u2019s got a bigger play.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan ","Yeah, that\u2019s kind of what I was thinking on the lighting side.  And then just on hydraulics, on your outlook.  I mean, you know that the agribusiness OEM order book was up significantly.  But you didn\u2019t change your outlook for end market.  Can you talk about is there a bigger drag elsewhere, or is this just being conservative in case things slow again as it goes through the year?","Alexander Cutler ","I think there would be two areas in there.  I would say that we haven\u2019t changed our view so much of the U.S. or Asia on the end market, but we are in Europe consistent with our view of what\u2019s happened there with car sales there, with what\u2019s happened with distributor stocking in the electrical business.  ","Also, we look at the hydraulics market in Europe of being influenced by that.  So that\u2019s a little bit of a drag.  I\u2019d say the construction equipment business, it has been a drag, and it\u2019s continuing to be.  I\u2019m talking about the U.S. and Asia in that regard.  Mining is clearly a little bit worse than it\u2019s been.  I think we\u2019ve all read about that, and I think it\u2019s related to the commodity question that was raised earlier.  ","And then I\u2019d say the big plus has been just, as you noted, the ag market.  A big turnaround from what has appeared to us many OEMs were trying to reduce inventories still last year.  It appears to us now that they\u2019ve flipped that switch, and we saw very strong orders placed.  And some of them were for future capacity, but frankly some of them were right for the springtime build.","Donald Bullock ","The next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.  ","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners ","Following up on the comment about sequential growth in bookings and hydraulics, that 30% jump fourth quarter.  What is that normally, seasonally?","Alexander Cutler ","It\u2019s not odd to have a jump from the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter to the first quarter.  It\u2019s been very hard the last couple of years to give you a normal, because we\u2019ve been going through these very dramatic changes.  But I think if you assume between fourth quarter and first quarter that you\u2019re going to get a 10% or 15% jump, that\u2019s not a terrible number.  But I would tell you that it\u2019s been hard to give you a normal number the last couple of years.  Any way you look at it, after these four quarters of quarter to quarter declines, it\u2019s a big jump, and we think directionally it gives us a view that we\u2019re starting to make the turn here.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners ","One of your competitors said last week that some of the weakness they saw on the bookings side was more for long term delivery schedule, kind of trimming the out quarters rather than anything that you would call near term weakness.  Is that your characterization as well?  Maybe a little bit of near term and a little bit of out?  I guess just some color there would be helpful.","Alexander Cutler ","Last year we saw quite a bit of long term cutbacks.  That consistent with what we saw in the 2008\/2009 time period, where, when people weren\u2019t clear what their visibility was going forward, they were just trying to get everything off the books.  I would say we saw most of that hitting us last year.  Now, we\u2019re seeing a little bit more of the, it\u2019s not only the quick, hurry, I need something next week, it\u2019s also trying to get a call on capacity as we go out a little further.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners ","And then just one last one from me on the data center side.  Any change in momentum on small data centers versus large ones?  Any update you can give us there on the momentum there?","Alexander Cutler ","I would say not much.  You\u2019ll recall when we gave our guidance for this year, after a very weak year last year, we thought that market would be growing kind of between 1% and 2% this year.  And we don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s really changing that at this point.  A couple of pieces, as you\u2019ve all listened to the various different tech companies report, there\u2019s not a big new generation of servers coming out.  There\u2019s not, you know, many of the kind of technology nodes that tend to get people to flip at this point.  ","And there\u2019s still a fair amount of work going on as people are trying to think about, do they build their own versus do they continue their own work on virtualization, or do they kick things to the cloud.  So we think this year is going to be a relatively slow side on the power quality side, and that\u2019s consistent with what we said earlier this year.","Donald Bullock ","Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow.  ","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research ","Can we just talk a little bit about the European exposure in the electrical business, electrical products and electrical system services.  Electrical products, weaker bookings in the quarter.  Margins [unintelligible].  What\u2019s going on in the European [unintelligible]?  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big in that business, but can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking of it and get some color on that?  And same thing for electrical system services.","Alexander Cutler ","I think, again, in Europe, you\u2019ll recall from Tom Gross\u2019s presentation, that our business in systems and services and the traditional Eaton business was bigger in the U.S. than it was outside the U.S., because we hadn\u2019t had the traditional IEC assemblies business, and our services business, which tends to work on that installed base has not fully developed yet.  ","So Europe\u2019s not a real big issue there.  So more of a products orientation for the traditional business.  You\u2019d find that overall, Eaton, we talk about Europe being on the order of about 18% of our sales.  So when we acquired Cooper, Europe became an even smaller portion of Eaton\u2019s overall sales.","In terms of the geographic exposure, the product business has got a bigger exposure to Europe than does the assemblies.  It\u2019s about two to one.  And when we gave guidance at year-end, we were talking about, in terms of geographic guidance, that the systems business, systems and services, had a 14% or 15% end market European, and that\u2019s EMEA, so that includes the Middle East content.  And the products was closer to 27-28%.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research ","I\u2019m trying to get some idea, as you look at your electrical products, 14.7% margin in the first quarter, bookings down 3%, and you\u2019ve got to get to 16%, with a bigger European exposure.  So trying to get some color on that and how easy to get there.  At one point, even the electrical system services, you beat the 14% guidance for the quarter.  You\u2019re telling us that it\u2019s going to get weaker over the rest of the year.  So I\u2019m trying to get some idea\u2026","Alexander Cutler  ","","I think what we\u2019re really telling you is that we\u2019ve got two new segments here that we have one quarter of experience with.  And it\u2019s just too early to be changing the guidance.  And I think as we have a little bit more experience working with the new businesses we acquired, we\u2019ll have a little better handle on how they kind of go through the year, if you will.  Both, to us, feel very reasonable as we look at the guidance for the remainder of the year this year.  And the products business, even in a weakened Europe, still has the seasonality, because the weather patterns happen the same kind of way that they do hear.  So they\u2019ll be off a lower base.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research ","And with a follow up on the ESS business, is the weakness of the utility business the reason why you\u2019re so cautious on operating profitability?","Alexander Cutler ","No, I just note it because I think you\u2019ve heard from a number of other participants in the electrical industry that utility was weaker in the first quarter than perhaps they thought it was going to be.  Still a really nice business for us, but people who have anticipated the utilities were going to be in an unfettered ability to spend cash, if you\u2019ve watched what\u2019s going on and the continuation of what went on last year with the difficulty utilities have got, and to be able to get rate increases, they need to get those rate increases to have some of the money to spend.  And that\u2019s gotten quite tight in this environment.","Donald Bullock ","Our next question comes from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer.  ","Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer","Question about the electrical strength in the U.S. called out for both segments.  It seems like some of the distribution commentary has been that it\u2019s been weaker.  Just wondering if you could comment on the contrast between channels, whether that\u2019s direct distribution, OEM, MRO.  Any flavor in that regard?","Alexander Cutler ","No, I would say that we tend to think of the markets as covering the whole residential, non-residential, the industrial OEM, and user side.  We think about verticals like oil and gas, for example, that are continuing to spend quite a bit.  Pharma\u2019s quite active, continues at this point.  And we think about the utility markets that we mentioned.  ","And then big drivers that are going on in the industry such as led replacement, the use of vacuum interruption, a variety of different technologies.  And so our characterization of where we think our market\u2019s going to grow, I think we were pulled back in the first quarter in terms of being able to achieve those full year numbers by the distributor destock.  Generally what gets destocked has to be restocked, so we think those things tend to work out over a couple of quarters.  ","So no, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re backed off in terms of\u2014I would say, like all of the markets that were out there, we think the growth is going to be a little bit toward the lower side versus the higher side.  But we still think it\u2019s going to be a good year of growth.  ","Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer ","And then for the electrical segment, you did refer to just having a few months with the full segmentation, but is the $7 billion for EP in the 69 for ESS still a good way for us to think about the year?","Alexander Cutler ","It\u2019s our best thinking at this point.  Whether they\u2019re going to end up exactly in those two segments, I\u2019d say that\u2019s the best way to think about modeling it at this point.  We still feel pretty good, obviously, about the 13.9 in total, and I think that\u2019s going to be the balancing item.  And the total will be the balance, and we\u2019ll see how well we did in getting these split up into the two segments.","Donald Bullock ","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.  ","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities","Just wanted to look at the growth.  You\u2019re forecasting a little bit differently.  In a lot of different company conference calls there\u2019s been discussion about increased quoting activity that\u2019s just not translating into orders right now.  Is it your view that we\u2019re kind of in a capex air pocket?  And then within that, are you seeing more customers focus on operating expense in place of capital investment outside of Europe?","Alexander Cutler ","I\u2019d say it\u2019s quite different, Andy, for us by individual segment.  Let me take an area like oil and gas for example.  We continue to see people moving forward on very major projects as well as their MRO.  I would say in mining, clearly people have gotten very cautious, and are looking for ways to kind of pull back.  ","In residential, I would say it\u2019s still very much rebuilding of the industry, and trying to get everyone to\u2026 I heard an analogy this morning that said you try to get all the players back at the party.  You know, it\u2019s been quite different being at a million or 800,000 starts versus when you were up at 2.1.  ","I\u2019d say on this construction equipment side, I think people are still cautious.  On ag, it\u2019s starting to feel like people are interested in running on more cylinders again.  So fairly inconsistent if you would, and I think those are often the attributes of slow growth, overall GDP.  And that still is our kind of predominant view.  ","Again, aerospace commercial, quite busy.  Great news.  The 787 flying again.  The industry seems to be opening up.  On the defense side, obviously it\u2019s lower.  And so I think that\u2019s where this execution is so important as a company, in that our opportunity, having these 5 acquisitions to integrate, is we\u2019ve got an opportunity to create synergies and create earnings per share even without big, strong, top market growth going on.  And I think that\u2019s one of the issues that really makes Eaton attractive through here.   ","Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo Securities ","And then one detailed question related to pension expense.  I think you\u2019re looking for increases in the 2013 guidance, but Q1 seemed to show a year-to-year decline.  Is there something special about Q1?  Or is it just a timing thing?","Richard Fearon ","Pension expense does vary by quarter, based upon the timing of retirements, which we can\u2019t exactly plan on.  But our expectation is you\u2019ll see a modest increase in pension expense this year.  And we believe that accordingly, you\u2019ll see some higher levels of pension costs as you look at the balance of the quarters.","Donald Bullock ","Our final question today comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley ","Just wanted to clarify the comment you made about industry reductions.  You seemed to indicate that in products it was particularly heavy in January\/February.  And [unintelligible] is the same way.  So did we see an unusually weak start to the year, to the quarter, which then got better into March?","Alexander Cutler ","Slightly better, then of course March is always the month of the quarter, and the first quarter.  And in some senses you could almost take off the first month.  I would say slightly better, but I think, again, it wasn\u2019t the rate of acceleration that we\u2019ve seen some other years.  I think that\u2019s reflective, again, of this slower growth environment.  And I do think there\u2019s some caution in the air in terms of whether distributors want to put a lot of inventory on their shelves, not knowing, exactly, how this next round of the fiscal discussions go in in the U.S.  So we think there\u2019s plenty of room for some additional recovery here.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley ","And then switching to aero margins, for me this is a big bright spot in the quarter.  You\u2019ve referenced that after market\u2019s still under pressure, yet you showed a big sequential improvement from the second half run rates into Q1.  So just wondering if there\u2019s anything that you should call out there in terms of the strength?","Alexander Cutler ","I think remember in the fourth quarter we took $4 million restructuring expense, and we did that because as we were looking at the size of the business, and as forecasted we mentioned growth on commercial, negative growth on defense, we needed to resize the organization.  We also closed one small plant.  And so getting that in place is a piece of helping us manage more successfully in this changed environment.  We feel pretty solid about this 14% range, and as you say, it\u2019s great to start off well in this regard.  And I\u2019d say it doesn\u2019t hurt to have this backlog piece turning up a little bit for us as well.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley ","Then just as a quick follow up on that, as the after-market starts to improve for the year, would you expect to build off that 14% through the year?","Alexander Cutler ","I think at this point our best estimate is, that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t changed guidance at this point, because we think it\u2019s 14 for the full year, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s early still.  And so I\u2019ll have a better feel maybe after we get through two quarters.","Donald Bullock ","Thank you all for participating in today\u2019s call.  As always, we will be available for follow up questions following this call.  Thank you very much.  "],"8082":["Eaton Corp.

For the conference, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I'll turn the call now over to Mr. Don Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us for today for Eaton's first quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today as usual are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer.","Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the company's performance in the first quarter along with our outlook for 2018. As we've done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments.","The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation are posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that the press release and presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of the call will be accessible on our website and will be available for replay.","Before I get started, I do want to remind you that our comments today will include some statements on expected future results of the company and as therefore are forward looking statements. The actual results may differ from those from our forecasted protections to a whole wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in both the earnings release and the presentation and they're also outlined in our 8-K.","With that I'll turn it over to Craig to go through the presentation.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Okay. Thanks, Don. Appreciate it. Hey, before I dive into Q1 results this morning, I thought I'd take a moment to just reiterate three key elements of the strategy that we've been working on as a company and how we're focusing on growing the company, expanding margins and really effectively allocating capital.","First, our organic growth initiative really is focused on new technology, how we're leveraging our channel and service capabilities, creating products that play across the entire spectrum of our customers' requirements, what we call delivering superior value.","Next we intend to continue to expand our margins by restructuring to eliminate fixed costs, to drive operational improvements across our plants and functions, and we're being more selective in where we invest; what we call fixing the tail and growing the head.","Finally, we continue to be good stewards of capital, first by investing in our existing businesses, playing to win in every business that we're in, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and being disciplined in our approach to M&A.","By consistently doing these three things well, we believe we'll drive superior value for our shareholders both in the short term and over the long term. And we made solid progress in Q1. A few examples that we've noted on page four. We launched our new eMobility segment targeted at growth in electric vehicles. A $2 billion to $4 billion opportunity for Eaton and we're clearly working this opportunity with 30 plus pursuits that we're working on as we speak. And we'll certainly talk about this more later in the presentation.","We continue to make progress towards our goal of digitally enabling our product portfolio including addressing the necessary infrastructure needed to ensure industry approvals and needed security protocols. We launched a new Microgrid initiative in Africa, combining our expertise in Microgrid management with energy storage.","And we also had a very successful quarter growing our penetration in hyperscale data centers with over $60 million of new wins in the quarter. We launched a new Power Xpert circuit breaker product line for the harsh, hazardous and corrosive circuit protection market, a market that we believe is $500 million in size and a new opportunity for us to serve it. And lastly, we continue to execute on our ongoing restructuring actions and completed three site closures in the quarter. So while not an exhaustive list, we thought it would be helpful to provide a few notable examples of progress that we're making towards our strategy.","Now turning to our financial results for Q1 on page five, I'll just add a bit of color to what you've already seen in our reported results. Earnings per share were $1.10, up 15% over Q1 2017 and at the high end of our guidance range of $1 to $1.10.","Our results were primarily driven by strong revenues, up 8% over Q1. This is driven by 6% organic growth, the highest growth that we reported since Q4 of 2011. And foreign exchange added 3% or approximately $150 million to reported revenues. We had expected $150 million of forex for the entire year, so certainly a strong start there as well.","Booking strength continued in the quarter with notable growth in Hydraulics and another quarter of strength in Electrical Systems & Services. Our operating cash flow in the quarter was $339 million. And if you recall, Q1 is typically our weakest quarter of cash flow generation. In addition, we're adding working capital to support higher growth in the quarter and a stronger outlook for the year.","We repurchased $300 million of our shares in the quarter and are on track to repurchase $800 million in shares for the full year. And finally, we increased our dividend by 10%. This is consistent with our long term goal of growing our dividend in line with our long term earnings.","Turning to page six, we show a summary of the income statement for the quarter. Here I point out that our 8% growth was made up of 6% organic, 3% FX, offset by negative 1% due to the divestiture in Electrical Systems & Services and the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture last year.","Margins were 15.2%, 80 basis points above prior year and a Q1 record. We think a good indication that our restructuring plans are paying off. Consistent with our plans, our incremental margins on organic growth were approximately 30% in the quarter and we remain confident in our ability to achieve 40% incrementals for the full year. We did see good volume leverage in the quarter, generating 12% net income growth on 2% organic growth and we expect this relationship to improve as the year unfolds.","Moving into the segments, I will begin with Electrical Products. Our revenues were up 5% with 1% organic growth. Sales in this segment were impacted by our Lighting business which was down approximately 10% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of Lighting, organic growth in the segment was 6%, so strong growth excluding Lighting.","Maybe just a word on Lighting weakness. The weakness was driven primarily by what you've seen, reported weak markets. There were also a number of large projects in last year's results and management's decision, quite frankly, not to chase some unattractive projects during the quarter. We do expect Lighting to have a relatively better next three quarters. And consistent with our prior guidance, we think the business will be down mid-single-digit for the year.","For the remainder of the business, we saw strength in a number of end markets with particular strength in products going into industrial applications. And geographically, we saw strength in Europe and in North America. Bookings were down 2% in the quarter, also driven by Lighting weakness. Excluding Lighting, bookings were up 2% with strength in Power Distribution Components and Industrial Controls.","Notably, our margins in the quarter were up 30 basis points over the first quarter, a first quarter record as well. The results for Electrical Systems & Services are on page eight. Revenues were up 4% in the quarter with organic up 2.3%. We rounded it to 2% on the chart. Foreign exchange was up 2.2%. We also rounded it to 2% on the chart. And the divestiture of our stake in a small joint venture reduced revenues by approximately 1%.","In the quarter, we saw market strength in services in harsh and hazardous and power distribution assemblies for industrial markets. And geographically, the U.S. markets saw the greatest strength.","Bookings in the quarter were up 8% on strength in industrial projects and in services. And as we noted in Q4, our backlog for industrial projects continued to expand and as a result, we would expect to see organic growth accelerate beginning in the second quarter. I'd also note that our operating margins improved by 50 basis points in this segment.","Next, taking a look at the Hydraulics business, sales were very strong, up 21% with organic revenues up 16% and foreign exchange adding 5%. In the quarter, all regions were up significantly with particular strength in construction equipment and through the distribution channel.","Bookings were up 14% in the quarter with strength coming primarily from OEM customers and really all end markets. And we also saw booking strength across all geographies. Given our very large backlog, we expect this market will remain strong throughout 2018.","Margins were 12.7% in the quarter, up 250 basis points over Q1 2017 and we continue to see the benefits of our restructuring efforts as well as the benefits of higher revenues. Now we continue to experience some challenges as we continue to ramp this business in the face of very strong demand levels, but we do expect to see improvements beginning in Q2. And we're certainly on track to deliver our full year margin guidance in this segment.","For Aerospace, we had another strong quarter. We saw 7% sales growth with 6% organic. Sales growth was driven primarily by strength in military which was up 13%. And the military strength extended across really all categories including the military aftermarket.","Always lumpy orders in the quarter were up 1% on aftermarket and strength in rotorcraft offset by weakness in both military and commercial transport. And margins were 19.4%, up 90 basis points over last year and once again, a Q1 record.","We also had a very strong quarter in the Vehicle business. Sales up 14%, of which organic revenues were up 13%. Foreign exchange added 3% and the divestiture impact from the joint venture formation with Cummins was a negative 2%.","NAFTA heavy duty truck production was up 45% in the quarter and also Brazil truck and bus was up nearly 6%. So lots of strength in our truck business around the world. In addition, order strength continued through the quarter. We now expect NAFTA heavy duty production will be 295,000 units in 2018, significantly higher than the outlook of 275,000 that we had at the start of the year.","U.S. and China light vehicle markets are expected to be flat for the year. Europe a bit better. And strong growth in the emerging markets, specifically in India and Brazil.","Margins were 14.8% in the quarter, up 110 basis points on better than expected revenue and benefits from prior restructuring efforts. Margins, while good, were held back somewhat by higher restructuring costs in this quarter and we certainly expect them to improve in the out quarters.","Page 12 is a first look at the financial results of our eMobility segment. You'll find 2016 results for eMobility, including the restatement of our Electrical Products and Vehicle segments in our 10-Q which will be out later today.","Sales in the quarter were $77 million, up 22% from prior year, 19% coming from organic growth. The organic growth in the quarter was driven by new European electric vehicle penetration and growth in electrical products going in traditional internal combustion engine applications in North America.","Margins in the quarter were 14.3%. This is down from prior year due to additional R&D investment and spending on specific customer programs. This is an exciting new segment for Eaton and we expect to see double-digit growth in this segment for some time to come.","So before we move into the remainder of the year, I do want to provide some additional background on our new eMobility segment for those who may not have had an opportunity to join us at our investment conference in New York.","eMobility is really a great example of how we're capturing synergies across the company, in this case, to pursue emerging market opportunities in electric vehicles. So what are we doing? In simple terms we're combining the unique industry knowledge, customer relationships and, I'd say, application knowledge from our Vehicle business with the proven technology that we've created in our Electrical business. All of the technologies and products that are needed to support electric vehicles were already selling in homes and factories and offices in our Electrical business.","More development and customer specific changes are certainly needed, but this is exactly what our Vehicle business does very well. And electrification is a good thing for Eaton. Our addressable content per vehicle is actually 8 to 10 times greater on an electric vehicle than it is on an internal combustion engine.","So just turning to page 14, electrification of vehicles will no doubt be a very large market and we've decided to really focus on those areas where we can create the right to win and have unique technology. On page 14, we show you the specifics of where we intend to focus and that's in power electronics and conversion and on power distribution and circuit protection.","You can see from the description that these technologies are critical to the safe and reliable operation of the vehicle. But what you really can't see is what we already do. And that's \u2013 we have a very large business in both of these technologies across our electrical markets.","We're a market leader in power conversion from our UPS business and in power distribution and circuit protection from both our Bussmann fuses as well as our legacy circuit breaker business. We're already selling many of the electrical products into both electric vehicles and into internal combustion engine markets, and look forward to exploring the opportunity to expanding this opportunity as the electric vehicle market continues to grow.","On page 15, we included an outlook for 2018. And here we expect revenues to be approximately $320 million, 12% organic growth. And we think the segment will deliver 12% and 13% full year margins. Our margins were down versus 2017 as a result of a significant step up in R&D spending and where we expect to spend approximately $30 million in this segment for the year.","More importantly, I'd say we expect a serve a market that will grow to over $33 billion over the next 10 years or so, and we think Eaton can capture $2 billion to $4 billion of additional revenue by that same timeframe. So we're working with a number of global OEMs as we speak and are certainly excited about the opportunity to make eMobility a meaningful part of the company.","At this point I'll turn to our outlook which is on page 15. Excuse me, page 16. We now expect organic revenues to grow 5% for the year up 1% from prior estimates driven by, as you can see here, an increase in both Hydraulics and Vehicle.","We expect Hydraulics to be up an additional 3% and now forecast a 13% increase for the year and Vehicle to be up an additional 3% and we now expect a 4% increase for the year. The other segments are unchanged from our prior guidance.","And for margins on page 17, we're increasing our segment margin guidance for Eaton from 16.4% to 17% or 16.7% at the midpoint, up from our prior guidance of 16.6% at the midpoint. We're also raising the margin expectations for our Vehicle segment to 16.5% to 17.1% for the year.","And as we noted last year, we'd only intend to change margin guidance for our segments when they're outside of the prior guidance or ranges provided, hence the increase in Vehicle. And our other segments remain unchanged as our expectations for the year continue to be within the prior ranges.","On page 18, we provide a summary of Q2 and our 2018 guidance. For Q2 we expect EPS of $1.25 to $1.35. This assumes 5% organic growth, margins of 16.2% to 16. 8%, and a tax rate of 11.5% and 12.5%. For the full year we now expect EPS of $5.10 to $5.30, up $0.10 at the midpoint from our prior guidance; organic revenues of 5%, up 1%. We think foreign exchange will be a positive $250 million now, $100 million above our prior guidance.","We think segment margins are now expected to be, as I noted, 16.4% to 17%. Corporate expenses will be slightly higher than what we originally forecasted, $10 million above 2017. The prior guidance was flat. And we expect our tax rate to be down modestly with a range of 12.5% to 14.5%, down from our prior guidance of 13% to 15%. Cash flow, CapEx, share repurchase and restructuring cost assumptions are really unchanged from the prior guidance.","And so just before I turn things back to Don for Q&A, I did want to once again take this opportunity to summarize why we think Eaton is a very attractive investment opportunity. The first I'd say, our markets have returned to growth and we think the next three years will be better than the last three.","In addition, we have a number of attractive organic growth initiatives that we think will allow us to grow faster than our end markets. Our restructuring is paying off. Our margins will be at an all time high in 2018, and we expect our margins to continue to improve.","Our balance sheet is in great shape. Net debt to capital is below 30%. Our pension plan is now funded at over 95%. Our cash flow continues to be strong and we expect to consistently deliver cash flow at or above 100% of net income, while generating $8 billion of free cash flow over the next three years.","And we're also returning cash to shareholders through a high dividend yield. Our dividend today is north of 3.5% and we're buying back shares, 1% to 2% on an ongoing basis. And lastly, we'll deliver 11% to 12% EPS growth over the next three years. So we think it's a fairly compelling story and, once again, a very good reason to take another look at how you view the stock.","So with those opening comments, I'll pause and turn it back to Don for Q&A","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Operator's going to provide you instructions for the Q&A. But before I do, I would like to remind you that we have a large number of questions on the call today, and I'd ask you that you \u2013 to try to keep it at an hour today, I'd ask you sort of keep your questions \u2013 limit your questions to a single question and a follow-up.","And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to give you instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our first question today comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Morning.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Craig, can we maybe just start on Lighting for a second? It's been a bit of a drag on growth in orders for the last several quarters and I'm just curious, like, how are you guys thinking about this business internally just from a strategic perspective? And how important is it to the overall portfolio?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. I appreciate the question. First of all, I'd say that the Lighting results in Q1 were certainly were below our expectations as a company, but very much in line with our outlook for the year. As we said back in New York, we thought this would be the one segment inside the company that would be under pressure during the course of the year. And so we still believe, down low single digit is very much in line with our thinking when we set our plan at the beginning of the year.","And to your point around strategically how we view Lighting, I'd say Lighting, very much like the rest of the company, has to live up to our company's expectations around the criteria that we set for what an attractive business looks like.","And we talked about it being \u2013 businesses have to be leaders in their markets. They have to grow in excess of GDP. They have to deliver attractive return on sale and attractive return on net asset. And where we're in cyclical businesses, they have to deliver a minimum level of profitability. And so I would say, the Lighting business inside of Eaton today is a business that has a lot of positive things and a lot positives going on, but it's also a business, I would say, today that still has something to prove.","And so with respect to Lighting, we have work to do to turn this into the type of business that meets all of Eaton's criteria for businesses that we want to be in. So we continue to invest, we continue to like many of the prospects, but we clearly have something to prove in this business.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful color, Craig. And maybe for my second question, if I could just focus on ESS growth in orders. Clearly, the order momentum is there. It sounds like large project activity is picking up. No change to the organic growth guidance, but you're expecting an acceleration in 2Q.","So maybe just provide a little bit of commentary around your thoughts on growth for the remainder of the year, the acceleration that's expected. And whether this is one where potentially we could get outside the range, just given how strong the order momentum has been.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. I mean, at this point, I think, I would say, it's early in the year and, but perhaps too early to make a change to the guidance. But we are, in fact, seeing very strong growth in our Electrical Systems & Services business, driven as we said at the beginning of the year, by power distribution, large assemblies, harsh and hazardous markets, the Crouse-Hinds business, and certainly, today we're really seeing perhaps even more strength than we originally anticipated in our three-phase power quality business.","And so our negotiations are up solidly for Q1 as well. And so we certainly are hopeful that this business continues to grow at the rate that we expect and we'll have to take another look at it in Q2. But at this point, we think the guidance that we provided is prudent and we're optimistic that this business continues to grow not only in 2018, but we think the outlook for the next few years for our Electrical Systems & Services business is quite positive.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good to hear. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with UBS.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Can you maybe just give a little more color on the incremental walk that you're talking about for the rest of the year? I know obviously restructuring and you got the benefits from that, maybe pricing actions versus material and wage inflation and productivity. Just little more color for how that's progressing given the 1Q performance.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, and I'd say that if we think about our incremental performance in Q1, they were in fact largely in line with what our own expectations were as we've built our profit plan . And so we were quite pleased overall with how we did in Q1.","And as you think about why things will improve in subsequent quarters, I'd say there's really two pieces. You hit on one. It's restructuring, net spending versus benefits and those are certainly will increase in each of the subsequent quarters.","And the other thing I would say is that our net price versus commodity inflation performance will actually improve as well as the year unfolds. And so those are really the two, I'd say things that will give us ultimately a lift in our margins. And we had some volume growth in some of our businesses as well. But those are really the two big ones that will generate incremental margins and incremental return on sales as the year unfolds.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","I would think that volume leverage would be very significant too given this large step up you're looking at for the rest of the year.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, absolutely. We also see a benefit there.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","And just following up on your pricing point, so what \u2013 in terms of actions that you've taken versus those that are kind of being phased in through the rest of the year, would you say that you're about a quarter of the way through those pricing actions? Have you taken more of them? Just some perspective on that.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Sure. Yeah, maybe the first thing, just to go back to what we said in New York. We talked about what \u2013 we anticipated that Section 232 would have an impact of roughly $50 million. Well that impact has been significantly reduced with all of the exceptions that have been made in terms of countries that are no longer in scope or potentially no longer in scope, and we'll see how it finally unfolds. But that number went from 50 million down to about 10 million.","Secondly, I'd say that inside of our businesses, we have already either taken or announced price increases in each of our businesses that essentially offset or more than offset the commodity inflation that we anticipate and can see at this point.","As we take a look at commodities in general, they're certainly running at higher levels than we planned originally. But our teams have gotten out in front. We've already, as I mentioned, taken price increases or announced price increases. And we're fairly confident that we don't expect commodity price inflation to be a drag on margins at all for us this year.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, Craig. I'll hand it on.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Morning.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Most of the operational questions have been addressed so I'd like to focus maybe on your comments on eMobility. Craig, I think you said that the content opportunity for Eaton is 8 to 10 times versus an internal combustion engine. Was that reference just to gasoline engines or was that also diesel engines? Because if I recall, you probably have more content on a diesel engine than you do on a spark-ignition engine.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. First maybe just to clarify that point. And no, we don't have more content on diesel than we do a gasoline engine. We have content on both platforms and we're not necessarily biased to one or the other. And perhaps one of the pieces that you reference is the whole diesel issue in Europe and how that would impact the company. And for us, it won't have an impact at all. Those become gasoline engines, we're just as well positioned as if they would be a diesel engine.","Ann, but to your other point, yeah, absolutely. I mean, if you think about the content available to Eaton as the world moves to more electric vehicles and commercial vehicles and off-road equipment, our opportunity as a company, it really does increase by 8 to 10 times. And that's simply the electrical content on those vehicles versus the content today that we would sell in the form of valves and valve actuation and superchargers and other product that you would typically find on an internal combustion engine. So for us it's an exciting opportunity and we think a real growth opportunity and the reason why we launched this eMobility initiative and are putting so much resource behind it.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And this may be an unfair question for a conference call and quarter conference call, but are there any lessons learned from the penetration of LED lighting that can be used in eMobility? I mean I look at the world and I see companies like (29:44) have already also created an eMobility segment. Are there any lessons learned from conversion of industries where you can take the learnings from one division to another?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I think there absolutely is, Ann. And I think if there's one message and if you had our Lighting team on a call they would probably say play to win and make the early investments and bet on the technology winning. And that's exactly way we're approaching the eMobility opportunity. That's one of the reasons why the margins are down in 2018 in eMobility is because we were investing heavily in that segment. So we clearly intend to play to win and to play to win globally and our teams are excited by the opportunity.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there and get back in line. I appreciate it.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thanks","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Morning.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Hi. Just following up a little bit with Ann on eMobility. I mean, I don't know what scale looks like in eMobility. It's still early days, but do you feel like you have enough? I mean, I look at the product portfolio and you're really strong in circuit protection and power conversion but there's a lot of electricals on the car. I mean, does it change your M&A strategy or the things that you'd like to have or think about bolting on that you've sent your M&A guys out to explore?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. The first thing I'd say is as we think about kind of the places where we've decided to play around power conversion, power distribution, I'd say we're really leveraging the strength of what we do today. We have a very large Electrical business today where we provide exactly the same types of technology in buildings. And so I think one of the real advantages that Eaton has versus other companies who are approaching this opportunity, we have the ability to leverage existing technology and leverage the scale that we already get through participating in these technologies in our Electrical business.","Having said that, there is obviously customer specific modifications that will be required. And in many cases we'll have to make some additional investments and we're certainly view this as a segment that we'd be willing to look at M&A opportunities and partnerships in. But I think we're in a great starting position because we do have this very strong base of technology and knowhow and customer intimacy through our Vehicle business.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Makes sense. And just to again go back to \u2013 a couple folks have asked about Lighting and I'll ask about it too. I mean, when Eaton bought Cooper, I mean, most of us I think felt that Eaton might sell their Lighting business. It was something that was easy to parse off and it's an industry that's desperately in need of some level of consolidation it appears. But do you need to be in the lighting business? And at what point do you just say, we're fighting too many wars here? I mean, you're trying to build an eMobility business at the same time you're \u2013 gosh, you've got lots of SKUs here. And do you need to be in lighting? And how much time are you going to give it?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, no, what I'd say is, first of all, I think we have an attractive Lighting business. We are arguably the second largest lighting LED supplier in the North America market and have really enviable positions with a full product range. And so I'd say today, if you think about as lighting businesses go, we have one of the most attractive lighting businesses we think in the world. And so it's an attractive business in the context of the markets in which we compete.","Yeah, and in some cases we are, in fact, leveraging some common distributors. But I'd say do we have to be in lighting? Does it have a negative impact on the balance of our Electrical businesses if we're not in it? I'd say no. But one of the things we've said in general as we think about the company, every one of the businesses that are part of Eaton has to stand on its own. It has to be a good business in its own right to earn the right to continue to be part of the company.","And so no different than the criteria that we've set for Hydraulics or Vehicle or any part of the company, we have to prove that this is a good business in its own right. And if there's other synergistic things that it brings to the table as a part of Electrical, that's fine, but the first thing we have to do is demonstrate that this is going to be a good business as a standalone business inside of the company. And so we think we're working on all the right things to make improvements. But as we said with any part of the company, if we get to the point where we don't believe it can live up to our expectations, we'll be prepared to make other decisions.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Good answer. Thanks guys, and good luck to you.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thanks.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey, sorry to come back to Lighting again, but just a few other things to clarify if I could. I think, Craig, in your opening remarks you said you thought it would be down mid-single-digit for the year. But I think in response to a question you said low. So could you clarify that as point one?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. I mean I'd say that, kind of parsing numbers at this point, but I'd say low-single-digit is currently the viewpoint on the business in terms of where we think it'll end.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then I was actually more curious just actually on the size of Lighting. For it to be a 5-point impact on organic growth and down 10% implies the business is a fair amount bigger than I thought it was, like in the neighborhood of $3 billion plus or so. Is there some other adjustment you're making when you talk about how much it's down, maybe excluding the projects from last year? Or what other color could you give us on that?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. I'm not sure about kind of the way you did the math, but it's not even \u2013 not close to $3 billion in revenue. So, I mean, we can maybe offline, help you with your model, but it's...","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Jeff let me just add, it's in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. That's what I thought. Okay. Thank you very much.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Okay. Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe going back to eMobility. Craig, help us maybe better understand the opportunity here. You're investing a lot in R&D. In order for you to win in this market, are we talking about you displacing already existing players? How would that process work over time? And how should people think about incremental margins here as we're thinking about beyond 2018 for this segment?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. Yeah, appreciate the question. And I'd say that for us what's most exciting about this opportunity is that, no, we don't have to displace existing companies in this space as electrification is largely a new market today without a number of established competitors. And so really it's a wide open space today and the ultimate kind of winners in this space are yet to be determined.","So we think, if you think about what Eaton brings to the table, we have as much of a right to win in this space as anyone, given what we do in our Electrical business. And so we do believe that it's going to be a great opportunity.","Yes, to your point, lots of companies are pursuing eMobility and electrification. I think the two areas in which we've chosen to focus are places where we are uniquely situated and have unique capabilities. And we think, if you think about the business long term, yes, some relatively large upfront investments. But we think, long term, we think the margins in this segment also become very much attractive and in line with the rest of the company.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then my follow-up, maybe kind of a small modeling clarification. Is there a way to quantify the price cost drag that you had in the first quarter? And I want to make sure that I'm clear on this. You're basically saying that you're going to be neutral in, going forward or in the back half of the year on that, right?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. And we're not going to \u2013 we won't specify specifically Q1, but I will say that as you think about the back \u2013 beginning in Q2 and the back half of the year, the price cost equation for us is better than it was in Q1. So despite the fact that we reported record margins in Q1, for Q1, we did have a little bit of drag and it gets better as the year unfolds.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And you're going to be neutral by year end 2018? Are you going to catch up with that? Or...","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. We will basically be neutral. Commodity costs will not be an issue for us at all this year.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Appreciate it.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Maybe just trying to understand within Electrical Products, I think the margin guide for the year is for that to be up maybe close to 100 points or so at the mid-point. Q1 is starting out some way below that.","I understand maybe there's some volume leverage as Lighting comes back. But I guess in the past when Lighting revenues grew a lot, it was called out as a mix headwind to margins. So I guess I'm trying to understand what gets the EP margin momentum improving over the next three quarters? And whether Lighting sales recovering is a contributor or a headwind to that process.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I'd say the way to really think about it is there's a fair amount of cyclicality in this business in general. And so our Electrical businesses typically have higher volumes in the second half of the year. And so Q1 has always been historically a, relatively speaking, tough to call north of 17% margins low. But for that business, it's always been kind of the weakest quarter. So there's the seasonality as a function of volume that impacts Q1 and positively impacts the subsequent quarters.","And then as I mentioned as the price cost equation improves as the year unfolds and we start to see even greater restructuring benefits in our business as the year unfolds. Those would be the three elements that I'd say that would result in the better margins as the year unwinds in the Electrical Products segment.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So Lighting should be sort of a neutral impact on...","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. Lighting is \u2013 the changes in revenue are not going to have a material impact at all on the margins.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very clear. Thank you. And then my follow-up would just be on capital deployment. You have the guidance of $800 million share buyback spending I think retained for this year as a whole. You spent $300 million in Q1. Should we think that if the share price stays around where it is, that $800 million guidance starts to look pretty conservative? Are you trying to be sort of deliberately opportunistic here on the amount spent on buybacks?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","You know, I think very much consistent with what we said is that we will generate a lot of cash this year and we don't intend to let cash build up on the balance sheet. Our first priority is clearly investing in our businesses which we're doing. We have committed to a very strong dividend and $800 million of share buyback. But in the event that our stock price kind of continues to languish at the levels that it's at right now, we find our stock to be very attractive as an opportunity to accelerate buybacks or to buy back more. So that continues to be an option that we're considering. And we're obviously considering that in the context of obviously other opportunities around M&A. But at the current pricing levels, we find our stock to be very attractive.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. I'm going to avoid the penalty for piling on, on another Lighting question. So I just wanted to get some clarity on one of the businesses that you highlighted at the beginning in terms of accomplishments in the first quarter, the increased penetration in hyperscale data center market which has \u2013 that whole market has changed so much in the past couple of years. That market's expectations and use of UPS is drastically different from what mainstream data centers use. So how is it that you've been able to address this market? Is in particularly is it new products? Is it service? And what's the opportunity from here?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, no, I think to your point, it's actually a very attractive market and if you think about today when \u2013 the data center markets today, most of what we sell into the data center markets actually is in our core electrical distribution business. And yes, we have a very big footprint as well in power quality, but it's a very positive story for our electrical distribution business as well. And I'd say so much of what's going on today, it's not so much new products as much as it is most of our major customers building out their infrastructure to try to keep up with this massive generation and consumption of data that we all tend to generate.","And so I would put it as more in terms of the market fundamentals, the secular trends that we all live with every day that's requiring that our customers build out more infrastructure.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then just a follow-up question for Rick. Can you give any color regarding the tax rate being tweaked lower on the year? Is this any further clarification on tax reform or is it something very company specific?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","It's really company-specific. We've now had a chance to digest all of the complexities of the tax bill. And we've made some adjustments to our own structure and plans that allowed us to pull the rate down a little bit.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Oppenheimer. I'm sorry, Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. I apologize.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. I thought I hadn't changed.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Sorry, I didn't mean to preclude an announcement there. Sorry, Steve.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Who know, maybe you will be prescient. But anyway, I will risk the piling on penalty. Just one more quick one on Lighting. Craig, are there pieces of Lighting that are doing well? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is if you had to restructure the business just to control what you can control because the market is what it is, are there things you could do that would improve that business?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, and I'd say we're always working to restructure businesses to focus on \u2013 one of the things we talked about across the company is that in every business it's a normal distribution of \u2013 there's always things that are going very well or with attractive margins. There's always pieces of every business, even an attractive business, where there's opportunities to improve them. What we call grow the head, fix the tail.","And so that initiative really cuts across the company and Lighting is no different. And we're certainly looking at opportunities to just be more focused in our Lighting business on those places where we have a unique technology and the right to win and looking at the other marginal activities where they tend to be more commoditized. And so I'd say that is absolutely a piece of the formula in Lighting. It's really a piece of the formula in the way we run all of our businesses.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay fair enough. And then maybe on ESS. Traditionally when that business starts to grow backlog, there's an opportunity to improve pricing and sort of the margin that's in the backlog. As you look into the backlog, is that happening? Should we be expecting better margin in the backlog?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, what I'd say without commenting specifically on margin in the backlog, I think your general thesis is correct. In this environment where our Electrical Systems & Services business is growing, we are in fact building backlog. Orders are growing. It makes the opportunity to get price that much easier.","And so I do think we are all fortuitous at this point in the cycle where we are in fact experiencing some commodity inflation. But at the same time, markets are very strong. And in many of our facilities, we are pushing lead times out because many of our factories are sold out. And so it's a very positive environment climate in general to get price.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Chris Glynn, who actually is with Oppenheimer. Chris, by the way I'll be seeing my optometrist a little later in the day to get this problem fixed.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. You can buy our in-house optom. So just on Hydraulics, I think about 24% reported incrementals depending on how FX plays here. Maybe low relative to the full year Eaton targets around 40%. I know you've been fighting some market ramp inefficiencies there, but wondering what you think Hydraulics incremental should be showing here in terms of internal views absent ramp inefficiencies.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","No, I think the number you quoted is a very good number. We think 40% incremental is the right incremental level to think about for our Hydraulics business. And to your point, we certainly have been experiencing some ramp inefficiencies as orders continue to run and outstrip our supply chain's ability to respond. And so we're expediting and running a lot more overtime and not as efficiently as we would ordinarily run as we try to catch this ramp in the cycle. But I think 40% is absolutely the right number. And as I mentioned, we think that business, once again as we look forward, we think it starts to deliver much more consistently with those kinds of expectations.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay great. And then I'll take a penalty for the team there and go back to Lighting. Just wondering on the volume declines what the relative impact roughly is between \u2013 you called out large project comps versus specifically how you serve the market being more selective there. The point being the latter might actually be stable or favorable to margins.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, and in terms of parsing the two, I'd say \u2013 I can't say that one was a more significant of an issue than the other. Both projects that did not repeat and being more selective around business that we take, both contributed to the decline in Q1. But I would say as we look forward and very much consistent with what we saw in the month of April, we think most of that's behind us at this point. And we're comfortable with our forecast for the year and our guidance for the year.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just on EPG I guess outside of Lighting. I guess the orders came in a little bit more sluggish. You cited industrial. Maybe just speak to the construction markets, res, non-res, any anomalies there and kind of how you think that the orders play out.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. I'd say that we really have not seen any dramatic changes from what we forecasted or anticipated in the Electrical Products businesses with the exception of perhaps a little bit of weakness we talked about in Lighting. Industrial markets continue to do fine. We think industrial markets are up 3% to 4%. Residential markets continue to be quite strong, so we think those markets continue to grow mid-single-digit. So we think by and large that our outlook for the year for our Electrical Products business and the key markets that they serve really have not changed much from our original guidance.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","And I might add, Jeff, it's early. We don't have a full accounting of orders for April but the orders for April appear to be pretty strong. So we're seeing a continuation of strong conditions in the product segment.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay great. And then just back on eMobility margins, is it right to think about for the foreseeable future we're in the low-double digits as you invest? Or do we start to move back up to a level we saw I guess in the last year period?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I would say that as we go through this kind of investment cycle which we think is really kind of a at least a couple-years kind of investment profile, we're going to be seeing margins at these levels. And you probably won't get back to the higher levels of margins until we get to a much higher level of revenue.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks guys.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Two questions. So following up on two of the topics. Number one on Lighting. From my math, it would seem to suggest that kind of core volume declines or \u2013 excuse me, core declines is close to 15% to 20% which is pretty significant.","Do you think there's going to have to be incremental restructuring or anything you're going to have to do internally that's going to be a lodestone to operating margin there? And could you comment qualitatively on any decremental leverage off that decline?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. I'm not sure how your math gets to those levels. Our Lighting revenues in Q1 were down 10%, and actually our profitability was essentially maintained. And so, we delivered margins that were very much in line with our expectations in Q1 on a 10% revenue decline.","And as we look forward, as I mentioned, we think Lighting obviously, on a go forward basis, we have much better quarters in front of us than we had in Q1. And we think the margins of this business continue to be very much in line with our expectations. And so we're not particularly concerned about a decremental margin issue in Lighting that's going to have any impact on our business at all.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. I'll table those questions offline. I guess, then the next question is obviously a statement of drag. Going back to Julian's question about capital allocation, it would seem to me that obviously your preference is probably for M&A. But given this environment with where the stock is, there's a pretty significant market break here and kind of speed kills in terms of capital allocation and what you can do, particularly in the prevailing environment with cash repatriation, the strength of your balance sheet, the free cash flow generation. Don't you think there's going to be some upward bias to think about expanding this buyback pretty significantly? Because that seems to be the best use of your capital at this point in time.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. I just think at this point it's just too early to make a call on that, and because we promise, we will not allow cash to build up on the balance sheet. And to the extent that we don't have attractive M&A opportunities that deliver better returns, we'll certainly be very aggressive in buying back our stock.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our last question for the day comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. This is Chris Laserinko on for Andy. Just a couple follow ups and I wonder if I could zoom out a little bit for bigger picture. As we looked at the orders in the release, it seemed like there was a little bit of a slowing compared to the prior quarter's order growth rates. Is this mostly related to comparisons? Or are you seeing anything sequentially weaken as you work through the backlog?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. No, we're really not, and as Rick indicated, we're actually seeing some strength carried through in the month of April. And so, I'd say, there's always a little lumpiness in some of the businesses like Aerospace, so I wouldn't read anything into that. We came off of a very strong 2017 order input.","Hydraulics, a little less strong but our orders were up 22% in Q1 last year and we're up 14% on top of that. And many of this is simply a function of cyclicality or a function of what's in the denominator from last year. But no weakening at all. We're very confident that the order profile that we've seen so far this year is very much consistent with our guidance.","Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And I wonder if you could talk about company incrementals as a whole. Is the 40% target for the company as a whole still good? And I wonder if you could comment on what drove specifically the under leveraging in Q1. Also what you'd have to have in place to achieve it. Is that more volume related, price-cost related, combination of both, plus additional things that I might be missing?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, no. I think it's the things that you mentioned. It's volume leverage. It's price-costs where we're certainly much better balanced in the subsequent three quarters as I mentioned earlier. It's the net of restructuring spending and restructuring benefits. And so the incrementals that we delivered in Q1 were very much in line with our guidance for the year which ties out to a 40% incremental for the year. And we're very much committed to that number and that's very much consistent with what our expectations are for the year. We've seen nothing today in our businesses that will suggest that we will not deliver the 40% incremental.","Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And I wonder if I could sneak one in \u2013 since I'm the last one. In terms of the eMobility, could you comment on what the revenue ramp for the rest of the year looks like, and maybe about product introductions or leveraging the existing technology in the medium-term, in the next two years?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","There isn't going to be a gigantic ramp. You're going to see just a relatively modest ramp as you go through the quarters. And obviously we are working very hard on a whole variety of customer projects right now and that will impact a little bit the spending depending on whether we end up going forward on some of these projects. So those are the two dimensions.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","And I think largely it'll be tied to our customers and the rate at which they introduce new electric platforms. And so you'll clearly see a step function change in revenue in this business as the big global OEMs introduce new electric vehicle platforms. And so that's really the pacing item more than anything.","Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much for that. I appreciate the color.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","With that, it wraps up our call for today. As always Chip and I will be available for follow-up questions for the remainder of the day and into the rest of the week. Thank you for your time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8080":["Eaton Corp.

Welcome to the Eaton third quarter earnings conference call. Also as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded.","At this time, we'll turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead, sir.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us today for Eaton's third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO, and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","The agenda today, as is typical, includes opening remarks by Craig highlighting our performance in the quarter, the third quarter, and our outlook for the remainder of 2017 and some preliminary comments or thoughts as we look into 2018. As we've done in the past, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments.","Before I turn it over to Craig, a couple of issues. First, I'd like to note that the press release for today's earnings this morning and the presentation we'll go through were posted on our website at www.eaton.com. I'd ask you to note that both the press release and the presentation do include some reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, and the webcast for today's call is accessible through our website and will be available for replay after the call.","Before we get started, I do want to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ from those from a wide range of risk items and uncertainties that we describe both in the earnings release and in our 8-K.","With that, I'll turn it over to Craig.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hey, thanks, Don. Hey, if you had a chance to read obviously our results this morning, and so we delivered what we think are very solid Q3 results. Reported EPS was $3.14, and this included $1.89 gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture.","Excluding the gain from the joint venture, operating EPS was $1.25, and this included some $13 million or a $0.03 impact from the natural disaster, so up 9% over Q3 2016. Sales were $5.2 billion. That's up 4.5% in total, of which 3.5% was organic, and we had a 1% positive contribution from FX. The 3.5% organic growth was at the top end of our guidance range.","And we reported segment margins of 16.4%, an all-time record for the company, up 80 basis points from Q2 2017. And adjusting for $11 million of restructuring costs in the segments, margins were 16.7%. And I also would add that margins were reduced by another 20 basis points in the quarter as a result of the recent natural disasters, and so really a strong quarter of operating results for the business.","In addition, we had exceptionally strong cash flow in the quarter. Adjusted for the unplanned Q3 pension contribution, operating cash flow was just over $1 billion, once again, a quarterly record for the company.","Also of note in the quarter, we refinanced $1 billion of debt that was maturing in November, and we're very pleased with the attractive rates that we've achieved. $700 million was financed with a 10-year tenor at 3.1%, and we had $300 million of 30-year debt at 3.9%. We also took advantage of the very strong cash flow and we decided to contribute $250 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan, which is now funded at 94%.","Lastly, given the share price volatility that we saw during the second quarter, we repurchased $324 million of our shares in the quarter at an average price of $73.29. This brings our total repurchases to $789 million for the year, and this compares to our original target of $750 million.","Turning to page 4, it provides a simple bridge explaining our EPS performance for the quarter. Compared with the midpoint of our operating EPS guidance of $1.25, we delivered $1.25. Better organic growth delivered a $0.02 improvement and better FX delivered $0.01. These two positives were offset by the negative $0.03 impact from the hurricanes and earthquakes, as we had previously announced on October 10.","In addition, we closed the Eaton Cummins joint venture in the quarter for an after-tax gain of $843 million or $1.89 per share. This gain was derived from both selling 50% of the business and revaluing the remaining 50% interest that we hold. Adding the $1.89 from the gain on the sale plus $1.25 operating EPS is how we got to our reported EPS of $3.14 per share for the quarter.","Turning to our financial summary on page 5, I'd just point out a few items not previously discussed. First, the 3.5% organic growth is really our best result in 11 quarters, so we're really pleased with the fact that the businesses are starting to inflect positively in many of our markets around the world.","And despite commodity cost headwinds, we did improve segment margins by some 40 basis points year on year. And when you're adjusting for the impact of restructuring costs, segment margins continue to improve year on year. In the quarter, they were up 20 basis points over Q3 2016 to 16.7% and up 40 basis points when you adjust for the natural disasters.","Moving to segment results, we'll begin with Electrical Products. Revenues were up 5%, 4% on organic growth with 1% positive FX. And we saw notable strength in the Americas; industrial controls, commercial and residential products. Europe was stronger really across all geographies, and in Asia-Pacific, power quality across the region.","Bookings were up 5% in the quarter, on strength once again in all regions. Bookings improved from both Q1 and Q2, where they were up 3%. And I would note that we also have particular strength in Central and Eastern Europe, which was up over 20%, transportation products was up high teens, commercial components up mid-teens, Canada and Latin America were up low teens, and residential in the U.S. was up high single digit.","Profits were at 18.7%, or 19.2% when you adjust for the $11 million of impact that we experienced from the natural disasters in this particular segment.","Our facilities in Puerto Rico are actually making good progress. We have four facilities on the island, all of which are back in operations. We're back on grid power in two of our facilities, two still running on generators, but we have plenty of access to fuel to keep those facilities producing. And in fact, production at most of our facilities is now running at pre-hurricane levels as we work to make up lost production.","We do expect a reduction in Q4 profits in this segment of another $8 million as a result of air freight, cleanup costs, and overtime labor that we're running in our facility, but we don't expect this problem to linger into 2018. And in fact, while difficult to size at this point, as the building process begins in earnest, we do expect to see a positive impact on sales in 2018.","Moving to Electrical Systems and Services, revenues were down 1% in the quarter, 2% organic, offset by 1% of positive FX. We experienced weakness in large assemblies in the Americas and in power quality, but growth in engineering services and power systems, and notably first signs of improvement in the Crouse-Hinds harsh and hazardous business.","Bookings were down 1% in Q3, and this compared to being flat in Q1 and down 2% in Q2. The reductions were primarily the result of weakness in both the utility and data centers in Asia-Pacific and large projects in the UK and Middle East.","The good news in this segment is that we're beginning to see signs of improvement in large assembly orders in the U.S., which is an important indicator for us in terms of this segment returning to positive growth, which we continue to expect to be the case for 2018. One important indicator, large projects were up some 16% in Q3, and this is on top of a 25% increase in Q2.","Segment margins, excluding restructuring costs, were 13.8% in the quarter. That's down 40 basis points from last year on a 2% reduction in organic growth. As we look forward, we also expect to see an approximately $8 million profit impact in Q4 from the hurricane impact in this segment. As many of you are aware, the components that we make in our Electrical Products business in Puerto Rico go into our Electrical Systems and Services business, so that becomes a little bit of an issue for us as well in Q4, but that's fully baked into our guidance that we provided.","Turning to Hydraulics, the story here is one of continued market strength really across all geographies, both at the OEM and distribution channels. Organic revenues were up 13% in Q3, a further acceleration from the 9% increase in Q2. Margins were improved at 12.6%. And adjusting for restructuring, margins were 14%. We're getting some benefits for sure from higher volume, but most of the improvement is the result of restructuring efforts that have been undertaken in this particular segment.","We've also had a strong quarter of bookings again, up 22% from last year, and this follows a 32% increase in Q2. Given the rapid increase in orders in the segment, there are certainly some areas where the industry overall is operating at capacity. This is causing lead times to extend for some new orders. And we're certainly in the process right now of flexing up our employment to respond to the increased orders that we're experiencing.","And in our Aerospace business, revenues were essentially flat in the quarter. In the quarter, commercial transport and commercial aftermarket revenues were up low single digit. Military OEM was up low teens. And this was offset by weakness in military aftermarket and also in the business jet segment, both of which were down in the mid-teens.","Bookings were up 11% in Q3 after being up 12% in Q2, and we experienced broad-based improvements here in both of the major markets. Other than military transport and military rotorcraft, everything else was positive, with particular strength in military fighters and also in biz-jet. And margins remained strong at 19.2% in the quarter.","And lastly in our Vehicle segments, revenues were up 10%, with 9% organic growth on strength in NAFTA heavy-duty vehicles, where production was up 34% in the quarter. Global light vehicle markets were a bit mixed, but South America up mid-20%. Europe and China were up low single digits, with the U.S. down low double digit. Positive FX contributed 2% to growth, and we had 1% negative impact due to the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture in the quarter. And we're very pleased with our margin results at 17.4% and adjusting for restructuring costs at 17.7%, so a very strong conversion quarter for our Vehicle business.","In addition, we closed the Eaton Cummins joint venture on July 31, and we did receive $600 million in cash for selling 50% interest in the venture. And in addition, during the quarter we announced the launch of our new heavy-duty Endurant transmission to really essentially a very positive reaction from the marketplace. And so we're optimistic about what that's going to bring in the future for that business as well.","On page 11, it includes an outline of our expected full-year organic growth for the segments and for Eaton overall. At the Eaton level, given the strong performance in Q3, we're fine-tuning our full-year outlook from 1% to 3% organic growth to 2% to 3% organic growth for the full year, so 0.5 basis point improvement at the midpoint for the full year.","In addition, as a result of the stronger NAFTA heavy-duty truck results, we're increasing our 2017 forecast to 250,000 units for the year, taking the overall growth expectation for Vehicle to be up 2% from prior forecasts. The other segments are largely in the range of our prior guidance.","Page 12 provides a brief summary of our restructuring program, which remains on track overall for both cost and benefits. For the year, we'll spend $100 million, and we expect to see $155 million of benefits during the year. You'll also note that we spent $22 million on restructuring in Q3, $11 million spent in the segments. And we expect to spend $25 million in Q4, the majority of which will actually be in our segments.","Page 13 is a summary of our margin expectations for the full year. And as you can see, the overall margin expectation is unchanged from our prior guidance. The midpoint of our estimate for Electrical Products margins has been reduced by some 30 basis points, largely due to the impact of the natural disasters. Electrical Systems and Services is unchanged. And based upon the midpoint of our margin guidance estimates, the other three segments' expectations have actually moved slightly higher for the year.","And turning to page 14, we provide a look at our guidance for Q4 and for the full year. For Q4, we expect to deliver $1.19 to $1.29 operating EPS. We think our organic revenues will be up 3% to 4% versus Q4 2016, really showing continued strength in most of our end markets. Segment margins we believe will be between 16.3% and 16.7%, and this does include the impact of the hurricanes in the quarter. And this represents another, let's say, $0.03 of reduction in operating EPS in Q4. The tax rate we think will be between 10.5% and 11.5%.","And so when you roll it all together for the full year, we do expect to deliver $4.55 to $4.65 of operating EPS, excluding the gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture. This includes a combined total of $0.06 impact from the natural disasters that we experienced both in Q3 and the impact in Q4.","Revenues and margins were really covered on the prior slide, so I won't go back through that.","Corporate expenses, interest, pension, and other corporate, we think will now be up $40 million over 2016. The tax rate, including the impact of the gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture, we think will be between 13% and 14% for the year.","And excluding the $250 million pension contribution that we made in Q3, operating cash flow is now estimated to be between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion for the year. At the midpoint, this represents a $100 million increase over our prior estimate. And we now believe that our total share repurchases will be $800 million in 2017, $50 million above our prior guidance.","And so if we can just maybe turn our attention a little bit to 2018, I'd say while it's too early to provide a detailed outlook, we thought it would be helpful to provide at least a few insights into our early thinking. First, we continue to see improving market conditions and global growth that is setting up well for Eaton's end markets. While we are still developing our plans, we will provide specific guidance certainly on our Q4 call that we'll have at the end of Q4. We currently believe that our combined end markets should grow approximately 3%.","As noted, when we announced the Eaton Cummins joint venture, we expect to see lower revenues in both 2017 and 2018 as a result of the joint venture in our Vehicle segment. For 2017, we now expect to see a $25 million revenue impact, and for 2018, we expect to see $175 million revenue impact. As for the profit impact for 2018, we would expect to see a small decremental profit on lower revenues.","At this point in the cycle, I would also say that we would typically as a company expect to see roughly 25% incremental profits on organic growth. And once again, while it's early in the planning process, we think for 2018, including the net impact of all restructuring costs and benefits, we think you should plan on an incremental rate that would be closer to 40% as you think about the company for 2018. We expect our tax rate to be between 11% and 13%. And 2018 is the year that we'll complete our $3 billion share repurchase program, so we expect to repurchase another $800 million of our shares during the course of the year.","So with that summary, I'll stop here and turn it back over to Don, and we can begin Q&A.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thank you. Our operator is going to provide you some guidance on the Q&A. But before he does, I do want to note a couple things. One, recognizing that many of you have several calls today to address and deal with, we're going to hold the call to an hour today. What I'd like to do to make sure that we can do that and represent all the questions on the air, I guess that you please hold your questions to a question and a follow-up.","And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning, Julian.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning, just a quick question. I guess if I look about your 2018 outlook, one of your peers recently talked about next year being a new normal. If we look at Eaton through that lens, would you think that all segment margins, assuming it is more of a normal year, should be within the corridor that you laid out last year, or are there any specific reasons around input costs perhaps why some of the margins may come in at the lower end?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","We appreciate the question, Julian. I would say absolutely, as we laid out during our New York analyst meeting, we set margin expectations for each of our segments, and we would expect all of our businesses to be solidly in that range during the course of 2018. To the specific point around \u2013 I think you inferred how we're thinking about commodity input costs in 2018. We think while once again it's early to make a call on commodity prices, we don't think it represents a headwind to the business going into 2018.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Understood, thank you. And then my follow-up would just be around the ESS business. Back at the Analyst Day in February, you talked about an improvement in growth there, 2018 to 2020, based around oil and gas and broader global CapEx. The oil and gas piece seems to be coming back. I just wondered what your updated thoughts were on the global CapEx driver within the ESS top line.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our point of view with respect to the outlook for 2018 as it relates to ESS really is unchanged. Certainly, if you think about some of the macro indicators, the Dodge data certainly indicates that large projects are coming back, and we're seeing that in our own business. We do expect that commercial projects growth to continue. Power systems, we think inside of our ESS business, we think it will be a low single-digit growth outlook for 2018. Maybe hurricanes provide a bit of upside at some point, but it's too early to call. And we believe that three-phase PQ markets are in the low to mid-digit growth range. And lastly, to your point, our Crouse-Hinds business certainly is setting up for a much better 2018. So our thesis with respect to 2018 being a better year and a growth year for Electrical Systems and Service we think still holds.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thanks.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","I'm looking to your 3% market growth. I just want to be clear, you say leading to market growth of 3% in 2018. I assume you would imagine you would outgrow the market, so your forecast would be a little bit better than that. Is that how I should look at that?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","That's exactly the way we would think about it. It's early, and we'll certainly provide more detailed guidance when we get to our Q4 earnings call, but at this point, that's meant to be a proxy for what we see in the end markets and we would certainly expect our businesses to grow faster than our end markets.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","And if memory serves me right, I don't think you or your peers have really gotten price at all in probably the last four years. Is 2018 setting up as a year where you can go in with particularly some of your electrical products and January 1 price increases, catalog plus realized?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Once again, I think it's early to make a call on the net of price and commodity input costs for 2018. We're still working through our internal planning processes. But I would say that going into 2018, at least on the input cost side, we think the headwinds that we experienced in 2017 are not there in 2018. Once again, early to make a definitive call, and we would expect, like in every year that we go out and we work on getting price in the marketplace. And so I'd say too early to call. It's early in our planning process. But at this point at least, we won't have the big negative that we experienced in 2017.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Fair point. Okay. Thank you. I'll past it on, guys. Thank you.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thanks.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just back on ESS, wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what you're seeing in utility. Your business mix isn't exactly like Hubbell's, but this feels like two quarters in a row where you're lagging what they're seeing. You did call out APAC. I wasn't under the impression that was that big of a business. So maybe just give us a little bit of the lay of the land on what you're seeing on particularly the domestic utility side of things.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","We do have a \u2013 with the acquisition of Cooper, we actually did in fact develop a pretty reasonable position in the utility market in Asia as well, and that's really where we saw the weakness during the quarter. Our North America power systems business, we actually saw low single-digit growth, I think pretty much in line with what you're seeing from others in the industry. And so the real weakness for us really was only in the Asia region, and principally China.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And maybe not to put you on the spot, but everybody on the call here this morning is distracted with this Rockwell-Emerson story. It's kind of interesting from an Eaton standpoint too, right? If you look at your big three electrical competitors, ABB, Schneider, Siemens, they're all big automation houses also. I just wonder how you feel about that strategically. Do you think automation is strategically important to Eaton, and any other comment about how you compete and differentiate in a market that might be consolidating here?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","As you know, we're not really an automation company today, and so it's not a space that we participate in today. And as we've talked about it in prior years, we think our business as a standalone without automation as a piece of it, we think we like our prospects and our opportunities to continue to grow and to be successful. So we'll wait and see what happens with that particular potential announcement, but we don't think it has any material impact on Eaton at all.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I think Jeff was asking there if you'd have an interest in Rockwell. It sounds like the answer is no, but I'll leave it there. So just, Craig, you mentioned another $0.03 impact from the hurricanes in 4Q on top of 3Q. Is it fair to assume that most of that would \u2013 or ESS would be more impacted given the component supply chain than EP? And does that $0.03 include any insurance recovery, or is that more of a 2018 impact?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","The way the business works, as I think you understand, Nigel, so today we make components and most of these components are circuit breakers, molded case circuit breakers, these are (28:26) circuit breakers are manufactured in Puerto Rico and they feed our Electrical Systems and Services business, but they also feed our distributors, and they go into the Electrical Products segment as well. And so it does impact both segments in Q4. And the reason we didn't see an impact, at least a material impact, in Electrical Systems and Services in Q3 is because we had inventory in the system. So that's really the way you think about that. It will in fact impact both businesses.","And to the specific question around insurance, yes, we do have insurance. There is no insurance recoveries baked into our forecasts. We also have deductibles as well. And so we're still working through the whole insurance process. But at this point, we've not factored in any insurance recoveries into Q4.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's clear. And then just thinking about 2018 in a bit more detail but thinking about the pension and the impact of the $250 million discretionary contribution, and if we snapped the line today on returns and rates, how does that look into 2018?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Nigel, it's Rick. You're right to mention that we've added assets, $250 million in Q3, $100 million in Q1, so $350 million. Plus our asset returns as of yesterday were about 15% in the pension plans, and so that's a positive. Where the discount rate ends up is unclear. It might actually \u2013 it's hard to believe, but it's possible it might be slightly less than where we ended 2017. It's bouncing around quite a lot.","And so as we look at it, we will clearly have pension expense dropping from 2017 to 2018. The precise amount will depend on where the returns and the discount rates settle out. I would note, however, that our interest expense is likely to go up a little bit. The reason is that we are 40% to 50% floating debt. We issue term debt and then we swap 40% of 50% into floating. And as short rates go up, and certainly most forecasts are that they will continue to go up across next year, that will cause a slight increase in our interest costs. And so that gives you a little bit of color on those two main items.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Rick.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Thank you, another question on ESS. Can you help us understand what's going on in the power quality markets? Those continue to be weak. And I'm wondering if you're seeing any sign of improvement there, or if it's potentially a candidate for accelerate or restructuring.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I'd say to your point, Andy, we have in fact experienced a weaker year than what we anticipated in the power quality markets. And as we said on prior calls, we think this is largely timing as the large customers in this space consolidate activities from prior years as well as look at various architecture changes in the context of the way they configure their data centers. And so we do think it's largely just digesting and a bit of a transitional issue that we're dealing with.","As we look forward to 2018, we continue to believe that this market will grow low single digit. Some other industry forecasters are out there with even stronger numbers than that. But we think low single digit makes sense from a planning perspective. And there's nothing that we've seen that would suggest that there's been any fundamental changes in terms of the overall economics in those markets and why those markets should not continue to grow.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","And certainly, Andy, the data traffic continues to grow quite rapidly, as is obvious as you look around all of the online sites and video and corporate data. So that's really at the end of the day the key driver which says you need more data processing capability, and it is a little bit lumpy. It changes quarter by quarter a bit just depending on who's placing an order for a large new facility. And so hopefully that gives you some color.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","It does. Thank you, and one last question. I'm skipping to Hydraulics. Have you witnessed any supply chain constraints popping up in that channel?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I would say the short answer really would be yes. This V-shaped recovery that we're living through right now in Hydraulics is on the one hand very welcome news and very much overdue, but it certainly caught everybody by surprise, orders up 22% this quarter, 32% last quarter.","And so certainly coming into the year, we and our suppliers were not anticipating the kind of V-shaped recovery that we're experiencing right now in Hydraulics. And as a result, lead times, as I mentioned in my opening commentary, have pushed out a bit. We're obviously ramping up our hiring in our manufacturing facilities right now to deal with this increased demand. And so it's a high-quality problem to have, but certainly it caught the industry a little bit flat-footed, and we're all scrambling to recover right now.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So I just wanted to clarify, Craig, your comment on the 40% incremental margins for next year. If I think about the restructuring spending that's occurring and the benefits that you're getting, it seems like you should have at least a $40 million benefit from less spend, and I think roughly about $105 million in incremental benefits from all of the spending that has occurred. I just want to make sure that I have those numbers straight as I think about that 40% number.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","You absolutely do, Joe. And the way we think about it, as I mentioned in my commentary, normally we would expect let's say a 25% incremental at this point in the cycle. For planning purposes, we think you should be planning roughly a 40% incremental, and that's fully inclusive of the lower restructuring spending and the benefits that we've committed to deliver.","What we said about restructuring is that typically in our businesses, we have ongoing restructuring every year. And what we've talked about is that we'd only call out restructuring if it's an extraordinary program or an extraordinary event. But what we'd like to do is in the ordinary cost, just absorb the restructuring inside of our businesses and not call it out as a separate reporting item.","And so we think as we go into 2018, we're really closing the chapter on the restructuring program that we've announced. Most of those activities become behind us by the time we end this year. And so what's manifested going forward are the benefits. And that's why we think you can plan on roughly a 40% incremental on the change in volume.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes, that makes sense. And just maybe taking that one step further, assuming hopefully no natural disasters next year that impact operations, you should also get a tailwind from \u2013 about a $0.06 tailwind from that not recurring next year as well, correct?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, absolutely, for all the operational issues that we experienced this year, that will certainly be a tailwind for 2018.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And maybe my one follow-up there is can you guys tell us what the revenue impact was from the natural disasters, and then specifically on EPG growth because the growth there was really solid? It's probably the best levels I think that we've seen since the early part of 2015. And so maybe a little bit more color on what's driving the strength in that business as well would be really helpful.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Joe, let me give you the revenue impact. Our overall revenue reduction in Q3 we estimate at $12 million, of which $10 million was in products, and that's understandable. The facilities were shut down for 7 to 10 days before they started up. And while we did have product in our warehouses, there began to be some shortages as we went through the quarter.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Let me. To your point, we've covered a little bit of this in the opening commentary. But really as I've said, in general we really did see notable strength in the Americas. Industrial controls, as I mentioned, were strong. Commercial residential products were strong. Europe has really been a standout performer this year really across of many of our businesses. Europe was really strong across almost all geographies. And so I'd say it was really pretty broad-based revenue strength that we experienced in most of Electrical Products.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hey, good morning. Craig, you mentioned Crouse-Hinds lifting its head up. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there and what the customers are telling you about the outlook into 2018?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","As I mentioned, we saw revenue turn positive in Q3, the first time in quite some time, and orders as well. And so very much I'd say consistent with what we expect, given stabilization in oil prices and really what we think is probably a lot of pent-up demand. That business is starting to, as we expect it to, inflect positively.","And at this point in terms of customer input, it's very much consistent with our view of the world that we think 2018 should be a better year. How much better, at this point it's premature to say. We're still in the planning processes, but certainly it will be a growth year for Crouse-Hinds in 2018.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Craig, could you give some color on how you think power systems shapes up into 2018?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","We think power systems continues to be low single-digit growth. It's certainly baked into that assumption. There's not any major infrastructure spending bill. If we end up getting a major infrastructure spending bill in the U.S., that business could be a bit stronger. But at this point, we're not counting on it. And so we think there's the normal replacement CapEx cycle, and that business continues to deliver low single-digit growth.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks a lot.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","You bet.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","Hi. So just on that 2018 initial thoughts, a little clarification. Are you thinking about holding corporate expense flat for next year excluding all the insurance impact and things like that?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","I would say we're still in the process of planning, but our general construct is definitely an ambition to hold it roughly flat.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","Okay. So if that's true and I ignore the natural disaster recoveries that might come or the year-on-year impact, then based on what you ran through, and it rose a little bit faster than that 3% market growth that you put in and the 40% incremental, it seems like you'd be talking about north of 10% EPS growth if that were to all come together on that page. Is my math somewhere close?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","That's close. And in fact, what we talked about is that we said 8% to 9% EPS growth through this planning cycle. And the implications of that is that between 2018 and 2020, it's 11% to 13%. And so you can certainly assume that we're very much on track to deliver that commitment in terms of EPS growth.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","Okay, great, Craig. That's helpful. And then on the cash flow dynamic, which seemed to also be proving out well, any thoughts or a little color on what's driving the improvement there?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","I would just say that we have managed our working capital quite effectively so far this year, and of course, our profits are growing as well. So it's really those two key factors. We're quite pleased with the cash flow and our ability to generate more than we had even anticipated at the start of the year, and so it leaves us in a very good cash position. We had net debt to total capital of right around 30% at the end of Q3, and it should go lower than that in Q4. And that's why we elected to put a little bit more into the pension plan, just to bring us up to levels that are pretty well funded.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","And maybe just to follow that up, Craig, given the cash dynamic of the organization and you're already talking up some of the capital deployment, but now that you're completing both the share repurchase program, the restructuring is behind you, any initial thoughts on moving to the front foot on some of the things that were too early to talk about a couple years ago on the M&A side, getting more maybe aggressive of that front, or do you still think that's not really the right direction for the corporation?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","What we said with respect to M&A is that, as we think about the priorities in terms of the call on capital, we've said number one, it's to reinvest in our businesses to drive organic growth because that's the first priority with respect to capital. We said we'll continue to pay a strong dividend, which we're committed to. And we also said that we would complete the share repurchase plan. And we have another year to go, $800 million of share repurchase in 2018.","But then having said that, we said there's still plenty of cash left over to continue to add strategic assets to the portfolio. And so we continue to be very much interested in looking at opportunities to acquire strategic capabilities and with a priority in our Electrical and in our Aerospace business. That hasn't changed. And we're certainly in a much better cash position today to do so.","Having said that, we obviously have nothing to announce. But we will commit and promise that we won't let cash build up on the balance sheet. In the event that we're not able to readily deploy cash into value-creating M&A, we'll find opportunities to put the cash to work in the form of perhaps more share buybacks. We have a debt maturity coming up next year. So we have some other options around effectively redeploying the cash in the event that the M&A opportunities don't materialize.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","Okay, great. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on a good quarter. Two questions, and I have a little bit of ADD as do others, so I do apologize if some of this has been covered. But embedded in your expectation for next year, how should we think about the state of play for U.S. non-residential construction? What are you seeing now or what's your prospects for growth? How are you just ring-fencing what you're seeing for 2018 and how that could play out?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, it's a good question. It's obviously an important one for us as well and one that we're spending a lot of time internally thinking through. Perhaps, Rob, it would helpful at this juncture to just quote some of the external data that's out there. And I'd say that by and large, if we take a look at most of the consensus numbers and the consensus forecasts for non-res construction next year, you'd say it's centering around 3% to 4%, perhaps with a little bit of strength on the commercial construction side, a little less strength in industrial construction overall, but it's really centering around 3% to 4%. And we think that number is very much in line with what we're experiencing and expect for the year.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just as a follow-up, if we think about the prospect, to Scott's question around market growth leading to maybe more mid-single-digit growth for you because you expect to outperform your markets, thinking about the leverage, I think you talk about incremental margins through the cycle 30%-ish range. But could we stack-rank where you'd expect to see maybe higher incrementals in 2018, if the growth materializes, how you would think about your portfolio in that regard, because clearly, you would think as you have a first spurt of material growth here after a while of weak volumes and deflation, you should see higher incrementals at least that year versus through the cycle. So any commentary around that would be helpful.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Rob, what we've said is that for the company we said yes, we'll absolutely see higher incrementals for Eaton overall. And that's why we said instead of what we would think would be normal at 25% at this point in the cycle, we said you can plan on 40%. What the specific incrementals are by business, at this point, we're really not in a position to comment on. We've not been through our internal planning processes yet. And we'll certainly be in a position to provide some margin guidance for 2018 as we discuss the outlook in our Q4 earnings call.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you for taking my questions.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Sure. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Next question comes from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Just looking at Aerospace, the orders are starting to compound there nicely, double digits I think on double-digits orders in the prior year. Is that business starting to shape up to get into a higher growth profile as you look into 2018?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, we certainly hope so. This has been a little bit of a flat year for our Aerospace business this year and we are very much pleased by the double-digit orders this quarter and last quarter, and it's certainly shaping up for 2018 to be a better year. Commercial transport continues to be strong. Commercial aftermarket continues to be quite strong.","We think as we look at 2018, the one \u2013 a couple points of weakness that we experienced this year was in military aftermarket and in the biz-jet markets. And our order intake in both of those segments also inflected quite positively in Q3. And so we think once again, Aerospace is certainly setting up to have a better year in 2018. We're not in a position at this point to quantify and forecast a more precise number, but we certainly think it returns to positive growth.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then as you wait for the appropriate time to give an outlook for the segments and ESS in particular, could you remind us what the peak-to-trough revenue journey was for Crouse-Hinds in particular?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, it was down about between 25% and 35% from the peak to the trough, and now it's starting to climb out.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And if memory serves, it started at around $1.3 billion maybe?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","It was a little bit higher than that. It was about $1.5 billion.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, good morning, guys.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","Just on the organic growth investment that you talked about, Craig, where are you guys specifically making some inroads and where can we see externally some of that progress? Because I would imagine that outside of maybe Electrical Products and Hydraulics, you guys haven't maybe been as enthused with the growth. So what underpinning that should we really be focused on going forward as maybe seeing that investment starting to pay off?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Josh, it's a big question for the time that we have. And most certainly, as we think about our analyst meeting in 2018, we'll once again take you through our key growth vectors that we're investing in, in our businesses, as we did this year.","And if you recall, if you had an opportunity to attend our meeting this year, we spent a lot of time talking about investments that we're making in IoT and took you through our strategy there and what we're doing across the company but principally in our electrical businesses, whether it was smart home or smart grid, smart factory and the investments that we're making around embedding intelligence in all the components that we manufacture.","But in every one of the businesses, I'd say it's a big question and perhaps one that I can't do justice to in the amount of time that we have on this call. But certainly you can look to us to really shed a lot of light on that at our analyst meeting that we're going to have in February of next year.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just maybe just shifting over to the incrementals, I know people have asked this a few different ways now. But I guess if you pull out the restructuring savings and the reduction in spend, you're looking at a sub-20% incremental margin here for next year as a high-level starting point. Presumably, mix starts to go your way, particularly with what's going on in Crouse-Hinds. Is there some other big plug that we should be aware of that changes as we get into out years? I'm not asking for 2019 guidance, of course. But I guess what I'm trying to understand is as restructuring becomes a smaller piece of the bridge, is there something that steps up to replace that field?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Josh, I'm not sure what numbers you're looking at. As we said, we see the incrementals overall being about 40%. And if you were to then adjust for the restructuring, it would be about 25%. And so you must be making some other assumptions, but that's our current view right now at this early point in our planning.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Maybe I'll just follow up offline then. Thanks.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Okay, thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning, Deane.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Craig, I was hoping you could expand on this high-quality problem of this V-shaped recovery in Hydraulics and maybe touch on where are the end markets and applications. How much is mobile versus stationary, and how sustainable is this uptick?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","The first thing I'd say, Deane, it's been fairly broad-based. It's really been all regions of the world, and it really has covered both mobile and stationary markets, with more strength in mobile than in stationary, but both markets performing quite favorably.","And a lot of the growth, as you probably are aware, is coming out of China. If you take a look at some of the key end markets in China, markets like the excavator market or the wheel loader market, those markets in some cases have been up more than 100%. And so it's been a very broad-based recovery, a lot of it tied to construction equipment, to material handling. We also participate in the commercial vehicle market inside of our Hydraulics business as well. That market has been strong. And the one market today that's an important market for us that has started to build positively is also be Ag market. And we think that market perhaps returns to some more positive growth in 2018.","And so we think that this point in the cycle that Hydraulics is setting up to be a multiyear growth story. And quite frankly, that's what's needed, given the fact that we've lived through the downturn over the last couple years. It's been since 2014 that that business has grown. So we think it's certainly setting up to be a positive growth story for at least a couple years to come.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. And then my follow-up is can you clarify the 2018 assumption if I heard it correctly that you're not expecting any material cost headwinds? How \u2013 if you could, frame for us where that stands today if you snap the line on copper, on steel. Are you doing any additional hedging or just advance purchasing? Anything would be helpful there.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I'd say that every commodity's got its own story. And we have in fact continued to see a bit of commodity price increases as we came through Q3, but it's very much in line what our forecasts have been. And so I don't want to suggest that we've not experienced commodity price inflation. We certainly have, but it's been very much in line with what we anticipated and expected in the business.","In terms of hedging, we do some hedging in terms of our businesses. What we think about going into 2018, there is a change in some of the accounting rules that allow you to perhaps take down some additional hedges. We've not yet thought through exactly how we're going to approach that. We're still in the early planning stages. But there is certainly another opportunity as we think about 2018 to put some additional functional hedges in place that we've not been able to do historically.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","That's right. You're able with these new accounting rules to hedge components instead of the raw metals, and that allows you to put on truly economic hedges as opposed to just accounting hedges. But broadly, Deane, our view is that if you look at the mix of metals, we think that they are not likely across 2018 to show significant increase. So there will be pockets, but on average, we don't see a significant rise likely.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered by now, obviously. But maybe in Hydraulics, you could talk a little bit about whether you are the bottleneck that's driving the lengthy lead times, or is it your supply chain? Just where exactly are the bottlenecks building?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","What I'd say, Ann, most of the bottlenecks, as you know this business fairly well, it always ends of being the long lead time components, castings and forgings and others, back throughout the supply chain where, in many cases, can be lead times are three months to six months. And so we're ramping up our hiring from a labor perspective. And at this point, labor tends to be much easier to put in place. But the big issues continue to be in the long lead time components, and I'd say especially in castings.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And there's no simple way around that, I'm going to assume.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","No simple way around it. Obviously, we're working on some potential longer-term solutions and new technologies like additive and other things that we think hold a lot of promise to shorten those lead times. But at this point, it is a challenge that we're dealing with. And lead times have in fact pushed out in some case. But I'd say on balance, it's a pretty high-quality problem to have, and we'll work through it in relatively short order.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","It is a high-quality problem to have after so many years. My second question is maybe one that's better for the Analyst Day, but I'll ask it anyway. I've been getting a lot of questions on the notion that Boeing is trying to grow its aftermarket business and obviously capture some of those nice aftermarket margins in Aerospace. How is the supply chain reacting to that and how do you expect it to change your business over the midterm?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","We're certainly very much aware of the various initiatives that our different OEMs have to more fully participate in the aftermarket, and so we're working with them. We think today, there are in fact opportunities in places where Boeing and other customers can add value in that supply chain. And so our goal is obviously to work with Boeing and others towards a mutually beneficial outcome for both companies, and we're optimistic that we're going to be able to do that.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So net-net a positive, perhaps more volume, more original parts versus a negative, is that the way to interpret that?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","We think in every problem, there's probably a win-win outcome there someplace, where there are things that we want and places they can help us and things that we can contribute to help them against their particular goals. And so we're confident that we're going to find a solution that works for both companies.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, I'll leave it there. Thanks, I appreciate it.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thanks, Ann.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","We have time for one last question, and that will come from Andrew Obin with BofA Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question on the inventory level in the distribution both on the Electrical side and the Hydraulics side. The past couple of years, we never got this restocking trend going on. Are you seeing anything that would indicate that at last with macro picking up, dealers are considering restocking inventory in the channel?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, what I'd say probably largely in the Electrical business, we really have not seen a big change in inventory levels. Those markets are certainly improving, but not the kind of movements that we think at this point would result in any big changes in inventory levels.","Certainly, what we've seen in hydraulics, we certainly have seen some replenishment of inventory in the hydraulics markets, although I will tell you that our sales into the OEM segment continued to outpace our sales into the distribution segment, and so hopefully that's a positive sign of things to come. But there certainly has been a little bit of inventory replenishment that's really taken place throughout the supply chain in the Hydraulics business, which is why you see that our order input is obviously up much higher than our sales output and much higher than many of our OEMs output as well.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you, and just a follow-up question on Aerospace. I know we talked about it. But is there a specific program? I'm just a little bit surprised that given your exposure that revenues were flat. I would have thought that was like 777 exposure, but you did not call it out. I'm just trying to figure out if there's a specific military program that's holding you back this quarter because I think by and large, defense companies that had flat revenues, there was a specific program in charge, and commercial guys generally posted positive growth. Just if you could, give a little bit more detail.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","As I mentioned in my commentary, first I would tell you that we're about 60:40. 60% of our business is commercial and 40% is military. And where we saw weakness is we saw weakness in first and foremost commercial. The commercial side in biz-jet and the biz-jet sector continues to be weak. And we have relatively large content on a number of important biz-jet platforms.","And then on the military side, it was the military aftermarket. And that we would say is largely a function of a number of large campaigns, mods and retrofit upgrades that we had in prior years that have not repeated. And so we think once again, transitional issues that we're seeing in the Aerospace business, orders are up nicely.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead, sir.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank all of you for joining us for Eaton's second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. The agenda today as normally includes opening remarks by Craig highlighting the company's performance in the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2016. As we've done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments.","Couple of quick housekeeping items. The press release today from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation do include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures and a webcast of the call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.","Before we get started, I want to remind you that our comments today do include statements that are related to expected future results and as a result, are forward-looking statements. Our actual results that may differ from this for a wide range of uncertainties and risks, they're described in our earning release and in the 8-K.","With that, I'm going to turn this over to Craig Arnold.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Hey. Thanks, Don. Hey, I'm sure you've all had an opportunity to work through the material and so I'll hit a few of the highlights and add a bit of color to the results. Operating earnings per share, we're really pleased with the results in the quarter at $1.07, $0.02 ahead of our guidance. And as we anticipated, sales in the quarter came in at $5.1 billion, down 5% organically \u2013 down 5% \u2013 organic revenue down from 4%, and this is really consistent with the normal patterns that we see. Q2 sales at 5% above Q1 and quite frankly, FX was a little better, 1% better than it was in Q1 as well.","Segment operating profits came in at 15.4% versus our guidance of between 15% and 16%, and I'd say with particularly strong margins in Electrical Products as well as in Aerospace, both of which came in at 18.6% when you exclude some of the restructuring charges, and offsetting a bit of weakness in Electrical Systems and Services. Restructuring costs in the quarter came in right as expected at $35 million and reducing our margins by some 60 basis points. Adjusting for restructuring costs and FX, really strong decremental performance by the company overall in each of our businesses. And we're really pleased with the fact that we had record cash flow in Q2 with cash conversion of 124% of net income, so really strong cash performance in the quarter. We also repurchased some $225 million of our stock back, some 3.7 million shares in the quarter.","Turning to the financial summary, we continue to see weakness in the number of our end markets versus 2015 but sequentially revenues were up some, as I mentioned, 6% from Q1. Organic revenue declines and FX headwinds are decelerating. Organic revenue was down some 6% from Q1 but \u2013 in Q1, but only 4% in Q2 and as I mentioned, FX also mitigating a little bit, down 1% in Q2 versus 2% in Q1.","Margins, excluding restructuring costs, were some 16%. That's up 90 basis points from Q1, and an improvement over Q2 of 2015 by some 10 basis points. And this is despite some 4% weaker organic revenues, so a real indication that we're getting and we're holding onto the restructuring benefits that we're engaging in across the company.","Turning our attention to Electrical Products segment, a really strong quarter of execution in this business. We're pleased with the Q2 results and we think strong overall performance that we continue to see in this business. Modest year-on-year organic growth, up some 1% offset by FX, but in acceleration sequentially with revenues up some 10% from Q1.","We continue to see strong execution in the business as evidenced by the significant margin improvement. Excluding restructuring, our operating margins were up some 270 basis points and 150 basis points better than Q1. Bookings were down 2% in the quarter on weakness in the Americas' industrial markets and really broad-based weakness in the Asia Pacific region. We did continue to see strength in U.S. residential housing, in the lighting markets and in Europe generally.","Looking at Electrical Systems and Services, revenues in the quarter were up some 6% from Q1 but 5% worse than Q2 2015. Margins were weaker in Q2 2015 on less favorable mix of projects and also on the impact of a litigation charge that we actually took in this particular business that reduced margins by some 70 basis points. So note margi7ns excluding restructuring costs were in fact flat with Q1.","While somewhat offset by lower commodity prices, the pricing environment in this business does continue to be somewhat difficult and as we've characterized the net between the two, we'd say slightly negative on a net commodity cost basis but certainly manageable and well within our guidance. Bookings are down some 2% and we're seeing continued weakness here in large industrial projects, weakness in Canada in oil and gas markets, partially offset by strength in three phase UPS, principally in data centers. Light commercial orders continue to be strong as well as the Service business.","In looking at Hydraulics, hydraulics markets, I'd say they appear to be stabilizing, but more importantly, I think our team is executing well here. Organic revenues are up some 7% from Q1 but down 7% from last year. 10% margins in the quarter but I think importantly 13% when you exclude restructuring costs and we think real proof point that the restructuring work that's being undertaken in the business delivering the margin improvements is really coming through. So ex restructuring costs, profits were essentially flat on 7% lower organic revenue growth, and so we think really strong performance.","Bookings declined some 2% in the quarter. Really the best quarter that we've seen in bookings in the last two years, on particular strength in EMEA and positive bookings in Asia with the modest weakness continuing in the Americas. In the quarter, OEM orders were down 4%, distribution orders were down 1%, and really the area of greatest weakness in the business continues to be on the stationary side of the business where we had orders were down, in some cases, up to 33%. We did see strength in the quarter in ag, up 23%. Not sure how much of a read-through that is on the total year as we continue to see some concerns there. And construction orders in the quarter were up some 8%.","In Aerospace, we think our strong operating result in the quarter. Organic revenues were flat with Q2 2015, principally on lower military OEM sales offset by strength in both large commercial transport and in aftermarket. Margins were once again very strong at 18.6%, up some 160 basis points over Q2 2015. Bookings were down 1% in the quarter, and this is on particular weakness in the bizjet segment, which was a little bit of some surprise weakness for us, but when you just for weakness in bizjet, bookings were up mid-single digits and aftermarket orders continue to be strong, up some 7%. We also continue to see strength in commercial transport segment, where we saw orders up some 10% in the quarter.","In looking at Vehicles, organic revenues were down 14% versus Q2 2015, driven primarily by the 29% decline in Class 8 market and continued double digit market declines that we're seeing in the Brazilian market. Outside of Brazil, passenger car markets continue to hold up at very high levels and we expect markets in North America to be flat with modest growth in EMEA and in Asia. Margins, when you exclude restructuring costs, were down some 230 basis points versus 2015 but up 70 basis points versus Q1. So we think with or without restructuring costs, we think strong operating performance in this business and where you're really dealing with some pretty significant headwinds in terms of the Class 8 market and what's happening in Brazil in general.","If we turn to the organic growth outlook for the year, maybe I'll spend a few extra minutes on this slide just to give you some color on the way we see the year unfolding. In general, we think markets on balance are performing as we expected, but we do expect the market to remain sluggish throughout the balance of the year. And looking at Electrical Products, we'd say here a really mixed story in terms of what's going on in our end markets. We see growth in residential and lighting in the U.S., growth in Europe, but we continue to see declines in industrial markets in the U.S., Canada and in Asia.","More specifically, we're seeing growth in U.S. residential markets; we think growth in the 5% to 7% range. We're seeing growth in the U.S. lighting market which we'd say is mid-single digit, and we see growth in Europe and we think Europe, EMEA grows some 2% to 3%. And this is offset by weakness in U.S. industrial markets, which we think will be down mid-single digit; weakness in Canada, which we think is down low single digit; and continued weakness in the Asia Pacific region, which we think is also down low-single digit range.","In Electrical Systems and Services, we continue to see declines in large industrial projects, in oil and gas, but some growth in three phase, in power quality in the U.S. market and in Europe with modest growth in Power Systems. More specifically, we see U.S. and EMEA three phase power quality up low-single digit. We see some real weakness in harsh and hazardous, we think down some 15% for the year. We think industrial projects continue to be down and light commercial continues to be a source of strength in the business and once again Asia Pac we think will be down low- to mid-single digits for the year.","Turning our attention to Hydraulics, and certainly we had a relatively speaking stronger quarter in Hydraulics, and we think in many ways this is really a function of easier comps as we move forward during the course of 2016. We continue to see weakness in mobile, particularly in ag equipment, we see certainly continued weakness in oil and gas equipment markets, double-digit declines in China construction. So our call on the Hydraulics markets really has not changed materially from the way we originally saw the year.","In Aerospace we're seeing low-single digit growth in commercial OE and in commercial aftermarket, offset by, as I'd mentioned earlier, some pretty significant declines in the bizjet segment, which really took orders down in Q2. Some small declines in U.S. defense OEM and some modest growth in defense aftermarket. In Vehicle, as we noted, NAFTA Class 8, we think 230,000 units this year, down some 29%. And we continue to see weakness in the Brazilian truck and bus market. We think down 20% for the year offset by low-single digit growth in NAFTA Class 6 production and some modest growth, as I mentioned, in the light vehicle markets around the world.","If we turn our attention to restructuring, really good news here. Restructuring programs remain on track, Q2 spending came in right at plan at $35 million and our projects are clearly on track and we have great line of sight to delivering the benefits that we laid out. We did increase our second half spending by $5 million, primarily in Electrical Systems and Service to deal with some of the continued weakness that we're seeing in some of our markets, principally oil and gas and industrial markets. We expect to spend $27 million in Q3 and another $20 million in Q4, increasing our total spending for the year to $145 million, but we've also increased our annual benefits by $5 million and so really no net change in benefits for the year. So in total we now expect the program to cost $404 million in total with benefits of $423 million, both up $5 million from prior forecast.","Turning our attention to the segment margin expectations, not much in the way of change here overall. On a consolidated basis unchanged from prior guidance, however we did make a minor adjustment in guidance for both Electrical Systems and Services and in Aerospace. ES&S down some 30 basis points on continued weakness, principally in the higher margin oil and gas and industrial projects. And Aerospace up some 30 basis points on the basis of ongoing strength in aftermarket and really tight control in development costs inside of the business. Each of the other businesses are expected to be within the ranges noted and you'll recall that these guidance numbers do in fact include restructuring expenses.","Turning our attention to EPS guidance, guidance for Q3 reflects continuation of the current overall softness in a number of our end markets. We think organic revenues in Q3 and Q4 are essentially flat with Q2. Flat revenue, but the variances to last year will improve as a result of, as I mentioned earlier, easier comps. Margin expectations will be between 15.5% to 16.5% reflecting lower restructuring expenses and increased benefits from Q2 and Q3. We think the tax rate will be 8% to 10% in Q3 versus 11% in Q2 and the midpoint of our guidance remains unchanged at $4.30 but we did in fact narrow the range by $0.05 on both the high side and the low side.","Turning our attention to the outlook for 2016, the summary table that we normally provide in these calls, I'd say here the key changes are once again we updated Q3 guidance $1.10 to $1.20, a slight increase in foreign exchange negative benefits by $25 million and as I mentioned before, simply narrowing the range but holding the guidance at $4.30.","So in summary, we think really a strong quarter in Q2. The teams are executing extraordinarily well. Revenues came in more or less as expected with strong performance in Electrical Products and Aerospace offsetting some of the weakness that we're seeing in Electrical Systems and Services and Hydraulics really showing strong margin improvement excluding restructuring charges in the quarter. And once again, really importantly, record cash flow as the businesses are really doing a nice job of converting net income to cash.","We remain committed to our $700 million of share repurchase. We repurchased 3.7 million shares in the quarter, $225 million. Markets are unfolding as we expected and the full-year outlook is unchanged at down 2% to 4%. And the restructuring programs are basically delivering. $174 million of incremental profit in 2016 over 2015 and it's setting up well for us to deliver another $120 million of incremental profit in 2017 over 2016.","So I'll stop here, turn it back to Don, and we'll go to question and answer.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","At this point would our \u2013 commentator will provide some guidance for you on the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Before we enter into the question-and-answer session today, I did want to note that we have a number of people in the queue for questions, and to try to be able to keep things within the constraint of an hour for us, I would ask you that you limit your questions to a single question and a follow-up, and as always, we'll be available to go into more detailed questions or others throughout the remainder of the day or otherwise. With that, our first question today comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks a lot. Hi, Craig. Just firstly on the ESS margins, I think you're implying the second half margins are 14%-ish. Those are up maybe 150 points year on year and sequentially in the half. Revenues though, probably in the second half, probably not doing much year on year or sequentially. So maybe just clarify what it is you see in ESS that picks up in that second half.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'd say the first adjustment we'd say you need to make in terms of the underlying run rate of the business is the fact that we did have the legal settlement in ES&S in the quarter. That shaved some 70 basis points off of margin. Then secondly, as we move into the second half of the year, we will clearly see a little bit of volume lift but not dramatic, but the restructuring benefits that we've been undertaking during the course of the year also start to kick in and we will see a margin lift as a function of the restructuring benefits that are more backend loaded.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thank you. And then just within the Electrical Products business, you did see that bookings turn down in Q2. It looks like the guidance for revenues has an acceleration in organic sales year on year in the second half. Are you seeing something in the bookings in Q3 already that suggests that that decline in bookings should be reversed now and that gives you the visibility on second half revenue?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, what I'd say on that one, Julian, is that when you take a look at the absolute level of revenue that we're forecasting for the back half of the year, it's really running essentially at Q2 levels. And so we don't really have a volume lift that's built into the second half of the year. And as I mentioned earlier, the comps in general get easier for all of our businesses. As you'll recall, we really saw a fall-off in our revenue during the course of 2015 in Q3 and Q4. So principally, we're saying we're going to be running at this current level of economic activity and revenue and it's a function of the comps versus prior period that appear to be a relatively change in the rate of change, but the absolute dollars don't really move much at all.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our second question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Craig, and congratulations on a solid quarter and a good initial start. I guess the first question I would ask, with respect to ESS, aware of the litigation expense there and the margins. But could you talk \u2013 you did set the oil and gas exposure there, but could you talk about maybe the trends you're seeing there, oil and gas in general?","And then as a follow-up to that, and this will constitute my follow-up, could you talk a little bit about the portfolio's oil and gas exposure beyond what the explicit exposure, what the implied exposure could be? Because I think what we struggle with sometimes is understanding what the second order effects of some of these industrials companies' oil and gas exposure is. So if you could comment on that, that would be very helpful.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so I think there's three questions there, one, in terms of the margin impact in ES&S. We had this legal settlement related to a three-year old or so commercial negotiation that ended up impacting the Electrical Systems and Services segment. And so that did take our margins down by 70 basis points in the quarter. And just a commercial settlement from a prior matter.","In terms of the company's exposure to oil and gas, most of our exposure that's inside of the electrical business is in the Electrical Systems and Services business. You'll recall that when we acquired Cooper, we also acquired a very large business called Crouse-Hinds that has a very big exposure to what we call harsh and hazardous markets including oil and gas. And so we're certainly seeing an impact in that business as well as in all of our businesses that are exposed to oil and gas.","I'd say, in terms of the overall oil and gas market, I think at this juncture we'd say we certainly have not seen any improvement in oil and gas and maybe we've seen a little bit of deceleration in oil and gas. Not material changes from our original assumptions for the year, but clearly we've not seen any indications that that market has turned.","And to your point around the second derivative and the other markets that are tied to oil and gas, I think we really have been experiencing all year that second derivative impact. And so yes, it's oil and gas but it's in many cases, oil and gas companies whether it's upstream or downstream, they all live under one roof. And so we've seen the other knock-on effects from oil and gas related industries already impact our business and is already reflected in our guidance.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I guess following up to that just briefly, do you think you have a number about, for planning purposes and otherwise, how you're thinking about that second order impact? Because I think you have a headline number for your oil and gas exposure, but do you have a number of about the outer ring of that penumbra?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we really don't, Julian (sic) [Rob] (23:42). Appreciate the question and what you're trying to get at, but we really don't have a particular number. And once again, it's a really tough number to derive and we would just be hazarding a guess. And so what we try to think about today is, we understand the underlying run rate of our businesses and what we're experiencing today. We know that we're already experiencing the second derivative fall-off and that's the basis that we use to develop our guidance.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'll leave it there. Thank you for your time.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks, and good morning, guys. Just trying to understand here, on the margin front, you put up 10 basis points better ex restructuring. That's quite a performance given the volume leverage. So maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing, if you could give us some color around \u2013 you've mentioned price versus material, productivity versus wage inflation, leverage, mix, some stuff going on in corporate. Just a few of the puts and takes to help us understand how you get there and how sustainable it is.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'd say that principally, maybe if you cut through all the tape, more than anything, it's a function of restructuring, benefits, great cost control by the operating teams and good operational execution. Price versus commodity input costs, we mentioned that we are having a few challenges in Electrical Systems and Services, but if we think about the entire year, we think we're largely on plan and on expectations that there's that little bit of uncertainty around what the future looks like around commodity prices as you read all the same press clippings that I do. And we have seen a little bit of an uptick in some commodities in the last 30 days. We've seen others tick down. So we think, largely speaking, that commodity prices for the full year will be very much in line with what our expectations were.","We're not getting leverage right now in the business because we're not, for the most part, growing volume, and so it really is a function of our business is doing a good job of flexing our costs in anticipation of this weak market environment that we're living in.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. We can follow up offline for some \u2013 maybe if we could put some numbers around some of that it'd be helpful. But on the cash side, maybe, look, that was also very strong performance. Maybe talk about some of the puts and takes there around working capital and others?","Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer","Yeah, Steve, I'd be happy to. Really, quite a straightforward quarter from a cash standpoint. If you look at the combination of net income and depreciation and amortization, those two were almost $730 million of cash and then the balance is simply a small positive from working capital.","As we've commented earlier in the year, we believe that we have opportunities to continue to take down inventory. We did take inventory dollars down some from Q1 to Q2, but we think we have further opportunities as we go through the year. So it's really just those three items: net income, D&A as well as a small positive from working capital.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning. You know you mentioned a few times some strength in Europe for different businesses. Could you just give us a little bit more color on that, where exactly and what segments that you're seeing strength?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, yeah, sure, Ann. Be more than happy to. I think what we've seen in almost every one of our businesses is relatively speaking versus our expectations for the year and all the geopolitical issues and everything else taking place in Europe, we've seen Europe generally perform slightly better than what we anticipated. And so it really does run the gamut. Certainly if you take a look at vehicle markets, and that's probably been a big standout this year, light vehicle production and sales has been up mid-single digit all year, so we're seeing real strength there. Hydraulics markets in Europe, while still negative, less negative than we anticipated.","In fact, that market's we think down low-single digit this year which is a better outlook than we anticipated. On the Electrical side of the house, once again we're seeing growth for the most part in many of our end markets in Electrical Products and Electrical Systems and Services, and we think those markets grow slightly this year. We think up, once again, low single digit. So it's really, we'd say, been a broad-based kind of beat versus our internal expectations, modest but pretty broad, and at this point it's too early to say.","And your follow-up question may be in terms of what happens with Brexit and the Turkey matter. At this point it's too early to say. On the positive side we are, today, a net exporter out of the UK so we don't think that is going to have a big issue and the same thing would be true of Turkey. So really it's been a broad-based, we'd say, beat where Europe in general has performed slightly better than what we anticipated.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And since you answered my follow-up, I'll switch to a different follow-up then.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On the Hydraulics side, which specific end markets? Was it mobile, was it industrial hydraulics? Just a little bit of color on the Hydraulics side that was less negative.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's great. It was pretty much primarily the mobile side that came in for the quarter stronger than what we anticipated. As I mentioned, strong ag orders up from 23% in the quarter, strong construction orders up 8%, offset by ongoing and pretty significant weakness that we still see in the stationary side of the business. The process industries, oil and gas, large industrial, very much like what we're seeing in the Electrical side of business, and that continues to be quite weak.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there in the interest of time. Thank you.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ann.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities (sic) [Research] (30:01).","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning, everyone. Can we just get a little more clarification? You just said ag up 23% but you said it's weak. Was that \u2013 and Europe performance has outperformed what the industry, and the industry was down a bit more than it. Is this picking up share? Was this just rebalancing of inventories in ag or something with anticipation of planned shut-downs which are coming this summer? So do you view the ag and the construction more of a one-off quarter as opposed to sustainability and can you talk a little bit about pricing there?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah, it's a good question, Eli, and I wish we were really smart enough to be able to call it precisely, but I think it's more the way you articulated. We had a strong quarter of order input in ag and construction. We don't think that's in any way indicative of the underlying market performance, and so it's probably a function of a bit weaker comps that we had last year, and to your point, perhaps some pre-buying that's taking place in anticipation of summer shut-downs. And so that's why our call on the year for Hydraulics hasn't changed. And we still think that the guidance that we provided on the full year is very much consistent with what we're feeling and experiencing in the business.","The pricing environment in Hydraulics is just fine. We're not seeing any particular or unusual pressures there with respect to the \u2013 once again, we always talk about it in terms of the net of commodity input costs and price and so we think it will be net about neutral. Price is not going to be a tailwind for us this year, or a headwind.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And just as a follow-up, we're seeing some, a lot more pressure on input costs in the second half of the year, particularly the steel numbers really haven't changed much. They're up big, maybe less than the spot market, but they're still up significantly. Can you talk about cost price across the business? And in the context with the auto numbers that came out that were quite weak today across the board, have you had any concern about some weakness spilling over into Vehicle business besides the truck market, just from North American auto?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. As I said, you raise an excellent point, Eli, because we've absolutely seen steel prices move materially up order of magnitude 50%, a lot of that driven by some of the duties that have been put on imports coming out of China, and that's had a knock-on effect of steel prices around the world. In the near term we think we're fine in terms of the net impact to the company.","We did some pre-buying. We do have some hedges in place. And so we think in the near term, we have the ability to mitigate the impact of steel price increases. We'll have to wait and see how long these increases stay in effect, whether this is a short-term blip or it's a long-term blip. And in the event that it's a longer term impact, we'd have to actually revisit our pricing assumption and we'd find a way to pass it on into the marketplace. And so, we think once again on balance, we'll do what we've always done in inflationary environments. We'll find a way to pass it on to the customer base. And I think it's been well publicized, it's well understood, and so we don't think that poses a risk to our margins.","To your point around auto weakness, we certainly have seen a lot of the reports, reading the same ones that you have. We continue to take a very cautious view on the outlook for automotive markets. We think North America will be largely flat this year and Europe and Asia will be up slightly. But like you, we're taking a very cautious view of it and we're getting prepared that in the event that we do have a downturn, we're going to be well prepared to deal with it.","I will add that there's a number of economic forecasters who do have a view that's already out for 2017 and we're not sure if they're right or wrong but whether it's IHS or some of the other economic forecasters, they think that the markets essentially continue at these high levels on into 2017 that essentially look flat or maybe up 1% or so, 1% or 2%. But we're watching it just like you and we'll be prepared in the event that it takes a turn for the worse.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you very much.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys, and nice job executing in a tough market. My first question, maybe just starting on Hydraulics for a second, I saw that you didn't take down the organic growth guide, yet one of your largest customers talked this quarter about underproducing real demand in the second half of the year. So I'm trying to marry those points. You guys are seeing some stabilization. It seems like things can get a little bit worse. So talk to us a little bit about, like, what you're seeing and what your expectation is for the second half.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and I think generally speaking, I said we were really pleased with our Q2 performance in Hydraulics and as we look at the absolute level of change in revenue for the quarter, down some 7%, slightly better than we anticipated, and you take a look at our order input down some 2%. So we think a couple of really strong data points that would suggest that if there is in fact a little bit of weakness in the back end in certain markets, and we saw the same report that you did that came out of one of our major customers, there's another \u2013 there's enough breadth in the business and other segments that are performing a little bit better than that that on net, we think that the year will be very much in line with what our expectations have laid out.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Fair enough. And I guess maybe my follow-up, one of the things that has surprised us from a trend perspective this quarter was that June seemed to have gotten worse for a lot of our companies, especially on the industrial side. And so to the extent that you maybe can provide some color on what you saw in sequential trends and specifically talk about industrial, that would be helpful.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think from our perspective, industrial really has been a source of weakness really this year and for the entire quarter. I don't know that June was an especially stand-out month for us in terms of the industrial markets, but we are in fact seeing the same weakness that others are talking about. And it's one of the reasons why in our Industrial Systems and Services (sic) [Electrical Systems and Services] (36:29) business, that we've taken the guidance down and the reason why we continue to see some margin challenges in that business. And so we are absolutely seeing the weakness and experiencing it. I would not say that we saw any particular change in the rate of trajectory in the month of June.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey. How did ESS margins in the backlog, how do they look? And the order pricing, is there anything that you could provide us there, Craig, in terms of color?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'd say there's nothing in the backlog or environment that will in any way materially change the margin assumptions or are highly influencing our assumptions around margins for the balance of the year. Now we did in fact trim the margin guide to ES&S, but that's largely a function of the things that we talked about. We talked about the fact that large projects, large industrial projects, which tend to be more profitable, we're not selling as many of them. So we have a negative mix effect, and that's the one business where we are seeing a slight negative on the balance between commodity input costs and pricing. And so that was the other reason why we trimmed the guidance slightly in ES&S. But there's really nothing in the backlog that would suggest any particular heavy influence on the margins of the business on a go-forward basis.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So other \u2013 just by inference then, other companies and not Eaton have called out that what projects are available. And I realize I'm not suggesting it's apples to apples, but just in general, right? What projects are available, but pricing is very tough, as you can imagine, right? Just because of the capacity that's out there for fewer projects. Sounds like that's not happening.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","No, and I think what we said is that price in that particular business, the net of price and commodity import prices, that is negative. So we are in fact experiencing a bit of price pressure in our Electrical Systems and Services business. So that would \u2013 we are in fact saying exactly what you're hearing from other companies.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then maybe big picture, how was China in the quarter? Maybe you could dovetail a little bit of your commentary around construction and just in general in China, right, was it stable? Did it get better? Did it get worse? Just if you \u2013 anything you can tell us about it would be fantastic, Craig.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'd say in general what we're seeing in China is largely ongoing weakness. I think as you heard the commentary as I talked through the various end markets, but for let's call it the consumer-related market and passenger car markets, we continue to see weakness, mid-single digit weakness in the industrial markets in China. That's affecting our Electrical business, and we continue to see strong double-digit declines in many of the Hydraulic-related markets as they continue to work off excess inventory.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was going to ask you just lastly on inventory in China, I think at the Analyst Meeting earlier this year, there was a broad discussion around just a lot of systemic inventory in China, whether it be construction machines or other equipment. And it's just not Eaton, it's more market. Has that changed at all, do you think? Or is it still this overhang?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","So I think we're still living through a bit of overhang, and sales versus production I think continues to eat into the inventory overhang that we're dealing with in a lot of the capital equipment markets. Principally I think markets like excavators and road rollers and the other things that are really supporting this major building boom that China went through over the last ten years, but they continue to eat into it. Are inventories today at the level that I'd say are where the market needs them to be? I'd say no. I think they're still working through a bit of an inventory overhang, and that's why we're still dealing with these strong double-digit declines in a lot of the end markets in China. And that's very much what we're forecasting.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yup. Got it. Thanks very much.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. And good solid quarter here. Just wanted to come back to Hydraulics. This quarter, Craig, is the first we've seen any sort of hint of normal seasonality in this business for about three years. So I'm wondering maybe \u2013 obviously the orders down 2% is good news, but it's sometimes hard to define the underlying trend from order data alone. So I'm just wondering maybe address the issue of normal seasonality at lower levels and how did the book-to-bill this quarter compare to other quarters? Are we at a normal book-to-bill ratio here?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'd say that if we take a look at the business this quarter, we built a little backlog in the quarter, which would be expected to the extent that your orders are stronger than your sales out, and so \u2013 but once again, I think like you, we don't want to over-read one quarter of results in Hydraulics. And so it was a bit of a stronger quarter than we anticipated in the order intake.","Is this a turn in the business? We don't know. And I think it's too early to call. I think we need to string together more than one data point before we know whether or not the Hydraulic end markets, the big important markets to this business which are ag and construction and oil and gas and mining, have these markets bottomed out? Are they ready for a turn? We're reading all of the same customer data that you read, which would suggest that we're still living in this period of really low economic activity. So I'd say in general it's just too early to call whether or not these markets have reached bottom and are prepared for a turn.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, but stability is good news, I guess.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","(42:24)","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then \u2013 yeah. And on the restructuring, clearly you're getting some pretty tangible payback on the actions. You've raised by $5 million this year, you're getting $5 million more, so it's a wash, but 2017 you gave some color in terms of what do you expect, and I'm struggling for the numbers here, but I think it was $130 million of restructuring costs next year and $105 million of payback, incremental payback. Are we still on track for that next year?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, we're still on track and what we said is $120 million of net, so you think about the net profit improvement as a function of restructuring. We said it's $120 million, but your numbers are largely correct.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Craig.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","(43:08). Great.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Hey, just a couple questions. Craig, on lighting, I think you described it as mid-single digit. I don't know if that was an outlook comment for what happened in the quarter. Could you just elaborate on that? And I was wondering if maybe you could bifurcate lighting a little bit. I think you have some harsh and hazardous in there that maybe is holding that business back a little bit. Any way to think about the underlying truly commercial part of lighting and how that's growing, commercial and res?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we did say mid-single digit in my commentary. That's really a reflection of what we expect for the entire year and so it's our outlooks, but it's largely the way we think the market has been performing overall. When we quote the lighting numbers, it does in fact include all of our lighting which would include harsh and hazardous and the safety business as well, so it's a composite view.","And certainly, if you took out harsh and hazardous, the business would be performing slightly better. I don't have the exact number handy, but it would certainly be performing slightly better than that.","And we think the really important news is that LED penetration continues to grow inside of our overall lighting business and LED penetration in Q2 was approaching 70%. So we continue to see tremendous growth and penetration in LED lighting and we think that has a lot of room to run and we're really pleased with the way that business is performing.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks. And Craig, I appreciate your comment on trying to go after price as laws maybe start to work against you a little bit. But can you help us frame that? Perhaps some idea of what percent of your COGS are raw metals or metal related or any kind of ballpark number you could give us there?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's not a number I have handy so what I would just say is that what we'll do is we'll find a way to offset it like we have historically. We could end up in any given quarter with a little timing challenge around inflation versus pricing in the market. But all of that thinking and the current commodity prices are factored into our guidance for the year, so it's all fully baked into 2016 at the current activity levels, at the current inflated levels of steel prices. And so I don't really have the number in terms of specifically the steel commodity itself and how much, in terms of bifurcating that from the rest of what we buy.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And just one other quick one. Just thinking of Eaton Corp. as maybe a window on what industrial companies are thinking. Can you share any view on what you would expect your capital spending to do in 2017?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's really too early for us to make the call. We haven't even really begun the process of working through our internal plans at this point, so we'll certainly be in a position to give you perhaps a better look at that at the end of Q3. But at this point, it's just too early to call.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, can you hear me?","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah, yeah. We got you, Jeff.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Yep, sorry. Okay. So I really wanted to focus on EPG order rates. You went from plus 2 to minus 2 and I just want to understand what caused the delta because that was the one area within Electrical that had been more resilient.","Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer","Well, we don't have that precise Q1 to Q2 comparison, but as Craig pointed out, if you look at order pattern in Electrical Products, it really was the industrial parts. It was those products that are in that segment that go into industrial controls for example, and APAC. Those are the two areas that showed particular weakness. And so without having the precise numbers, I would characterize those areas as being a bit softer than in Q1.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And how about just the non-res piece?","Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer","Well, non-res of course goes across both segments and so much of non-res in Electrical Products tends to be in the lighter commercial type areas and that experienced good conditions. And as Craig mentioned, Europe in general, non-res as well as other markets, experienced pretty good conditions in Q2. Q2 orders.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, good. And then on slide 11, you gave the quarterly cadence of the restructuring cost. Do you have that similarly for the $190 million in savings?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we don't have it particularly for savings and we haven't provided it other than to say that the savings will generally follow the spending in the business. And maybe to deal maybe the follow-on question, as you think about characterizing the restructuring spending for the back end of the year, I'd say that it's going into the businesses that you would likely expect. And so Electrical Systems and Services will be the recipient of the most money followed by Hydraulics and then Vehicle. And so that's, if you're thinking about modeling where the restructuring spending's going, that's really the way the current numbers line out in terms of where most of the cost will go.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks guys.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning. Question on cash flow. Your really strong performance the first half, it's running about 40% of your annual operating cash guidance and in most years, it moves around a little bit, but it's usually between 20% and 30% full-year operating cash. And Rick mentioned the opportunity to draw down inventory in the back half. Are there any second half offsets of that inventory drawdown that we should consider?","Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer","None that we're aware of. We think that, given that, as Craig commented, we think sequentially, revenue stays relatively flat going from Q2 to Q3 and Q3 to Q4. That would mean you wouldn't have a need to build working capital to deal with revenue going up. And so we would hope that we would be able to pull down a bit of inventories in that flattish revenue environment. But other than just the normal business characteristics, we wouldn't expect anything else to impact cash flow.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Rick. And if at historical proportion of closer to 40% hold, if full-year guidance ends up being a little bit conservative, what sort of allocation priorities should we consider? Would it be an acceleration of maybe share repo or restructuring or something else?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'd say that, as we think about the company's capital priorities, I think very much consistent with what we said in New York. And our message all along is that if we think about capital allocation, we say the first priority is to invest in our businesses, to continue to invest to drive organic growth. The second priority was said is in fact to ensure that we continue to maintain a very strong dividend. The third priority we said was to buy back shares, especially in this environment. We think that our stock price is on sale and we think we can create a lot of value of buying back our shares. And then the fourth priority would be to do M&A. And so that prioritization has not changed and that's currently the way we would think about capital deployment.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys. Just to come back to Hydraulics and the stationary market, it seems like you guys are trying to signal a bit more of a downbeat tone there, although when you talk about the weakness or the fresh weakness in industrial market, it seems to be directed more at ESS. So I guess I'm trying to determine one, in 2Q did you see a further loss of momentum in stationary or is it just trying to signal that hey, some of the mobile markets are hitting easier comps and stationary is now along for the ride? I guess first question, just trying to parse out that difference.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'd say in terms of Hydraulics, I think the right way to characterize what we're seeing in the stationary markets is that the oil and gas markets continue to be weak. They've been weak all year and we really have not seen a turn in those markets. We did see a little bit of some weakness in some of the process industries, but those orders tend to be lumpy. And we saw some strength in the mobile markets. And so I'd say the way we'd characterize Hydraulics is that not a downbeat tone at all. We're very much pleased with the fact that we posted better revenue than what we anticipated and we had better order performance than we anticipated. We do think it's important that we don't read that through to mean that a definitive bottom in the business and that the business has turned, but it's certainly a positive indicator for the business overall.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. And thinking about the potential margin mix of recovery, if mobile starts to look better or bounces off of a bottom here and stationary stays weak, is that a better outlook for the margins of the business? Is it all about the same? Maybe help us try to bridge that gap.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think the bigger indicator would be what's happening with the OEM business, whether it's mobile or stationary, and what's happening with distribution. The distribution business tends to be a bit more profitable than the OEM business, and that's really more what influenced the underlying profitability than anything else. And in the quarter, our distribution orders were actually slightly stronger than our OE orders. And so that's a positive sign. But once again, with one quarter, really too early to really make a call one way or the other.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I guess maybe to ask the question differently, is there more distribution exposure in stationary or mobile?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, they really do play across both segments and so our distributors sell mobile applications. They sell industrial applications, so really they play across both markets.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate the question, guys.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Morning, guys. Hey, on Hydraulics, just on the margin side, getting that back to low teens margins ex restructuring has been a goal of yours. Was this sooner than you expected to get there? And now that you're there, has the 13.1% victory been achieved, or anything particularly favorable that got you there this quarter?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, no, I'd say the business largely performed on expectations for the quarter and we certainly continue to have work to do inside of that business with respect to restructuring. We're not done, and obviously the 13% at the low point in the cycle was the bottom of our threshold. And obviously our aspirations for the business are much stronger than that. So I'd say no, we're not done. We're not ready to declare a victory. It was a strong indicator that the restructuring work that we're doing is paying off, but we clearly still have work to do in that business at different volume levels to ensure that we can maintain the minimum of 13% at the bottom of the cycle, and obviously numbers that are closer to 16% in normal times.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, and then on Vehicle, on the margins there, you guys have worked to decapitalize that business and try to minimize the decrementals. They got a little tougher this quarter. You still feel good about the ability to keep modest decrementals in Vehicle?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, absolutely. And quite frankly, we're really pleased with the Vehicle business and the way it performed in the quarter. 17.1% return on sales excluding restructuring at a period of time when the North America Class 8 market is down 30%, at a time when the Brazilian markets are at all-time lows. We think that business continues to execute extraordinarily well and we're very much confident that we have the right formula. And to the point that you raised, it has been a formula of decapitalizing the business, changing the business model, moving more across from fixed to variable and we're very much comfortable that the business formula works there and that that business will continue to deliver strong margins in very difficult economic environments.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just like to touch on Aerospace if we could, some more specifics on the mix that you saw this quarter. The business jet weakness is certainly being felt industry-wide, but maybe some color on the offsets in the aftermarket, both military and commercial?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, as we said, Deane, appreciate the question. I think it's the weakness on the bizjet side caught us all a little bit off guard and that's really what's driving a little bit of underperformance in that business from a revenue and an order input standpoint. But offsetting that and helping the margins, we continue to see strong order input and results in aftermarket, commercial OE, commercial transport continues to be quite strong. It was roughly 10% in the quarter. Military OE was off modestly but very much in line with expectations. And Military aftermarket also growing in the mid-single digit range and so aftermarket continues to be a real source of strength. Commercial transport continues to be a real source of strength offsetting some weakness in bizjet and a little bit of weakness in regional jet as well.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. And then, Craig, just on a bigger picture question, you've now had your first quarter as Chairman and CEO successfully completed. Is there anything different versus your expectations since taking the helm in June?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Deane. I appreciate that question as well. I'd really say no. Again, as you know as well, the transition between Sandy and myself was really over a period of about 12 months and during that period of time, we worked closely together and I was in the shadows of all the calls that have taken place over the last year or more. And so I'd say the job is largely what I expected. The business environment is largely what I expected and there's really been no big surprises. It's the way we like it by the way, in the job so far.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Terrific. Appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. On the guide I think I heard revenue flat or sequentially into the third quarter and again into the fourth quarter. That would seem to be a favorable in the fourth quarter relative to normal seasonality, if you could comment on that.","Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer","It's relatively flat. It might be down just a tiny amount in Q4 possibly, but the reality is that it won't even be a material change and so as we see the balance of the year laying out, it's just Q2, Q3, Q4 are essentially flat revenue.","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","And I appreciate the concern that a number of you are signaling around the second half volume pace. And what we've said all along is that in the event that the volume pace is any different than what we anticipate, we'll be more aggressive around the things that we will do around managing costs. And so as you can imagine, we have a contingency plan that we're working through as a leadership team around what happens if in fact we end up with a volume issue in the second half of the year. So we're well prepared for that contingency.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just in lighting I'm wondering if there's been a lot of transition over the last couple years. One of your competitors talked about some recent change in the competitive and pricing environment, are you seeing anything in that area?","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","No. I'd say lighting, every year it's a business given that the input costs and the price of LEDs has continued to fall. So every year it's a business that basically sheds a bit of price, but also the input costs and the cost of that LED technology continues to drop and so I'd say in that business overall, in its ordinary course is that it's a competitive business and the technology cost continues to decline and our margins in that business, quite frankly are performing just fine. And we had another strong quarter of margins in Q2 and so we think that business is fine and very much consistent with the guidance that we laid out for products during the course of the year.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you all for joining us today. We're at the top of the hour and wrapping, and would like to wrap up our call. As always we'll be available to take questions or follow-up item after the call, thank you very much for joining us today.","Operator","And that does conclude the conference for today.

At this time all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll turn the call now to, Mr. Don Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us for today for Eaton's third quarter 2018 earnings call. As all of you that are on the call have noticed, today our call is occurring at 11 AM versus our traditional 10 start. We moved our call today to allow those of you who follow Cummins to participate in their call, which occurred at 10 AM this morning. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer.","Our agenda today as typical includes opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the performance in the third quarter along with our outlook for 2018 and a preliminary look at 2019. As we've done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments.","The press release from the earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, and a webcast of this call is going to be available on our website and will be available for replay after the earnings is complete.","Before we get started, I want to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to forward-looking future results of the company and are therefore by definition forward-looking statements. The actual results can differ from those forecasted projections due to a range of items covered in the uncertainties covered in our press release, presentation and on the 8-K.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Craig.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Okay. Thanks, Don. Hey, let me begin with a quick summary of our Q3 results. And overall it was a solid quarter where our balance across multiple end markets really allowed the company to deliver strong results and so we're really pleased with our Q3 results.","Earnings per share of $0.95 on a GAAP basis or $1.43 excluding the impact of the arbitration decision we previously announced in August. This is towards the upper end of our guidance range of $1.35 to $1.45 and up 14% above prior year, excluding naturally the gain from the JV that we formed last year in Q3. Our sales were $5.4 billion, up 4%, and this was comprised of 6% organic growth offset by 1% each from both currency and some small divestitures we had during the course of last year.","We're very pleased with our strong margin performance, which included an all-time record margins of 17.6%. Our teams really executed well, which led to all-time record margins in three of our segments including; Electrical Products, Electrical Systems & Services, and Aerospace. And finally, we produced solid operating cash flows of $1 billion in the quarter.","On page 4, we compare our performance of the quarter versus prior year and I'll just highlight a couple of items here. Notice that sales were up 4% and strong execution, segment operating margins were up 120 basis points over prior year and we posted 11% increase in segment operating profits.","We did have two unusual items impacting the year-over-year comparisons, the gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture in Q3 2017 and the expenses from the arbitration decision in Q3 2018. Excluding these items, net income was also up 11%.","On page 5, we summarize the quarterly results of our Electrical Products segment. Revenues were flat with organic growth of 1%, offset by 1% currency. And I'll just note here that revenues in the quarter were negatively impacted by the Lighting business. As we discussed in prior calls, in the Lighting business organic revenues declined slightly in the quarter, in line with declines that we've seen in Q2 and excluding Lighting, Electrical Products had 3% organic growth. In the quarter, we saw revenue strength in North America with particular strength and solid growth in the industrial end markets.","We had expected our Lighting sales to turn positive in the quarter and we do believe this will happen next quarter. This assumption is also supported by the growth that we saw in our orders during the course of Q3. Overall orders increased 3% for the segment with solid growth in industrial and residential markets in North America. And our backlog is up some 16% over last year. So we're pleased to see the really strong strength and building backlogs during the course of the quarter. Segment operating profits increased 4%, with operating margins up 70 basis points to once again an all-time record of 19.2%.","On page 6, we outline the results of our Electrical Systems & Services segment. Organic growth was 9% in the quarter, an acceleration from Q2, which was up 7% and Q1 which was up 2%. Foreign exchange and the divestiture of a small joint venture each reduced revenues by 1% in the quarter. We saw strength in industrial markets and data centers and geographically we saw strength in North America and also in the Asia-Pacific region. Bookings were up 4% with strong growth in EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and with data center orders up double-digit globally.","We did see a degree of caution in late September in U.S., especially in large project orders. We've seen this kind of caution in the past on periods of economic uncertainty and so we do think that impacted our orders a bit in the quarter and at the end of the month of September. Notably, our backlog was up 12% versus last year. Operating margins of 15.4% were up 160 basis points and were an all-time record for the segment.","On page 7, we cover our Hydraulics segment. Here revenues were up 6%, 7% organic growth offset by 1% from currency. We had strength with multiple OEMs in both construction and ag markets and also in the distribution channel. Orders increased 4% with geographic strength in Asia and in the Americas, and this is on top of very strong comps from Q3 of 2017 which were up some 22% last year. So we saw end market strength in both construction and also in agriculture \u2013 with agriculture OEMs.","Geographically, orders were up 12% in the Americas, up 9% in Asia and down 16% in EMEA. Similar to last quarter, orders in EMEA were down due to largely reduced lead times. Our shorter lead times and better delivery performance continues to reduce the need for customers to place long-dated orders in the Europe market. Our Europe orders for deliveries in the three month period, so those shorter lead-time orders, were actually up again this quarter. We continue to have a strong backlog, which was up 24% from last year, operating profits increased 18% and our margins were 14% and 140 basis point improvement over last year.","Next on page 8, we summarize Aerospace's performance in the quarter. The Aerospace segment accelerated nicely from 6% organic growth in Q2 to 9% growth in Q3. In the quarter we saw strength across many platforms including military fighters, rotorcraft, regional jet, biz jets, and in both military and commercial aftermarket, so really broad-based strength in our Aerospace business. Orders remained strong in the quarter, up 12%, with particular strength in commercial transport, commercial aftermarket, as well as in military rotorcraft.","Our backlog is also up strongly, up some 15% in the quarter. And operating leverage here was really outstanding with profits increasing 25% to an all-time record. Margins of 22% and up some 280 basis points over prior year. In addition to solid execution, I will acknowledge as well that we had favorable mix in the quarter, which positively impacted margins, largely as a result of strength in the commercial aftermarket business which grew faster than the overall segment.","Moving to page 9 in the Vehicle segment, in Q3, our organic growth was 7%, and this organic growth was offset by 3% from FX and 2% from the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture last year. The NAFTA Class 8 market continues to perform well. We've increased our production forecast for 2018 from 295,000 units to 320,000 units and this is being offset somewhat by weakness in light vehicle markets in China and a bit in Europe as well. Operating profits increased 11% while operating margin stepped up 140 basis points to 18.9%. Overall, another very strong quarter in our Vehicle business.","And wrapping up our segment summaries, we move to the eMobility segment on page 10. Organic growth was 7%. As anticipated we're ramping up our R&D investment in this business and therefore segment margins stepped down to 12.5%, which is really in line with our full year margin guidance for the segment. In Q3 we secured an additional contract win for a new eMobility program, which reinforces our optimism for this fast-growing market. And we're also currently in discussions with a large number of additional customers and so our long-term growth outlook for this segment remains quite optimistic.","Now moving to page 11. With three quarters behind us and heading into the final quarter of the year, we're fine-tuning our segment expectation for 2018 for both organic revenue growth and for operating margin. Our end markets continue to experience solid growth; we're reaffirming both our full-year organic growth target of 6% and our operating margins of between 16.4% and 17%.","While the overall organic growth expectation remains unchanged, we are adjusting our growth estimates for four of the segments. In Electrical Products, we're adjusting it down by a half a basis point (sic) [half a point] (11:01) from 3% to 2.5%, and this is mostly due to softness in Lighting, which we say \u2013 think has extended one quarter longer than what we originally anticipated. But with orders turning positive in Q3, we're really confident that this headwind for the segment has now abated and we expect to see better growth going forward.","We're also reducing Hydraulics down 1% from 13% to 12%. We had previously raised our outlook in Q1 from 10% to 13%, reflecting the strength in orders over the last 18 months, so this change from 12% to 13% we think reflects just some fine-tuning with three quarters behind us now.","We're also raising our revenue outlook in two segments. We're taking Aerospace up 2%, from 6% to 8% for the year, really on broad-based strength in a number of our end markets, and for Vehicle, we're raising our organic growth forecast by 1%, reflecting the increased production levels in NAFTA Class 8 market in 2018, moving it from 295,000 to 320,000 units.","For segment operating margins, we're fine-tuning some of the targets in a number of the segments, but overall, segment margins for Eaton overall remain unchanged. So we think a strong year of conversion.","And just turning to page 12, we've taken an opportunity here to summarize our thoughts around our raw material cost and tariffs. As we outlined in Q2, we expect the tariff impact for 2018 to be modest, and as background, it's important to note that we do manufacture in zone of currency, and as a result, we don't have large material flows that would disproportionally be affected by tariffs. Where we are affected we've been focused on taking both price increases and operational actions to ensure that we stay ahead of this issue and our performance today certainly reflects this in the margin strength that we're delivering in our businesses.","As we look to 2019, we remain confident in our ability to mitigate the latest round of tariff impacts with both pricing actions and other supply chain changes. As we take a look at the latest round of 301 tariffs that have been now finalized, we expect about $110 million of additional tariff cost in 2019 and we are in the midst of taking actions now that will ensure that the tariff related cost increases are once again fully offset by pricing and other additional supply chain changes. And so we're confident as we look forward just as we look backward that we have plans in place to fully mitigate any tariff related cost increases.","And next on the next page, we provide our Q4 guidance, and an updated guidance on the full year. For Q4, we expect EPS of $1.38 to $1.48 and this assumes 6% organic growth, it assumes margins of between 17% and 17.4% and a tax rate of between 12.5% and 13.5%. And as we take a look at the full year for 2018, for the third time this year, we're increasing the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance to a range of $5.30 to $5.40. This naturally excludes the arbitration decision impact. The midpoint of our EPS guidance is increasing 1% from $5.30 to $5.35. We now expect corporate expenses to be $20 million above 2017 levels compared to $10 million that we previously noted and this is largely the result of slightly higher interest expenses.","The tax rate for 2018 is now expected to be between 11% and 12%, reflecting really the impact of the arbitration decisions in Q3 that we noted earlier. And consistent with prior guidance, we're expecting operating cash flows of between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion. This does exclude the $300 million impact from the arbitration decision in Q3, and also unchanged, our free cash flow is expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, once again, excluding the impact of the arbitration decision.","Our assumptions for CapEx and restructuring costs are unchanged from prior guidance. However, certainly given the recent pullback in the stock market, we would expect our share repurchases to range from $800 million to $1 billion for the full year and year-to-date our share repurchases have been roughly $600 million. So we'll certainly view this is a buying opportunity given the pullback that we've seen recently.","Lastly, at the midpoint of our EPS guidance, we would expect to generate 2018 EPS growth of roughly 15% excluding the impact of the arbitration decision and the 2017 gain from the formation of the Eaton Cummins JV and the income arising from the 2017 tax bill.","Hey, just turning to page 14, and I know this is one of the big questions that's on everybody's mind, during last quarter's earnings call we provided a view of our key end markets and really split by three categories, parts of our businesses that we were basically in the early to mid-part of the growth stage, those that were in the middle part of the growth stage and the late stage of growth. And our conclusion then is still our conclusion today, the majority of our businesses are in the early to mid-part of the economic growth cycle. While we do expect the rate of growth to slow somewhat, given the strong 2018 results. We also anticipate that we'll see solid growth in 2019. This view of our end markets is consistent with our initial outlook for 2019 and our assumption that our end markets will grow between 3% and 4% next year.","And just turning the page 15, while we provide specific guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January \u2013 we will provide specific guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January, we thought it would be helpful also to share some high-level assumptions around 2019. As I noted, we think our end markets will grow 3% to 4%. At this point in the cycle we'd expect incremental margins on core growth to be between 25% and 30% and this does include any impact associated with tariffs. And our preliminary estimate on corporate costs, including pension, interest and other corporate, suggests that they'll be flat with 2018. We expect our tax rate to be between 14% and 15%, consistent with our expected long-term tax rate, and lastly we continue to see opportunities for attractive returns and restructuring opportunities and we anticipate restructuring spending for 2019 will be generally in line with 2018.","So with that, I'll turn the meeting back over to Don Bullock and we're happy to answer any questions that you may have.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Before I have the operator provide you with instructions for the Q&A, I did want to note that we do have a number of individuals in the queue for questions today. Given our time constraints of an hour and our desire to get as many of these questions as possible addressed, please limit your questions to a question and a follow-up. Thanks in advance. With that, I'll turn over to the operator to provide you with instructions for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our first question today comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Craig, I was wondering if you could actually address capital deployment a little bit more directly, and what you're thinking. The spirit I'm asking the question is what seems some plausible speculation you guys were poking around at Esterline. I don't expect you to address that specifically, but maybe you could give us some thoughts on what your appetite is for bigger deals and how you might kind of play that card as we look into 2019?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. Thanks, Jeff, certainly appreciate the question, and as you noted, we don't comment on any potential acquisitions. I would say that our capital deployment strategy is largely unchanged with where we've been. We've said that our first priority in our call on cash is going to be invest in our businesses and to invest in organic growth, and we continue to see really lots of tremendous opportunities to do that.","We'll continue to pay a very healthy dividend and buy back shares, and in this environment, as I noted, we'll certainly be much more aggressive in buying back our shares where we think this is a tremendous buying opportunity, and we'll generate a lot of cash over the next several years, and we have the opportunity to deploy that cash in certainly value-creating acquisitions, and there we've said our priorities continue to be in our Electrical business, in our Aerospace business, and also in our new eMobility segment.","But having said that, what we've said all along as well, we are not going to lose our pricing discipline, that we have a very structured approach to the way we take a look at deals and those opportunities, and we think our cost of capital is 8% to 9%, and we talk about delivering a minimum of 300 basis points over the cost of capital. And so we intend to remain very disciplined as we take a look at opportunities and how we price them, recognizing that we always have an opportunity to go out and buy our stock back and essentially create tremendous shareholder value. So, we will continue to be disciplined as we have been in the past around the way we think about capital deployment.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Right. And by the same token, any other thoughts about just the portfolio overall? I think that probably is something you are always discussing internally, or thinking about internally. Do you think the structure, combined structure still makes sense for Eaton here?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I think in simple terms the answer is yes, we like the structure of the company today, we like the makeup of the company today, but having said that, as we've shared with this group in the past, we are always evaluating and assessing. We have laid out a very specific criteria for what's required to be a part of Eaton and the type of characteristics that businesses need to have and the type of results that they need to deliver, and to the extent that we have businesses that are not measuring up to those requirements, there are specific actions in place to improve.","And obviously they are on the clock, and they have to improve within a certain period of time. And if they don't improve, we'll do what we've done in the past, and we've always been willing to divest parts of the portfolio that don't live up to the company's expectation. And I can assure you that we have a very thorough process with our board where we review all of our businesses, including nonperforming businesses on a regular basis, and so I would tell you that we will continue to be smart and diligent in assuring that the things that are part of the company pass the criteria or have a path to it, or we'll take other action.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Right. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning, Nigel.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, no one told me about the 10 o'clock, I actually dialed in quite early. So just want to dig in a little deeper on the projects pause, I think you called out, specifically within ESS, and I'm just wondering what are you hearing from customers here? Is this more inflation and having to back to the drawing board to reassess project returns? Is it just uncertainty around the macro? Any color there would be helpful. And any end market color in terms of where the project delays are coming from?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, what I see, Nigel, we did see it, as I mentioned, largely in large projects in the month of September, in the Americas primarily, and it was \u2013 certainly caught us by a little bit \u2013 by surprise as well, but I do think it's just simply the environment that we're in right now which is filled with lots of uncertainty, whether it's geopolitical issues, or it's the elections or it's tariffs, quite surprisingly, we were clocking along just fine and were surprised in the month of September, but we do think that it's a temporary pause, and if you take a look at the macro data, whether it's the C30 data or you take a look at some of the key end markets that we serve, there's nothing that would suggest that the fundamentals are not still very much intact. And so we'll have to see what Q4 brings, but at this point, there's nothing that would suggest that the underlying strength that we anticipated to see in our Electrical Systems & Services business would abate at this point.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on China, obviously there's a lot of push and pull going on in China with \u2013 obviously, we're seeing a slowdown in the data, the stimulus measures coming through. Feels like the construction markets are pretty healthy over there. Obviously you play quite strongly into the construction markets, but any comment in terms of what you're seeing in China would be helpful.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I think, without a doubt we definitely saw a slowdown in China during the course of Q3. Principally, we saw that slowdown in vehicle markets which I think have been largely widely reported and we saw that slowdown as well, although we did deliver solid growth ourself in China in Q3 based upon a number of new wins.","And so I do think that as we think about the project business or commercial construction in China, at this point, we think that market continues to be fine. There's nothing that we're seeing in the overall economy that would suggest a significant pullback, although, clearly, there's some uncertainty in the China market as well.","I think the tariff impact and the uncertainty that that's creating, I just \u2013 I spent about a week in China myself a couple weeks ago, had an opportunity to meet with a lot of our customers and CEOs of local Chinese companies, and they, too, are feeling this period of uncertainty and I do think there's a little bit of a pause taking place in that market, as well, pending our elections and the ultimate resolution of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks, Rick.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So maybe just following up on that question on just the large project pause in North America, I guess I'm just trying to understand, did you guys have a sense that these projects were going to be awarded in September and then the customers decided to pause on the decision? Or was this more of like just a gap in the market from the strength that you'd been seeing in the most previous quarters?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Joe, I'll take that one. It really was the former. We had expected contracts to be signed by the end of September and due to the uncertainties that Craig talked about, there are various customers that delayed committing to projects. We think it's temporary. These are projects that are quite far along, so it's not likely that they won't go forward, but it seemed to be that phenomenon, really, just in the last two weeks of September.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","And I'd say that that position is really buttressed a little bit by the fact that if you take a look at our backlog in both our Electrical Systems & Services business, as well as in our Electrical Products business, the both of them were up quite strongly in the quarter, up 12% in Electrical Systems & Services and up 16% in Electrical Products. And so I think that that thesis is really borne out by the increase in our backlog.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And perhaps my follow-on question, Craig, you mentioned earlier just initial thoughts into 2019 on the contribution margin of 25% to 30%, so that includes the tariff related impact. I'm just wondering, how much are you anticipating to get back of the $110 million in tariffs? And then, also, if you think about just like cadence from a pricing perspective, like how are you guys thinking about that as you progress through 2019?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I'd say that \u2013 once again, appreciate the question. The 25% to 30% does include the impact of tariffs and while we fully expect to recover all $110 million of the tariff related cost increases, what's obviously problematic is trying to get an incremental on top of a tariff.","And so the incrementals that we're talking about for 2019 are somewhat muted as a result of what we think will be an inability to get an incremental margin on a tariff related cost increase, but we certainly expect to fully recover those costs and we expect to be out in front of it and ensure that as we go through the quarter, that the tariff related cost increases are not a headwind to margins.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. So just a couple questions here, truck, big revision here. Is that being driven by the supply chain improving there, any kind of color?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I'd say, one, Jeff, absolutely. There were some supply chain constraints that we experienced early in the year and there was some concern that we and others had about the industry's ability to actually deliver against the underlying demand that was in the marketplace. And certainly, those constraints have been largely eliminated during the course of the year. And so that's certainly part of what drove us to revise our forecast up, as well as the market has just continued to be very robust. And I'd say the really good news even about some of the order intake that we continue to see in the North America Class 8 market, is that in all likelihood, all of these orders are not going to be delivered during the course of 2018 and they'll spill off into 2019. And so we think 2019 will be another growth year for North America Class 8 on top of a very strong year in 2018.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then data center, I think you cited as been strong, certainly it's been red hot in 2018. If you just look at backlog and quoting activity, what does that suggest for that data center market into 2019?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, right now we enter, we will enter 2019 with a pretty decent backlog and certainly there are continued discussions for some large orders next year. So we would expect 2019 would be another robust year. Right now it's a little bit hard to say will it be as robust as 2018, 2018 after all did step up dramatically, but it should be another strong year.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.","Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning, Nicole.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. So just I don't want to harp too much on this ESS order issue but just had one more point to clarify. I guess when you think about the customer conversations that you're having and the fact that they're kind of pushing out signing contracts, is there any visibility at all on how long they're pushing out? Like is this oh, we'll delay until 4Q because we want to get this into our CapEx year? Or are these contracts more likely to be signed in 2019 once we get past this next stage of tariffs?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I think it's really difficult to say precisely, Nicole, how much of a delay we're talking about, but with these projects in general you can't delay them for that long, right? I mean, as they're tied to other underlying requirements for facilities and buildings. And so we don't anticipate that this is going to be a long delay and we would hope to see in the course of this year in the fourth quarter and certainly by time we get to Q1, that this thing rights itself.","Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Craig. And then second question just around Hydraulics margins, you guys had to take down guidance again. I guess what's going on there? Maybe a little bit more color and is this just a structurally less profitable business than you thought? Or is this just really attributed to price cost and other issues that are more transitory? And I guess, does Hydraulics have a place in Eaton's portfolio given what we've seen with the margin performance year-to-date?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Sure. First of all, I'd say we too are disappointed in the fact that we've got to take margins down again in Hydraulics, but I'd say the underlying margin issue in Hydraulics is largely a function of supply chain and operational inefficiencies that we're experiencing throughout the system. They're not structural, they're absolutely fixable but we have continued to struggle with the ability to work through supply chain, we're spending a lot more than we anticipated in premium freight and expedite and overtime as the industry has ramped up and our ability, and quite frankly our suppliers' ability to deal with this ramp in orders and sales.","And so I'd say structurally speaking, nothing has changed, but having said that, as I've said with all of our businesses, Hydraulics is on the clock. And there are certain things that we have to do to demonstrate that the Hydraulics business can be a consistent performer in the company in terms of underlying margins and underlying growth rate and reduced cyclicality. And so all of the criteria that we've laid out for every part of the company also applies to Hydraulics and they have some work to do to demonstrate that we can create the kind of business that we want to own long term inside of Eaton.","Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","But structurally speaking, no concerns. And they're operational issues that we have to work out with our supply base. But the business remains largely on target.","Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Craig.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with UBS.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, thanks, and good morning.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Just on the 2019 overall market growth of 3% to 4% that you're calling out, are you still thinking about your own outgrowth of that generally and kind of the one and a half times or two times? Or how are you guys thinking about your own performance relative to that?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I think at this point, Steve, we're still in the midst of doing our own planning internally, but you have the thesis right. The 3% to 4% is market and we would anticipate our businesses growing in excess of market. And so as we get through our own internal profit planning for 2019 and we provide guidance in January, we'll give you a sense for what we think the overall growth rate of the company will be. But it will be something on top of market growth.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And I just want to make sure I'm crystal clear on your comments on that delay that you talked about so much on the call. The order delays around ESS, are those projects that are already in the backlog that you saw the risk or just new? And if they are already in the backlog, are you \u2013 can you think about sort of this is 12 to 18-month projects; I assume these are sort of shorter term ones?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","No, I would put \u2013 these are really largely in the category of negotiations that did not result in an order, so, therefore, are not in the backlog.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So, therefore, you're not seeing or calling out any incremental risk to what's already in the backlog?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Absolutely not.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, I'll pass it on.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Good morning. I just want to go back if we can, to your 2019 tariff comments. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on which segments might be impacted more than others? And I'm also wondering if Section 301 essentially gets taken all the way, what would be the incremental impact, if you know it, or you had a to calculate it versus what you've got in the pipe today?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Sure. I'd say \u2013 first of all, I'd say that, to answer maybe to your last question first. Most of the stuff that we do in terms of trade between China and the U.S. has already been captured in the current proposed wave of tariffs. And so if they ended up tariffing 100% of what came out of China into the U.S. it would have an immaterial impact on our company. So most of it's been captured in what's already been announced. And in the context of what's already been announced by segment, I'd say most of it will largely be in our Electrical segments. We had some earlier \u2013 some of the earlier stuff caught our industrial businesses. And this last wave, most of that will be in the Electrical sector. But we will have some smattering of impacts across the other businesses as well.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I see. That's helpful. And again, looking at 2019 incremental margin comments, 25% to 30%, based on what you just said about tariff impact, is there a way to maybe rank the various segments in terms of where you see opportunity for incremental margins? What's above-average? What would be below average? How do you think about it?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, we certainly appreciate the question, and I'd just say this once again, it's a little bit early for us to provide that level of detailed guidance, as we've not worked through our own internal profit plans. And so perhaps in January we can provide you a bit more insight. But for right now I think if you use 25% to 30% for the overall company, it should help you at least do some preliminary modeling.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. Thanks.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning, Josh.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just to maybe dig on EP here, I know you guys have talked at length in the past about an implicit attachment rate between EP and ESS. Craig, you mentioned in some of your opening remarks that the industrial side of EP was doing a little bit better. So I would assume that attachment rate is still holding, but when I think about the deceleration in the quarter, Lighting was cited as a bit of an issue. And I would imagine in 2Q that was an issue as well. So I'm just trying to figure out what inside of EP feels different sequentially, understanding that maybe Lighting isn't moving around as much.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, let me take a stab at it. I would say the fundamentals of the business, let's take Lighting out, that's a separate set of issues. The fundamentals feel not very different than in Q2. The tone of the market, the momentum. What we did see, though, right towards the end of September, is we did see a similar slowing in some of our flow goods in various parts of the business and I would attribute it to the same kind of caution that we saw in ESS, in the orders in ESS. It's just that in a flow good type business, you tend to see it in sales because it just \u2013 it's an immediate impact as opposed to simply an order being placed.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just to go back to the outgrowth question that was asked earlier on 2019, could you maybe frame up how you think about the 6% for 2018 and what that represents of outgrowth versus markets just so we can kind of level set how that has trended?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","I can take a stab at it. I mean, it's really hard.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Don't stab too much, it's close to Halloween, Rick.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, yeah.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Right.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","The way I would think about it \u2013 first of all, the way I would think about the general growth in our revenues, 2018 was a year of growth in many of our markets. It was probably above trend and what you're seeing in 2019 is you're coming back towards a more trend-like rate of growth. And our outgrowth in 2018, it's hard to know your markets, particularly in this tumultuous time very exactly, but at 6% organic growth, we're probably a point or so, maybe a little more than a point, of outgrowth.","And so if you think about 2019, you could take the 3% to 4% and add something, a point to a point and a half, maybe, roughly, outgrowth and get some kind of rough estimate of what kind of organic revenue growth we're likely to have. It'll be a little less in 2019 than in 2018, but that's to be expected, you come back to a more trend like market growth.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I think you just answered the question, Rick, that I said I wasn't going to answer.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Sorry about that.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Appreciate the color.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question is from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. I was hoping to pile on just a little bit on your thinking around 2019 and when you see overall market growth of 3% to 4%, it feels like half to three-quarters of that's probably available in terms of pricing, which would imply a fairly low growth rate on sort of a unit level. And I'm curious sort of how you think about that.","And then the follow-on would be on incremental margin. I guess I would have assumed that 25% to 30% is a good base level, but you would have had some sort of restructuring benefit on top of that. And so, recognizing you probably don't want to put numbers around that, just sort of how do we think about that qualitatively?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Inventories in the market.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes. There is a holding number for price in our 2019 market outlook, but it's really preliminary and I wouldn't read too much into that. Does the 3% to 4% need ultimately, to be adjusted for price? Maybe, but it's just too early to have a good feel for that.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","And the incremental margin?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I'd say the way I would think about the incremental margins is that \u2013 keep in mind that a lot of the restructuring stuff that we've done, really, we got a lot of those benefits in 2018 and we'll be spending more \u2013 a similar level of restructuring expenses in 2019.","And so I think you saw the pop in incremental margins in 2018, but as you think about just the timing of programs and expense versus benefits, as you take on more and more programs, the profile of cost versus benefit changes. And so I'd say that the 25% to 30% is a good number to use right now and the restructuring programs will have good paybacks, but the \u2013 as you look at every incremental program, the length and the payback pushes out a little bit.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","I think it's fair to say we have not yet gone through the detailed restructuring initiatives for next year. So until we do that, we can't be really precise about the benefits next year from those programs.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Fair enough. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good morning.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question on taxes. Given where taxes ended up for this year, why do we think the tax rate will go up next year, particularly as you're working to reduce it longer-term?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Well, there \u2013 2018 is still a transitional year with some changes in the regulations associated with the tax bill. And so we, as we look at those changes including a step-up in the rate of the BEAT tax next year, we believe that the tax rate will naturally move a bit higher.","Now 11% to 12% we say is the overall rate, but mind you, that rate's a little lower than it would be because of the Pepsi arbitration. That was a U.S. expense, and of course a U.S. expense pulls with it the U.S. relatively higher tax rate than the rest of the world, and so that pulls the overall rate down. If you look at the rate without that Pepsi expense, the rate is going to be higher by something on the order of a point to a point and a half. And so the difference isn't as great as it seems.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. And then another question. How should we think \u2013 you guys sort of broke out eMobility. And how volatile should we expect this segment to be, both in terms of profitability and top line?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I'd say that we can expect a fair amount of volatility in this business. Largely, if you think about the top line, is programs and program wins will naturally be lumpy, and they come in very large chunks when you win a program. So I think from a standpoint of the revenue growth \u2013 and once again, the revenue growth we're still saying is going to be out a couple years or so. But it will naturally be lumpy, just by virtue of the type of business and the growth phase that we're in, in this particular industry. And we will continue to invest heavily in R&D. I mean, we talked about the underlying profitability being, order of magnitude 12% as we continue to invest heavily in R&D. As we win programs, each of those will require a level of R&D investment, and so I think you can expect a fair amount of lumpiness in the segment as we move forward.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Morning, Deane.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Craig, was hoping you could expand on your comments regarding that you thought most of your businesses were still in the early to mid-stage of the cycle. So what are you basing that on? Are there some bellwether verticals that give you good indications of that as to the size of projects? But some color there for starters, would be helpful.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I mean, and once again, everybody has their own kind of sense of forecasting, but one of the things we certainly look at in our largest segment, we look at the census data and we looked at consensus forecasts. And when you take a look at consensus forecasts, whether it's Dodge or IHS or Moody's or Associated Builders and Contractors, and we have an economic forecast. And there's also a number of economic forecasters and prognosticators who basically have a view of what 2019 is going to look like. And I'd say, their consensus numbers would suggest that 2019 will look not terribly different from 2018. A little bit of moderation in growth on average or looking at the median, but you're still talking about growth in the 3% to 4% range when you look at this consensus body of forecasters.","And when you \u2013 if you talk to customers, you look at negotiations, you take a look at where we are in the economic cycle versus our historical cycles. You put all these factors together. We take a look at an aerospace business that continue to do extremely well on commercial with a big backlog. You look at increased defense spending. You look at the type of orders that we're experiencing today in our North America Class 8 truck business and the type of \u2013 kind of backlog that they'll carry into 2019. So we think it's really only the vehicle markets around the world that have shown clear evidence of sales retrenchment. And most of the other markets that we serve, whether we're looking at the current view or the outlook for our markets would suggest that we continue to see growth.","And even for us, if you think about some of the headwinds that we've experienced this year in the context of even Lighting, we don't expect those headwinds to necessarily be there next year. And so once again, we think it's the forecast that we laid out, that our markets will grow 3% to 4% next year, is supported by all the economic data that we take a look at and supported by what we're hearing and seeing from customers as well.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I appreciate all that color. And then just follow-up on the free cash flow question, was there any sort of prebuying done? We talked about this last quarter, but pre-buying ahead of the tariffs, and maybe also for what you all may have done in terms of inventory building. But anything unique or an impact on the quarter that we would see?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I would say for sure we did, as I think we talked about a little bit last quarter, we did some pre-buying in terms of inventory to get out in front of the tariffs and protect our customers, and so we did build a little bit of inventory during the course of Q3 that we'd expect to unwind in Q4, and as we go forward. But nothing that I would say is material. Our cash flow numbers in the quarter, $1 billion dollars of free cash flow, and we are maintaining our guidance for the year, and so everything that we've done, we expect to largely unwind it during the course of the year.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, one way to think about it, Deane, is that if you look at simple way of thinking about amounts of working capital. So receivables inventory less payables divided by annualized sales were at about 21.5%, and most of the time we've operated more like 19%. So there is an opportunity to bring that down, it's largely in the inventory area because of some of the need to take positions to deal with the tariff issues. We have not yet done that, but certainly we have plans to take down this inventory back to more normal levels. We hope to make some of that progress in Q4 and some will probably extend into the first quarter of next year.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's real helpful. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","The next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Wanted to dig into the pause you discussed in some the Electrical markets and look into another vertical, Hydraulics. Did you see any similar pause in that business, specifically in energy and mining?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I'd say in Hydraulics, no, we really did not see any particular pause in energy and mining and one of the great proxies for what's going on for example in mining, you see the Cat data that's out there, which was, once again, very strong in Q3, and so material prices, the commodity prices are up, that's generally a very good thing for mining overall, very good for the equipment manufacturers. So no, we really did not see any pause in that market at all. China is a big piece of construction equipment and in China in Q3 we continue to see very strong numbers in excavator sales and wheel loaders, and so no, we have not seen a pause in those markets.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, Craig. And then separately, Eaton's historically had a really good feel for the NAFTA Class 8 truck market. And we're seeing customers having to wait a real long time for truck deliveries. Are you guys seeing any sign of double ordering within that backlog?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","No, I think at this point we'd say no, we've seen no evidence of that. The market is good right now and obviously rates are up, capacity is up, and we are actually in a replacement cycle based upon trucks that were basically sold, and it peaks eight, nine years ago. And so right now, I'd tell you it all feels good, Andy, and that market as you know, it's subject to be volatile, but everything that we're hearing today from customers and seeing in the market would suggest that no double ordering, and 2019 will be another growth year on top of an extraordinary year in 2018.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","The next question comes from and Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered by now. But maybe you could expand on the project win you talked about in eMobility, where is it, what is it, what's the timeline, just some color on that would be great?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, it was largely, I'd say, Ann, if it was a win in the commercial vehicle segment, and it was a relatively modest win in that particular business. And so I'd say today, not one that's big enough for us to make a lot of noise over at this point, we are still bidding on a number of very interesting opportunities in eMobility, but I'd say that one was largely in commercial vehicles with some of our existing customers, and really not one that I'd say that's worthy of a lot of discussion at this point.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then as a follow up, I think when I was with you earlier in the quarter and European construction was showing some signs of weakness, and yet on page 14 it's listed as mid-growth stage. I would think that that's one end market that may be at the later growth stage just given how long that market has expanded. Could you just discuss that a little bit?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","We actually, a quarter or two ago would have said it was not yet into even mid, it was sort of late early stage and we think it's moved into the mid stage. But barring political issues in Europe, we think you'll have another year or two of reasonable growth in European construction, Ann. So that's our thinking as to why it's in the mid stage.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And any regional color, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Germany versus other regions? I'm just trying to get a sense of where you're seeing the growth. Thank you.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","I have to say, Ann, that I can't give you that off the top of my head but certainly Don can follow up with you on that.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, okay. No problem. And then the only other segment that I think I would disagree with is ag equipment, but we can talk about that offline also given the Chinese tariffs. I'll leave it there for now. Thank you.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Okay. Thanks, Ann.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","We're probably going to have time for one last question as we want to wrap up on the hour. So we've got John Walsh with Credit Suisse.","John Walsh - Credit Suisse","Hi, thank you for fitting me in here.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Great.","John Walsh - Credit Suisse","So just going back to the initial thoughts on 2019 and as we think about pension and where rates are and I think there's a little bit of a refi benefit potentially in 2019, is there something in corporate to call out? Or is it just it's early days and flat's just the appropriate way to think about it today?","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","I'd say first of all, it is early, and we think it will broadly be flat. But secondly, you do have short interest rates rising and we, like other most large corporates have roughly half of our debt swapped into floating. And so as the short rates rise, our interest costs go up. And so it's really those two factors. As a general matter, it'll be pretty flat, but secondarily, we do know at least of one factor that's likely to increase expenses slightly.","John Walsh - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then I guess thinking about data center and what the growth looks like from here is there any discernible mix benefit or headwind to call out as we kind of see the shift to colo and edge over hyper and what that impact is to Eaton?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I'd say not. I'd say that we have a very strong position as a company in hyperscale, and that is the fast-growing segment of the market. And so I think if anything, the advantage goes to Eaton as you look at these larger, more complex hyperscale data centers.","John Walsh - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","With that, we'll wrap up the call for the day. I do want to remember that we will be available for follow up for the remainder of the day and in the days and weeks following this. Thank you all for joining us on the call today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) And as a remainder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead.","Donald Bullock","Good morning. I am Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. I'd like to welcome you all to our second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and CFO.","We'll begin today's call with comments from Sandy and we'll follow up with questions for the question-and-answer session. Before we step into the presentation I would like to take a moment to draw your attention to the statement on page two of our presentation. Our presentation today contains certain forward-looking statements. Comments on page two in the presentation will outline the series of factors that could cause those actual results to differ from the statements. Those factors are also noted in the press release and in the Form 8-K. Additionally, we have a number of non-GAAP measures in the presentation as defined by SEC rules. A reconciliation of those measures and the most directly comparable GAAP equivalent can be seen on our Investor Relations website at www.eaton.com.","At this point, I will turn it over to Sandy.","Alexander Cutler","Thanks, Don, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us. I am going to walk through the packet of information that we posted in terms of our earnings presentation. So I am turning to page three to start. And just before I comment on this page, I will spend a little longer time this morning talking to our view of end markets because obviously they have had an impact on our guidance for the year, and so I will come to that in a moment.","Let's start on page three, titled highlights of the second quarter results. And I'd just remind everyone that this is a second full quarter of our results reflecting our acquisition of Cooper Industries. Operating earnings per share of $1.09 that compared to our guidance for the quarter of $1.05 to $1.15 and the consensus of $1.11 as of the last night.","Our sales were $5.6 billion, up a very solid 38%, and that's about up 5.5% from the first quarter. And you'll recall that our guidance when we left the first quarter and were giving guidance for the second quarter, was that we expect our sales to move up seasonally about 7.5%. We had said between 5% and 10%. So we came in slightly short of that. We are really delighted that in spite of the market weakness that drove that miss in sales, we had all time record quarterly segment operating margins of 15.6%. I think if you've had a chance to look through the pack, you'd see in a really strong performance across our businesses.","Strong operating cash flow, $609 million. And that our Cooper integration remains ahead of schedule. Really pleased with the progress our teams are making in this regard. So we've increased our 2013 synergies by $25 million to $115 million, and I'll comment a little later on the fact, on our view on 2014 and 2016, both which have moved up as well. I think what obviously is allowing us to do is these cost savings are helping to offset some of the market weakness that we're dealing with. It really allows us to make some progress by controlling those issues we can control when the markets are a little bit weaker than we anticipated.","If we turn to page four, just a quick reconciliation to our second quarter guidance. You recall the midpoint of our guidance was $1.10. We had about $125 million lower sales than we had anticipated. That's the difference between the 7.5% and the actual achieved 5.5% growth from the first quarter. That drove a negative $0.08. Higher incrementals, you saw the very high segment margin is 15.6%, a new quarterly record for us, up about $0.04. And the tax rate we\u2019d said would be around 10% when we gave our guidance and it came in at 7%. That was about $0.03. So all in all netted about $0.01 short of where we had thought we would be coming into the quarter.","Now if we compare the first quarter to the second quarter, and I think this is where it\u2019s perhaps easiest to get a sense for rate of the progress, because we do have some difficulty comparing year-to-year because of the size of the Cooper acquisition, the first quarter you recall our operating earnings per share, I\u2019m on slide five, was $0.84. We had higher seasonal volume, about $290 million higher. We were at $5.31 billion in the first quarter, $5.6 billion in the second quarter. So that's that 5.5% I\u2019ve referred to a couple of times. That drove about $0.19. We didn't have the inventory charges from the purchase price adjustments that you recall that we had in the first quarter. That was about $33 million you recall in the first quarter. That did not repeat and it won't repeat going forward. That's a positive $0.06.","Our margins improved from 14% in the first quarter to about 15.6% here in the second quarter. And so that drove about $0.05 and this improvement beyond the normal 33% incremental that we talked about this year and also the additional synergy, which is on the next line that we incurred as we're continuing to ramp up our synergy savings from our acquisitions. And then the tax rate was little higher here in the second quarter, about 7% versus 5% in the first quarter. And our corporate expenses increased as we had indicated they would up to a total and I\u2019m including pension in this category of about $85 million or negative $0.04. So that's the reconciliation of how we get from $0.84 to the $1.09.","Turning to page six, a quick look as we try to compare ourselves back to last year the second quarter. If you recall last year we had $1.15. The higher acquisition volume above $1.6 billion drives about $0.66. Our margins were higher. Last year they were 14.7% of the segment level, this year 15.6%. Our tax rate was a little lower, 7% this year versus 8.7% last year. And then you get into a couple of the items that are directly related to the acquisition financing. A higher number of shares were about 476 million shares this year. We were about 339 last year.","Purchase price accounting and amortization, that's about $66 million. That's a negative $0.18. Higher interest as you can see looking at our income statement of about $41 million. And then slightly lower core volume there of about $90 million lower volume in terms of core as the markets were weaker this year. That's the reconciliation. And we know it's a difficult one for you to follow with all the puts and takes because of the acquisition and the associated financing and accounting.","Let's move to chart seven, a quick summary. You\u2019ve seen most of these numbers already in our press release. Sales versus the first quarter were up 5.5%. You see a very substantial increase in the segment operating margins from 14% in the first quarter to 15.6% here in the second quarter. We think really good sequential progress in the business.","Turning to the individual product segments, let's start on page eight with the electrical products segment. Versus the first quarter when we had sales of $1.66 billion, sales are up approximately 6% from the first quarter. You see the very substantial margin progress, up to 16.2% from 14.7% in the first quarter. Large contribution here obviously from the acquisition and this is all Cooper in this particular segment. And then you recall, if you try to compare the second quarter '13 to the second quarter '12 numbers, you recall of course that the Cooper numbers are not in the second quarter '12. What I would tell you when you look within both the Eaton legacy and the Cooper legacy businesses, is we made solid progress in terms of margin improvement in both streams of revenues. So, really, very pleased with the revenue performance here, bookings up 2%. Markets, not probably a surprise to you, stronger in the U.S., Middle East and Latin America, weaker in Asia Pacific and Europe, and I will come back and comment about that when we talk about our forward look.","As a result of this very strong performance here in the quarter, we are raising our segment margin to 16.5% for the full year versus our original 16%. So really strong margin performance, integration performance here within the segment. Turning to page nine, our electrical systems and services segment, compared to the first quarter of this year, first quarter of 2013, we had sales of $1.521 billion. And so as you see, our sales are up about 7% compared to the first quarter, margins are up 14.7% versus 14.1% in the first quarter. When you compare, again, back to the second quarter of '12, we have the same issue here that the Cooper products were not included in 2012, they are in 2013. Again, very solid margin progress in both streams here.","The acquisitions that you see contributing 78% to the sales, that is the Cooper, Rolec and Gycom acquisitions. Once again very strong margin performance and as result we are raising our segment margin guidance from 14% to 14.5% for the full year. If we turn to hydraulics, compared to the first quarter of 2013 when our sales were $756 million, sales are up 2% sequentially. Margins up very strongly, 14.5% compared to 11.9% in the first quarter of this year. The acquisition numbers you see in terms of contributing 10 points to the sales, that is both the Jeil and SEL Polimer acquisitions. And I think perhaps the most important in terms of trying to understand the pace of this business, let's look at the bookings and drill down just a little bit in this area.","Bookings were down 12% versus the very strong second quarter of last year. And when you look within that, I think probably not a surprise in terms of the complexion. Distributor sales were down for us on the order of about 9%, OEMs down on the order of about 16%. And when you drill down within that, no surprise, the larger weakness continues to be on the mobile side of the market where it was down about 18%, whereas the stationary side was only down about 8%. Looking around the world, probably not a lot of surprises in this regard too, is that we have not seen a snapback in Asia Pacific at this point. Europe continues to be weak and the U.S. is weak at this point, really led by the weakness on the construction and mining side.","Turning to page 11, aerospace. First quarter sales were $434 million. So our second quarter sales of $446 million were up about 3%, again very solid margin performance here, 15% in the quarter compared to 14.3% in the first quarter. Bookings up about 5%, not a surprise again. I think here really driven by the strength of the commercial OEM market. Aftermarket remains weak, and you'll recall that we've said that we thought the first half of this year would be choppy in the aftermarket. Our expectation is it'd begin to stabilize in the second half of this year. Very solid quarter in terms of margin performance and top line performance.","Turning to page 12, the vehicle segment. First quarter 2013 sales were $939 million. So $1.2 billion here in the second quarter of '13, up 7%. Operating profit, again a familiar story by now, a very solid quarter. Really an exceptional 17.2% operating margin compared to 14.1% in the first quarter. Of the big change here, and you saw it in our commentary and our press release, is that we have reduced our NAFTA heavy duty truck production estimate for 2013 down from 270,000 units to 260,000 units. And just to anticipate a question, yes, we do still think the second half is stronger than the first half in terms of that layout with the first quarter this year having been about 55,000 units. The second quarter about 66,000 units. The third quarter, 68,000, is our forecast, fourth quarter 71,000. Those are all NAFTA production numbers adding up to 260,000 full year forecast, down 10,000 units from our earlier forecast.","If you turn to page 13, I think this really becomes the heart of our discussion with you today. And to anticipate questions, let's spend a little bit more time on this particular chart than we might ordinarily do so. And before I get into the specific numbers, let me give you the backdrop to our thinking about what's happening globally in terms of economic. We know there\u2019s been a rush of data in the last couple of days that has seemed quite positive. We'd like to put it in a little bit broader perspective and maybe a setting that is I think anchored by if you simply look at U.S GDP in the second quarter which you saw reported this week at a 1.7%. I think that many have not concentrated upon is that the manufacturing industrial production number was 0.1. So virtually no growth.","And so as we look around the world, I give you a quick rundown how we think about it. We've obviously changed our full year market growth guidance to 1% from the guidance we gave you at the end of the first quarter which you recall was a 2% to 3% range headed towards the bottom of that range. We think the global economy is trending up slowly, but it is a real mix of positives and negatives. And we don't think we\u2019re being dower. We think we are being realistic in this regard. U.S. is plodding. Europe may be at a bottom, but we see a little prospect for a lot of vigor in a prospective recovery at this point. And the emerging nations continue to be a mixed bag with China, India and Brazil probably being good examples of halting progress.","We do not see a major catalyst for a change in the second half of this year. If you think about just a couple end markets, construction is mixed in the U.S. That's flat, perhaps declining in Europe. Capital equipment is rising moderately in NAFTA and elsewhere. Most global vehicle markets are improving. And the EU decline and the slope is beginning to flatten. But U.S. Defense and government spending are clearly hamstrung by the sequester and fiscal challenges. As we look here in the U.S, in Canada we see strong residential construction, a weaker non-residential construction than expected earlier in the year. Weak construction equipment, we've seen indications of that over the last couple of weeks. Weaker general industrial demand. I think you've seen that from a number of companies who have announced here.","The utility demand is weaker than it was a year ago, particularly in the distribution segment. We see flat to weak heavy duty truck demand. I spoke about the government issue. And then we do see data center demand strengthening, both at the high-end and mid-end, particularly in terms of prospects for the second half of this year. If we go to Europe, I think many of us were surprised with the high side PMI surprise that we saw on the Eurozone. And we are hopeful, that means that we're seeing the economy flatten. But that's one month. That's not yet a quarter or two quarters.","And in Asia Pac, I think most people were shaken by the China PMI's downside surprise after a number of people have felt they saw that market significantly increasing. Demand continues to flow in Australia. In India I think we see it\u2019s a story of reduced growth from what we were used to several years ago. So as we look at all of this, we think it's a fairly realistic appraisal at this point in terms of a 1% growth rate in terms of our end markets this year. And GDP here in the U.S, for many of you who follow that in close order, being below 2% this year. And so not a huge change from where we've been in our forecast, but I know it stands in some stark contrast to the very bullish numbers that have come out in a number of areas until people saw jobs today. And I think as people start to concentrate on the industrial production, we see the growth here in the U.S is primarily on the consumer side, not the industrial side.","And let me bring us back here to page 13, which is our attempt to provide you some insights into our end markets as we see them by each of the segments as we report them. So if you take the two electrical markets together, we had been talking about the electrical products index growing at 3% in total and the electrical systems and services index growing at 4%. And so as you can see these have come down a couple of points. And let me talk to you just about a couple of the places and let me do this by end markets. And so if we talk about for both electrical products and electrical systems, our view of the European markets is that they are going to be down on the order of about 2% this year, and that Asia Pacific will be up about 3%. That is a little weaker in both areas than we have thought earlier this year. Here in U.S., our view is the utility markets will be down on the order of 4%. Non-residential construction will be up 2% to 3%, now that's weaker than we thought earlier in the year when we said 4% to 5%. Residential, I think we are all following, we think continues to be a strong number up about 12%. General and industrial about 2% and power quality down too after a very, very weak first half and then strengthening into the second half. That's our view on the electrical business at this time.","The hydraulics business, not a big change from our earlier forecast. We had been forecasting the hydraulics index in the U.S. will be down 5%. We weakened the index outside of the U.S. from a negative 3% at the end of the first quarter down to a negative 5%, anticipating that Europe is down about 4%, Asia is down about 7%, and Latin America down about 3%. In the aerospace side after we've taken up our view here, really because the commercial story here in the U.S. continues to get stronger. The only real change we've made here is that we're talking about aerospace kind of a 9% up instead of an 8% up in that market. And outside of the U.S. we went up from 4% to 5%. So overall aerospace increased from 2% to 3%.","In the vehicle area, really two I think salient changes here. In the U.S., growth number where we had been at 1% positive growth were at negative 3%. And really the main issue here is our reduction of the NAFTA heavy duty truck business. If you go outside of the U.S., a little stronger. We had thought it would be about 3%, now we think it will be about 4%. And the real issue there is that we have seen Latin America growing less than 10%. We now think it may grow as much as potentially 18% as we are seeing quite a recovery in the Latin American markets. So when you step back from all of this instead of seeing our markets in the U.S. grow at a 2% to 3% number, we think they will be about flat. Instead of our feeling that non-U.S. markets will grow at about 2% to 3%, we think that they will be at about 1%. Putting that altogether you get to about 1% growth for our end markets.","Now the bright side of this entire picture. When you turn to the next page which is where we talk about margin expectations, is that we take our largest business, our electrical business, and move the margins up by 0.5 point. I think you have seen the demonstration of those margins in the first quarter and you have seen very strong margin performance in our hydraulics, aerospace and vehicle businesses, which I think give great credibility to those numbers we have -- I refer our guidance in terms of segment margins for the balance of the year. So, overall, our margins will go up from the 15% earlier guidance to 15.25% for the full year.","Second part of the strength of this story is it's not simply the productivity in the business nor the 33% incrementals that we're exceeding that we've provided as our guidance this year, but we're also off to an even faster start in terms of our Cooper integration savings. You may recall, we have originally increased -- we started this year with our synergies at $75 million for operational synergies, at the end of February we moved that to $90 million, we are now moving that to $115 million. So up $25 million from our most recent guidance, up $30 million in 2014. And when you go out to 2016, up $35 million now a total of $440 million. And we have increased those acquisition and integration costs you see at the bottom by $40 million in 2013 and $30 million in 2014 as we're pulling some of these actions in more quickly.","Obviously the question is, where is it going better than we thought. It's primarily in SG&A savings and some facility consolidation, additional work that we gave you a little bit of an indication. We thought there was some more potential of when we had our early March analyst meeting. So I think very solid performance here. If we turn to chart 16, our operating earnings per share and net income forecast for this year. If you look at the top number there are $4.05 to $4.25 in terms of our operating EPS full year guidance. There is no change to the bottom-end of that range. That was the $4.05 that we have provided this year. We did reduce the top end by $0.20 as we are seeing these markets to be weaker. We are able to hold the lower end because of all the productivity, cost savings, good incremental work and better synergy savings that were occurring this year. Our third quarter, $1.05 to $1.15 in terms of our guidance from midpoint of $1.10.","Then on page 17. If I could take you through this somewhat busy chart in terms of our operating EPS guidance for this year. I think I can simplify this with you for a couple of comments. And so let me do that. On the acquisition line, the $2.66 is up $0.18 from our last guidance to you. And that's the addition of $25 million of integration savings this year that's moving from the 90 to the 115. And it is higher base productivity in the Cooper, Jeil and SCL businesses. The businesses are running even better than we thought they would, so up $0.18 there.","The organic growth at 33% incremental margin. No change in the incremental margin. But the volume is down of what we provided you earlier of some $900 million was our earlier estimate. We brought that down to 350 and that is the impact of reducing these overall markets. That's down $0.45 from what we provided you at the end of the first quarter. In addition to expense control, this is additional productivity and cost saving work beyond the integration savings and beyond the 33% incremental, about a positive $0.15. It\u2019s about $55 million and I think that those are the actions that we've been able to take and our teams have been able to achieve across the company to maintain profitability during a period of reduced market demand, really good work there. So the total of that top group is a negative $0.12. The higher number of shares, the $1.47 is $0.02 better than our previous estimate. So when you net the negative 12 up top and the $0.02 there, that's how you get the $0.10 reduction from $4.25 to our guidance now at the midpoint of $4.15.","If we turn to chart 18, this is a comparison of the second quarter of this year to the third quarter of this year. It supports our guidance of $1.10 the midpoint. We start with $1.09 that we\u2019ve reported for our second quarter of this year. We're anticipating higher seasonal volume but it's pretty nominal. It's about $75 million, again reflecting the fact that we don't see an accelerating economy. That's taking again another 33% incremental gives us about $0.05. Additional acquisition synergy as it continues to ramp up quarter-to-quarter through this year of another $0.01. We're anticipating a slightly higher tax rate in the third quarter of approximately 9%, versus 7% during the second quarter. That's negative $0.02 and higher corporate expense of about $15 million. So, it will be a total of about 100 million and I\u2019m including in here our corporate expense pension and amortization. So that total is about $0.03 and that gets us to the overall $1.10.","So if we move to chart 19, chart 19 is simply a summary of our outlook. You'll recall that the $350 million of core revenue growth compares to the $900 million in our last guidance we provided you. No change to the $6 billion of net acquisition revenue. No change to the incremental margin of 33%. No change to the tax rate of 7% to 9%. The change to the operating EPS full year forecast is simply at the high end of the range. It came down from 4.45 to 4.25, our first guidance for the third quarter. And operating cash flow in light of the weaker overall volumes coming from the lower market this year, both the operating cash flow, both at the lower end and the higher end have been reduced by $100 million. You notice the free cash flow has only been reduced by $50 million at both ends of that range. That's due to fact that we've reduced our CapEx this year from $700 million to $650 million.","And then finally, if we move to chart 20, the final chart in this packet. Just a quick summary of I think the themes that you've heard me refer to as we went through this. The markets started off weaker if you recall. We were down with organic growth about 4% in the first quarter, 2% in the second quarter. And they remain weaker than we originally anticipated. I went through in some length those markets to try to give you a granular feel as to how it supports our thinking. Secondly, we\u2019re really very pleased that we\u2019re delivering higher operating margins, higher than expected in terms of our segments by 0.25 point. You saw specifically we took them up in our two electrical segments and continue to have very strong performance across our industrial businesses.","And then we're also very pleased with the terrific work that our integration teams are doing and specifically here. We\u2019ve increased both the full year 2013 and each of the future years 2014, '15 and '16 forecasts for increased savings. And so as we think about the quarter, it's a quarter all about controlling what you can control. And we can't control our end markets but we can certainly control our segments in terms of our operating margins and the productivity work and the integration work. And I hope you see in the results that we have chosen to pull forward a number of these integration activities as markets have been weaker. That's allowing us to get at these synergies more quickly and the $55 million of additional savings this year that are not related to the acquisitions and they are not related to the 33% incremental, I think are an indication of the effectiveness of all that productivity and cost control work in a period of weaker demand.","So I hope we have given you a little bit more of a granular understanding for our thinking around markets because we anticipate that's where a lot of your questions may be this morning. And with that, Don, I'll turn things back to you.","Donald Bullock","If you would, operator, will give you some instructions regarding the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions)","Donald Bullock","Our first question this morning comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein","A lot to cover here, but just maybe first on the outgrowth versus the markets. You've talked obviously a lot about the market weakness that you experienced. But traditionally you've given us a very good flavor on how you think Eaton has done relative to those markets. Could you maybe provide some color across the portfolio about how you think you did on a relative basis and why?","Alexander Cutler","Yeah, Steve, we indicated in our first quarter of this year that we would not be providing quarterly breakouts on that during this year, we will do so at year-end. And really the reason why, so we have got a number of new businesses and a very large number of data streams, that I can tell you with what's just been issued this week in terms of the rebasing of so many of our traditional data streams. It's very difficult for us to do that on a quarterly basis. So our sense is, I can tell you across our businesses, that we're doing well on these businesses but we don't have an ability to quantify it this year.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein","Okay, all right. Maybe talk a little bit about what you are seeing in non-res specifically. I mean you talked about it being weaker than your prior expectations, what do you think is driving that? What are you anticipating? Are you seeing seen any inflection points there?","Alexander Cutler","I would say not an inflection point but I would say, certainly on the government side, on those projects that are government financed, you are seeing a negative number in that segment. And so the private put in place, if you will, is stronger than this 2% to 3%. But you are seeing a government side which is in the order of sort of a negative 5% to 6%. And that is providing, I guess I would say some downward pressure on that. We see a lot of projects being talked about, a lot of projects being bid. But there are some caution, I guess I would say in the marketplace, that I think is very much what we are seeing broadly across our businesses here in the U.S., where people aren't quite sure how they really continue to invest in a GDP that's clearly not going to reach 2% this year. And so I think that degree of caution while you find individual segments where people are very bullish, you will see other areas where people are really kind of biting their time. And so I'd say it's not a lack of projects on the drawing board or projects that are being bid, it's really more kind of getting them released to moving them forward.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein","Okay. And before I hand it off, could you maybe give us a view sequentially in the third quarter by business unit, sales and margin.","Alexander Cutler","We don't go into the specifics in terms of our guidance, in terms of -- but I could tell you from a historical point of view, generally you have seen vehicle markets have a third quarter because of some of the shutdown period that's a little weaker than the second quarter. Generally, the second and third quarter are your stronger electrical segments of the year with the fourth quarter then being a little weaker and the first quarter being the weakest. Aerospace tends to be fairly consistent through the year and hydraulics generally is a little weaker in the second half than it is in the first half. Those are sort of the patterns of how it normally lays out.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein","And that's why you have assumed more or less...?","Alexander Cutler","Yeah. We have not -- the one business that I think you have got a little difference in this is, and we talked about at the end of the first quarter and it is still true with our 260,000 units forecast, is the North American heavy duty truck market from those numbers I have provided, we do expect ramps up during the third and the fourth quarter. And as we have talked with many of you over time, the critical element there is really seeing the orders come in and we did see some weaker order patterns here at the back end of the second quarter in that business. That's the reason we had dropped our forecast by 10,000 units.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So as I think about the cadence for the rest of the year and what your guidance implies, it looks like second half versus first half you\u2019re looking about a $0.20 increase in EPS at the midpoint of your guidance. And I think some of it is going to be seasonality. But clearly the cost outs are also increasing in the back half of the year. So perhaps maybe you can provide some color on how much of that increase is expected to come from the cost outs versus seasonality versus volume improvement.","Alexander Cutler","As you can tell by our guidance, Joe for the second quarter of only up $75 million on a $5.6 million base, we're not counting on a lot of volume here in the second half. And we just think in this marketplace we\u2019re better to manage our business assuming that the markets aren\u2019t going to get a lot stronger. We do get obviously higher integration savings are one of the largest drivers here in the second half. And that's very much within our control. I did mention that in the third quarter we're going to see higher taxes. We're also going to see higher corporate expense and that will play out in our own guidance we think in the fourth quarter as well. So I\u2019d say that the two issues that are tugging at another is not a lot of help from higher volumes in the second half. We will drive our own additional higher profits from our integrations and productivity work and that will be offset to some extent by the higher taxes and the higher corporate expense. And prior to that higher corporate expense, for those of you who have gone to the balance sheet already, is that our intangible expense coming from these acquisitions is going to be a little higher than we originally anticipated, being offset in some other areas. But that's going to flow through here in the second half. So I'd say those are the elements that tend to push one on other.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That's helpful. And as it relates specifically to the cost synergies, it seems like you have $0.01 incremental benefit this quarter. You're expecting $0.01 next quarter. Is the fourth quarter supposed to be a big quarter? As I was tracking I thought you guys for this year had about $35 million that you\u2019ve achieved thus far and I think the target for this year is 115. So I just want to make sure my numbers are right.","Alexander Cutler","No, I\u2019d say we\u2019re in the order of $35 million to $40 million here in the first half and then the balance out in the second half. And that's why I say we do get a positive from the integration benefits and it's the largest portion of what drives higher profits from the second half","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And one last question. I think it may be too early to start talking about '14, but perhaps maybe you can talk about some puts and takes. It seems like the cost outs alone a lot about $0.18. Clearly at this point there would be a pension tailwind. But any puts and takes as you see it today as we head into '14?","Alexander Cutler","Yeah, I'd say the only that we\u2019d be really comfortable talking about yeah because it's a little early to get to '14 is that clearly we're going to get the integration savings that we talked about and that is a positive. You saw that we did increase it for next year as well. So that is a positive for us. And I think as you stay back and think about the economic situation, for those of you who think Europe has already turned up, we're not yet in that mode. But at some point out of this very still situation that\u2019s been there for a couple of years, we're going to turn from a negative to something being more stable. And for those who are most optimistic, maybe very slightly positive.","China has been going through a real digestion period. We think that continues, but at some point that begins to stabilize as well. And we think we're in a period of time where until you solve the fiscal issues here in the U.S, you've got relatively low growth similar to what we\u2019ve been facing the last couple of years. So we think most likely we're in a period of time here for global economies that you don't get the propulsion that we got used to many years ago a lot of emerging nations because they've got some issues as well. So it means you've really got to find a way to create your own sources of profit growth. And that's why we're really pleased that all the work that's going on in terms of increasing margins, whether that be from higher productivity or from the integration of these acquisitions that we've completed last year is really providing that opportunity.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So the magnitude of the end market revision, one, it\u2019s not really that surprising and it's not a big number. But it does come only three months later and it's not if there seems to be a lot that's really changed. And I\u2019m thinking, Sandy, you were relatively more optimistic at EPG towards the end of May with respect to lighting, new products etcetera. Can you just help us with kind of put this in to a context in terms of perhaps did the month of June get a lot worse versus what your trajectory had been expecting? It just seems like Hubbell and some other companies maybe are a little bit more constructive, maybe more realistic. I am just trying to put all of this together.","Alexander Cutler","Yeah, glad to, John. I think if you remember our guidance, at the end of the first quarter, and I repeated it down at EPG, was that we started the year thinking our markets would be up 2% to 3%. At the end of the first quarter we said, after what we have seen in the first quarter we think pretty clearly it's going be towards the lower end of that range, it's going to be more like 2%. And we are now saying we think it's like 1%. So I think the difference we're talking about is really that difference of that lower end of the 2% to 3% range down to the 1%. Having said that, if you kind of go around the world and say what's a little different than we might have expected back at that time period. I would say here in the U.S., I think that we haven't seen the truck orders come in that we thought were going to come in and so that dropped from that. And remember we said that we thought you'd have to start to see monthly truck orders of 20,000 to 25,000, that has not materialized.","Secondly, after a very strong quarter of quarter-to-quarter booking progress in the hydraulics business, we've seen a quarter now where it was down 12%. And then I'd say not much of a change in aerospace. And then I'd say, third, in the electrical business, that we saw growth come in through the quarter about a point lower than we had thought. And as you look to the pieces of that in terms of how it materializes, I'd say the non-res issue, that the outlook has slowed a little bit from where we were. Resi is fine. Utility market, I think people, and you've heard most of the people comment on utility that it's softer than people thought and we have seen that as well.","And then I'd say the last piece in that regard has to do with how we think about Europe and Asia Pacific, is that they have not what I call stabilized quite yet, and so we still saw more negative numbers in those regions than we have thought would come in. I wouldn't say the quarter decelerated greatly. Our individual months were fairly similar. I'd say what we lacked was an acceleration during the quarter.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","That kinds of make sense. How did lighting, Sandy, do because...?","Alexander Cutler","Very well. I mean that was one of those areas in our electrical business that was really smokin' in the quarter. And so very healthy double-digit increases and really delighted with some of the new products. I have spoken to a number of you about it. When you think about that whole WaveStream LED recessed commercial lighting area, really doing well and winning large tenders.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","And then a lot of your products obviously run through distribution, and I realize a little bit of it, there are subtleties between hydraulics versus electrical. But did distribution play a role in some of this? I mean was there some incremental de-stocking that you could tell and kind of the corollary to that question is, you guys are doing much better or at least better on Cooper perhaps. And I am just wondering like in all this these situations sometimes there are distraction costs that are created, I am just wondering if maybe you lost a little bit of share. It may be hard to quantify just around the edges and it maybe not that material but it may be happening because you're just focused on Copper?","Alexander Cutler","John, we don't think so. It's something that we monitor pretty closely. And I would say that I think distribution had a good quarter not an outstanding quarter, and I think that's again reflected by some concern. If you are a resi guy, life is just spectacular. If you're someone who is a [balance] of dealing with resi and non-resi and industrial MRO, and maybe some utility work, you got some elements in there where there are some areas they have gone a little softer on you. And if you are a person that's really oriented at single phase power quality, you have had a really rugged first half. And so I'd say it's a little different by the type of distributor. But, no, we do not see and we get pretty good market share data out of organizations like, [NIMA] for example, we don't see any evidence of that.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Maybe just finally here. I know there will be these OECD tax meetings, and I hate to kind of bring this up, but I don't know if Rich's there. I mean is there something that's percolating behind the scenes that would in any way cause you to think perhaps somewhat differently in any context positively or negatively about obviously your tax rates which are much lower than everybody else because of your high risk status?","Alexander Cutler","The report you refer to is one that came out a week ago Friday in which the OECD published 15 principals and they put together work groups to look at these streams of areas, but no. We said before we\u2019re Irish incorporated. We have no special deals in Ireland. And so we don't think the issues are pertaining to Eaton.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Sandy, on the public construction data, we published it this morning also, we have seen a significant deceleration in public spending since sequestration. And given that we face another potential 40 billion incremental cut from sequestration going into next year, how confident are you that that public construction segment won't deteriorate further before it gets better?","Alexander Cutler","I don't know that we can give you assurance on that, Ann. Those numbers look to us, like in both the first quarter and second quarter this year they were down about roughly 6% from a year ago. Those are some pretty big numbers when you think about usually peak to trough in these markets is on the 30% to 35% side. So you are seeing some pullback there. I think perhaps the bigger question is whether the private put in place which has been running more in this year, more in this 3% to 4% area. Does that begin to pick up as you continue to see job hiring go up? Unemployment comes down very nominally, but it has been coming down by a tenth or two. And that's the balance we are looking at.","We are seeing a fair amount of activity in the commercial area, which is usually in one of those areas that's more interest sensitive. So you expect to see that. So that's our eye, but we can't give you a guarantee because none of us really know exactly where sequestration is going to fall out. I think the same question pertains so the aerospace market where we've been forecasting a 6% contraction. And you\u2019re seeing a lot of people now beginning to talk about the individual services, talk about how they're meeting those. And in many cases there what we would consider employment and forces reductions as much as they are capital equipment though which is more where we tend to get involved.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","That's a good color. Thank you. And then from a more strategic standpoint, this is probably another question you\u2019re not going to answer directly, but I'll throw it out there anyway. Part of the reason for the negative earnings revisions this morning was hydraulics and trucks. Just highlights and reminds investors that Eaton still has machinery exposure. I guess my question Sandy is why wouldn't you look at the strategic rationale having those businesses in your portfolio going forward?","Alexander Cutler","Yeah, I'll come back to your question in a minute, but just if I could maybe correct one piece. When you look at the overall markets, actually the electrical markets which are markets we're quite bullish on as well as the others, came down and had as bigger influence as the other markets did. So I think just to correct that base period. We actually -- then let me come back to the other comment about hydraulics for a minute. Hydraulics obviously we think has gone through a big adjustment as construction equipment was over built around the world. The prospect we think is the growth is really quite good in that segment going forward. We\u2019ve come to two years of fairly difficult adjustment here. And so we think there is a real opportunity to create shareholder value there.","And in the vehicle market, actually the growth rate is not bad. It's really -- if you look at the light vehicle side of the marketplace I think is where you\u2019re seeing a number of people report some fairly exciting sales and earnings opportunities and you see the 17.2% margin, the highest margin we have within Eaton in that individual segment I think are indications. So we think we can continue to create real value there. So it\u2019s a power management business. We continue to think like fit.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Sandy, I am wondering if we can just talk about these changes in the Cooper synergies a little bit. Obviously you raised those numbers, but you also raised the cost associated with that. We should be sort of looking at that net, I assume, right?","Alexander Cutler","No, I think the cost to achieve is obviously, they are incurred once. So we get the repeat in terms of what happens over multiple years in terms of the savings. And what we basically, there are two reasons that that cost is going up and the savings are going up. Number one, we are finding even more SG&A savings than we had originally estimated. They are happening more quickly. And and those will run in to the future and I think that speaks well to the future margin character of the businesses. And then secondly, as we had talked about, as Tom Gross had shared with you in the March New York meeting, we think there is more potential on the side of the plant consolidation as well. Generally, the plant consolidation is a little bit more expensive than SG&A and we've announced a number of facility consolidations. I am not going to get ahead of the process of our other announcements at this point. So we think there are some very attractive opportunities there for productivity and efficiency, and improved service to our customers. So, yeah, we're up that 40 and 30 on the integration side and then through the time period being up $25 million savings this year, 30 and 35 and 35. We think we will pay for that increase and more.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay, that's good color. But really for 2013 then that is a bit of headwind here.","Alexander Cutler","Yeah. In terms of the fully diluted, that is correct.","Stephen Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Great, okay. So, that was one thing. And then I was just curious, I think John started to ask this question, but with respect to distribution, and I guess I am thinking more specifically in hydraulics. Are you able to see anything kind of specifically going on with sort of destocking at the distributor level and any color on where that process may be.","Alexander Cutler","No, I think, Steve, if I could take us back to our comments in the first quarter, we saw more of that distributor destocking towards the end of last year into the first quarter. We don't believe there is a lot of active destocking going on at this point, although the distributor demand is weaker. We think that simply reflects their end markets, not so much that they are spending their inventories. They are pretty thin right now. But what we have not seen is a really active restocking there, but I think, again, put yourself in the position of any one of these business partners who are looking at end markets that aren't positive right now. And so we don't sense that it's a really active destocking. It's just that they aren't feeling they are having to put a lot of inventory in in anticipation of an immediate snapback in the market.","Donald Bullock","The next question comes from David Raso with the ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group","I know I brought this issue up last call as well, but the concern around the core volumes and implied growth. The first half of the year, the core volume on a pro forma basis was down like 3.5%. So this is a full year number, the second half has got to be up, 6.8%. And I think the sector is sort of facing this right now. If you look at your comps from a year ago, the comps fit easier. First half of the year standalone company core growth was positive three to four in the first half, negative four in the back half. So, comps alone, I can see why the core business in the second half should be positive. But this 6.8% seems like a strong enough number. And just when you hear your description of your end markets, this doesn't sound like it's a 6.8% type back half of the year. So it was asked a bit earlier, but are there some markets on an outperformance basis or am I doing my math wrong? It just doesn't feel like a back half of 6.8% from everything we're hearing on the call and obviously the other work that we do.","Alexander Cutler","I'd say that we've been through that exact same analysis by products or by segment, by quarter. And we do think it all fits together. Let me just take a couple to give you a sense for probably the one that's easiest, will actually get your head around this, is the vehicle issue where you're continuing to see a strong retail demand here in the U.S. for light vehicle. You're seeing Europe is not declining like it was. You're seeing South America strengthening and you're seeing Asia Pacific strengthening. That was all light vehicle. On the heavy duty side, I think we can quickly get our heads around the fact that there is a ramp in the second half. So I think we can sort of take vehicle and put that one on the side.","If we take aerospace, aerospace, I think if you have looked at our bookings, quite strong during the first half of this year. I think they support what we have in terms of the shipments. Our bookings have been going faster than our shipments during the first half. In hydraulics, where you had quite a severe contraction still in the first quarter, but very strong bookings if you recall them, less of the contraction here now in the second quarter. So anticipation that that business, again as you said weak comps starts to compare better in the second half because you recall it was running off in the second half of last year.","Then in the electrical business, it\u2019s seasonally a strong quarter in the third quarter. Resi tends to be a big quarter in the third quarter I mentioned earlier in my comments, perhaps it was very early in the call, that we see quite a difference in the power quality markets in the second half to the first half because particularly the three phase area has strengthened very substantially on the bookings side. And we've got good visibility now in terms of what we're shipping in the second half. That's really -- those are the major pieces in the -- excuse me, Europe we think is more stable in the second half than it was in the first half. And we think actually Asia is a little bit better in the second half than it was in the first half. So those are the elements as we have gone through this by each of the businesses and each of the regions to support our view of the second half versus the first half.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","Let's say last quarter we find out that the core volume guidance was a little bit aggressive for the latter part of the year. Are there some levers to pull on the cost side? Obviously I\u2019m not sure how much people are willing to pay for it, but the tax rate always seems to save you a couple of pennies every quarter. But versus what we have as a core growth story for the back half, I would still argue like last quarter looks a little optimistic. Are there some levers to pull on the cost side to feel comfortable at the back half of the year, even if core volume did disappoint? Are there things that were maybe another incremental boost to the synergies? I\u2019m just trying to understand the downside risk if the core volume isn't 6.8, it's 4. How do we offset that? And then the thought is of course what\u2019s that run rate mean going into next year?","Alexander Cutler","I think clearly what you heard us talk about here in the second quarter, David, is exactly the thesis you\u2019re postulating there is that in a slow growth marketplace, you've got to find ways to create sources of profitability. And I think we\u2019ve been pretty successful in doing so. So I can't tell you I know exactly what that individual lever is at this point. But that's exactly what our teams have been working all through this year. And that's why you see us with $55 million of higher savings than the 33% incremental would suggest and that's a very high incremental by the way and above the increase of $25 million in the integration savings. So those are exactly the issues we're continuing to work because I would tend to agree with you is that it's hard to predict in this kind of an environment exactly what the global economy is going to be, because it's full of pluses and minuses, which by the way is characteristic of when you have slow growth because there is just not as much of a variable to work with.","And so obviously the reason that we're sharing with every one of you our view of the markets that is a little bit more calibrated than I think what people were hearing in the last two to three days is it\u2019s our belief that just like the last three years where people got too enthused with economic growth early in the year and then we're facing dramatic slowdowns this year when on. We're trying to manage within that envelope. And that's the reason we're putting a real premium on cost reduction margin improvement and asset management.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","And I guess last question you can answer as much detail as you wish, hopefully good detail. If next year, another muddle through economy, so you can move the geographies around, but another modest, modest core growth year, how does that impact how we think about the synergy opportunities and ideally if somebody wants to quantify would be great. If I gave you that 1% core growth to the year, what can the company do next year? It could be out growth. It could be obviously some synergy savings, however you want to use the balance sheet. I\u2019m just trying to think about how much can this be of self-help versus we can self-help for the first year. So with Cooper and some synergies, but at some point I need 3%, 4%, 5% core growth again. I\u2019m just trying to get a feel how you feel about, how you plan for next year modest growth -- change how you act and what you can do self-help wise.","Alexander Cutler","I think the chart, Dave that was in the packet, I\u2019m just paging for the right page number here, but it's the one that's got the integration savings on it. I think it's a good place to start, it's page 15. Because obviously you see a jump there in the operational synergies between $115 million and $210 million, I think a very important source of additional profitability to the company. But that would assume if you had nothing else, I mean that occurs, now I do think there will be something else. I would say though, however, to be consistent with what we have said with our economic forecast, we think the U.S. will, improve so there will be growth but we are not forecasting a breakout in the economy. We are thinking that Europe gets a whole lot closer to stability or potentially positive. I think China will be a more stable story by next year than it is now. We did see good progress in China between the first quarter and the second quarter of this year. Our sales were up 20%.","Now having said that, we don't think the economy is jumping and you normally see some sequential increase between second and third. But we were up most solidly in our vehicle businesses in China, as you'd expect, the automotive market has been quite strong. We were up high single-digits in our electrical business. We were still down in our hydraulics business, mobile oriented there as well. I do think you're going to continue to see these emerging nations get better but they're not going to be quite the propulsion that we saw a number of years ago. So, we haven\u2019t put a number on what we think end markets are next year but it feels that it would be better than it would be this year, but we haven't really tuned it up at this point.","David Raso \u2013 ISI Group","And the incremental synergies at 4% EPS growth here, top of base right there, so from (inaudible) that aspect, at least the synergies give you 4% growth from a baseline perspective?","Alexander Cutler","No. And that's obviously why we're pulling these synergies ahead is that we recognize in a slower growth marketplace, those sources of profitability become even more important. Now we are not taking our hands off the growth issue, we have got a whole string of new products and we can manage up quite well. We just think the danger in these types of markets is that people plan for too much growth but their expenses get out of control and their working capital out of control and then you end up with a period of time where people are trying to pull back expenses. That's not an error we want to make and we are quite confident we can scramble upwards if we see the volume occur.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research","Just a couple of things. First, just to the balance sheet. Can you explain a little bit what is going on with the big bump in intangibles. I see goodwill actually came down but the movement in tangibles is much larger. And how do we think about that actually amortizing through the P&L and what kind of timeline did this additional increase?","Richard Fearon","Yeah, Jeff let me address that. As you know, when you go through a purchase price accounting, it involves a series of detailed analysis of the various categories of intangibles. Just having bought Cooper at year end and at March 30, we had not, or our outside appraisers have not gone through all of the details that you need to go through. We have now been through much more of that. We're not 100% done but we're certainly well beyond 50%. And the conclusion is that the intangibles, particularly the trade names, were more valuable. But also as we refined our plans around how we're going to use the trade names, how they're going to be used over time in particular, we concluded that the amortization period would be a bit longer as well. So the net of it all is that amortization costs go up by between $10 million and $15 million a year as a result of the change in the intangible valuation.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research","All right, thank you. Sandy, a lot of questions, I think people trying to get round out growth and things like that. And your answer is kind of understood. One thing I am trying to just understand and that was what's going on in Asia with your business, in the electrical business in particular. A lot of mixed results from folks. Schneider had a good performance in Asia, Lockwell was up in China, but down elsewhere. Mixed bag at ABB but slightly positive. Can you just give kind of the state of the world and kind of the electrical franchises in Asia as you see it and where you might be gaining or loosing grounds?","Alexander Cutler","Yeah, our electrical business as I mentioned was up high single-digits second quarter versus first quarter this year. And I'd say the biggest portion of -- and I\u2019m speaking specifically to China right now, and I think their -- while the mining market has been weaker in China then it's been before, we are seeing the market get a little bit better in that regard. And just to complete the picture, I had mentioned that hydraulics in China was down and vehicle was up. So like you've heard from a number of companies, second quarter was substantially better than the first quarter. In that regard there are two we've seen that with the pressure on liquidity, particularly for smaller customers. There are certain segments of the market that have not been as strong. And I would take just single phase power quality as an example of that which tends to go through smaller distributors. The liquidity pressure is really being felt by some of those smaller firms. I'd say that's the only maybe unique element that we\u2019ve seen in that regard.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research","And then just finally, what is the prospect for some share repurchase this year? Obviously as you look into next year, you've got very strong cash flow. You\u2019re bringing your debt balances down already, but at what point do we maybe get a mix of share reduction and debt reduction in this post Cooper period?","Alexander Cutler","Really no change in game plan there, Jeff that we\u2019ve indicated. Really our number one issue obviously we start off is financing, our R&D and our capital expenditures, our dividend which we had increased this year. And then we\u2019ve said really that with the free cash flow after that the working -- first priority really to reduce this debt. And we scheduled out for everyone a couple of different times it was about $2.1 billion of that 4.9 billion that we were going to get repaid. We\u2019ve done just over 300 million of that. We\u2019ve got a larger tranche to the order of about $550 million that comes due to next year. And so we have not anticipated beyond simply neutralizing dilution that occurs as a result of option exercise. We\u2019re not anticipating or forecasting any share repurchase.","Donald Bullock","Next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","A question going back to Joe's, looking for some complexion on 2014 puts and takes. I see trucks coming through little slower here, but FTR has forecasting very high utilization rates in the back half, so seemingly at odds. I\u2019m wondering if you any thoughts from customer discussion or otherwise to see how that could trend?","Alexander Cutler","I think the real critical issue in terms of trying to understand that market demand is going to be to watch orders here during this third quarter, because to support for fourth quarter ramp up that we outlined in terms of our guidance, we\u2019ve still got to see those orders start to come in above 20,000 to 25,000. And so a little difficult to call '14 at this point. We do see fleets making money, plenty of freight at this point. All those drivers seem to be positive. But in spite of that orders were a little weaker here at the end of the second quarter. And that was our bringing it down. We see all the indications for why it ought to be stronger, but it's not.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","You've cut a lot of ground and I really appreciate all the amount of color. Just a couple of quick ones for me. So I think the big theme for the quarter was obviously excellent cost control and execution on Cooper. The $0.15 from the additional cost control in the bridge, Sandy, just want to clarify, is that structural cost savings or somewhat discretionary that might come back in '14?","Alexander Cutler","I don't know I can give you a precise characterization on that. But I think that level of productivity and focus is something that I would hope we can continue to repeat. At this point I think it\u2019s just a reflection of around the world everybody recognizing that markets are little slower. And so we have to find ways to continue to it. There was not a big restructuring cost we took to do it. And so it's more a series of hundreds and hundreds of projects and programs people are working on. So I tend to think about that more as something we all expect as a base line for us and not something we end up giving back.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then switching to aerospace. Again you referenced the better trends in markets in the back half of the year which still is reasonable to me. But in spite of the weak spread mix, your margins were north of 14%. So, I am wondering if we get a richer spread mix in the back half of the year why wouldn't aerospace margins expand from here?","Alexander Cutler","Well, what we would really like to see is to see, as you mentioned that driver of the booking start to materialize on the aftermarket, because it really did not here in the second quarter. There was lots of talk at Paris Air Show this year. Almost everyone was talking about the expectation of the higher aftermarket bookings. We'd like to see them. And I think as they come in at the volumes, people are talking about that is beneficial, but we'd like to have them on the books first.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. That's fair. And then finally looking to tax rates, and Rick I've gone through the last ten years and your 4Q tax rate is usually your lowest tax rate of the year. So I am just wondering that 7% range, is 7% more realistic than 9%?","Richard Fearon","No, we continue, Nigel, to believe that 7% to 9% is where the full year will come in. There isn't really a seasonality in tax rate, it's based upon the precise mix in the given quarter. It's also based upon a variety of items that get resolved around the world. And it's also now as we are continuing to complete all of the projects related to the movement to Ireland. It's the impact of those projects being completed. And it's a very complex thing to forecast but we continue to believe that the tax rate in the second half of the year will be a bit higher than the rate in the first half.","Donald Bullock","We're going to be able to take one additional call since we've run past our normal scheduling time. Our next call would be Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question on the vehicle margins. Very impressive margin, Europe auto seems to be getting better. Brazil which is a very good business for you, is doing quite well. So specifically you highlighted increase in forecast there. So why we're leaving the vehicle outlook unchanged because I would imagine Brazil would have offset North America margin wise. And can you talk a little bit about the intersegment dynamic?","Alexander Cutler","Yeah, Andrew, I think your characterization of the regions is correct from our view, and I think the good news is that the rate of decline in Europe has begun to get less. And that clearly the new news in this quarter in terms of our guidance was the strength in Brazil. Having said that, normally the third quarter is a weaker quarter from a margin perspective than the second quarter is. And that's a result of some of the shutdowns we are seeing as we mentioned. Good demand on the retail side, that's also true -- excuse me, light vehicle side, that's true in China as well. Well, that market is quite strong and that is the reason that our vehicle market is up so strongly and our vehicle business is up so strongly in China. So, I'd say in terms of the margins, it's just the expectations that you see this down in the third quarter and the second quarter is often the strongest quarter in terms of margins in that business.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And can you just comment what are you seeing in terms of pricing and sort of cost going to the second half and how is it versus your expectations?","Alexander Cutler","Yeah, the way we tend to think about it, and you've heard us talk about it before, is really trying to have pricing and commodity pressures to be relatively neutral, and that's to the main very much our experience this year.","Donald Bullock","Thank you all for joining us today. As always, we will be available to take calls and questions throughout the day and next week. I look forward to speaking with each of you. And, again, thank you very much for joining us on the call today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today.

Bullock Jr.Good morning. I\u2019m Don Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Welcome to Eaton\u2019s fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and CFO. As it has been our practice, we will begin today\u2019s call with comments from Sandy, followed by a question-and-answer session.This presentation we will cover today contains certain forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ from those in the statements, including those set forth in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2012. This presentation also includes certain non-GAAP measures as defined by SEC rules. A reconciliation of those measures to the most direct comparable GAAP equivalent is provided in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.eaton.com. Sandy?Alexander M. CutlerGreat. Thanks, Don, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I\u2019m going to work from the information that is contained in the earnings presentation that was posted on our web page. So I hope you each have that in front of you. I would like to take a little bit more time than we normally do to introduce this call to really address three different subjects.So first the fourth quarter, attempt to try to unravel some of the complexity for you that\u2019s associated with the closing of Cooper and the many cause which impacted the month of December. Secondly, to talk about our 2013 economic outlook and our earnings update, and it really is, many of you recall that our first guidance update since July, since we\u2019ve been in a relative quiet period, since we last updated in July.And then third, to update you on the Cooper acquisition and the integration and I will tell you just a summary that deals with everything we hope it would be in more and we will give you a little bit of update of that as we go this morning and then more details when we get together in New York at the very beginning of March.So, if you turn to the third page in the presentation, just a couple of comments on the fourth quarter. And once again, you recall at the end of our third quarter earnings conference call, we said this quarter was going to be complex quarter because we were going to have three months of Eaton\u2019s results, one month of Cooper results and then the long list of items related to the closing of Cooper that included transaction cost, financing cost, additional shares, the purchase price accounting adjustments and they obviously make these statements a little bit more complex to interpret.So if you can step back a couple of summary comments and I will take you through a couple of charts today. I hope you will find helpful in trying to reconcile some of the large pieces. We reported operating earnings per share of $0.82 and net income of $0.46. That\u2019s obviously a $0.36 difference between the two. And out of that $0.36 difference, $0.32 are the transaction cost, that\u2019s a $152 million of transaction cost that you also would have found in our mid-year filings, so that\u2019s the same number that we\u2019ve been talking about since that time period and a $0.04 of acquisition integration cost.Sales for the quarter, for the fourth quarter were $4.3 billion, up 7%. Again, a little bit of a complicated construct within that, 14 points or 14 points of the 7% came from acquisitions, a negative five from market, so obviously markets came off versus the second \u2013 the third quarter when we reported markets down 2%. ForEx about a negative one and undergrowth about a negative one.Very strong cash flow in the fourth quarter of $687 million and I will talk a little bit about the beneficial impact it had upon our ability to pay back our bridge loan in just a couple of minutes and then obviously all of this is underlying the fact that we completed the Cooper acquisition on November 30th. Further recently mentioned that here is that \u2013 so many of you who saw presentations from us, starting in May and then during the balance of the year know that our pro forma\u2019s for 2013 that we showed for the Cooper acquisition anticipated the deal we closed because we simply didn\u2019t know whether it would actually close on January 1st. The fact that we closed it a month earlier than those pro forma\u2019s were constructed is why we\u2019ve been able to hold some of these costs in December that we will be talking about.If we go to Chart 4, a quick reconciliation of our fourth quarter EPS numbers. Again, we will start with the net income per share on the top line of $0.46. The transaction related costs of $152 million, and again both the same number that was included in our mid-year filings. $0.04 about $24 million of acquisition integration charges and of that, about $11 million of that $24 million related to the Cooper deal. That gets you to operating earnings per share of $0.82.We elected in the fourth quarter to take restructuring costs of about $50 million and I'll take you through those as we go through each of the segments, but really the rationale for why we felt that was important is, is the markets decreased further than we had initially thought they would in the fourth quarter and our own view is that this slowdown we saw happening as the world economy and the U.S. economy downshifted during the third and fourth quarter is likely to continue in its early part of 2013. And we felt it was prudent to get these costs out to operate well in little lower markets than we might have anticipated, say, a year-ago.And then adding back that $0.14, you get to the $0.90 adjusted operating earnings per share which we think is roughly akin to the basis on which many of you did your estimates in terms of your own view as to how we would do here in the fourth quarter.If we turn to chart 5, now a little comparison versus last year because we know many of you are trying to really understand the year-on-year performance. And so last year's fourth quarter 2011, our operating EPS was $1.08. The net Cooper impact by the time we take all the items that pertained to this transaction so that the one month of operating results in December, it's the very significant international tax benefits that we referenced in our notes, it's the financing costs, it's the additional shares and it's the purchase price accounting, obviously a very complex and lengthy group of items that's a positive $0.03 in terms of the impact on the quarter.The lower tax rate for Eaton and this is Eaton alone, so you can think of it as Eaton classic if you want, was about $0.04 benefit. And as you saw in the note attached to our statements, that $0.04 really came from foreign tax credit utilization, little lower international provisions and favorable mix; and what does favorable mix mean? It means that in the countries that had the higher tax rate, we had less income in those than we had estimated.Lower end market growth; I think one of the big highlights in terms of really trying to understand what's happening at our end markets, about $0.18 impact. This is that difference as I mentioned between 2% down as we were in anticipation of coming in, we were five points lower versus a year ago that we had anticipated here than a year ago in terms of our markets, and that throws off somewhat in the order of $120 million, $125 million of less volume. Most of that lower market was in hydraulics, it was in our vehicles segment. So I'll talk a little bit more about that.Our restructuring costs of the $50 million, that's a $0.14 negative. And then ForEx, a fairly small impact. And so that's how you get to the $0.82. Now remember the $0.82 does not include the $152 million of the significant items, transaction costs from the Cooper deal.If we turn now to the segments, I want to take you through those, let's go to page 6, overall results for the company. Just -- where I think most of these numbers on this page speak for themselves. Sales of 7%. Obviously net income is down, but from 51% for all the reasons I just itemized in terms of the significant impact of the Cooper transaction plus the $50 million of restructuring costs that we took.The acquisition is on the left-hand side in the greenish box, that 14% positive, that's about $580 million of sales in the quarter that came from acquisitions. And then if you're trying to kind of track our progress since the third quarter of 2012, our sales then were 3.95 billion obviously in this quarter helped by acquisition revenue of some $580 million, we were at $4.33 billion.Jumping into the individual segments, if you turn to Electrical Americas segment, again another terrific quarter from this business. Our overall volume is up 3%, operating profit up 11%, margins at 16.7%. We think very significantly in the look-forward dimension here, orders were really strong up 11% and a little bit surprising. We had equal strength in the power distribution side of the business and the power quality business.Now that's not to say the markets were equally strong, but we had a number of very large wins in the power quality area that we think boosted our results a little bit higher than you\u2019ll find in the end markets because as we look at the strength, the strength in the markets themselves has been U.S. residential and nonresidential, the power quality market has still been slow as we've been talking. And what we\u2019re really particularly excited about is, continuing strong tone in January as we\u2019re seeing booking activity here in this last month.And now that you\u2019ve asked questions about Hurricane Sandy in terms of how it impacted us, as you can appreciate it's hard to estimate because some of these orders come through our distribution partners and some of them we have orders come direct. But our best estimate is in the fourth quarter was somewhere in the order of about $25 million of orders and we think that\u2019s likely to repeat again in the first quarter because not all of the repairs and services were able to be completed in the fourth quarter. Just one last comment on this chart, what I think as overall very good news is that, the Rolec acquisition, you remember that the acquisition of the Chilean based electrical business we bought is what you\u2019re seeing and causing the 3% positive growth from acquisitions and that\u2019s about $26 million of revenue in the quarter.If we move to the next chart, Chart 8, this is the Electrical Rest of World segment. I think good news here again, that you recall the third quarter our volume was $686 million, so volume is up about 4% from the third quarter, 2% from the year-ago as you can see. We were able to hold a 10% margin in spite of the fact that these markets are not back to where they\u2019ve been historically. It is the first quarter of sales and booking growth in over a year. So the way I would characterize this is we\u2019ve seen that the combination of the European and Asian markets stabilized. Europe I would call a little bit more stable, we\u2019re beginning to see growth again in Asia. We did take some restructuring cost in this segment that reduced our margins by about 40 basis points, about $2.5 million of cost. Again, that really was to continue to realign employment levels most especially in Europe, but to some smaller degree in Asia Pacific. These markets you recall in the third quarter we had reported to you were down about 6%. We think they\u2019re down about 5% in the fourth quarter. But I would say the tone feels a little better in this area in terms of us finding bottom and now being able to record a quarter of some improvement in terms of both sales and bookings.Chart 9, the next chart is the Cooper segment, really not much annotation on this particular chart. This represents one month again, this is the month of December. We think very strong performance and the comments about the end market that I made in both our Electrical Americas and Rest of World that they\u2019re very applicable here. Cooper obviously with its strong strength in addition to residential and nonresidential; remember has this very strong participation in industrial end markets and utility end markets.If we move to the Hydraulics segment, complex set of items here within Hydraulics. Overall you recall in the second quarter we felt the markets were up about 2%. Third quarter they were down 4%. Fourth quarter down 11%. And what's happening from an end market point of view here? What's really happening here is that we\u2019re continuing to see the construction markets, which you recall are fairly big exposure for us. They were made slightly larger by our acquisition of the Jeil acquisition that we made with the Korean hydraulics manufacture, are continuing to be down hard from an order perspective.You recall our own view on this has been that we had a number of large customers who overbuilt inventory early in the year and they\u2019ve been aggressively trimming inventory, since then I think you\u2019ve seen many of those announcements out in the marketplace, so that where the market is down 11%, we felt it was very appropriate that we needed to restructure. And so we took restructuring cost as you see impacted our margins by about 250 basis points, about $17 million of cost. Our general global employment resizing, two plant closings and downsizing at two other plants. We believe that, that sizes us for how we think the year will begin, which is obviously slower than it began last year.And as we try to get a feel for where the strengths or weakness is going to come from a booking side, I would tip-up by the saying while there has been some weakness on the distributor side, the big weakness has been on the OEM side, most particularly in the construction area then followed by agriculture. The one good piece of news here is that, China, which you recall we have a fairly large exposure to and has been quite weak here for a couple of years. We are beginning to see better tone in January. I would not yet announce this as a breakout, but it's been the first indication of better tone that we have seen in that better part of the year in some months.If we move to the Aerospace segment, shipment is up about 4% from our third quarter of $419 million, up about 1% from a year-ago. And as I say the market action is very similar to that, which we've described in before with the strengthening and the commercial side, the weakness being on the defense side. Bookings down 4% and that really is the interplay of particular orders that came in during the quarter, but again I would say stronger on commercial, weaker on defense, aftermarket up about 3%.We elected to take some restructuring costs in this business as well, about $4 million across one small plant closing and some reorganization of our workforce as we think again that it sizes us well going into 2013.Chart 12, the truck segment, again you'll recall that we've been watching this market decelerate on a global basis through this year in the second quarter. We reported to you that we felt that the market grew about 3%; in the third quarter, down about 8%; fourth quarter down about 13%. And within that 13%, because I know a number of you follow elements in here, the big news here is Europe is down over 30% and Brazil down in the mid-30%, U.S. down about 14%.So, as a result again of the view that we've seen that these markets particularly in Brazil had not come back as we had hoped they had and we think are likely to start out slower this year although we do think it will be a year of growth in Brazil, we elected to take about $7.5 million of restructuring costs to reduce our employment primarily in South America. That impacted these margins but we still think they\u2019re very healthy margins on volume is down some 8% from the third quarter and 26% from a year ago.Moving to chart 13, the automotive segment, again as we talked to you in the third quarter that we saw the European markets for automotive really begin to crack in the third quarter and that decelerated even further in the fourth quarter. Second quarter we had said that the worldwide markets were up 1%, third quarter they were flat with Europe beginning to decline, fourth quarter down 7% with Europe down 23% from a year ago.So pretty good growth in the U.S. and we've all been reading those notes and you'll hear we think that this year 2013 will be a year of about 15 million in terms of retail sales in the U.S. But the real weakness is Europe and Europe was down, as I mentioned 5% in the third quarter from a year ago, down 23% in the fourth quarter. And so we undertook actions to really reduce employment in Europe that impacted our margins by 270 basis points, about $9 million and that's the primary reason that these margins are down as they are here in this particular quarter.That's a quick overview of the fourth quarter segment results. If I could ask everyone to move to chart 14, we've got a number of pieces of information that I think will be helpful to you in terms of understanding both our reporting and then how we're thinking about 2013. Let me start with new segment reporting for 2013. There is no change to our reporting for hydraulics or aerospace, but there are some new reporting segments that I wanted to cover with you and then give you a little bit of background as you think about what is within these individual segments.We will be reporting on our Electrical results in two segments, the first called Electrical Products; the second called Electrical Systems and Services. We've listed to the right-hand side \u2013 middle and right-hand side of this chart the traditional products that will fit into both of those, and so I hope that's helpful to you in trying to understand how you kind of map our different products and the Cooper products to these segments.They do have slightly different geographic representation within them, and I want to give you a quick rundown on that. The Electrical Products segment is about 50% in the U.S., about 10% in the other Americas, about 28% in EMEA and remember EMEA includes Middle East and Africa not just Europe, and about 12% in Asia-Pac. For the Electrical Systems and Services, it's about 58% in U.S., 17% in other Americas, 14% EMEA and about 11% in Asia-Pac. Hopefully that gives you a feel for this slightly different geographic representations and we'll talk more about that when we get down to our meeting in New York beginning of March.Similarly, if you ask end market drivers for those businesses, the Electrical Products segment, about a third is nonresidential and about a third is industrial. And then you've got about 15% to 16% that's residential, 15% to 16% that's power quality and about 3% utility. Similarly, if you go to the Electrical Systems and Services segment, about 28% nonresidential, 29% industrial, almost no residential in this, it\u2019s about a point and then 22% Utility and 20% Power Quality. Again, I hope that gives you kind of an orientation of the thinking about these two new segments. And then the Vehicle segment, which will encompass our truck and automotive Drivetrain and Powertrain systems. That business is now about 50%, driven by Truck and Bus, about 48% by light vehicle and then Ag making up the remainder just a couple of points. And then if you think about from a geographic point of view, its just over 40% in the U.S., about 30% the other Americas, about 19% in EMEA and about 10% in Asia Pacific. So I know a lot of data there, but I don\u2019t \u2013 I know you will be interested in trying to how to think about these particular segments, we thought that might be helpful to you.If we turn to chart 15, our 2013 end market growth forecast. I would guess, some of you\u2019re looking at these numbers and think do you they feel a little conservative? Our own view is having watch how different fiscal policy debates have impacted growth in the fourth quarter. The prospects we think have some churns still in Europe as Europe is trying to settle. The recovery coming in Asia Pacific more so as we go through the year and a year where we just saw ourselves come off of one-tenth growth rate of the fourth quarter here in the U.S. We think this set of economics is prudent, not having us get out kind of our [skis], so early in the year and that\u2019s certainly as we watch the last three years, we\u2019ve all seen that people\u2019s economic forecast have started strong in the beginning of the year and that have waned as we gone through the year. So hopefully that gives you some feel for our thinking on these numbers.I think the numbers on the chart speak for themselves. I thought I just give you a little color behind them. In the electrical two segments here. We\u2019re assuming that the nonresidential market here, in the U.S., is up 4% to 5%. The residential is up on the order of a 11% that corresponds about a million housing starts. Industrial is up about 2%, power quality remains low at 2%. And when you get outside the U.S., we\u2019re basically assuming that Europe is flat and that Asia Pacific improves about 5% to 6%.Within Hydraulics, I think the U.S. number speaks for itself. When we get outside the U.S., we think Europe will be down on the order of about another 4%. Asia Pacific is still not fully stabilized, down 2%, Latin America down 4%. In the Aerospace side that 1% in the U.S. is that mix that you heard us talk about in the last couple of years, about an 8% positive on commercial, about a negative 6% on defense.And then in the vehicle index here, which map the heavy duty of about 270 in terms of the truck market, U.S. light vehicle retail sales about 15 million and when you get outside of the U.S., EMEA down 1%, Asia Pacific up 9% and Latin America about 8%.And so, when you roll all of this together and then I know one of the themes everybody has been trying to understand is people\u2019s geographic balance and we think Eaton\u2019s geographic balance is working for it, and I\u2019ll come back and talk about that. We\u2019ll be about 50% in the U.S, about 50% outside of the U.S, that\u2019s a little different than Eaton was prior to acquiring Cooper. Cooper was a little bit more U.S. oriented or less international, that put the counting for that change from that 45%, 55% now to the 50%, 50%. Now when you look inside the 50% for non-U.S. that\u2019s about 18% of our revenues will be in Europe, about 3% Middle-East and Africa, about 14% in Latin America and Canada and about 15% in Asia Pacific.Now if you\u2019re pencils are still burning, why don\u2019t we turn to page 16 here. Our margin expectations for this year obviously you can see we think that our electrical products and electrical systems and services are strong margins and those do incorporate the synergies as well as the base operations for the businesses. Hydraulics at about 13.5%, Aerospace 14%, Vehicle 16%; so overall even consolidated our margins 15% which will be a new high for us in terms of guidance we've provided for an individual year for overall segments.We recognized that in the electrical products, electrical system and services it maybe a little difficult to try to figure out exactly what the revenues will be for these, so I will help you a little bit on that one. Our estimate is at this point is, electrical products will have revenues on the order of about $7 billion in 2013. Electrical Systems and Services will be about $6.9 billion. So they\u2019re offly close to one another in terms of total volume.Turning to Chart 17; this is our 2013 operating EPS guidance. As you can see the mid-point of our guidance is $4.25 with a $0.40 or roughly 10% range and you can see that our first quarter midpoint is $0.75 with about $0.10 range. Both numbers include a $0.06 charge, if you will, for Cooper inventory purchase price adjustment to finish that purchase price adjustment. So said another way, without that, the midpoint of the first quarter would have been about $0.81.On chart 18, I think the start of some of the good news in terms of the Cooper acquisition is that you'll recall on the way we've tried to show this to you is the two columns that are labeled original projections both for operating EPS and for cash operating EPS go back to the presentations we made at May when we announced this transaction. And so you'll recall at that time that we thought that we would close the deal on January where we were projecting for the performance purposes that we would close the deal on January 1.You can see obviously that now with the benefit of having closed and taking many of those costs in the fourth quarter that our operating EPS accretion will be about $0.15, $0.25 better than we estimated. Then you can see a nickel benefit every year going forward. Similarly, you see a fairly similar benefit in terms of the cash operating EPS accretion. At the back of our presentation, we have included, on page 24, labeled Appendix 1, the detail that gives you the insight as to why those change.We don't propose to spend a lot of time on it here on the call today. We'll talk more about it in New York. But suffice it to say the business is operating at a little higher revenue and very attractive margins. We are realizing our synergies a little faster here in 2013 with about two-thirds of that benefit coming from faster integration of corporate SG&A and about a third from faster realization of supply chain benefits.You saw the financing information earlier this year that was beneficial in terms of the lower interest rate and that's helping us to tune about a nickel. And then there are a number of purchase price accounting items that the timing and magnitude are slightly different than we had anticipated and obviously those are tough things to estimate before you actually get in and work all the details. So I think the good news here in terms of, we're off and running and ahead of schedule in this regard.Chart 19 deals with our debt financing, again I think good news here. I'll let you read through the page but I think the really good news here is that as a result of the stronger cash flow of the business and the fact that the Apex Tools joint venture which was the joint venture between Cooper and Danaher has been sold and the deal concluded and the cash having been received by Eaton, we were able to totally repay the bridge loan on the 1st of February. And so as a result of that, we're a little ahead of where we planned on being from a financing point of view.Our Board will address our first quarter dividend later this month. We mentioned that in our press release. The other thing I wanted to note is that unlike the Moeller and Phoenixtec acquisitions where we had announced our plan to include equity as part of the financing, we have no such plans and had no such plans as it relates to this particular one. So I think the way you simply read this chart is we're ahead of plan in terms of the cash flow and our ability to repay debt and that's good news and we were able to finance at a lower costs.Chart 20, the 2013 EPS bridge, our traditional bridge, just a couple points of annotation on this. Obviously our 2012 actual operating EPS of $3.94; the acquisition and that is Cooper, that's Jeil, that's SEL, that's Gycom and that's Rolec. If you put all those together, it'd be about $2.48 that includes the synergies for those as well. The organic growth got about a 33% margin and some of you may look at the 33% and say, geez, that's stronger than you guided last year. That is right because we have included in that the lack of the $50 million charge we just took at the end of fourth quarter plus the 2013 benefits. And so we really thought it was appropriate to use the higher margin.On the negative, a higher number of shares. Our shares this year we anticipate will be about 474 million shares. So you see that impact there. Other corporate expense items primarily intangibles and the interest and much of these first two but not all of this second one pertained to the Cooper acquisition. Higher tax rate and then increase in pension expense of all that leading to about a negative of $2.94, and that's how we get to the midpoint of our guidance of $4.25.Chart 21, the next chart, it gives you kind of a recap of some of the key elements that support our guidance. Overall revenue growth of about $900 million, so that\u2019s about 5%. Acquisition revenue of $6 billion, that\u2019s about 37%. So overall growth of 42% in terms of our revenues. Of that $6 billion, about $5.8 billion are the three acquisitions in the electrical business, Gycom, Rolec, and Cooper. And about $200,000 are the two acquisitions in hydraulics, that being SEL and Jeil.Incremental margin, I mentioned 33%. Tax rate of 7% to 9% in line with our expectations when we announced the Cooper deal last spring and reflects the issue. Remember, the $160 million of synergies that we will get on the tax line. I already mentioned the operating EPS guidance and we think very strong cash flow for this next year, operating cash flow of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. Free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion, obviously the difference being $700 million as our anticipated CapEx expenditure level.So all of that and we appreciate your patience on listening to all the detail, brings us to our summary on page 22, is that we think 2013 is a year of modest global GDP growth. And as a result of modest market growth through our end markets and its likely to start slower and strengthen as we get through the year. I would describe it as cautious optimism. Some of you may describe it as conservative, we think it\u2019s the appropriate place to be at this point.In response to the slower market growth in the fourth quarter in Hydraulics and vehicle in particular, we did undertake these restructuring activities that we think position ourselves to deal with what we think is going to be a little slower start this year economically. The Cooper acquisition as I said before, it\u2019s everything we expect it to be on more. We\u2019re delighted to have it completed to be done with so many of the issues necessary to after close this transaction, that we\u2019re now in the process of running it and really pleased that we\u2019re ahead of schedule in terms of our synergy activity and our financing plans. And we will provide some more color on those synergy plans when we\u2019re together at \u2013 in New York.And then the last two points I would say is that, really pleased obviously we\u2019re now expecting the accretion from Cooper this year. And it\u2019s not only this year, because we raise that accretion by a nickel going forward \u2013 in the forward years as well. And we believe that Eaton\u2019s business and geographic balance is really working. So, even in a year where we saw hydraulics be quite weak last year and we think likely to be a weaker year this year. I think you\u2019ve seen the strength of this overall franchise and its earnings capability and certainly the cash flow capability.So with that, Don we will turn things back and we will open things up for questions.Question-and-Answer Session","OperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions).Donald H. Bullock Jr.Our first question this morning comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research PartnersThank you everyone. Good morning.Alexander M. CutlerGood morning, Jeff.Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research PartnersSandy, could you just address big picture of how to think about the portfolio going forward, obviously the combination of the vehicle assets has some of us kind of speculating on what the future might hold. Anything you could share there about what's next with the Eaton portfolio?Alexander M. CutlerAnd nothing different, Jeff and than I have said in numerous forms really since we announced a Cooper transaction is that, we\u2019ve changed our segment reporting to respond to kind of the changes in the Company at this point, but it doesn\u2019t presage any other moves at this point. So, we like the portfolio we\u2019re with; we like the products that we\u2019ve got and the capabilities and we\u2019re really quite enthused about some of the new products and earnings capability in a number of the features that \u2013 in a number of the products where we don\u2019t simply have as great market support right now in terms of end markets, that will come back again.Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research PartnersGreat. And I was also just wondering, I believe [Curt Hutchins] was going to move over and help with the integration for a while. Is he still there and kind of what's he up to in the integration process?Alexander M. CutlerYeah, Curt is working with us in the integration activity and on a number of individual projects. I won't go into all those projects, but we\u2019re really a grateful that he\u2019s part of our team in that regard. So, that\u2019s working out just as we anticipated.Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research PartnersAnd then just really one final \u2013 finally, on the Hydraulics could you just elaborate a little bit more on where you think the channel inventories are on your growth forecast it is what it is, but in terms of how things play out over the course of the year, can you give a little bit more texture there?Alexander M. CutlerYeah, I think the big issue Jeff, there is not so much power channel inventory, if you will. But I think it's the inventory of our customers, because there\u2019s where you're seeing in a lot of the mobile markets, you're seeing dealer inventories that are quite strong and they've been that way for some time. And that's why you're tending to see order levels or production levels down below end market demand at this point. And we've commented a couple times during the second half of last year, we think many people felt that the second half of 2012 was going to be a growth time. And so as they were building inventories during the first and second quarters, they build inventories on increased demand and actually demand fell away. And so that's why you're seeing so much written about the orders being overpopulated with inventory. That was particularly true in Asia but it's true in Europe and it's true in the U.S. as well. We think that takes some time to burn off.Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research PartnersThanks. Congrats on the deal.Alexander M. CutlerThank you.Donald H. Bullock Jr.Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan.Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionHi, good morning.Alexander M. CutlerGood morning, Ann.Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionMorning. Alexander, could you talk a little bit more about where you are seeing the upside surprise from the Cooper deal? You talked about it being all you expected it to be and more. Can you just give us some more color on that?Alexander M. CutlerYeah, I would say just from the energy point of view as I mentioned, we're off to a faster start in 2013. And so we've not increased future year guidance at this point, but the fact that we're getting it in the SG&A savings and some of the procurement or supply chain savings is I think a reflection of how well the teams have come together. As we've gotten the chance to spend time with the teams in the businesses and with channel partners and end customers, the reaction is just really very, very good.So we'll spend some more time chatting up on it when we're in New York, but I think you can recall one of the areas that we had talked about that many people had raised questions about were, geez, how are you really going to get sales synergies in this transaction? And I would tell you that it feels really good at this point.And about half of the sales synergies we had been anticipating came from increasing our scope of our solutions and the key verticals such as oil and gas or mining or broad construction segments and data centers and that feels really good. And the other half was going to come from what we could do together in developing economies where one company was significantly stronger than the other and we think that one can pull the other ahead.And the other is increased relevancy to our global channel partners and our ability to really take our service business and have it provide support to traditional Cooper businesses, because as you recall, Cooper did not have its own service entity. All of that is, I would tell you is planning out really well. And without getting out ahead of Tom's presentation that he'll share with you in early March, I'd say we're really quite encouraged.Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOkay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then you noted during the call that you're beginning to hear better tone out of Asia again if you could give us a little bit more color where exactly, what exactly are you hearing out there and is it just a wish and a prayer at this point or is flotation activity, order activity actually picking up? Thanks.Alexander M. CutlerNo, great question Ann and I would say that I no longer abide the whispers because we've been listening to the whispers for two years and they haven't panned out. So we're really looking at the orders. And our January order tone was better and I'm speaking specifically to China because that's the big one that's really going to move this. And so from the mobile, okay and this is basically construction, we have actually seen a level of activity that is quite different.And I'm going to tell you this is the heartbeat, this is not yet the patient jumping off the bed and running around the room. But it feels better than it has in some time now. Of course, everyone's trying to speculate not just on hydraulics but in other markets how quickly will the Chinese economy come back? Our own view is that we may get back to a legitimate 7% to 8% GDP in 2013 versus what we feel is a GDP that may have been overvalued by as much as 50% versus the official numbers that have been reported for 2012. So we are encouraged but I would -- probably we're not widely ebullient about what's happening yet in China.Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionJust a real quick clarification, Alexander, you said orders were better in January or order tone?Alexander M. CutlerOrders.Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOkay. I'll get back in line. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.Donald H. Bullock Jr.The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Barclays.Vlad Bystricky - Barclays Capital, Research DivisionGood morning, guys. This is Vlad Bystricky on for Andy. How are you?Alexander M. CutlerGood.Vlad Bystricky - Barclays Capital, Research DivisionCan you talk about in Electrical Americas, you talked about strength in nonresidential markets. Can you give us some color on where you\u2019re seeing the strength and what\u2019s driving that?Alexander M. CutlerYeah, we \u2013 we got a pretty big front-end as we talked about in this business and we\u2019ve done very well with a number of major projects be they for industrial building, be they for datacenters, be they for large municipal applications and so I think one of the key here is that as we\u2019ve continued to strengthen our franchise, we\u2019ve continued to grow our market share. And so we\u2019ve seen really pretty much across the board strength. I know that got a number of reports from other firms that have talked about weakness in nonresidential, that is not been our experience here during the fourth quarter and its not what we\u2019re seeing in the first quarter.When you look at the U.S. private [put in] place data, you see a pretty balance due with the market again with and that\u2019s the government data showing growth in the great majority of the end markets. I think there are 12 segments, if I remember there and I think all of the two, if I remember off hand, were positive in the quarter. So, we read the same comments about people talking about weakness in nonresi, and that\u2019s is not our experience.Vlad Bystricky - Barclays Capital, Research DivisionOkay. That\u2019s great. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up in aerospace, you noted continuing our ongoing decline in defense markets and you also talked about the budget noise that we\u2019ve had here. I\u2019m wondering with some form of sequestration seemingly increasingly likely, are you able to quantify that the impact of potential budget cuts here in aerospace business and do you have any of that assumed in your forecast?Alexander M. CutlerYeah, our \u2013 let me just \u2013 we got our best assumptions, but having said that and tell you actually see which programs are impacted. But as I\u2019ve said, we won\u2019t know, but in our \u2013 commented a number of forms that it seems to us pretty clear that Joint Strike Fighter that the new tanker, that a number of the heavy lift helicopters, a number of the unmanned vehicles are going to continue to be funded and those are areas where Eaton has very good participation. So, we\u2019re pretty comfortable that this marketplace assumption of a negative 6% takes into impact \u2013 or takes into a consideration perspective impact that, that we\u2019ll see. So, we think we\u2019re well positioned in a pie that got smaller.Vlad Bystricky - Barclays Capital, Research DivisionOkay, that\u2019s great. Thanks very much guys.Donald H. Bullock Jr.Our next question comes from David Raso with the ISI Group.David Raso - ISI GroupHi, good morning.Alexander M. CutlerGood morning, David.David Raso - ISI GroupJust unclear about the synergies; you previously spoke of total operating synergies of $375 million, $260 million being cost out and $115 million sales synergies. Are we not increasing those targets today? Is this just simply a function of timing?Alexander M. CutlerYeah, we have not increased the synergies. And what I\u2019ve said is that we\u2019re getting at synergies more quickly in year one, that being 2013, so that\u2019s what you saw as take up. We\u2019re obviously into this transaction now for two months and so we\u2019re not comfortable taking up the overall projections at this point. We\u2019ll describe you in a little bit more detail when we get together in early March what some of the specific activities are and why we\u2019re feeling pretty good about them at this point, but I would just describe it is a little too early there.David Raso - ISI GroupAnd related to the comment you said the $160 million of cash management and tax benefits. Just trying to think through then if that\u2019s, what were the original target and still the target. How that relates to the tax rate for the combined entity. The 7% to 9% for \u201913 was a little lower than I was expecting. Should I take the $160 million comment holding still as that\u2019s what you\u2019re always thinking about the tax rate for \u201913 and going forward that is an 8% type tax rate?Alexander M. CutlerYeah, the $160 million amount is specifically the question, we\u2019ve not changed it. The $160 million and the 7% to 9% are right in line with \u2013 7% and 9% is right in line with what we anticipated or what we never quoted a tax rate. We gave the guidance that you recall take Cooper\u2019s results, take our results add on a the pre-tax synergies and take off the $160 million and that\u2019s what puts us in the 7% to 9%. In terms of \u2013 will it always be 7% to 9%; we can\u2019t tell you it\u2019ll be always 7% to 9%. I suspect it may drift up by a point or two, but it's over multiple years, but that\u2019s our best estimate at this point and not different than we anticipated.David Raso - ISI GroupAnd regarding your outlook for the U.S. for construction. It seems like you\u2019ve bumped up your thoughts on resi, industrial and power quality. But despite the positive commentary you have on nonresi you\u2019re still in that mid-single digit type forecast? Is there any reason you bumped up the others but aren't comfortable to bump up the nonresi?Alexander M. CutlerWell, I'd say nonresi has come back and so we're operating off of bigger numbers. And I'd say the residential issue is that we were perhaps a little conservative on resi and I would say maybe a little bit more on the middle of the pack. With the power quality market, actually 2% did well below the secular growth rate for power quality and we saw really during 2012 a pretty slow year in power quality. There was actually a little less than that 2%. And so we think still it's likely to carry into early next year, it's going to be a little slower.Our own bookings and that may have been a little bit confusing were really quite good in power quality in the fourth quarter, but that was more the result of us being very successful on a number of large projects not only in the U.S. but around the world. So, no, I wouldn't say -- we're still quite bullish on the overall nonresi, but we think 4% to 5% at a time where you're going to see U.S. GDP growth be somewhere around 2% is a pretty good number.David Raso - ISI GroupAnd lastly, looking at it in the, call it classic Eaton way, the Electrical Americas stand-alone, for 2012 the margins, ex-restructuring were about \u2013 just a shade below 17%, 16.7%. Could you even give us 2013 Electrical Americas margin guidance stand-alone? I know you're going to morph them together, but how are you thinking about that stand-alone business '13 versus '12?Alexander M. CutlerYeah, we don't have a stand-alone business anymore. We've integrated the businesses and so we can't give you a bridge, Dave that kind of takes you from one organizational structure to another organizational structure. All we can do is provide the guidance on the two new segments.David Raso - ISI GroupOkay, I appreciate it. Thank you.Alexander M. CutlerThanks.Donald H. Bullock Jr.Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities.Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLCGood morning, everyone.Alexander M. CutlerGood morning, Eli.Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLCJust one clarification, the $4.25 midpoint includes the $0.06 purchase price accounting inventory on Cooper, it would b $4.31 if we ex that out?Alexander M. CutlerThat is correct. Just as the first quarter $0.75 [inclusive], so it would $0.81 if you ex that out.Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLCAnd that's the only charge you expect to see -- you expect the sense to finish it?Alexander M. CutlerYes, that finishes the purchase price inventory on adjustment.Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLCAnd you gave us a tax rate will be similar to the (indiscernible), is there any pension and things like that impact from the ones you put to come together for greater cash use, it\u2019d have to be contributed to plans or anything like that from the combinations?Richard H. FearonEli, its Rick. No, Cooper's plan is essentially fully funded. It's in the high 90% funding. And so there really isn't any drag from Cooper's pension plans.Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLCI see. So that means there's no change for you guys either in '13?Richard H. FearonNo, we have a $0.04 increase in terms of pension expense\u2026Alexander M. CutlerWhich is largely a function of a lower discount rate. So in terms of pension funding, Eli, as we have mentioned, due to the Transportation Act, the required funding has gone down in the States. So we made our pension contribution for 2013 in January. Its $176 million and that should be our entire contribution for the qualified plan in '13.Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLCAnd can we talk a little bit about cost in pricing across the company at this point. Cost has gone up a little bit at this point, the combination of businesses and with the weakness in hydraulics, there's some pull effect to some pricing pressures across the company. Can you give us an idea what's going on cost wise which I assume would probably be sort of a tailwind for you guys this year and particularly in pricing?Alexander M. CutlerGot it. Obviously it\u2019s early in the year to know, but our assumption and our plans here is that we have not assumed either accretion or dilution from the impact of commodity prices versus pricing. And so we think it's likely to be a fairly stable year.Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLCSo everything's awash as a marketplace. And one final question, your hydraulics numbers which showed a lot of weakness, is this a tail with two heads where you expect hydraulics to be quite weak for the next \u2013 first half of '13 with positive compressions in second half. Would you give some color in the spread of the year?Alexander M. CutlerYeah, I think our view is very much as you articulated, Eli, is that it's going to take time to burn off these inventories. And as you've listened to some of the big construction companies' talk, they've all talked about stronger second half than first half. And we think certainly in China where you don't tend to get the OEMs talking about their forecasts, that's exactly what they've been indicating in terms of their burn off. I think the key thing to watch here though is going to be does end market demand burn off these retail inventories quickly enough to allow that to happen. I think that\u2019s really going to be the key issue and fortunately there is a fair amount of public data out there on retail inventory, so that I think that\u2019s an issue we can all kind of keep an eye on.Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLCRight. Thank you very much.Donald H. Bullock Jr.Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital MarketsHey guys. Just on this \u201913 bridge, I see 248 from acquisitions and then if you take the shares corporate intangibles interest 273 for kind of $0.25 net dilution. Can you bridge that versus the $0.15 accretion?Alexander M. CutlerYeah. Jeff, you\u2019re right that it can be a little confusing moving from one to another and because they\u2019re constructed slightly differently. We really can\u2019t give you an easy bridge to it. Some of the information that\u2019s built into other corporate expense for example relates to Eaton and some relates to classic Eaton and some to Cooper, and the transaction and the tax rate similarly you have to pull it apart and it obviously it doesn\u2019t service the purpose going forward and so that\u2019s our best representation we can give you.Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital MarketsOkay. So, there is moving pieces within shares and corporate expense and legacy Eaton where that\u2019s not a [claim], okay.Alexander M. CutlerYeah, absolutely. Yes.Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital MarketsOkay. And then just \u2013 can you a rationale and maybe just one or two lines about how you\u2019re splitting the electrical businesses?Alexander M. CutlerLet me kind of step back for people who has been around electrical industry for some time. Generally there and you\u2019ve heard us talk about this when we talked about what creates a lower and higher data in terms of earnings trends for electrical businesses is that, there are kind of two different parts of the business and that is how we run the business, now today as the products business. And if you can see both Eaton and Cooper had products businesses, those businesses tend to flow through distribution channels to a little larger degree and have historically tended to have a little less beta through the economic cycle. The projects business or some people call an assembly, some people call systems tends to be a business, its got little longer lead times that tends to operate off of backlog and it tends to had a little bit more of a beta through the cycle because it relates a little bit more than new construction, if you would in that regard. Yes, it\u2019s the fact and so the industry generally will think about products and we\u2019ll talk about the systems and services; that\u2019s why we\u2019ve organized our business. We run it that way, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to report it that way.Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital MarketsOkay, that\u2019s great. Thanks guys.Donald H. Bullock Jr.Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo SecuritiesThanks. Good morning everybody.Alexander M. CutlerHi, Andy.Donald H. Bullock Jr.Hi.Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo SecuritiesFirst a clarification, it\u2019s small, but in Q4 was there any contribution for Mapex tools?Alexander M. CutlerI don\u2019t have the number, Andy. It's a very, very modest contribution.Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo SecuritiesOkay. And then within the guidance for European electrical exposure than NAFTA Class 8 truck. Are you implicitly expecting back-half improvement to get full-year flat after a week of first half?Alexander M. CutlerYeah, let me deal with the first one. In terms of NAFTA heavy duty, you obviously saw the orders that came out for January just over 20, so those are kind of annualizing on a seasonal basis, so about 246, our plan is 270. So, yeah we would anticipate that things will get marginally stronger as we go through the year. In Europe we\u2019re fairly flat. We don\u2019t talk about a big recovery in Europe. We think that\u2019s kind of malaise that we\u2019re dealing with is what we\u2019re likely to see pretty much through \u201913. So, we\u2019re not calling for a big recovery in Europe.Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo SecuritiesOkay. And then \u2013 thank you for that. And the post quarter activity in terms of the cash inflow for Mapex and the bridge loan. How much of that $1.67 billion bridge loan is represented on the balance sheet at the end of \u201912?Alexander M. CutlerWe have paid down by the end of the quarter. We have paid off $1 billion, so we had about a little over \u2013 little less than $700 million was on the balance sheet at the end of the year.Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo SecuritiesOkay, thank you. And then outside of the pension contribution you referred to earlier; how should we look at cash allocation because clearly \u201913 looks like a pretty healthy free cash flow year.Alexander M. CutlerI mentioned before that about $700 million, so it's pretty close to that general 3% guideline that we used as CapEx as a percent of overall sale. We will \u2013 obviously our Board will be addressing the dividend as we have our next meeting here, as we mentioned, just to allay any fears of this. We announced this back in May that we did not plan on changing our dividend policy which you know has been to increase our dividend in line with our view of future earnings. And so our Board will obviously make that decision at their meeting and they'll be able to then fix the date as well as add the amount. But no such considerations of us reducing our dividend. And I think you'll see us act in concert with our policy that I stated, but I just can't comment on a number there yet until after our Board meets. We really don't have big lumps in terms of our debt financing until we start to get out a year or two. I think Rick, the first big ones in '14.Richard H. FearonYeah, we have term debt maturing about 307 million in '13 and they are term debt that is maturing in '14 of about 550 million, but those are still relatively modest numbers given the size of the cash flow.Alexander M. CutlerAnd then I would just complete the last piece as we've stated, I think, consistently since we announced the deal in May is that our primary use of cash will be to reduce debt. And so we'll take advantage obviously those term opportunities to do so. But as you correctly noted, the cash flows that we've gotten into today are pretty fulsome and it's one of the things that has us very excited about this transaction and combining with the base power of Eaton is that our cash flow moves up very substantially.And as a result, let me just complete that thought, the acquisition issue, many people have asked us about our acquisition policy or activities going forward, we said that we thought we would be largely out of the M&A market for a couple of years and that's indeed still our plan.Andrew Casey - Wells Fargo SecuritiesOkay, thank you very much.Donald H. Bullock Jr.Our next question comes from Brian Grzelakowski with Goldman Sachs.Brian Grzelakowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionThanks, guys. You got most (indiscernible) on the last one, but just on the free cash flow, so I mean if you have about a little north of 800 million in debt to be able to pay down over the next couple of years, it sounds like then obviously you have other things like the dividend and share buybacks and so forth. Is the pension completely off the table where you would not put additional discretionary contributions into that or is that a possibility that that could be on the docket as well?Alexander M. CutlerI wouldn't rule out any possible action, but I would say at this state, we don't contemplate putting additional money into the pension. Now next year, obviously, it depends on the discount rate, it depends on the returns that we get on the plans assets and there probably is a contribution next year that's a little bit more than the 176 we put in this year. But I wouldn't imagine the pension to kind of be a big user of cash relative to the size of the cash flow.Brian Grzelakowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionAnd so again to be clear, the debt reduction is mainly just going to be from maturing bond maturities over the next few years. You have no other like means by which you plan on paying down debt?Alexander M. CutlerWell, our expectations right now is we'll take advantage of the term maturities, but as our cash builds we will obviously look at other ways to manage that debt balance, and there maybe opportunities to pay some of that down in other ways.Brian Grzelakowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionOkay, great. Thank you.Donald H. Bullock Jr.Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionHi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for putting me on.Alexander M. CutlerGood morning, Josh.Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionJust on the acquisition close here, I guess some of the changes to accretion, am I to interpret the change in how you guys are looking at the step-up in inventory maybe adjustment there as Cooper bleeding down inventory into the close?Alexander M. CutlerNo, this is an accounting convention that purchase price accounting requires. Essentially, Josh, what you have to do is you have to take existing Cooper inventory and you have to then market the fair market value, so that's looking at the realizable value less distribution costs and it's simply convention of purchase price accounting. So it effectively erases some of the normal profit that Cooper would have earned.Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionOkay. I guess what I meant by that is the fact that it's an add-back suggests that there was less inventory to markup?Alexander M. CutlerNo, it turned out that you also have to take it through LIFO layer, so it turns out to be a much more complicated calculation. We didn't have that information prior to the transaction on when we took it through all of the calculations that turned out to be a lesser number, but it's not really a function of market change in the Cooper levels of inventory.Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionGot you. And then, I guess, just a related question, maybe I misunderstood the comment earlier on the call, that the initial time of dilution that you guys were expecting assumed January 1 close?Alexander M. CutlerYeah. But when we put the pro forma\u2019s together and shared them with investors in May, we had for that pro-forma had assumed that the deal we close in January 1, so would only affect 2013. The fact we closed earlier is why many of these costs that were incurred in December and we had mentioned in our third quarter conference call that our expectation was that we would be closing in 2012 and that we would have a lot of these individual items we detailed today would impact the fourth quarter.Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionGot you. So is there an easy way to just parsed out with that 25%, I\u2019m sorry, with the 15% versus the 10% of dilution would have looked like assuming January 1, or is that the bulk in the adjustment here?Alexander M. CutlerNo, that\u2019s the bulk of the adjustment really, but if you look back on your appendix number one, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve tried to give you that \u2013 it's the very last chart in the page 24, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve tried to give you that reconciliation of how 2013 has been changed as a result of going ahead and then what the impacts were. So, that\u2019s how you get your $0.25 change, it's pretty well detailed back there.Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionGot you. And then, I guess, just one last one before I would go is; when would you guys kind of judge the initial integration kind of grade yourselves on that. Should we expect kind of an update by quarter or maybe a couple of quarters from now; just getting a sense of when \u2013 if there\u2019s upside on the synergy front when we might start to see that or get a read on that?Alexander M. CutlerYeah. We have an opportunity obviously to speak to that on a quarterly basis. We do have a meeting coming up in New York in early March, and I would say that\u2019s probably the next chance we\u2019ve really got to talk about that, but I guess, I would just reiterate again this is a $13.2 billion acquisition with over 30,000 employees and we\u2019ve owned it for two months. So, while we\u2019re very enthused about it as well, we want to be sure any numbers we share with you has the benefit of some vetting and so hopefully would have something a little more to share with you at early March.Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research DivisionI\u2019m clear. I appreciate it.Donald H. Bullock Jr.Your last question today comes from Ted Wheeler with Buckingham Research.Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.Hi, guys. Thank you very much.Alexander M. CutlerHey, Ted.Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.I have lot of details new, if I could just kind of hit a couple of other ones. What does the future corporate expense \u2013 what should we expect for that?Alexander M. CutlerIf you look at a corporate expense per quarter, we think it's going to be in the $83 million, that\u2019s kind of range.Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.Okay. And then the OPEB and pension that should pretty much stay the way, well it might go up. What would that look like?Alexander M. CutlerWe think the pension, it\u2019s in total are going to be pension and OPEB about $42 million a quarter.Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.Yeah, okay. And then the, I guess, the interest expense we can calculate that\u2019s going to move around, but that should come down from the fourth quarter rate, I guess. Is that correct?Alexander M. CutlerThe fourth quarter includes a lot of amortization of things like the bridge loan.Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.Right.Alexander M. CutlerEssentially you take a bridge loan; you put it on your balance sheet when you end up closing a transaction you end up writing-off the bridge costs, so there are some of the $152 million of transaction fees \u2026Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.Are in that line?Alexander M. CutlerYeah, yeah.Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.Okay.Alexander M. CutlerSo you\u2019re probably going to have a number that\u2019s around $300 million.Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.Okay, okay. And then, just if I could back on the margins; could you maybe indicate what's the new electrical pieces margins \u2013 I know it's hard because Cooper\u2019s only in there for months, but maybe if you could just give us the 12 margins for those two new units, and either include or exclude the restructuring or however you want to lay that out for us, that would be helpful.Alexander M. CutlerWe can\u2019t give you that information yet. If you can imagine we\u2019re in the process of bringing a lot of different things together at the time that we start to publish the actual results for those segments then we\u2019ll provide historical information for them.Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.I guess the total Company 13.6 for \u201912 includes those segments of course. I mean it's the Company?Alexander M. CutlerIt is the Company. Yeah, it's correct.Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.And those \u2013 that margin includes the restructuring costs. When do you say \u00a0the 20 -- my guess is $24 million of restructuring items?Alexander M. CutlerYeah, that was in the fourth quarter, that $24 million.Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.Right.Alexander M. CutlerYou\u2019re talking about the acquisition integration charges, the $24 million.Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.No, I was talking about the \u2013 I think well, maybe I am \u2013 you delineated restructuring charges for each segment and then there's 11 million in corporate I guess?Alexander M. CutlerYes, and that is a separate 15 million of restructuring charges that \u2013 the great majority is in the segments and then you got a small amount in corporate.Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.Right. I guess I was just trying to reference the total company in your bridge. 13.8% is your actual margin?Alexander M. CutlerRight, yeah.Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.That includes I think the restructuring costs but does not include the acquisition costs?Alexander M. CutlerCorrect.Edward Wheeler - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.Okay, great. Thank you.OperatorThank you.Alexander M. CutlerWith that, we will be available to answer questions \u2013 I'll be able to answer questions and follow-up questions for the remainder of the day.

Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]","And as a remainder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead.","Don Bullock","Good morning. I\u2019m Don Bullock, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. With me today are Sandy Cutler, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Sandy, highlighting the company\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter, along with our outlook for 2015. As we\u2019ve done in our past calls, we will be taking questions at the end of Sandy\u2019s comments.","The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we will go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore, forward-looking statements.","Our actual results may differ materially from those of our forecasted projections due to the wide range of risk and uncertainties. Those are described in our earnings release and presentation. They are also outlined in our related 8-K filing.","With that, I will turn it over to Sandy.","Sandy Cutler","Great, thanks Don, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I\u2019m going to work from the presentation that we posted earlier today and I am going to start on chart #3, its entitled Highlights of Fourth Quarter Results.","Clearly, we finished the year with a strong quarter of performance. We are really delighted that our operating earnings came in at $1.27, up full 18% over year ago and that was versus our guidance as you recall of a $1.20 for the fourth quarter.","Sales up 1%, the really bright news I think in terms of the revenue line though really the organic revenue growth of 5%, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2011. We had record fourth quarter segment margins at 15.9%, you may recall we were at 16% in the third quarter and our guidance at that time was that we'd expected margins might come off as they normally do seasonally by about a 0.5 point in the fourth quarter. Clearly, we did substantially than that. And these overall margins of 15.9% at the segment level were up 1.3 points versus a year ago.","Record operating cash flow of $944 million, obviously a cash conversion ratio of about 119% in the quarter over 12% of sales and then we continued in the fourth quarter as we had in the third quarter and second quarter repurchased our shares repurchased $326 million of shares that was 4.8 million shares.","I think if you recall from having added up what we did in both the second and third quarter, that\u2019s a total amount of 9.6 million shares or $650 million expended in repurchasing them during 2014. So a total of buy backing about 2% our outstanding shares during 2014.","If we turn to the next chart, chart four, it\u2019s entitled Comparison to Fourth Quarter Guidance. As I mentioned, we are very pleased with the $0.07 beat, really made up of three items. The big headline fairly is the higher margins of 15.9% versus the 15.5% that drives $0.04 of the beat.","Lower tax rate really came as a result of legislative changes not just here in the U.S. but elsewhere around the world for about $0.02 and then the lower share count that I mentioned that\u2019s a result of buying back of 4.8 million shares in the fourth quarter $0.01. So, again, as we look at this the real big news is obviously the better margins.","If we turn to chart five, a summary of really all the numbers you saw in the press release, so I am not going to walk through all these numbers. I do want to just highlight in the lower left-hand corner in the green box entitled Sales Growth. Again, the organic sales growth of 5%, we think really strong record, obviously performance here in this quarter.","If we turn to the next chart, which is labeled Electrical Products segment and we will start to go through, give you a couple comments on each of the operating segments to report, obviously, our largest segment of the company about 33% of the company, a very strong quarter of performance.","As you can see sales were up 2%, organic was up 5% and here we start to see the impact of ForEx in the quarter, which grew in the fourth quarter to be more significant than it had been earlier in the year and as we will talk about 2015, we think that\u2019s going to continue to grow as we move into 2015.","But sales up 2%, 5% organic, very strong margin performance at 17.6%. I think when you look behind the business in terms of the activity that\u2019s going on. Bookings were up 4%. But once again this is very much a story of great strength in the Americas and then weaker activity outside the Americas.","Anything you will hear us talk about really in terms of each of our businesses and to give you just a dimension of that. Our bookings in the U.S. were up almost 7%. So I think you can get a sense for the difference around the world.","Again, we get into individual products and end markets, lighting again very strong, volume up 13%. We are delighted that our investment in LED is really paying off, about 50% of total revenue, now in the fourth quarter was actually LED. Very strong and residential very similar numbers to what we saw in lighting, industrial activity was quite strong.","We are pleased with the rebound in our Canadian business that was quite strong. Those really the highlights of where that booking strength came. You may recall bookings in the third quarter were 5%, booking in the fourth quarter 4%. So, continued nice tone in this business.","If we move to the next chart, entitled Electrical Systems and Services segment, about 29% of the company, obviously a very nice quarter here. While sales were basically flat with the third quarter and flat with last year.","You continue to see the, I think very strong margin performance here. I think many of you\u2019ll recall we've had disappointing second quarter, we\u2019d indicated at that point that our plan was to get our margins in the second half to an average of 14%. You recall in the third quarter we were at 14.6% and the fourth quarter we were at 15.2%. So, obviously, significantly stronger than we had laid out in the second quarter.","Bookings were flat and once again in this particular business we've been seeing a real flatness or weakness on the power quality side, really around the world. And here in the U.S. somewhat of a split in terms of the major project work, in terms of small projects, things aimed at sort of light commercial type market continued to be very robust.","The very large projects, more heavy industrial tend to be weaker and tend to being postponed at this time period. And then, I would say, the Utility markets continue to be a weak at this point.","Many of you, I am sure are looking at the bookings progression here, 3% in the third quarter, zero percent in the fourth quarter. I'll talk a little bit more about the implications of this in terms of our guidance for next year.","But it does mean that we would expect to start in this segment a little slower in the first half of next year, because, obviously, the last two quarters of bookings have been little weaker. That\u2019s all in our guidance already.","If we move to the next chart, Hydraulic segment, about 13% of the company again. Clearly 6% volume decrease from a year ago. If you look toward the green box in the lower left-hand corner, you see that 4 points of those 6 points was ForEx, but no question the market itself weaker as we\u2019ve talked about. Margins of 12.2%, down from a year ago, up just slightly from the third quarter, which was 11.7%.","And when we get inside the economic, economic activity here again, I think you look at our bookings, they declined about 3% from a year ago. But again very similar to what we discussed with you in the third quarter, distributor orders were up 9%. It was the OEM side of this business that was down again double-digit, down 22% and the story within that OEM weakness is exactly the same as they was in the third quarter. It\u2019s the story of the big ag retrenchment going on here and so that really had, okay, tone, with our OEMs, but very, very weak here on the ag side.","As we look forward and I will talk a little bit more about this when we talk about guidance. But we will be taking some actions in this business to restructure our business further in light of these volumes and I will talk a little bit more about that in terms of how it lays out in 2015.","Next chart, Aerospace, just less than 10% of the company. We think a really fine quarter, volumes up 2%. But again I can refer you to the green box in the lower left-hand corner, organic growth of 9% offset by, as you recall, the divesture of the two small business units, we divested during the second quarter this year, that\u2019s how we get 1 point negative ForEx, that\u2019s how we get to the 2%.","Bookings continued to have a good tone here, both on the commercial and the military side. Commercial is a little stronger than military, but they both positive numbers. And the aftermarket running at about 8% continues to be robust. And we are really pleased to see that activity, very solid margin performance here at 15.4%.","And then finally, the next chart entitled, vehicle segment, about 17% of the company. We think a very strong quarter, volumes up 4%, margins of 16.9%. Within that volume, again if I can refer you to that green box on the lower left hand corner, 8% organic growth, very strong growth offset by 4% negative ForEx impact.","And for those of you who are looking at the 320 basis point increase in margins, the 16.9% versus the 13.7% last year, I think you recall in the fourth quarter of '13, we had a number of launches, high volume launches that we had not done as well on and that had depressed those margins by about 1.8%. So I think the real correct comparison for you to think about is 16.9% versus sort of a run rate a year ago of about 15.5%.","Now we are at the front end of -- we continued to have a pretty attractive number of quarters here in terms of economic activity within North America in heavy duty truck business.","I think most of you saw in December the NAFTA Class orders came in at 43,800 units that\u2019s for the industry. The fourth quarter total orders were 130,900 units. And if you look back over the total bookings for 2014, we believe it maybe a record year of individual bookings in the industry, all that is leading to our forecast of a build -- an industry build for NAFTA Class sales of about 330,000 units this year.","And we think it\u2019s going to start at a pretty brisk level, about 82,000 units in the first quarter, about 85,000 in the second quarter, about 82,000 in the third, and then 71,000 in the fourth, and that\u2019s our present view for how this will lay out over the quarters this year.","We can then move to chart 11, which is entitled highlights of full year 2014 results. We think a very good year. Organic revenue growth of 4%. FX was just 1% this year. And of course in our guidance, we will be talking to you about a negative 4% next year. So, three additional negative points going into 2015 about what we experienced this year.","With all the puts and takes and changes in economic environment and individual operating issues, our guidance originally was $4.70 and we came out with $4.67, up 13% over a year ago and it does exclude the legal settlements and the divestiture gains.","Segment margins up 40 basis points to 15.3%, operating cash flow, excluding the legal settlements, a record $2.53 billion, that\u2019s about a 0.9 cash conversion or just over 8% of net sales, the Cooper integration, really doing very, very well.","We have fully achieved that $95 million of incremental savings that we expected to achieve in 2014. And as I mentioned earlier, all this has enabled us to repurchase about 2% of our outstanding shares at a cost of $650 million this year.","If we then kind of switch hats here and move out of '14, although we would love to talk some more about the fourth quarter results, but we know your interest is really in trying to understand our thinking about 2015 and that really starts on chart 12 of this packet.","Clearly, we are operating and what I think many people have titled mixed global economic conditions. And our view on that really has not changed, the relative US strength, the weakness in Europe and Latin America, the slowdown in China, and then probably the newest factor that was introduced in the second half of 2014 is the extreme currency volatility that we\u2019ve all seen and that\u2019s done nothing but accelerate into the New Year here.","So set in that context of overall global GDP that we think is going to be around 2.5%, we would expect our organic revenue and this is combination of both market and whatever we do to grow in excess of that to be between 3% and 4% 2015. And what we have raised for you on this chart is our view of the likely ranges of that organic growth in these four businesses.","And maybe just to give you a little bit of color in and around this. In the electrical business, clearly we continue to see real strength in the residential markets. We think that those may well increase again this year on the order of 15%, but non-res very solid single-digit type growth, similar to what we saw -- mid-single digit, similar to what we saw this year. Utility will be one of the lower growers, maybe a 1% type market and then the global power quality markets we think will be flat, not much growth this year.","In the hydraulics market, I know there is a lot of interest in trying to understand the end market activities here, not much new versus what we have been talking about. Real retrenchment of US in global ag, particularly at very large equipment area what many people are calling large ag, and those numbers on a global basis on the order of a 20% large ag pullback. US construction, mid-single digit. Industrial is pretty reasonable. Mining, a negative. And clearly, we continue to see weakness in the Chinese construction equipment market. And that\u2019s what leads us to this forecast.","On the aerospace side, we see the 2% to 4% range. You are seeing commercial around the world sort of is 5% to 6% and then US defense at roughly a negative 2%. And then on the vehicle side, you have heard us already talk about our forecast of 330,000 in terms of heavy duty truck. We are in the high-16s in terms of the US retail sales. And then we continue to think that the Latin American market is not going to show much growth here during 2015.","All of that leads us to this overall view of our organic revenue growth this year of about 3% to 4%, remembering again that that\u2019s going to be offset by about 4% of negative ForEx impact.","Moving to chart 13, a quick look at segment margins. What we\u2019ve shown you here is in the first column is the full year 2014 actuals, 2015 ranges for each of our five segments, and then in total I think they speak for themselves in terms of that they are all increases with the exception of hydraulics.","And I will comment on that one just in a moment. Electrical Products, I think pretty clear continued very attractive margins, continued growth. We get additional synergies in that segment as well this year. And so, I think no further comments needed there.","Electrical Systems and Services, I did comment that and we talked about quite a bit with many of you is that this is a backlog business so that the bookings in the previous two quarters are somewhat of an indicator of lightly revenues and the success of third quarter.","As a result, as we think about the first quarter in this business that is always the weakest quarter for Eaton in total, it is also the weakest quarter for the systems and services businesses. And as we look at the bookings of last two quarters, we think this business will start a little slower the early portion of this year and then pick up as the year goes on.","In the Hydraulics business, all the comments I made about the tough market conditions obviously apply here. As a result of those tough market conditions, we are going to pull some additional restructuring and head into this business.","Most of that will be completed or expensed in the first and second quarters. So I would encourage you to think about this business as being one that starts slower from a margin performance point of view and then margins are higher in the second half.","And then as you think about the total, as you look at the 15.9% to the 16.5% for the entire company, I think you are all well familiar that we tend to have our lowest segment margins in the first quarter.","And when you add two those, the two comments that I made on Electrical Systems and Hydraulics, we think a good place to think about first quarter segment margins are probably in this 14.5% to 15.0% type range. And obviously they pick up from there for the year.","And if we can move to chart 14, which is the summary and I won\u2019t repeat many of the areas that I have already touched upon here that organic growth is of 3% to 4%, that\u2019s about $675 million to $900 million.","And obviously you get a sense for the 4%, negative ForEx is $900 million. Corporate pension, interest, and general corporate expenses, we think will be about $30 million to $40 million higher than 2014 levels.","The tax rate, this is very consistent with what we have been indicating to you over the last six months, we think it will be 9% to 11% and that obviously is different than the less than 6% in 2014. That leads us to our full year operating earnings per share guidance of $4.75 to $5.05 and our first quarter guidance of $0.95 to $1.05.","Operating cash flow, up some 15% from 2014 and that\u2019s a cash efficiency ratio, our conversion ratio of about 1%. Free cash flow, obviously just the difference between our operating cash flow and the CapEx, which we think will be about $675 million.","And then as you saw in our release that we anticipate about $45 million of acquisition integration expense in 2015 and that includes both Cooper, and then the last pieces of the ramp up of a few of our smaller acquisitions, also concluded in 2012.","So if you move to the last chart, chart 15 entitled summary. Again 2014, we think we had a really strong fourth quarter, the 5% organic growth, the record segment margins, the all-time record quarterly cash flow. Finished the year we think well, up some 13%.","We think that really steeps the basis for another record year in 2015 for organic growth of 3% to 4%, offset by the negative 4% ForEx, operating earnings growth of 5% at the midpoint of our guidance.","And then we tried to give you a dimension into kind of the major elements that are affecting that 5% guidance that we are expecting ForEx is about a negative $0.20 this year. That\u2019s the impact of that $900 million of negative revenue impact and the move to that 9% to 11% tax increase from less than 6% is about another $0.17. So you\u2019ve got about $0.37 of negatives from those two headwinds. And if you were to take those out of our guidance, obviously that\u2019s what then drives the 13%.","The reason we felt it was important to come back to that number is that I\u2019ve talked with many of you on different occasions about the fact that I think the challenge for industrial companies is to think about in this relatively low growth market, how do you drive earnings in this 10% to 12% range?","I think our formula in terms of the acquisition integration benefits and the base earnings being a multiple of revenue is still in place. Unfortunately, we're dealing with it and we have to deal with, the ForEx and the higher tax rate issue here this year.","In the first quarter, specifically, the impact of ForEx and the tax rates about $0.09. And you obviously can get the impression that it\u2019s about that same number, as it runs through each of the other quarters as well. The good news for all of this is that the Cooper integration savings and the additional restructuring benefits we had from the work we did in our industrial sector this year are helping us really offset this negative $0.37.","So, again, if I just come back to the first quarter, I\u2019d ask you just to be thinking about currency and tax impacts, seasonally weakened margins, hydraulic restructuring, slower ESS start, that's what leads us to sort of our dollar midpoint for the first quarter and what we think is still going to be another great year for Eaton.","So with that, Don, I'll turn things back to you and look forward to the questions.","Don Bullock","Very good, Bill. Before we begin our Q&A session on our call today, I see that we have a number of individuals in the queue with questions. So given our time constraints today of an hour and our desire to get as many of those questions as possible, please limit your opportunity to one question and a follow-up. Thanks in advance for your cooperation.","With that, I will turn it back over to our moderator who will give you some instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Don Bullock","Our first question will come from Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","All right. So my first question\u2019s really on the electrical side of the house. Can you just give us a little bit more color, Sandy? You saw your bookings numbers up in EPG, yes, that's flat and I know you talked a little bit about the industrial market and I think is great. I guess what I'm just trying to understand is, as you look into \u201815 and your organic growth assumptions of 3 to 5 across electrical, I\u2019m just trying to understand what\u2019s embedded in your substance for growth, quarter growth in those two segments?","Sandy Cutler","I think we really think about the market as being across both of them, Joe. And I say that the big issue is, is really a continuation again of U.S. strengths, not much growth in Europe and growth somewhere between the U.S. and EMEA and Asia-Pacific. But I\u2019d say in the non-res market, we again think we are going to see here in the U.S., speaking to that a single-digit type performance, a single -- mid-single-digit type performance. And on the smaller kind of industrial projects, there is still a fair amount of activity. It\u2019s really large projects that we've seen have been drier in that regard.","Utility, we don't expect to get a tremendous amount of help out. We think that's going to be kind of a 1% grower again this year. In the residential activity, we continue to think we\u2019ll be quite strong. So, basically, the products that go through distribution are in that EPG pieces that include service activity, which has been quite strong, as well as some of the larger projects and the smaller projects that have been quite strong is in the ESS segment.","Joe Ritchie","All right. And maybe I guess my follow-up, just focusing on Hydraulics for a second. You mentioned that basically the order retention this quarter was predominantly driven by ag. But there has been negative commentary from the OEMs on the construction side as well. This quarter, you had CAT, specifically talk about your production being down next year? So, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for what your expectations are there on the Hydraulics side, specifically as it relates to construction?","Sandy Cutler","On construction, the big-big negative has been the China construction story and that leaked into a couple of stories that you just mentioned. And so our view on mining is still down. We think in \u201915 over \u201914. We think the China construction market does not come back in \u201815 either. We think the low-end of the construction market in the U.S. isn\u2019t bad and these are kind of mid-single digit type numbers. But then the ag piece is the piece that hits particularly hard really around the world on the order of kind of a negative 20 at the big ag side.","On the industrial side of the business, is not bad. Again, that\u2019s kind of a mid-single digit type business, so I\u2019d say those are the elements. But I think certainly in concert with comments you\u2019ve heard from others that Chinese construction market and ag and mining are not positives as we go into \u201915.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. I will get back in queue. Thanks guys.","Don Bullock","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities.","Eli Lustgarten","Good morning, everyone.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning, Eli.","Eli Lustgarten","Actually somebody has to ask for the obligatory oilfield exposure question and how you're looking at it and you tie it to the electrical businesses? You gave us a joint three to five. Are we really looking at gains in EPG and basically ESS being flat to down in revenues, is that sort of the way you are thinking of that?","Sandy Cutler","Let me deal with oil first. Trying to be precise on oil is a little bit of a rolling dice currently. Clearly, last time we all talked about this, oil was $20 to $30 higher than it is now. And so for Eaton, it is sort of a 6% number in terms of our oil and gas exposure. And so it's another one of those five to six end markets that we have many of and is one of our advantages of being kind of broadly spread across a lot of end markets. Our view is, it really does matter whether you're upstream, midstream or downstream and as we've indicated in a couple forums, we are predominantly downstream. We think the biggest immediate impact is an upstream, particularly in terms of being on onshore upstream and I think most people have seen that impact already starting to hit.","We think the downstream impacts are more likely to be felt in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. But having said all of that, our thinking is that you have to be thinking there's a 20% to 25% impact in kind of the oil activity that's out there. And so, I'm sure you're working your calculator at this point, the 6%, about a $1.3 billion for Eaton. I save you a couple of keystrokes there. And we think that the strict oil and gas impact is sort of a 20% to 25% reduction.","Now having said that, I think the piece that many people have missed is that there are whole bunch end markets that lower oil and gas actually help our customers and our business. And I think when you look at the light vehicles or the truck market, or the aerospace market, or portions of the construction market those are all aided by it. So it is not a net-net for Eaton, 25% of $1.3 billion. But all that\u2019s in our guidance for this year to the best that we've been able to approximate at 20% to 25% type impact on the direct revenues net area.","Now, coming back to your second question, Eli and I\u2019d address the oil one, which is this issue of do we expect to see growth in ESS this year? Yes, we do. And so we expect to see growth on both sides of the way we have split our electrical business for reporting of both the products in the ESS business. Typically, the ESS business always starts with a weaker fourth quarter and when you think about major construction activity and all one has to do is look out the window where most of us are located right now and you see what\u2019s lying on the ground, which is what ties up construction projects this time of the year. But we do expect growth on both. But because the power quality market is in the ESS, the big three phase portion is that it\u2019s probably going to grow little less quickly than the EPG side will.","Eli Lustgarten","Great. Thank you.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Thanks. Just a question on the balance sheet usage, I guess, you have said last year that the real scope to use it comes in second half of \u201815. You spend $650 million on the buyback, actually the last six months. So what's left vis-\u00e0-vis that billion dollars in the second half or is your view changed on kind of appropriate leverage levels?","Rick Fearon","No our views -- thanks for the question. Our views have not changed on the appropriate leverage levels. And I think you recall, we said is by the middle of 2015, so end of June that we\u2019d be in a position to share with investors more specific plans on what our next capital allocation plans would be. We said that we thought it would be a mixture of both repurchase and potential acquisitions. We want to get little closer to that time and really see what the relative merits of one of the other tend to look like.","It wasn\u2019t that we were going to actuate in action or take an action on June 30th. But it would be in a position to talk about what we do over the second half of 2015 but that plan continues. We obviously stepped into buy our shares in the third and fourth quarter. When we saw a period of weakness, we remained quite bullish on our forward prospects. And we think the fact that we alone are stepping it by 2% of our shares is an ample evidence of that ","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. Then my follow-up is just on the overall segment margins. They grew about 40 bps, I think last year, the full year issue at the midpoint, you\u2019re guiding for about 90 bps or so of increase. So if I back out Cooper savings and the restructuring benefits, those I think totaled about 40 basis points. So it looks like you are assuming sort of underlying that core incremental margin very similar to last year. Is that right? And I guess how do you see price and commodity cost affecting that base incremental?","Rick Fearon","First, Julian, maybe just a little bit of background. Your numbers are correct. We were 15.3 in 2014, 49, so it was the 40 bps you mentioned. And I think within that we recognized, we had disappointments in two of our five segments last year. We had not hit our original targets in Electrical, ESS or Hydraulics. And so as we look at this year, we try to provide you a little bit of a range for each of these but coming back to direct to your comment, yes, we do expect this year to achieve $150 million in the Cooper integration. Last year, it was 95%.","We\u2019ve talked about this $35 million of additional savings that were coming out of the restructuring last year that we did in our industrial sector. And I\u2019d say that when you work your way through that and the ForEx decrementals, I think what you come out is that we\u2019re in the very low 20s in terms of our incrementals this year. And we think that takes into effect, the mixed changes that take place in the business, it takes place -- it takes into effect .We think the uncertainties that are generally out there in this environment, when things are growing relatively slow, it's a little harder to have higher incrementals but that\u2019s our planning at this point.","Julian Mitchell","Right. Thank you.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan.","Ann Duignan","Hi. Good morning.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning Ann.","Rick Fearon","Good morning.","Ann Duignan","Can you talk a little bit slightly about what you are seeing in Europe? We had seen all the attempts to spur activity over there and everybody is kind of got into nothing happening in Europe. I\u2019m just curious as to what you guys are seeing by various country and if there are any bright spots?","Sandy Cutler","Yeah. There are few candles burning at full power. I\u2019d see -- what we\u2019ve seen is a lot of confusion. I m sure no different than the inputs you are getting. You see so many confidence number which are up one month and down another. Clearly, U.K. has been one of the strong areas. France has been very troubled. Germany, when you talk, the customers there doesn\u2019t sound as bad as some of the economic data does but somebody is reporting bad numbers. So I\u2019d say at this point, our assumption is obviously it\u2019s going to continue to be a challenged region. There are opportunities to grow there if you\u2019re serving the right market segments. But from an overall region, there is still a lot of challenge to get shaken out during 2015.","Ann Duignan","And would you anticipate any pickup in export side of places like Germany just under a weak currency?","Rick Fearon","Yeah. Our experience Ann is that it normally takes sort of six to nine months in industrial markets for currency to have significant impacts upon trade flows. Now obviously it\u2019s been falling, the Euro has been falling during the fourth quarter and has really come down obviously very hard here already in the first part of this year, which would lead us to believe that if you\u2019re going to see much of that, it\u2019s going to start to materialize in industrial goods. I\u2019m not talking about consumer goods but in industrial goods, it\u2019s going to be more of a second half story than it\u2019s going to be a first half story.","Ann Duignan","And then in that context space, just a real quick follow-up, Sandy, what about competitiveness vis-\u00e0-vis European competitors. Are you seeing any pricing, aggressive pricing in the marketplace and I\u2019ll leave it there?","Sandy Cutler","No, we haven\u2019t really seen any change at this point. It\u2019s early as I said in terms of kind of seeing that but of course then you\u2019re going to think about the physical size and you also have to think about the different standards. And so that typically hasn\u2019t been as big an issue on our end markets.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","Thanks. Good morning everyone.","Sandy Cutler","Morning John.","John Inch","Morning. So Sandy and Rick, I believe you talked about the 26% incremental margin read through and now it\u2019s low 20s. And I think you said mix. Is this a project, kind of a larger project issue because I would have though given the environment would be deferral of larger projects. And so far as you got oil tied and not what actually improve your mix yet or is the placeholder just you\u2019re trying to be conservative? I\u2019m really just trying to understand because your volumes are not bad. So why exactly are we sort of three or four points lighter on the conversion?","Sandy Cutler","Yeah. We had talked about 26 as it pertained 2014 and \u201815 during the fourth quarter in a number of sessions. We\u2019ve talked about this being a lower 20s number. And so this is very consistent with what our planning had been for \u201815. It\u2019s really a result, John, I would say, just about the fact that as growth has been slower, we just see it\u2019s little harder to get out of those higher incrementals. Some may call as conservative, we think its appropriate and these types have shift a lot of uncertainty around these market places at this point.","John Inch","But to Ann\u2019s point, there is no -- that's in this report, you pretty much refuted it. But there is no pricing in electrical or anything else that you\u2019re growing more concerned about?","Sandy Cutler","No, it\u2019s not an issue. Let me say a kind of a structural change in terms of how the market set up, no.","John Inch","Okay. And then just in terms of, I guess, we did $0.08 of restructuring in the second quarter. You said there is more restructuring coming in hydraulics and then we did obviously the share repurchase. What\u2019s in the guide in terms of share repurchase this year and then the restructuring and what quarter does it fall into? Is there anyway to know that yet?","Sandy Cutler","In terms of the guide for the share buyback and you recall that we ended the year around 470 million shares. Our best estimate is and this is consistent with our planning each year is that we try to put into our planning basically buying back shares to offset option dilution. And in many years, that\u2019s been around $100 million. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably your best kind of planning number.","In terms of the restructuring is that, this year as I indicated that we\u2019re doing work in our hydraulics business in light of all the factors, we\u2019ve talked about. And that\u2019s going to hit in both the first and the second quarter and that was where my comments were that expect margins to be lower than the average in the first half and higher than the average in the second half.","John Inch","But in terms of the $0.08, does that -- do you have any sort of -- is it like half that rates split in Hydraulics between the two quarters or is it turning out you just don\u2019t know yet?","Rick Fearon","The only reason John we called out a number last year is that we pulled forward restructuring that we haven\u2019t planned at doing in the year after we given out our guidance. Our guidance every year has normal restructuring just part of run on the business and we haven\u2019t broken it out because we really regard that as just a cost of doing the business. And that\u2019s very much this year. And so it\u2019s not different than the total we do in the company every year. You\u2019re just going to hit that segment in a way that you\u2019ll notice it in the first and second quarter.","John Inch","Right. So in other words, the second quarter should actually get helped because you\u2019re not calling out specific $0.88. So in theory, you\u2019ve got less restructuring in the second quarter. Is that fair?","Rick Fearon","Yeah. I think that\u2019s the fair interpretation, yes.","John Inch","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein.","Steve Winoker","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning Steve.","Steve Winoker","Could you just maybe provide a little more clarity on the ESS margin dynamic again? Just refreshing where we\u2019re on pricing mix and freight, some of those issues that you\u2019ve talked about and the sustainability going forward?","Sandy Cutler","Sure. I think as many people recall that when we had the poor results in the first half of 2014, we were dealing with three things, some pricing dynamics, some freight issues and some efficiency issues in terms of having had weak levels of bookings. I think what you saw in the second half is we considered those three things largely addressed or cured if you will at this point.","So we\u2019re jumping off the second half of last year, now we think in a healthy condition. My comments about how this year would layout is that, we would always encourage people to sort of look at the previous two quarters of bookings as an indicator for what sales are likely to be in the third quarter or the successive quarter. ","And because we\u2019ve had two quarters of bookings now, they were flat in the fourth quarter and they were just 3% in the third quarter 2014. That\u2019s going to mean the year is going to start a little slower than if we\u2019ve had a five and seven, the two quarters before as an example.","My last comment was that, remember in the seasonality of our businesses for all of the -- the first quarter is always the weakest quarter. And obviously, we get that indication from our $1 overall midpoint of our guidance versus the overall $4.90. But it is particularly usually weaker in the Electrical Systems and Services business because it is a lot of large construction activity that doesn't tend to get kind of put in place as much in the quarter. So that would be I guess the vintage I would give you on thinking about the first quarter there, and all this in our guidance of the $1.","Steve Winoker","Okay. And maybe just a little bit of thoughts on the tax side, so I know you\u2019ve already prepped us for the 9% to 11% this year. But as you sort of think now about your visibility of tax rate going forward, how are you thinking about that over a longer term? I mean, should we be confident that we\u2019re in the kind of a reasonable zone assuming no policy changes at this point, or how are you thinking about that?","Sandy Cutler","Well. Let me, Steve, give you a little color. First of all, the rate in '14 end up exactly where we thought other than the R&D tax credit, which was reenacted at the end of the year. That\u2019s what pushed it down to 5.2. But if you recall, we've been saying it would be 6. And so we ended up right spot on. For '15 mainly because of the mix issues, the rate is going up to just 9% to 11%. And absent major changes in tax law, it is not likely to change dramatically.","It might move a point or two from this 9% to 11%, but it is not likely to move a lot. Now there could be changes in tax law, that's very hard to get one's arms around. As you know there have even been various things moved at recently about that, but absent the changes on the tax code not likely to be big changes.","Steve Winoker","Okay. Great. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeff Hammond","God morning, guys.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Hammond","So Sandy, just back to the ESS, I guess what gives you the confidence that things do improve in the second half. I mean, do we expect these projects to break free?","Sandy Cutler","We can\u2019t specifically comment on individual projects per say, but it\u2019s our sense from what we see out there being worked upon, what we\u2019re quoting upon, what if you followed the Dodge reports and activities, said this stuff will start to break loose. We obviously saw that happen last year if you looked at the pattern as well. It always generally looks thinnest about this time a year.","But we come back to the non-residential construction, our view in this year came out a little stronger than I think most people thought it would in 2014. And we think this year again that we\u2019re likely to see this to be a mid-single digit type number. The kind of industrial MRO activity is pretty solid through here. And so that\u2019s what it\u2019s based on as our view of non-res being a big influencer and industrial continue to be strong.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. And then quick color on oil and gas, is there a way to carve out, how you saw order rates trend at least qualitatively within oil and gas basin businesses?","Sandy Cutler","Yeah. We really to-date have seen very minimal impact. We spent a lot of time talking to customers at the multi different levels of the oil and gas industry. And that\u2019s what we say looking forward, we think it's prudent to assume that we\u2019re going to see this kind of 20% to 25% impact, but not much of it has been felt at this point.","I do think you see a very different profile between upstream and downstream in terms of both how hard they will be hit and also what the timing will be that you feel this upstream will be a bigger hit and it\u2019s going to happen sooner. The downstream obviously has to be hit to some degree as well, but it's probably going to be out a little bit further. And clearly you\u2019re seeing a lot of announcements thing rolled out here during just a last couple of weeks. So this is a fairly dynamic topic.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. Thanks.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to focus a little bit here on the cash flow and you\u2019ve obviously provided the guidance Sandy. But in terms of pension contributions and cash taxes, can you maybe just provide a bit of color on these two items, please?","Sandy Cutler","Sure, Nigel. I\u2019ll ask Rick to get those for you.","Rick Fearon","Yeah. In terms of pension contribution, Nigel, we are going to be putting in about $40 million less into our U.S. plan to this year than we did in '14. That obviously is one of the factors that helping cash conversion. Also, we think cash taxes based on our best view of that is likely the difference between cash and book taxes, and it was about $140 million difference in '14.","But we think that that will likely be about half that in '15. And so those are two of the factors that are improving our cash conversion. But, frankly, and even bigger factor is that our working capital consumed about $260 million of cash in \u201914 and we expected to be about neutral in \u201915. And so those are the three big elements that improve the cash conversion ratio in \u201915.","Nigel Coe","And then what\u2019s driven that dramatic improvement in working capital?","Rick Fearon","Well, first of all, sales are suppose to be or expected to be largely flat and typically with flat sales you wouldn\u2019t expect to see a significant change in working capital. And then secondly, in \u201914, because some of our markets did turn out to be a bit different than we had plan for at the start of the year. We have had a bit more inventory than we had expected. And so it's really those two factors, flat markets plus working down some of the inventories.","Sandy Cutler","And one more, if I could, which is obviously, the integration. We did build inventories purposely during 2015, while we\u2019ve been moving this over 20 factories that are part of the integration of Cooper, as we\u2019ve share with you earlier and these schedules have not changed. We expect to have most of that work done by the middle of this year and obviously, it makes good sense to take the safety starts off.","Nigel Coe","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And just quick one on the Cooper synergies, you mentioned you are on track and \u201915 guidance is in line with your previous guidance 100%. But has the mix between revenues and cost change at all?","Rick Fearon","No. There is a same numbers as we showed you last year. They are very close to that. And in our February meeting in New York, I can\u2019t remember whether it was end of February or early March, but the one that occurs right at that time period. Tom will take you through a pretty detailed review of how we\u2019re doing against each of those buckets, both on the cost side and the revenue side. But I don\u2019t think there will be any surprises in that. I think you\u2019ve really be pleased to see the level of achievement.","Nigel Coe","Okay. I will leave it there. Thanks very much.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","On cash flow again, I understand kind of the improvements year-over-year. Rick, it still looks like you\u2019re converting though maybe a touch below 100, which just strikes me, is a bit low given kind of how much amortization there is? Is there some other kind of operational use to cash or something or could you kind of bridge us with the conversion?","Rick Fearon","Well, Jeff, we expect that to be right around one maybe at 0.98 maybe at 1.0, but they\u2019ll be right around 1. And in addition to the three factors I mentioned to you, namely the -- we still think that cash taxes are going to be a little bit higher than book taxes. Pension funding is a little bit above pension expense. Working capital, we think will be relatively neutral but we are expecting that CapEx will be about $100 million more than depreciation.","And we are capacitating various programs. I have several new products that are being introduced and so those are the major factors that they\u2019ll help you understand how the amortization, which is the amortization of intangibles, which is obviously, non-cash is being offset to a certain extent.","Jeff Sprague","Appreciate it. And just a follow-up on oil and gas, Sandy, perhaps, just coincidental, but about 6% of sales is about, how I would size Crouse-Hinds. Is that how you\u2019re defining oil and gas or you kind of parsing down through exposures in Hydraulics and other businesses that would kind of be exposed oil and gas?","Sandy Cutler","Yeah. I appreciate the question, Jeff. The Crouse business is not 100% oil and gas. In fact, it\u2019s quite a diversified business. So I think a number of people have the impression that Crouse was 100% oil and gas. Cooper had done a good job and we\u2019ve also taken that franchise into other. And so this is the total, like 6% it is the total of looking across our Hydraulics and our Electrical business, and trying to get a sense for where some of our vehicle businesses maybe impacted there as well. So we take Crouse into a whole variety of other harsh and hazardous applications as well.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning.","Josh Pokrzywinski","First question on price cost as some of these raw materials have come in, when should we start to see that show up in the business, giving natural or financial hazard that you guys use?","Sandy Cutler","Yeah. I think the relationship is always, what happens to kind of net, net commodity and price impact and then the number of our markets prices due end up adjusting to what happens in commodity.","So we think there will be a very small positive for us this year and it is in our guidance at this point. But you\u2019ve already seen whether you are looking at some of the metals, diesel fuel hasn\u2019t come down as much as, obviously, the traded numbers for WTR at this point. But some of the metals have come down. But those tend to get adjusted fairly quickly in terms of prices in the marketplace.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got you. And I\u2019m assuming you guys would still be able to hold on to the net price in the Electrical businesses where you consume most of that?","Sandy Cutler","Yeah. And I think as you can see that our margins, we are expecting to increase this year.","Josh Pokrzywinski","And then, just a follow-up on that comment around non-res that you made earlier, Sandy, I think in years past for you guys or maybe a little earlier than the rest on non-res in terms of seeing that recovering your business, probably attributed most of it to more industrial than construction type vertical. If we see some of this oil and gas weakness spill over into other industrial pocket and continue to see construction gets better. Is the push and pull that a neutral or is the construction piece with Cooper now outweigh the more industrial side of electrical?","Sandy Cutler","Actually, our balance when we bought Cooper, we became a little less sensitive to non-res because Cooper had a bigger kind of industrial orientation and part of that included oil and gas part of it was just general industrial but we are pretty good. As I said in the couple of different settings, we\u2019re a pretty good surrogate for the overall non-res exposure because we\u2019ve got good participation on each of these segments. So our real interest is in continuing to see that number increase total non-res and that\u2019s the real driver for us more than anyone of the individual segments.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got you. Its helpful. Thanks.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Andrew Owen with BofA Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Owen","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Sandy Cutler","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Owen","Just to focus more on agriculture. Do you guys forecast any difference based on the production schedules between the spring selling season and the fall selling season? I guess, what I\u2019m trying to get at a, is there any difference between tractors and combines? And b, are we sort of at a point where we starting to hope that this is the bottom?","Sandy Cutler","Yeah. I think our best view on this, we talk a little bit at the end of the third quarter Andrew was that we didn\u2019t believe it was going to be one crop season that was going to define recovery. We thought that based upon past downs, it normally takes two to three crops rotations to kind of get you back to a point and that to us said that we would see all of \u201815 be weak and that \u201816 might start weak.","That obviously informs part of our thinking as to why we\u2019re doing additional restructuring on our Hydraulics business as well. So we don\u2019t expect to see a real quick snap back in this regard and it really doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s planting or whether it\u2019s harvesting. The big equipment is getting impacted so your high horse power tractors and combines are both getting hit pretty hard.","Andrew Owen","And the second thing just a follow-up on aerospace. It seems that most of the companies that have provided outlook so far are not really baking in a significant recovery in the spares business due to low energy prices. What\u2019s baked into your outlook for your aerospace business particularly in the second half of the year?","Sandy Cutler","Yeah. you may recall that our business is -- if I went back four years ago, was a business where 60% of the business was OEM and 40% was aftermarket and obviously, that makes us important. The last couple years we\u2019ve been running at 65% OEM and 35% aftermarket. We do not expect that ratio is going to change in 2015 so that we stay very much at the 65% OEM, 35%, so that means that our aftermarket is not growing at much of a difference than the overall market forecast we have.","Andrew Owen","Okay. Terrific. Thank you.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Robert Baird.","Mig Dobre","Yeah. Good morning, guys.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning, Mig.","Mig Dobre","Sticking with Hydraulics, this is the second quarter where you kind of call out a massive difference between distributor and OEM orders. I'm wondering how sustainable is this? And in your experience, does one end market have a tendency to lead the other?","Sandy Cutler","I think the biggest piece is really flowing through distribution tends to be more of the industrial and then aftermarket into a couple of these markets. Generally, the change if you're looking for someone who is serving the mobile market, distributor that serves the mobile market, they might be three to six months behind the OEM. But I think in this case, the real dynamic to keep in mind here is think about the end markets.","The ag markets is going to be weak, the mining market is going to be weak, the construction market is very regional at this point. And then industrial is pretty good around the world. And that\u2019s the way we are trying to think about it. But again I\u2019d say part of the reason I gave the heading on the businesses when I went through was remember Hydraulics is about 13% of the company.","Mig Dobre","Sure that\u2019s helpful. And then for my follow-up may be back to ESS, I remember a couple of years ago, you were setting some margin targets there around 16%. And obviously we are still long ways from that. And I am just wondering how much of the delta your guidance for 2015 versus that target was owed to maybe volume really not being what you expected it as opposed to the Cooper synergies flowing a little bit different than you expected initially?","Rick Fearon","I don\u2019t know that I can parse that for you. I think we said at the end of the second quarter last year that with a slower start we had last year that we thought getting to the original targets that we had set the number of years ago for \u201815 would be a taller pot in both our Electrical Systems and Services segment and our Hydraulics areas and that\u2019s indeed I think what\u2019s reflected in our guidance at this point.","So I think we are going to have a solid year of improvement again in electrical systems and services this year as we will overall for the company. And that\u2019ll be true in every segment except Hydraulics, where we are saying that the midpoint of that range is actually less than what we achieved this year for all the other reasons I mentioned.","Mig Dobre","All right thanks.","Don Bullock","The next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Morning guys.","Sandy Cutler","Morning.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Hey, on residential the up 15%, I mean another robust outlook there, I mean it\u2019s been sort of a choppy market in some ways. Can you just sell out your thoughts on the optimism there?","Sandy Cutler","I think, we still believe when you look at the big issues what\u2019s going to drive the demographics over time and all the home formation numbers tend us -- continue to support a market that\u2019s on the order of 1.5 million starts per year. We are clearly a long way from that still. We\u2019ve seen a lot of activity in after market that\u2019s -- this is the kind of retrofitting and home repair that\u2019s been quite strong. But we are seeing it fairly steady.","If you don\u2019t look at the month and you don\u2019t look at the quarter. So if you look at the year, you are seeing a fairly steady recovery in terms of bringing back single-family in the country. Interest rates are still very low. And as you put more money in the pocket of the consumers with lower gas prices, this is one of the areas that is going to tend to be helpful because people have got more money for a mortgage. And so we do think these ties together and it\u2019s an example of one of those areas that is benefited by lower gas prices.","Shannon O'Callaghan","And there is obviously a pretty big disconnect with the outlook there and the outlook for utility. I mean, do you see that gap closing at some point? I think you said utility up one. I mean, at some point you would expect utility to kind of follow with those trends you are seeing in residential?","Sandy Cutler","Historically, portion of it would, but the utility market\u2019s facing some fairly severe capital challenges currently. And the rate increased market is -- the rate increase environment has not been terrific here in the U.S. So where we see most of the money being spend is really is an improvement of efficiency and then recovering from storms. It\u2019s not been in terms of putting whole new capacity in place. And so that\u2019s the stronger one, I think you can get lot of good information at an institute that speaks right to this issue.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey. You\u2019ve given all kinds of good color about direct oil exposure. But you\u2019ve touched on a couple of different times, the benefits and the offsets from lower oil and we just heard you answer the Shannon\u2019s question about residential mortgages. And earlier you zip through all the different businesses that would have a benefit. But maybe just -- just a bit more methodical in terms of what\u2019s in your 2015 guidance in terms of those offsets, fuel lower input cost and maybe is Cooper going to be a benefit? That would be helpful. Thanks.","Sandy Cutler","Yeah. We don\u2019t go that down in all of that detail, Deane. I think maybe the way to think about though is what are some of the markets. I talked to resi. We do think this also has an impact obviously in passenger car. And it also has an impact in the mix within passenger car because what you are clearly seeing is a move very quickly back toward larger SUVs and light trucks, which have a higher content fleet than passenger cars do. We do think it affects, what goes on in heavy-duty truck because diesel prices will come down. They haven\u2019t come down as far yet. They\u2019ve been a little sticky in that regard.","But that\u2019s going to affect the ability of obviously truckers, their margins and their ability to obviously buy new trucks as well. We think on the aerospace side -- clearly, its depreciation and fuel, those are your two big drivers there again and so we think good for us. So the way we\u2019ve tried to think about this, Deane, is looking at not just the negative in terms of upstream, midstream, downstream impact on oil and gas, but other sufficient points of exposure for Eaton to other markets that will have a benefit. And as a result, we think this is largely a neutral impact for us. But it\u2019s going to lead to some pluses and some of our businesses and obviously those businesses that ship capital equipment into oil and gas. Those are going to be a negative.","Deane Dray","And how about Cooper, specifically?","Sandy Cutler","Well. Cooper, again, we tend to have it tied to a lot of different contracts. So, we don't tend to make a gain on Cooper when it goes up or down.","Deane Dray","Got it. Just last question. You led off with some pretty heavy gains in your LED business, can you separate how much of that is -- is it all retrofits and maybe what inning are we in the whole LED retrofit conversion?","Sandy Cutler","It's very different by individual end market, whether it\u2019d be street lighting or parking lighting or indoor retail. We still think that the big piece of the market, both in terms of new installation, as well as retro is the recessed lighting markets that have traditionally been -- think of your commercial office building as well. And that\u2019s where we are just so excited about this WaveStream technology that we\u2019ve got in the market almost two years now and it\u2019s just doing extremely well, in all the various different styles that we have it out and so. But we continue to think there's real potential. We think LED is going to be the technology that really does rule in lighting and we've got some really unique advantages in that regard. And that\u2019s why you are continuing to see us grow at such strong rates.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Don Bullock","We have room for one more question today. And that\u2019ll come from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Chris Glynn","Thanks. Good morning. I think you had some on taxes, I think you had some discrete benefits in 2014, moving up the 9% to 11% range. Would you consider that fully normalized or longer-term, is there half more of the mid-teens at this point?","Sandy Cutler","Well, Chris, we think the 9% to 11% rate is relatively pure and that it doesn\u2019t really have significant discrete items. Now, as I mentioned earlier, it's always possible as mix continues to shift that perhaps the rate would change a point or two, but we don\u2019t see a sea change in the rate, absent changes in tax regulations.","Chris Glynn","Okay. Thanks. And then just on FX, the 4% overall, would you be able to kind of tilt that by segment?","Rick Fearon","We generally have -- I think if you look at, where it hit in the third quarter that relative kind of weighting where it hit, that\u2019s going to be a pretty indication.","Sandy Cutler","A pretty good indication to think about how it would be next year. It gives you a pretty good exposure for what the U.S. versus non-U.S. kind of load is in each of the businesses.","Chris Glynn","Makes sense. Got it.","Don Bullock","Thank you all. We\u2019ve reached the end of our call today. We do appreciate everyone\u2019s questions. As always, I\u2019ll be available to address your follow-up question today and later this week. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

Later we will conduct a question and answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for today for Eaton's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer.","Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Craig, highlighting both the performance in the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2018. As we've done historically in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments.","Before we do, I want to remind you of a couple of things. First, the press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted at our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that the press release and the presentation both include reconciliations to any non-GAAP measures, and a webcast of today's call is going to be accessible on our website and is available for replay for those who aren't able to join us.","Before we get started, I do want to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Actual results can differ materially from those forecasted projections due to a whole range of risk and uncertainties that are described both in the earnings release and our presentation and our related 8-K.","With that behind us, I'll turn it over to Craig to go through our presentation.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Okay. Thanks, Don. Appreciate it. Just before we get started with Q2 results, I did want to take an opportunity to once again emphasize the three primary elements of our corporate strategy. I'm sure you've worked through most of the financials already, but first and foremost, we remain focused as a company on delivering organic growth.","Our initiatives are very specific by business, but generally they include investing to create industry-leading products and technologies, leveraging partnerships with distributors and third parties, creating value products and services that allow us to more fully participate across the opportunities we see. So in short, what we're trying to do is find opportunities to say yes more often and doing it in a way that solves customer problems but also delivers attractive returns.","Second, we continue to expand our margins by improving productivity in our factories and in our functions and by selectively undertaking restructuring initiatives that allow us to eliminate redundancies, eliminate waste and really being more selective on how we spend our time moving away from marginal activities, but just as importantly, doubling down on those areas where we have the right to win with attractive returns.","Third, we'll maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation which begins with investing to win in all of our existing businesses. We'll also consistently return cash to shareholders in the form of industry-leading dividends, share repurchases, and by maintaining our rigor as we evaluate M&A opportunities against our hurdle rate.","We think by continuously delivering on these components, we'll generate superior value for our shareholders both in the short-term and the long-term. And in the context of that kind of strategic overview, we also thought we'd take an opportunity to just highlight once again this quarter a number of places where we've made a bit of progress against these strategic initiatives.","And on page four, I've highlighted a few of the examples. First, in our efforts to grow, I point to our presence in the fast-growing data center market which continues to pay off. In fact, we booked record orders in the first half of the year. We're seeing strong global demand for new facilities in hyperscale and Internet 2.0 applications, and importantly, we're winning in this space.","We also entered into a new joint venture with Shaanxi Fast Gear for light duty transmissions to serve the Chinese market. The JV combines Eaton's broad transmission technology with the leading transmission company in China and allows us to participate in the world's largest light vehicle market.","We also made solid progress on our digitization initiatives, and while too many to note, I would point out a few examples of progress made in the quarter. We launched an IoT enabled home lighting solution. We deployed an IoT enabled hydraulic system in sugar cane harvest applications as well as in hydraulic fracturing. We formed an industry cybersecurity partnership with the Rochester Institute of Technology which allows us to advance the common and secure IoT platform that we intend to deploy on all of our products. And so really solid progress as we continue to digitize the company and focus on opportunities to grow with these new technologies.","And while just getting started, we did secure our first high voltage converter order in our newly formed eMobility segment. And lastly, we added significant capacity to our hydraulics hose business enabling us to sharply reduce lead times and expand our presence in the high volume segment of the market.","So while not a complete list, these are examples that hopefully provide you with a sense of how we're moving our strategic priorities forward and how we're also investing in the future.","Now turning to our financial results for Q2 on page five, I'll just add some context to what you've already seen in the results. First of all, we think a very strong quarter of performance by our businesses. Earnings at $1.39, up 21% over Q2 of 2017 and at the high end of our guidance range. Our performance was driven by both strong revenue and record margins. Organic revenue up 7% was actually the highest reported growth since Q4 2011. FX added 1% offset by 1% in divestitures.","Bookings accelerated in most segments, but especially in Electrical Systems & Services and Aerospace, which were both up solid double digit. We generated all-time record segment margins of 17% based upon strong volume growth and strong incrementals, and we think once again demonstrated the ongoing benefits of our multiyear restructuring program and how those benefits are coming true.","Operating cash flow was $499 million in the quarter, and while not as strong as you might have expected, cash was impacted by adding working capital to support increased growth as well as by selectively pre-buying inventory to mitigate impacts of the trade tariffs.","And finally, we repurchased $300 million of our shares in the quarter bringing year to date purchases to $600 million, 1.7% of shares outstanding at the start of the year. So we think really strong, balanced performance across the company.","Turning to page six, we'll provide a summary of the consolidated results for the quarter, and here I just highlight a couple of elements of the income statement. We talked about the sales increase which really allowed us to increase segment operating margins by 16% and net income by 18%, earnings per share up 21% in Q2, and this compares to 15% in Q1. And lastly, we did deliver 11.1% after-tax margins in the quarter.","Moving to the segments, I'll start with Electrical Products. Our revenues were up 4%, 3% coming from organic growth, and this is up from the 1% growth we reported in Q1.","In the quarter, we saw particular revenue strength in industrial markets, especially in the Americas and the EMEA market, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Total bookings were up 4% in the quarter, and excluding Lighting, bookings were actually up 7%, which is a step up from Q1 bookings where, also excluding Lighting, they increased 2%. So this business is also ramping favorably.","Order strength was broad, driven by both industrial and residential markets. I would also note that lighting markets appear to have stabilized, and we expect to see low single digit market growth in the second half of the year.","Importantly, our margins in the quarter were up 120 basis points to 18.5%, which is a second quarter record. So strong conversion in our Electrical Products business.","Next, the results for our Electrical Systems & Service business is on page eight. Revenues increased a solid 7% in the quarter, and this is up from the 2% growth that we saw in Q1. Foreign exchange added 1% which was offset by negative 1% from a small divestiture in a joint venture.","In the quarter, we saw revenue strength in industrial projects, in data centers, and solid growth in harsh and hazardous markets. We generate very strong bookings growth of 15% with strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific and bookings were especially strong in large industrial projects and in data centers. And our backlog continued to grow increasing 14% in the quarter, and we think position the business well for continued growth in the second half of 2018 and certainly into 2019 as well.","Operating margins were 15%, up 130 basis points, and we delivered strong leverage as the 7% sales increase resulted in a 17% increase in operating profits.","Moving to page nine, here we cover the Hydraulics results. Sales increased 14% in the quarter, 13% organic, 1% positive FX. Revenues were strong with both mobile OEMs and across the distribution channel. Bookings were actually down 1% in the quarter, and this does take a little bit of an explanation, but this included Asia Pacific up 15%, the Americas up 4%, offset by EMEA down 21%. And while impacting orders, the lower EMEA number is actually the result of our operational improvements and capacity investments that we've made to shorten delivery lead times, and this has reduced naturally our customers' need to place long-dated orders And certainly when we take a look at our backlog, it increased some 26% year to date and this certainly gives us confidence that this market remains strong.","Margins at 14% were up 230 basis points, so we continue to see the benefits of restructuring efforts here as well as leverage from the higher volume. However, I would note as we discussed on prior calls, we continue to experience challenges as we ramp up production to support the strong growth levels and most of the challenges are coming from the supply base which has really struggled to keep pace with the higher demand.","Next, our Aerospace business is listed on page 10. Sales were up 6%, all organic. The sales growth was driven by strong activity in military OE across all segments, biz jets and commercial aftermarket. Orders were even stronger, up 18%, with strength in both military and commercial aftermarket, business jet, military fighters and military rotorcraft. Our backlog also remains strong and is up 13% over prior year. And lastly, operating margins were once again very strong, 19.4% and up 90 basis points over prior year.","Turning to page 11, our Vehicle business had another strong quarter. Sales increased 6%. Organic revenues were actually up 11% and the divestiture impact of the joint venture that we formed with Cummins was a negative 5%.","NAFTA heavy duty truck production was up 15% in Q2 following more than 40% in Q1. So this market continues to be very strong. We continue to expect NAFTA heavy duty truck production to be at 295,000 units for 2018 which implies a modest growth in the second half of the year on more difficult comps.","And I'd also note that the industry is seeing a few supplier challenges that will likely limit second half production but pushing production into 2019. And in the automotive markets, both Europe and China are stronger than we originally anticipated and the U.S. market is really coming in about on expectations. So really broad strength in our Vehicle business.","I'd also note that the Eaton Cummins joint venture is doing well. Revenues grew to $141 million in the quarter, so very strong growth in our joint venture. And margins were at 18.5%, up 180 basis points from prior year on strong revenue.","And finally, results in our eMobility segment are shown on slide 12. Sales in the quarter were up 15%, 14% organic, and having just formed the business in Q1, we're pleased to announce that we have in fact won our first high voltage converter order, one of the key products that we've just begun selling into the electrical vehicle market. And our pipeline of opportunities perhaps more importantly is 2X what it was in Q1, so we continue to see tremendous growth in the opportunities that we're having an opportunity to quote on for customers.","Margins were 16.9%, down 120 basis points reflecting really the additional R&D investment but very much in line with our expectations.","On page 13, we've updated our organic growth outlook for 2018. Our end markets continue to grow above our original expectations in a number of our businesses and so we're increasing our full-year organic growth estimate from 5% to 6%. The continued strength in orders from Electrical Systems & Services has led to an acceleration of organic growth and we're now forecasting growth of 6%. We're also increasing the organic growth outlook for our Aerospace business to 6% on strength in both military and commercial markets. And finally, our Vehicle business continues to perform at a high level and we're increasing our organic growth guidance to 6% for the full year as well. You'll also recall that we increased our Vehicle segment organic growth estimate following a strong Q1 as well.","Overall, a 1% change for Eaton and this is on top of the 1% increase that we provided as a part of our Q1 guidance.","Moving to page 14, we'd like to provide just a bit of perspective on where we think our businesses are in the economic cycle and why we think conditions are setting up well for the second half 2018 and really going into 2019.","Now, as this chart demonstrates, we think that our end markets are currently \u2013 where our end markets are currently at in terms of the economic cycle. As you can see, most of our end markets are in the early to mid-growth stage, which we think bodes well for continued market growth. The majority of Eaton's revenue comes from businesses that are in the early to mid part of the growth cycle, and this includes many of our larger businesses like long-cycle Electrical Systems & Services segment.","So overall, we think our businesses will continue to have a market tailwind for some time to come, and we would expect to, as well, grow faster than our end markets.","On page 15, we provide an update on our thoughts regarding raw material inflation as well as the estimated impact from tariffs.","As we communicated at the beginning of the year, we continue to execute on our strategy of offsetting raw material and logistics cost inflation with price and cost out actions. We moved quickly with pricing actions in the first half of 2018, and as a result, we expect no negative EPS impact in 2018 from additional commodity inflation.","With regard to tariffs, we think there will be a very modest cost impact for our businesses overall, some $65 million. But we also fully expect to mitigate this increase through actions that are currently underway or will shortly be implemented in our businesses.","So I won't go through the tariff details in a lot of detail, but I would emphasize kind of the two main points. And one, our long-term strategy has been and continues to be to manufacture in the same zone in which we sell, and this certainly reduces the tariff impact on Eaton. And secondly, we're committed to move swiftly to take pricing actions to offset any tariff impact that we do see in our businesses.","Moving to margin guidance on slide 16, we're increasing margins for three of our segments where we're seeing stronger than expected organic growth and solid performance. These include Electrical Systems & Services, up 20 basis points; Aerospace, up 30 basis points; and Vehicle up 50 basis points. We are lowering our guidance for Hydraulics to a range of 13.7% to 14.3%, which is a 50 basis points reduction at the midpoint. This is in response to supply chain challenges and inefficiencies as volume continues to grow at these strong paces. And our full-year margin guidance remains in the range of 16.4% to 17% and really places us on a solid trajectory to achieve our 17% to 18% margin targets that we set for 2020.","And finally on page 17, we provide a summary of our Q3 and 2018 guidance. For Q3, we expect EPS of between $1.35 and $1.45, and this assumes 7% organic growth. We expect margins to be 16.9% to 17.3%, and a tax rate of 13% to 14%.","For the full year 2018, we are again increasing our full-year EPS guidance to a range of $5.20 to $5.40, which is a 10% increase at the midpoint. Organic revenue growth is now expected to be up 6% versus 5% previously. Foreign exchange is now expected to be only a $50 million positive which is down from the $200 million that we had in our prior estimate.","Segment margins will be in the 16.4% to 17%, as earlier noted. No change in our cash flow or free cash flow guidance, and corporate expenses, tax rate, CapEx share repurchase assumptions all remain unchanged from prior guidance.","So just before I hand it back to Don, I did want to once again take this opportunity to summarize why we think Eaton is an attractive investment opportunity. As you can see, and we talked about, our markets have returned to growth. The next few years will be much better than the last few.","In addition, we have a number of really attractive organic growth initiatives that we think will allow us to continue to grow faster than our end markets. And our restructuring is paying off. Our 2018 margins will be at an all-time high, and we have plenty of room to continue to improve them. Our balance sheet is in great shape. Net debt-to-capital is at 30%, and our pension plan is now 96% funded. Our cash flow continues to be strong, and we expect to consistently deliver free cash flow at or above 100% of net income while generating some $8 billion of free cash flow over the next three years.","We're also returning cash to shareholders through a high dividend yield, 3.3% today, and buying back shares 1% to 2% on an ongoing basis. And lastly, as we committed, we'll deliver 11% to 12% EPS growth over the next three years, and so we think once again solid performance this quarter, a positive outlook, and we think a really compelling story for investing in Eaton.","So with that, I'll stop and turn it back to Don for Q&A.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Okay. Our operator's going to provide guidance on participating in the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Before we jump into the Q&A, we do see we have a number of people on the call and we also have a number of calls going on simultaneously to this time so I want to be very sensitive to the timing of that. So if we would please limit yourself to a call and a follow-up call. And with that, our first question comes \u2013 question and follow-up question, excuse me. And our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. Great momentum. I think one interesting question given that you guys report a little later than others is what you're seeing in July. I'd say it's somewhat implicit in your Q3 guidance obviously, but was there some element of pre-buying or other activity in June as people were looking at tariffs? And did you see any let-up in July?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I think the short answer to the question, Jeff, is no. We really did not see any pre-buy of any measure, and what we've seen to date in July is very much consistent with the patterns that we've been seeing. So absolutely everything that we've forecasted in the outlook for the company is very much consistent with the way the businesses have been performing.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Right. And then just to be clear on price-cost, what you're saying is kind of underlying price-cost, you're caught up or have visibility on being caught up but there's still actions that need to be taken on tariffs? Can you clarify that?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","There's still a fair amount of uncertainty as it relates to the implementation of 301. And so what I would tell you is what we know about to date and what has been announced to date we have very much either announced or implemented plans to offset that impact.","There's a lot of uncertainty as you think about the step 2, step 3 of 301 and what actually happens that obviously we don't have visibility into, and those actions, if they are implemented as speculated, then we would have to take additional actions down the road. But everything that we've seen to date and everything that's been announced to date is very much already baked into our guidance and plans are very much already implemented or in the phase of being implemented.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks. I'll hold it to two and pass the baton.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Morning.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So organic bookings in ESS, obviously really good to see the progress that you're seeing there and finally seeing some of that growth materialize. Craig, my first question is maybe touch on what you're seeing from like a leading indicator perspective on the data center stuff, the industrial projects, and how you feel about that business on the go forward.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, and I appreciate your question. Certainly the few big businesses that are inside of Electrical Systems & Services would include our power distribution and controls assemblies, our commercial distribution assemblies our power quality business and also Crouse-Hinds. And I'd say in all four of those very large businesses, we are seeing very strong order growth across the business.","And so all four of those businesses are performing well. We talked about the fact that the backlog is up from 15%, and we saw strong orders, and those are the four businesses that are essentially driving the growth. And so very much as we anticipated for our Electrical Systems & Services business, perhaps even a little ahead of schedule, those businesses are late cycle businesses but are ramping right now and we expect to continue to perform for some time to come.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great to hear. And then my second question maybe following up on Jeff's trade tariff question and more broadly on cost inflation. When you think about the different segments and your ability to offset cost inflation across the segments, where are you finding it the easiest or are you finding it difficult in some of your segments? Basically a question around pricing power and your ability to offset.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Sure. Again, and I'd say it's pretty much no different this cycle than it is any cycle. And to the extent that we're selling through distribution, distribution always tends to be a little easier. Price increases are good for our distributors, and they have the ability to pass it forward into the marketplace relatively easier.","It's always more challenging with the big OEMs, but I would tell you that our plan's to pass it forward every place including in those places that have historically been a little bit more challenging. But I just think more generally speaking, distribution tends to be a bit easier than large OEMs, but we're not differentiating between the two. We're passing price increases equally through to all of our customers.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.","Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Morning.","Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC","The positive benefit of putting up these kind of numbers is you're kicking off a lot of cash. And we've seen some of your peers have a fairly active M&A pipeline and some direct comp, some not. But what do you think as far as priorities are concerned? With the amount of cash you're kicking off, it almost doesn't feel like buybacks can really keep up to the \u2013 can almost not keep up to the growth. But is M&A something that think will come back this year?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","As we've stated in prior quarters, having paid down the last tranche of debt associated with the Cooper acquisition, the company is certainly in a position today both from an organizational capacity standpoint and from a cash standpoint that we have the ability today to re-enter the M&A market.","And today I can tell you that we are looking at more opportunities than we have in quite some time. But having said that, we'll be disciplined as we think about how we value and price these transactions. We talk about a cost of capital of being 8% to 9% and saying we want a minimum of 300 basis points over our cost of capital. So we intend to be disciplined as we look at these opportunities.","But having said that, we will not allow cash to build up on the balance sheet. To the extent that we're not able to land acquisitions, which we would hope to do, we'll certainly look for other ways of returning cash to shareholders.","Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC","Fair enough. And then as a follow-up, in the Lighting business, you mentioned a return to growth in the back half of the year. Is that \u2013 is there also a sense of price stability that you're finally seeing in that market explicitly?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I would say that as we talk about our own Lighting business and our own strategy with respect to Lighting is that we have made a decision to be perhaps more selective than others around business that we're chasing, and we made some adjustments in terms of where we focus our efforts. And I can tell you that as we think about the segments of the markets where we think are attractive and the places that we want to play, you generally see better pricing power, better pricing stability.","I can't say if you think about the entire market at the low end of the market that that dynamic has changed dramatically. But the places that we anticipate playing and the places where we think we have an opportunity to sell differentiated value-added solutions, we do have a lot better pricing power in those markets.","Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC","Okay. Sounds good. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","So you called out data center as a strong end market, which shouldn't be a huge surprise, but I think it's the first time you've really specifically called data center end market strength.","So I'm wondering is this pretty broad across geographies, or is it one of two super-sized data centers that you're starting to see coming through?","And then just thinking about the ESS margins and we're starting to tilt now towards larger projects. Do you think that mix becomes a headwind as we go into the second half of the year, maybe 2019?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I'd say to your first question around data centers and to your point, Nigel, it's one of the big secular trends that we certainly think bodes well for Eaton and will help generate long-term growth for our company. And it is broad. We're seeing growth in the data center markets really around the world, and as you move to hyperscale and colos and as the world just generates more and more data, we think that trend will continue for some time and will continue broadly.","To your other question around margins, no, we don't anticipate that margins will be under pressure in this business, and I'd say quite frankly today if we take a look at where the industry sits today in electrical assemblies, for the most part, we have capacity constraints. Some of the demand that we're seeing today in our business is really pressing us and others to really deal with a lot of volume that we're looking at, and we're certainly looking at potentially adding capacity to deal with some of this increased demand.","And so, no, I don't anticipate at all that margins will come under pressure and given the balance of capacity and demand, I think the market's in a great position today to actually get price.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thanks. And a quick follow-on.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","I just wanted to add one thing. We've seen a bigger \u2013 a larger proportion of complex large industrial type projects, and those tend to have higher margins. Inherently there are fewer people that can actually pursue projects of that nature. So that's another element to the margin outlook.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you. And then quickly on the EP, it looked like Lighting was down roughly 10% in the quarter. Maybe you can clarify that. But what was the impact on operating leverage. You obviously had very strong margins for EP, but if we look at ex Lighting margins how did that look?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I'm not sure of your math, but we know Lighting was down closer to 4% in the quarter, not 10%. But I'd say that today I could just tell you that it's better. I mean, we've not given specific margin numbers for our Lighting business, and I would just tell you that the margins in Lighting are certainly below, well below the average for the Electrical Products segment.","And so they certainly have a negative impact on the overall margins for the segment. But inside of that, we have a fairly large Lighting business and still posted 18.5% margins in Electrical Products which I think is a real testament to the strength of the franchise.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with the Deutsche Bank.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So I guess I want to start on ESS. If we look back into history since the Cooper acquisition, we've never really seen a real ESS recovery. So I guess if you could give us an idea of how order growth translates to revenue growth. Because it seems to me from the past three quarters that an acceleration in revenue growth could be in the cards.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, no, that would be our expectation as well, and if you think about it today, what's in the backlog \u2013 typically I'd say what's in the backlog, most of that becomes consumed within the next 12 to 15 months, probably 75% to 80% of it.","And so it is a longer lead time business from project to delivery, but it's not two years out or 18 months out. It's much nearer term than that. And so we do anticipate that the strong orders that we're seeing in our Electrical Systems & Services business convert in a relatively short period of time into higher revenue growth.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thanks, Craig. That's helpful. And maybe just one on Aerospace. Orders were also really, really strong there this quarter. I know that's a business that tends to see a lot of lumpiness. So if you could just frame the strength a little bit, where the growth was the strongest, and what your expectations are for the next several quarters.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I appreciate your comment too. It is a place where orders tend to be a bit lumpy. But we really did see, I'd say, in this quarter with respect to orders, pretty broad strength. A lot of that came out of military markets. Certainly pretty broad across all segments of military, and so you're seeing some of the increase in the U.S. federal spending come through in fleet readiness and dealing with some of the historical underspending perhaps in our military.","But also we saw very strong strength in aftermarket. Both military and commercial aftermarket were both up strongly, and that's revenue passenger kilometers, people keep getting on planes flying and that's translating into higher aftermarket growth as well.","So I'd say it's been a fairly broad-based strength. The one place you'd look at the biggest segment which is commercial transport, you have very strong numbers being posted by Boeing, Airbus a little less so, but we think Boeing \u2013 if Airbus, excuse me, delivers their second half of the year, there's probably more strength there as well.","And, so we think it's a pretty broad-based increase in our Aerospace business, and as you know, these big commercial OEs are sitting on record backlogs that are growing every day. So it was a very successful Paris Air Show where both companies booked very strong orders, and so we really think the aerospace industry is really set up for growth for an extended period of time.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Craig.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning, all.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Morning.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, so I just wanted to go back to Scott's question on the M&A front. Craig, you talked about kind of the usual 8% to 9% cost of capital plus 300 basis points over that that you're looking for. Just what kind of timeframe are you thinking about that you want to achieve those things? Given the step-up in M&A activity across a lot of your segments, I'm just trying to get a sense for the kind of competitive positioning that you have there.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Typically if you look at how our past acquisitions have done, we typically start a little bit below that 300 basis points over the cost of capital, but then we end up by year three or so at the cost of capital and then above that as you get past year three. So that's as you work the synergies into the equation.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","But your discipline commentary means that you're not willing to see that stretch out these days because I think we are seeing that stretch out for a lot of M&A.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Well, we are \u2013 we have always said we're cash on cash buyers. We look at the cash we put out and the cash that comes in, and the time value of money makes a difference. And so all of that goes into our thinking, and I think what Craig was trying to communicate is we will remain disciplined. If we believe there are significant synergies that are truly actuable, then that'll factor into our numbers. But we also, with all the experience we've had, we know that it sometimes takes longer than you think to generate them.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","And it's always a matter of what the alternatives are as well. So we'll always look at as we think about discretionary cash, and the acquisitions will compete like everything else against other options for other investments that have also very strong returns. And I'd say we have a number of, whether it's organic growth or other ways of improving the effectiveness of the business, we have plenty of other opportunities we think to deploy cash in value creating ways.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And Craig, can you just comment a little more on that Hydraulics order rate in EMEA? I know it's capacity investment to reduce lead time such, but between that and some of the other supply based commentary, just wanted to get a sense of the organization's ability to keep up with demand across your network.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, and I would say we are in fact seeing improvement. So we don't want to overplay that. We're seeing improvement in our ability; we're seeing improvement in the supply base. But having said that, it's come slower than what we anticipated.","With respect to the orders in Europe, and what we do is when we take a look at our orders internally, we take a look at when orders are due, and we look at things due within the next three months, due within the next six months, due within the next six to 12 months. And what we've seen in Europe specifically is a significant reduction in orders that are basically the long lead-time orders. And we think while it doesn't show up favorably on our orders chart, that's really a confirmation and a testament to the fact that we're getting better operationally in delivering. We've made big investments in new capacity, and so our customers today are actually placing orders that are more close to what the real demand is.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","And if I could just add a couple of nuances to that. If you look in Europe, orders that we had in the second quarter due within three months, were actually up. Orders due past three months were down more than 50%. So we believe that that's because you no longer have to put these capacity reserving orders in. We simply have capacity. And we've added more than 10% capacity in our very large conveyance facility in Europe.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Makes a lot of sense.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","And we think the end markets continue to be strong. You obviously have seen a number of the companies in this space report, and at this point we think those markets continue to perform very well, and the underlying demand we think is still very strong.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Makes sense. Thanks. Good luck.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning. Because we've had multiple companies reporting this morning, I'm going to ask you a simple math question. You've taken up your organic growth outlook, but you've maintained your margin guidance. So what is your revised incremental profit outlook versus the 40% you had guided to?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","The way I would think about really kind of maintaining the margin range is that we provide a range because essentially it gives us a fair amount of ability to move within that. And so I would not read or overread much into the fact that we haven't changed the range. Certainly our expectations are to be within that range and certainly the midpoint can move one way or another depending upon what your assumptions are.","So I would say with respect to the fact that we didn't change the margin guidance, I would not overread that. There is in fact a fair amount of uncertainty around the second half of the year, and I think more than anything, the fact that we didn't move that is a reflection of the uncertainty that we see in the marketplace with respect to trade and other variables that it's really difficult to predict and control which way it's going to head.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. But you were confident enough given your backlog in your orders to raise the organic growth outlook. Is that the way we should read that?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Exactly. It's exactly right. The backlog, as we talked about in a number of our businesses, whether it's Aerospace or Hydraulics or Electrical Systems & Services, the ones that build big backlogs continue to ramp, and so we think the backlog certainly provides a lot of confidence in our ability to continue to grow.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Just on your early-stage growth, mid-stage, and late-stage, I wonder if you could give us more color on why you think that U.S. not-residential construction is only in mid stage. I mean, we've been expanding for eight years. It certainly feels like we're not going to fall off a cliff in the near term, but it certainly feels like we're in the later stages of expansion in U.S. non-residential construction. So if you could clarify that, I'd appreciate it.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","I guess I'd cite three things, Ann. First of all the expansion we've seen in non-resi thus far in this cycle has been quite modest, much more modest than you typically see in expansion cycles. So that's point one.","Point two, if you look at this growth in oil and gas spending, typically oil and gas spending flows into a variety of non-residential categories, and we think that you will see that occur again this time just as you've seen in the past sometimes it'd flow downward when oil and gas activity goes down. But now we're, in our view, pretty clearly in an up cycle in the oil and gas markets.","And then thirdly if you look at more minutely at the Dodge contract data, it is signaling that you are going to see acceleration as you get to the back half of this year and into 2019. And so those are the three elements that give us confidence that you're going to see some pretty good conditions in non-residential construction.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And any of the subsegments within non-residential you'd expect more acceleration or less acceleration? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","I think you're going to see more acceleration in what I would call the heavier, the industrial, the oil and gas related type activities. Obviously you're also seeing it in things like data centers.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. So a lot of discussion on supply chain. It seems like you've kind of alleviated some bottlenecks in Hydraulics yourselves. Just maybe talk about any signs of supply chain improving within Hydraulics and truck as we move through, and then conversely, any other businesses where you see it becoming a bigger problem. Thanks.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I'd say that we are in fact seeing signs of improvement both in Hydraulics and in truck. And you've obviously, Jeff, have heard what others in the space have said around some of these specific bottlenecks in truck and how those things are finding a way of working theirselves through.","But I'd say typically in a lot of these industries, you could be six months away from, in the worst case from a demand signal that says something is changing to the ability to flow all that demand back to the supply chain base. And so we obviously have seen both of these markets really ramping over the last 18 months, and we have been chasing it for 18 months. But I think today, we're on top of it and we have a much better sense for where these markets are going.","So in simple terms, I'd say we have seen signs of improvement everyplace. We are getting better. Our suppliers are getting better. We're doing a much better job of shortening lead times, and we talked about that a little bit in our Hydraulics business in Europe which is giving our customers confidence.","But at this point I'd say that we certainly \u2013 it took us longer to get here than we'd hoped, and that's why we're experiencing some of these inefficiencies. So I'd say overall I think things should be better going forward.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just in EPG, it seems like Lighting has been clouding the growth rates for some time, and think your pointing to a little bit of growth in the second half. Just looking at the other businesses, is there opportunity to see some growth acceleration in EPG just as the Lighting comps get easier? Thanks.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. I think the Lighting comps get easier and I think our own business in Lighting actually has a better second half of the year. You saw the acceleration in EPG when you compare Q1 to Q2, and we would anticipate as you go into the back half of the year, that Lighting performs, relatively speaking, better. Somebody said easier comps, but the business, underlying business performs better and as a result, EPG performs better.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","And remember, Jeff, you still have a fair number, a fair amount of industrial components in EPG in the Products segment and in those parts of that business are going to benefit of course by growth in the commercial and industrial assembly businesses as well as just oil and gas activity.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of quick follow-ups. It feels to me like you guys actually ought to have pretty good visibility into 2019 when you look at some of this data center stuff we've talked about, ESS orders, Aerospace, some of the truck stuff that got pushed out. Can you just give us a sense of how you're feeling about your visibility into 2019 relative to, say, a year ago?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Well, I mean, certainly much better than a year ago. And as you've noted, a lot of the long cycle businesses that we anticipated to turn positive have turned positive. And so we certainly feel much better about our visibility into 2019 today than we did even three months ago.","But having said that, in terms of guidance specifically for 2019, we think our markets grow. And we don't think that we're at the top of the cycle in many of our businesses. There's certainly a few extraordinary events in 2018 that are pushing markets up, but we think when you look at in terms of a long-term trend, we think many of our businesses, as we talked about in the context of where they are in the cycle, are either at the early point or the middle part of the cycle. And we continue to see growth into 2019.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just to go back on Lighting for a second, it's nice to see that sort of stabilizing. But as you mentioned, it still sort of mixes your margin down. And I'm just curious if you've changed the way you think about Lighting as kind of a core business of Eaton going forward and is there any chance to perhaps find another way to kind of deal with that going forward.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, we're focusing on winning in the marketplace. We have made a slight adjustment to our strategy for Lighting in terms of how we think about kind of some of the more commoditized piece of the space, but other than that, no change at all in our strategy with respect to Lighting.","We think it's got a lot of great underlying technology. It is very complementary with what we do in the rest of our Electrical business, and so no change in strategic direction.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","And do you have a way to improve margins going forward?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. Part of the things that we're doing to improve margins is, as we talked about, where we focus and how we decide to participate or not in some of the more commoditized parts of the business. So there is that element of it. In our Lighting business, no different than the rest of our organization, we have undertaken a number of restructuring initiatives to get at some fixed costs and structural costs, and we'll continue to invest in the high end of Lighting in the area of controls and connected Lighting, and that segment of the market tends to have more attractive margins.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Morning.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, for Rick, like to get some more color regarding the working capital dynamics you touched on. Not surprised to see some working capital build with the increased order levels, but maybe some color on the pre-buy on the inventory ahead of the tariff noise and maybe you could size that for us.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I think a simple way to think about it, Deane, and maybe to put it into context is that if you looked at our classic working capital at the end of June, namely receivables inventory less payables, and you compared \u2013 that number was about $4.7 billion, and if you compare that to our annualized sales in Q2, our working capital as a percentage of sales was 21.2%.","For most of the last couple of years, it's been between 19% to 20%. And the reason it's higher is exactly as you say. The growth in sales, particularly in some of these longer cycle project type businesses, caused receivables to increase. But we also both positioned inventory for the continued sales growth but also took some positions in order to forestall having to pay higher prices.","And the kind of numbers you're talking about in inventory increase are in the order of $100 million-ish kind of dollars, and so \u2013 but if you run through the math of 21.2% compared to 19% to 20% on average, you'll see that we definitely have opportunity to bring the working capital levels down as the year progresses.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's real helpful. And then as a follow-up, I don't think I've heard data centers get called out so many times in a positive way in quite a while. So just want to circle back on this one. Is there any share gains in the quarter? And then maybe just, if you could, Craig, touch on the approach to servicing the hyperscale customer. They require a completely different set of architecture, hot switchovers and so forth. So what's working well in serving that part of the market?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, and I think to your point, quite frankly 2017 was a little bit of a surprise and a disappointment in terms of what happened in data centers given the underlying demand and the underlying growth in data generation and data consumption. So there's probably a little bit of catchup taking place this year in the market, but the long-term growth trends for data generation, I mean, it's growing at more than a 20% compounded rate a year, and so we think the long-term growth rate in data centers and hyperscale continues to be very, very positive.","I'd say that, to your point around a lot of the big hyperscale data center companies, they all have very unique architecture around the way they protect their data centers and the way they configure their data centers, and they will sometimes go through periods where they'll take a pause and they'll rethink the way their data centers are laid out. And so I think you'll find that some of that took place during the course of 2017, and there's perhaps new configurations that are coming out there today. But we're seeing very strong demand across all of the major players and data centers as they really build out their capability for this underlying growth in the market.","We do think we're taking some market share, but always difficult to tell for certain exactly where this is going to end up. But we, as a company, are very well positioned in terms of our global footprint, certainly in the UPS space but more importantly in the switchgear space. Our company is very well positioned. We have a very strong reputation with all the data center companies, and we think it's a place where we're going to continue to grow for some time to come.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great color. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. I guess we'll move on to Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. Excuse me. Question around the implied Q4 organic expectations. I'm backing into a deceleration of somewhere in the 2% to 4% range, but I know this can get thrown off by rounding in Q4 2017 comps. Can you comment on what's included in the current guidance for Q4?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Well \u2013 go ahead. You want to take it?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","I was going to say, Andy, if you just look at the full-year guidance we've given and the third quarter guidance, you would see that the rate of growth on higher comps will not be quite as high in Q4. That's our expectation at the present time. Now normally, as you know, you do have sometimes a seasonal impact in Q4. We'll just have to see whether that seasonal impact occurs this year given how strong the underlying markets are.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So thank you, Rick. I should just look at that as kind of a placeholder given all the uncertainty?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. My first question would just be around the backlog. You called it out a lot more in this call and in the slides than prior calls. Classically I guess your backlog is worth less than one quarter's worth of sales. I think it was about $5.2 billion at the end of March against sales in Q2 of $5.5 billion.","So I guess within ESS, Hydraulics, and Aerospace specifically where you call out the backlog, give us some idea of how much visibility you have in those three businesses in terms of that backlog, please.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","I can take a stab at it. First of all, there are various businesses like Vehicle where we don't have backlogs or at least we don't regard them as stable, so we don't report them. So you need to factor that in.","But in general, if you look at our businesses and you look at backlogs over the ensuing 12 months, the backlogs, particularly in project businesses, can be 30% to 40% of the next 12 months. In a case like Aerospace, the backlog will be really high. I can't give you a precise number. And the reason is that the orders are placed well in advance. And so it's a mixed bag.","In Vehicle, we typically say we don't have backlogs. We do sort of have a general idea, but we don't have specific back logs. In Aerospace, it's very highly locked in. In larger project businesses it's probably 30% to 40%. And then in Electrical Products, it tends to be much more of a flow type business. So the backlogs are much lower coverage of the next 12 months' revenue.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","And Julian, I'd say the reason we probably put more emphasis on backlog this time than perhaps in prior calls is there's been a lot written and speculated about where we are in the economic cycle, and so we're also looking at this thing just to get a sense for, are we continuing to grow our backlog and build strength into the future, or are things moving in a different direction? And we come away from our own assessment of the backlog and the fact that we're growing backlog in most of our businesses very positive around the outlook for the second half and 2019.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for that color. It's very helpful. Maybe following up, Rick, you touched on Vehicle where the concept of a backlog is not particularly useful. So maybe just flesh out a little bit the guidance for Vehicle. You grew low-double digits in the first half. The growth for the year is I think penciled in at about 6% organically. Maybe give us any help on how you're thinking about truck in Brazil and North America versus light vehicle in terms of your second half growth rates.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Well, you can see with the full-year guidance we've given for Vehicle that the growth rate in the back half of the year will be less than in the front half of the year. A lot of that has to do with prior-year comparisons. It also has to deal with some constraints on production that we're seeing in various parts of the market.","So as I think Craig mentioned, you saw very strong Class 8 growth in the first half of the year. It won't be as strong in the second half of the year. So those are some of the factors. But all, if you step back and look at the underlying direction of the vehicle markets, we see continued good growth in Class 8 in NAFTA. We see continued strength in the South American markets and broadly the automotive markets have performed a little bit better than we thought this year with growth in Europe and APAC and a little bit of a decline in the U.S. as expected. So we feel pretty good about the underlying tonality of the vehicle market.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with B of A.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in. Just a question on Hydraulics. Our channel checks indicated that on longer lead items I think lead times went up from months to over a year. And I'm just wondering now that your capacity has caught up, how long will it take to sort of adjust things in the channel? And I guess what I'm concerned about, are we going to see multiple quarters of negative orders or significant sort of volatility in growth rates? How long will it take to clear it through the system?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, that's a little bit of a difficult question to speculate on, Andrew. We certainly appreciate why you're asking it. I'd say for the most part, I'd say these changes take place relatively quickly, and as evidenced by what happened in our own business in Europe where a lot of the long lead time orders, the placeholders, if you will, that are put out six months to nine months out where people are just trying to hold a slot, those orders are relatively very quickly adjusted and changed.","And so I don't anticipate that it's going to take very much time at all for those adjustments to be made in the ordering pattern, whether it's through our OEMs where you see it more strongly or with distribution. So I think it's a relatively short adjustment.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. And then just a follow-up question on Aerospace. One of the themes at Farnborough I think was somebody described it as this bear hug from Boeing where Boeing is basically going to supply chain, asking for significant price concessions, asking for share of MRO business particularly to participate on NMA or 777X.","Can you sort of comment on what you guys are experiencing and how should we think about the profitability of the aerospace business long-term given Boeing's demands?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I'd say we've learned to dance with the bear, I'd say. We have certainly been involved with both Boeing and Airbus, and the things that they're trying to do strategically. And I'd say that suffice it to say that we have very effective working relationships with both Boeing and Airbus. We understand what their objectives are, and we think that there's plenty of room for win-win solutions with both Boeing and Airbus, finding ways to continue to grow our business and participate more fully in what they do, and also be responsive to what their requirements are.","So we don't think that the initiatives that are taking place today inside of Airbus or Boeing, we don't think either one of those two will be problematic for our teams to manage in the course of business.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So no structural change of profitability going forward with the new contract structure?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","No, none whatsoever.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Fantastic. Thanks a lot.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our last question today comes from Mig Dobre. Looks like we had a little problem with the queue earlier, Mig. I'm going to turn it over to you for the last question of the day.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Can you hear me now?","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, perfect.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Perfect. So one last question on Lighting for me. One of your competitors mentioned that this might actually be one area that benefits from 301 tariffs. And I know that obviously you're not at the lower end of the market, but I'm wondering what your perspective is as to how industry dynamics might change here, and is it feasible to think that, broadly speaking, pressure on profitability sort of shifts and you actually get some tailwinds into 2019?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, no, and we certainly have looked at 301 in the context of that same issue and whether or not it should be a net benefit to our Lighting business. At this juncture I would say that it's too early. It's very possible that with tariffs being put on lighting products coming out of China and a lot of the low-end lighting coming from China that there is in fact a bit of tailwind and help for the market and the industry overall.","But I would just say the way we think about it today is it's just too early to judge whether it's going to play out that way, and it's not baked into our forecast that way, and if it turns out to be a net positive, it certainly would be a bit of upside for us.","Mircea Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","With that, we'll wrap up our call and question-and-answer today. As always, Chip and I will be available for any follow-up questions you might have afterward, and thank you very much for joining us today.","Operator","That does conclude your conference for today.

Welcome to the Eaton Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later we\u2019ll conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Don Bullock. Please go ahead.","Don Bullock","Good morning. I\u2019m Don Bullock, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. With me today are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO; Craig Arnold, President and COO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","Our agenda today will include opening remarks by Sandy, highlighting the performance in the fourth quarter along with our outlook for the 2016. As we\u2019ve done on our past calls, we\u2019ll take questions at the end of Sandy\u2019s comments.","The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we\u2019ll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. In addition a webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the Company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and our presentation. They are also outlined in the related 8-K filing.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sandy.","Sandy Cutler","Great, Don. Thanks very much and thank you all for joining this morning. I\u2019m going to work from the presentation that was posted at our investor portal earlier today, and for the sake of brevity, I'll start right on page three, the highlights of fourth quarter results. As you saw we exceeded the guidance we gave for our revenue guidance, we achieved record fourth quarter segment margins. We generated $742 million in operating cash flow and we repurchased $228 million our own shares. We think a very strong quarter in the midst of pretty choppy end markets and I think it concludes the year on strong basis.","If you flip to the second chart just a couple of the highlights in terms of the reconciliation to the midpoint of our guidance that we provided for the fourth quarter. You\u2019ll recall the mid-point of our guidance was $1.10. Our volume came in just slightly higher than we had guided to you, recall we had guided organic sales being down 3% from the third quarter, it actually came in at 2%. The net of our restructuring costs and our savings came in about $0.02 better, we got all the savings and more than we were looking for and we actually done at a little bit less costs. ","Our tax rate did come in a little bit lower about $0.02, that\u2019s 3.9% versus the roughly 5.5% we had guided to. And then our corporate expenses reflecting that same orientation towards really getting our structural costs down that you saw also manifest itself in our very strong segment performance contributed $0.02. So $0.07 peak [ph] for the quarter, a nice way to finish up the year.","If we turn to Page 5, just the overall financial numbers I am sure you had an opportunity to study these. I would just reference one numbers in particular here because it does tie in to a lot to our thinking relative to having increased our restructuring over the next couple of year. The organic growth number which you see in the green box to the lower left of the chart, down some 4%, it was down 3% last year. So, our last quarter, third quarter. So, again if you think through the year last year we actually started up with a first quarter that was slightly up and then the second, third and fourth quarter we've seen our markets weaken.","Just a quick run through the individual segments and we\u2019ll get on to the guidance for \u201916, which I think most of you are most interested in trying to get some additional color around. Let start with the electrical product segment that\u2019s on Page 6. ","As you can see organic growth was down 1%, it was actually flat in the third quarter. You can see very strong margin performance, 17.7% volume relationship to last year down 5%. And obviously C4X was four point of that. Looking in the bookings, booking were down 1% and it\u2019s interesting if you look around the world, quite different conditions by regions. Americas were flattish, Europe was up nicely, and Asia-Pacific both in this segment as well as in our system and services lateral segment down fairly higher. And we think that reflects the real weakness that\u2019s been going on in China and we'll talk a little bit more about that as we go on in the call.","Our net restructuring if you\u2019ll see slight positive to the quarter, a good solid quarter and as you get down within the individual area clearly we\u2019re continuing to see strengthen in our lighting products, our residential continues to be strong in U.S., Canada is weak, Middle East was quite strong which was one of the thing that helped Europe and across Asia Pacific whether it would be in China or whether it would be in some of the electronic products we supply as well, a weaker quarter. ","If we flip to Page 7. Electrical System and Services segment. We think a good quarter performance, a nice rebound from the third quarter if you look at the margins, up 13.9%. So one of the stronger quarters we've had this year in that segment. The story is much the same however in terms of the markets. If you look at the box in the lower hand corner again the organic sales down 5%, it was down 5% last quarter as well and the bookings being down 2%. The play out is fairly similar that the real week region was Asia-Pacific once again.","As we have talked over the last couple of years we off course see that the bookings over the last couple of quarters are a fairly good predictor of revenue levels in the next several quarters and so if you look back to the third quarter of 2015 our bookings were down some 3%, now they\u2019re down 2% and I think that will help you understand our thinking relative to markets when we talk about that and organic for 2016. ","If we move to the next page, page eight our Hydraulics Segment very strong margin performance here as well in spite of a very weak market conditions you may recall that in the third quarter we reported organic sales down 10%, during the fourth quarter they\u2019re down 12%. Our bookings down 22% and that's pretty much a worldwide story. I mean if you go around whether it would be the Americas or Asia-Pacific the numbers are all negative and they\u2019re negative also when we look at both the distributor and the OEM cuts. So these markets continue to be very weak and I think our team has done a really terrific job in terms of really containing cost and driving structural change and that's why you see we think it was stronger than most people expected margins and a segment of 11.2%.","If we move to the Chart 9, the Aerospace Segment. Great quarter for Aerospace business as its continuing to having really very-very strong margins. Our bookings were up 6% and we\u2019re particularly pleased in the aftermarket which you know is an area that we've been working hard to continue to bolster. It was up both on the commercial and the military side for an average about 14%. A lot of discussion over the last couple of weeks about what's happening in the commercial aerospace activity, we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about that when we talk about our guidance for next year, but we continue to see that outlook being strong as we move into 2016 and 2017. ","And if we move to Chart 10, our Vehicle segment. Really strong quarter performance from a margin perspective again and I know a number of you have had concerns that as this business begins to turn down that it would have a disproportionate impact upon our margins. I think you see here in the fourth quarter our operating plans and the great job our teams have been doing in structural cost out is really having a positive impact not only here on the fourth quarter but once again in our guidance for next year. NAFTA Class 8 shipments in fact were down in the fourth quarter, they were down 6% and -- but you see that the really 18.4%, the margins here in the quarter. As we look into next year we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about it in just a moment, but our forecast is that we\u2019ll see the NAFTA heavy duty market beyond the order of 250,000 units, that's down about 23% from this year. So that is fully incorporated in our planning for next year.","If we move to Chart 11, maybe just to kind of cap off 2015. We obviously saw organic growth be negative throughout this year, but in fact that we moved in the second quarter, this is a start to really driven structural cost reduction across the company, is why you\u2019re seeing the real benefits here in the fourth quarter and that obviously sets up a really important part of our operating plans for 2016. Segment margins were 15.2%, free cash flows slightly below our target of 100%. As we look at this year, we did repurchase a 2.4% of our shares outstanding that's about $682 million we spend on that during this year. We paid down $1 billion of debt this year and we have completed the Cooper integration and so really as we enter into this next year you\u2019ll see we virtually have no acquisition integration costs anticipated during 2016 as well.","2012 really -- just for your records really gives you the kind of breakout on how are restructuring plan laid out during 2015 and as I mentioned upfront our net benefits in the fourth quarter were better than we had laid out for you earlier and I think reflect the momentum we have with an overall restructuring program.","Page 13, titled 2015 Restructuring Cost and Benefit, really gave you a view of that full year activity more for your historical background as you think of our performance across the segments.","Now jump to Chart 14, as we start to talk about our thoughts about 2016. With the weaker markets that we had anticipated in October you may recall those number, I'll go back over them for you in a just a moment on a subsequent chart, we've now accelerated and in fact expanded our restructuring actions and as our view that a couple of you had commented on your write-ups this morning that 2016 and 2017 will remain somewhat challenged time periods in terms of end market growth and so our focus is getting the cost out and using our balance sheet to buy back shares and to really get the company in well positioned in what will be a period of lower growth then we had seen in previous years.","So what you see in that chart up top, we\u2019ve tried to lay out for your ease, here is our 2015 actuals, than our 2016 and 2017 costs and then the incremental benefits that occur in each year, it's incremental to the previous year and you can see the total. The big news here is that we\u2019ve expanded the program to a three year program, we\u2019re going to spend about $400 million, we\u2019ll get benefits of just over $400 million over this time period. ","And as you think about 2016 because I know that\u2019s of real interest to you, we\u2019ll spend about $70 million of that $140 million in the first quarter of this year. Above 50% of the balanced, so of the balance of the $70 million will be spend in the second quarter and then during the third quarter and fourth quarter the spending is fairly equal. The benefits however, not much of those incremental benefits of 185 occur in the first quarter because we\u2019re just kicking off this second phase of actions and it builds through the balance of the year. So it is a reasonable expectation that it has a bigger contribution to operating earnings per share in the third quarter and fourth quarter than it would have in the second quarter.","Let's jump to Chart 15. And I mentioned before our view of our markets and organic growth opportunities are lower than they were when we last discussed this with you in October. You recall that we haven\u2019t laid out a formal forecast, but we had shared with you some early thoughts on 2016 in our October earnings conference call and at that time we talked about organic revenues being down on the order of 1% to 2%. We now, with the benefit of the last several months and I think all weaker and after [ph] news, it\u2019s not only we but you also have been reading as well our detailed discussions with our customers around the world. We think a better expectation tuned up for that doubt is that our organic revenues would decline on the order of 2% to 4%. ","As you go through these individuals segments let me just give you a sense for what has changed. As you can see the rate on the chart our organic revenue growth projections for the individual five segments we report. For Electrical Products, we think the organic growth will be in the range of 0% to 2%. In Electrical Systems and Services, a negative 2% to negative 4%. In October we had said if you put those two together we thought the growth would be about 1%. In the Hydraulics areas we are now forecasting organic growth of negative 9% to negative 11%, in October we had said we thought it would be about negative 7%. In Aerospace we're saying 1% to 3% not that much as change, we thought it would be 3%. And in Vehicle we had thought it would be negative 5% in October, we now think it will be 7% to 9%.","So what are the big drivers here, let me start from a bottom where I ended with Vehicle. We now think the North American heavy duty market will decline to about 250,000 units that's the whole market for NAFTA down 23% from where we finished up just over 320,000 units in 2015. We think light vehicle markets in the U.S. are going to remain strong kind of flat to 1% up, we think China will continue to move along fairly well in terms of its light vehicle markets. We think Europe, we\u2019re in agreement with most of the consensus that\u2019s out there that its probably up on the order of something like 2% and we continue to feel that Latin America is a very troubled area and really when we talk about the vehicle market, we\u2019re talking really about Brazil and so those numbers will be down 10% to 15% this year. That\u2019s what brings us to our 7% and 9%. ","Within the hydraulics market I would say really a continuation of the negative expectations in terms of the world wide Ag equipment market and the construction equipment market and not much positive on the industrial side. Then I would say again 9% to 11% is our best approximation having talked to our customers and you've seen many of them release their own guidance for 2016. We think this is very much in line with our own projections. ","If you move to Chart 16. Titled Segment Operating Margin Expectations, I think it's really noteworthy that in the fourth quarter we increased our operating margins in spite of negative organic growth and that is indeed exactly our plan again in 2016. In spite of about $1 billion volume decline and again that's about 600 million in organic growth and about 400 million from Forex, we expect to expand our segment margins. They finished at 15.2% last year and as you can see the midpoint of our guidance is 15.6%, so about 40 basis points expansion. We can obviously talk about each of these as we field your questions, but I would call your attention to Vehicle because I know many of you are concerned in terms of looking at the year of 2016 is that we would see a several hundred point contraction in vehicle margins as the overall market place began to decline and as you can see we\u2019re confident with our operating plan and the benefit of all the restructuring we\u2019re doing and the fine jobs been done by our team there that we\u2019re going to hold very attractive margins in that segment. And I think it\u2019s really a key element in terms of thinking about the evaluation of [indiscernible] because this is one that you\u2019ve been concerned about historically from a volatility point of view.","If we turn to Chart 17, labeled our Multiyear Share Purchase Program. You\u2019ll recall in July we laid out our new capital plan which outlined on an annual basis repurchasing 1% to 2% of our outstanding shares per year. We paid of this last year as I mentioned about $1 billion of debt and we repurchased $682 million or about 2.4% of our outstanding shares and we have commented through the fall that in this period of time where we're seeing such weakness in equity pricing and specifically on our own that we were tilting our balanced plan that we had of spending about 50% on the share repurchase and about 50% on acquisitions that we were tilting it towards buying back more of our shares. And what we\u2019re announcing today obviously is that we\u2019re targeting a $3 billion share repurchase program and those are for the years 2015 through 2018 and so what that means was also having purchased back obviously 682 million last year this is about $2.3 billion of purchases over these next three years about 10% of our outstanding share. That does move us a little closer to sort of an annual buyback that on the order of more like 2.5% versus 1.5%. ","Specifically in terms of 2016 and you\u2019ll recall that I just mentioned the numbers in 2015, we bought back 682 million, we would expect the buyback about that same levels this year, roughly $700 million. It will as it normally is for us be backend loaded in terms of how are cash flow lays out through the year. But it does play an important part in terms of how we offset a slightly higher tax rate and I'll talk about that in just a moment. You\u2019ll recall at yearend's 2015 our share count was 460.4 million shares and so we\u2019ll leave at you to kind of figure out backend loaded buying back about whether to pull out full shares, but we think its worth around about $0.09 of positive impact.","So if you move to Chart 18 to kind of pull this all together in terms of our EPS guidance for 2016, let's start with the first quarter. Our operating and fully diluted EPS this year is the same because we don\u2019t have acquisition integration across this year. We think our organic revenue compared to the fourth quarter so the actual numbers we just reported will come down about 5%, for those of you who are already calculating that means it\u2019s down about 8% from last year in the first quarter. The tax rate will be between 8% to 10% and the segment margin including the restructuring cost of the $70 million will be somewhere between 13.5% and 14%. That's what supports our $0.80 to $0.90 operating and fully diluted guidance for the first quarter. ","In terms of the full year again no acquisition to raise [ph] cost so the $4.15 to $4.45 with the midpoint of obviously $4.30. The guidance does include the full net restructuring benefit that we outlined for you that\u2019s on the previous charts of $174 million that's a year-to-year benefit from our restructuring. And the $45 million from the Cooper integration savings which is primarily the full year benefit of the plant closings that we were concluding in the back half of last year. ","So the operating EPS and I think this is really the best way to think about our operating plan. We\u2019ll have flat operating EPS year-to-year, will actually be up 2% in terms of fully diluted. So we don\u2019t have acquisition integration charges. But that flat operating EPS year-to-year really incorporates having revenues down $1 billion, $600 million of organic, $400 million of FX, margin\u2019s up 40 basis points, driven by all the restructuring work that we got a good head start on by starting early in 2015 and then the share repurchases of approximately 700 million are basically going to offset the impact of what we anticipate is going to be an increase in the tax rate from roughly 8% last year to roughly 10% as the midpoint of our range this year.","So if you turn to Page 19. Just to recap again organic revenue down 2% to 4%. You\u2019ll recall we had a couple of very small acquisitions so we had a little positive in terms of $35 million in terms of additional revenue. 2% negative Forex, that\u2019s that $400 million top line impact that I mentioned negative. Operating margins with the 40 basis points expansion from last year. Corporate expenses continuing to reflect all of the work that we're doing to get our cost down not only in our operating units but across the corporation as well. Tax rate ticking up slightly from last year, I just mentioned the flat operating EPS and the 2% increase in net income per share. Operating cash flow 2.6 billion to 2.8 billion, free cash flow of 2.1 billion to 2.3 billion, obviously that looks like it's been as a cash conversion ratio of greater than 1 and yes that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re targeting. ","Then CapEx of about 525 million, I can understand some of you may have a question, gee that's pretty similar to what you spent last year, if your volumes are coming down, why are you spending as much CapEx? We do have some capital that is involved in all of this restructuring actions and that's really the difference to facilitate getting them done in areas where we may be closing and consolidating facilities.","So that\u2019s our outlook for 2016 and we think it's a tight plan. We obviously have had the benefit of looking very hard at these markets and we\u2019re really confident about the restructuring plan that we put together. And so that restructuring plan and our share buyback, very much in our own control and those are the kind of variables we\u2019re trying to control as we move into it into 2016.","Don with that I\u2019ll turn things back to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Don Bullock","Before we begin the Q&A session today, I do notice that we have a significant number of questions in the queue. So given our time constrain today of an hour for the call, and the desire to get to as many of these questions that you have as possible, I\u2019d ask that you limit your questions to a single question and a follow up. I appreciate your cooperate in advance. With that we\u2019ll open the questions with Scott Davis from Barclays.","Scott Davis","Sandy you only have I think four months left or so of your tenure and you\u2019ve seen a bunch of cycles and I\u2019d love to get your opinion on how does the world get better? I mean how do we -- back here, your bookings are getting less negative for sure, but how do we get back to positive growth, what\u2019s it going to take in your opinion at least from a world perspective to have a recovery insight?","Sandy Cutler","That\u2019s probably almost a [indiscernible] question. But I think clearly we\u2019ve got a couple of big issues going on and we\u2019re in a commodity cycle and it doesn\u2019t matter whether it be oil and gas, whether it be metals, whether it\u2019d be Ag, we\u2019ve seen as the world has slowed down it's not having a fairly profound effect on a lot of these commodities. This too will bottom we\u2019ve been -- lived through a bunch of these. It just our view that we\u2019re not going to see that end in \u201916, that\u2019s why we said that it's so important really to get -- to take these restructuring actions in \u201915 and \u201916.","Hard to forecast right now, Scott, whether that turn up is in \u201917 or whether that turn up is in \u201918, I think most forecasts have always proved to be wrong, but I think that the benefit of where we are right now, we\u2019re in the second year of this fairly deep commodity cycle. And as we pointed out in our earnings release, this is really only the second time that we have seen our end markets be negative in consecutive years and we got to go all the way back to the 2000-2001 time period; people were pretty mopey then and by 2002-2003 we popped back out of that. And so I think you will see this cycle come back out.","Scott Davis","And then Vehicle, I\u2019m one of the guys who\u2019ve been skeptical in margins and you\u2019ve proven us wrong here. Help us just understand, is this all a function of restructuring? Is there other benefits here, whether it\u2019d LIFO accounting or mix or something else?","Sandy Cutler","No change in accounting. This is just plain old hard way of running a business really well, and the teams have really been working hard on restructuring and making sure that new products we introduce have attractive value propositions and just I\u2019d say it's doing it the hard way.","Scott Davis","So, some of it is new products that are not [multiple speakers].","Sandy Cutler","But remember in the automotive business you tend to -- we have pretty good automotive and truck business. We have pretty good visibility forward wise in terms of what we win. So, I think we\u2019ve had another very good year of bookings in 2015 really on a global basis. And so we feel comfortable both on that revenue side of how we\u2019re doing with our customers. But I feel really good about the work that\u2019s been done in the business on all of the cost work.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan.","Ann Duignan","Good morning and thanks for the color on the Vehicle side and Hydraulics side. Sandy could you give us similar color regarding your subsectors in Electrical Products and Electrical Systems? What you\u2019re seeing in the different end markets?","Sandy Cutler","I think our comments probably aren\u2019t going to sound vastly different from many of our peers who have announced, we\u2019re looking at the residential market in the U.S. as being one that will continue to be a positive on the order of say 3% to 4% next year, non-res is probably the hardest one of all of those numbers to figure out particularly here in the U.S. there are so many different opinions on non-res we think much of what\u2019s been published is perhaps a little too bullish. We\u2019re more in the 3% to 5%. I know there is some people that are at 8%, gosh I hope they\u2019re right, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re basing our expectations on.","Utilities is a little better than we\u2019ve seen it the last couple of years, but it's still a 0% to 2%. Industrial is quite troubled still in terms of just not seeing a lot going through that, so that\u2019s probably a 0% to a negative number. As you get into harsh and hazardous applications that have large portions of oil and gas around them, those are numbers that are like negative 15 type number. And then when we look in the large power quality areas, I\u2019d say those markets are likely to be slightly negative again this next year.","Last comment I would say is that we just don\u2019t see the big large industrial construction numbers that are being so quantitatively [ph] reported in many of the government\u2019s statistics. We\u2019re out there bidding on them all and we aren\u2019t seeing what they\u2019re talking about. So that\u2019s our view as to how we look. We don\u2019t see Asia Pacific getting substantially stronger, we think still that\u2019s going to be weakened up by the lack of the big projects there. EMEA is coming back and I mentioned in the fourth quarter we saw pretty good tone there and again we\u2019re at a very low single-digit but it's better than a negative.","Ann Duignan","Thanks for the color Sandy. And just a quick follow up, you had mentioned previously that on the manufacturing side in the U.S. the downstream built up from oil and gas. But maybe you start to see orders in that business pickup towards the back assets this year for deliver in '17, is that still your expectations?","Sandy Cutler","The big natural gas and exploring terminals that we are committed [technical difficulty] to us like those are going ahead here in the second half, that\u2019s still our expectations. You are starting to see some of the big integrator are really clashing capital budgets again and that\u2019s why our view has been that you have a second year of a negative in the oil and gas industry broadly in this year. And once you start these big cycles it takes a couple of years for them to swing back.","Ann Duignan","Okay. Thank you, I leave it there and get back into queue. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein.","Steve Winoker","Maybe a little bit more on the margin front. So, given the ambitious margin expansion you've got set up for next year, the way I use to think about it with you was decrementals I think 20 to 30 normally, plus you got pricing here soon productivity kind of costs inflation. Could you give us -- or deflation -- give us a sense for some of the pieces of this, obviously with restructuring being the baggiest positive, but just help us work through how you\u2019re getting there?","Sandy Cutler","I think Steve the way is, as we have watched volumes come down as strongly as they have all the way through '15 and then '16. Those incrementals or decrementals are getting bigger because you\u2019re getting down to points where you really have big knee curves. And so our own thinking is it\u2019s probably a 35% at this point so that\u2019s how we sort look at the decrementals. It hasn\u2019t changed degree to yield for us in terms of Forex but those are more like 10% to 11% types numbers. And then the rest basically comes from the cost reductions that we\u2019re getting. And remember to add in the $45 million of the acquisition integration benefits into the two electrical segments.","Steve Winoker","Okay. And then the other pieces like pricing, what that in there?","Sandy Cutler","It's fairly neutrally, I would say our expectations is that we do expect some tailwinds this year and that\u2019s really because commodity prices have come off as hard as they have in the fourth quarter and January sure look that way all the numbers we can see, commodity didn\u2019t do much recovery in the month of January. So, I\u2019d say a slight tailwind from commodity on margins this year as well.","Steve Winoker","And just a follow up. That restructuring for the fourth quarter, I guess you did $2 million of costs and you saved about $10 million more versus planned. Was that all timing in those two line items on Page 12?","Sandy Cutler","No, I would say that the big issue is that we were able to complete that restructuring at a lower cost than we had thought it was going to take, it\u2019s wasn\u2019t that we pushed something out, it wasn't that we didn\u2019t take some action, it\u2019s just sort of the actual cost turned out to be less than we had thought it was going to originally take. ","Steve Winoker","Okay, okay thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell ","Just starting with Electrical Products. You are guiding for a reasonable margin development in 2016, but looking at the moving parts lighting probably outgrows the rest that\u2019s a mix drag, it often has been, could be very difficult. So, why do you -- is there something in the mix or is it purely restructuring that you think can give you that margin uplift in Electrical Product?","Sandy Cutler","Our [indiscernible] numbers is in Electrical Systems and Services. But I would say it's the restructuring and it\u2019s the benefits from the Cooper. So, remember those first two segments Electrical Product, Electoral S&S that have both the restructuring savings and then you'll have about $45 million to put between the two and it's likely to be pretty equal between the two this year the $45 million. ","Julian Mitchell","Understood. And then my follow up would be on Vehicle, not so much the margins but just the top-line. So, in Q4 you had a 6% organic decline, NAFTA Class 8 shipments were also down six. For 2016 you are saying that NAFTA Class 8 down over 20, but your organic sales guide for the year is only down high single-digit for vehicle. So, I guess what's changing in 2016 versus Q4 leaving aside Class 8?","Sandy Cutler","You get a little bit a seasonal here too as well. And remember in the fourth quarter you have a bit of what I will call second half December shutdowns that occurred. So, that\u2019s a piece of it, remember that North American part of that fall of actually occurred in the fourth quarter to. So, of the 23 we talked about reduction you had a 6 points fall off from a year ago occur in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re talking about full year 23. But I think it's more seasonal and Craig any other color on that?","Craig Arnold","Obviously, you just need the metrics [ph] to tell, the 6 was the Delta from Q3. If you actually take look at North America classic truck, year-over-year it was down much more in line with what the forecast in 2016 and the North America Class 8 truck number is obviously an important number for the vehicle business but as Sandy went through that point one of the many segments that make up our vehicle business. And we continue to see around the world pretty robust numbers in growth in our automotive markets around the world, and so just one piece of the equation.","And then the other piece as we start to anniversary some of the really weak numbers that we\u2019ve seen in South America which is the biggest piece of our Vehicle business or Company's exposure in South America and Brazil, those comparatives just get much easier.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Evelyn Chan","Good morning. This is actually Evelyn Chan for Joe. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to touch on capital allocation and the 3 billion share buyback program, not to put words in your mouth, but I think the view on the priority of investment has been first to address weaker marketing that cost out and as than if you get our to 2017 maybe there are other alternative to running your business or portfolio that are available to you. So I guess what's the impedes to commit so much of your cash now towards buyback for the next few years?","Sandy Cutler","And again it's not all of our capital, it's -- we\u2019re tilting it towards that and our view is that this time of relatively weak equity performance and weak market prospects is a time when we can take advantage of really buying back shares and creating value for our customers at a time when I think certainty is something that everyone is looking for and so that's our view in terms of tilting over this point.","Evelyn Chan","That makes sense Sandy. And then I guess maybe switching gears it looks like bookings trends are moving in the right direction and we've heard a lot of surprisingly positive commentary from the industrial peers on short cycle trends in January. Can you address what you\u2019re seeing in your business here at the start of the year and what you maybe see in your front-log to drive back 8% year-over-year decline in 1Q?","Sandy Cutler","Our view is that there are couple of distributors that have come out and talked about things being a little bit more positive. Actually our direct business peers, I don\u2019t think you've heard as much commentary coming out about the first quarter. I don\u2019t think we're seeing anything at this point that causes us to think that markets are better than what we\u2019re forecasting here. This is a -- we've seen markets coming off each quarter throughout 2015 typically our first quarter is seasonally weaker than our fourth quarter, it's our weakest quarter of the year and that's how we've laid out our guidance for this year. So I think it's a little early to call the year. Fortunately, we haven\u2019t had a major snow event this year which hasn\u2019t given us a big hit in January, but I\u2019d say no were not seeing anything different than our guidance at this point.","Evelyn Chan","Okay, thanks very much.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. ","Jeff Sprague ","Thank you. Good morning everyone. I wonder Sandy if you can come back around to price. So I think it was an earlier question on price and I think you answered it more around kind of cost relief, but when you were saying you see a tailwind there, where you kind of commenting that price cost net is the tailwind? Can you just price [ph] that together for us and provide a little bit of color actually on the pricing side.","Sandy Cutler","Yes. I would say yes the price cost net, a slight tailwind. And [indiscernible] conditions are very different in every one of our market segments some have long-term contracts, some have price adjusters and then they\u2019re based in contracts, were not seeing the environment being one where there I would say there is undo price competition. Obviously markets are down, things are tough and if we see the market is behaving pretty well.","Jeff Sprague ","And then on the comment about the corporate expenses down maybe towards the $80 million decline is that all in across corporate options and pension and everything or is that actually just the corporate expense line?","Sandy Cutler","Yes. So that's interest amortization, pension and corporate cost, so that whole complex of cost. ","Jeff Sprague ","Great, thank you. ","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch ","Look I realize this is not a direct comp, but it is the big industrial, Emersion more or less suggested that we were approaching a bottom with respect to its various markets and they expect orders to actually turn positive after March. Sandy, it's kind of ductailing on Scott's point, I mean do you think we are approaching a bottom, it doesn\u2019t suggest there is recovery coming anytime soon. But do you think we\u2019re approaching an overall bottom and then what are you thinking about your own orders, are we looking at a positive inflection at some point this year?","Sandy Cutler","Perhaps it's the best indication, we've talked about this point a lot John and our own planning is as we put the plans together this fall were not counting on an economic rebound in the second half. We think that's been kind of an unwise premise to go into these markets where if it does gets stronger, so much the better, we can scramble up, we've done that well in the past, but the restructuring actions that we\u2019re taking, this commitment to a three year restructuring plan says that we think 2016 doesn\u2019t recover when we get to the second half.","John Inch ","First I wanted to echo some of the other comments so I think your margin performance in the pace of while which is actually pretty commendable. The one business that does take out is Hydraulics right, it does appear whether it's because of Asia or pricing or whatever it appears to be getting worst and it appears margin, but I mean your margins are down despite the heavy emphasis of restructuring your margins is still down a point year-over-year. So what I'd be interested in is really your thought process about and maybe Craig\u2019s even, add to this.","Hydraulic strategically I mean I guess if we have had this perspective that's the world was going to be this difficult we may not have built this businesses, there is some of the M&A we get kind of more recently, but instead you\u2019ve made the comment that you can\u2019t really adjust your portfolio in terms of spins until what 2017 because of Cooper. But you can always still do something with the business on a sale basis or something else. How should we be thinking about Hydraulics? Because it really is sticking out negatively, unfortunately versus the other segments at this juncture.","Sandy Cutler","Let me come back to couple of the elements that you mentioned. You are right is that we are not able to do tax free spins until after the five year anniversary. We have indicated that we do have the strategic flexibility that if we decide to we can sell businesses on a taxable basis just as we did the two aerospace businesses that Craig led last year that we felt we could better step out of because they weren\u2019t strategically managed. There is no question on hydraulics. We\u2019re dealing with a very difficult end market. We commented on that last year, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change this year.","We actually think the margin performance is pretty commendable in light of where the volumes have been, but we understand it's not at the mid-teen levels right now that we would like to see it at. We do think with the actions that the team is undertaking and if we get into the later part of this year, you\u2019re going to see some far more attractive margins than you will see in the early part of this year because we\u2019re taking some very-very significant steps within that business.","We\u2019re trying to get this business sized so that you can perform well without having to have a market rebound because again we think we are in a commodity cycle and clearly we don\u2019t have the benefit of the revenues that we had number of years ago, when it was the high point. And Craig do you want to add anything to that?","Craig Arnold","No, the only thing I would add to what you said is we really are living through what I would argue is a really unprecedented period in the Hydraulic markets and you can\u2019t find the hydraulic end market today that hasn\u2019t gone through a pretty perceptive downturn, whether it's Ag or it's China construction, or its mining the oil and gas. Most recently anything tied to capital purchases and on the industrial side the business. And so when we take a look at the end markets that we serve inside our Hydraulics periods, but for the great recession over the last 15 years we\u2019ve never seen a period like this in Hydraulics business and to say this point they have a business that in this environment that can still stand up clearly margins got on it the Company average, but margins that are 10% to 11% we think is pretty remarkable performance from that business.","And at some point these markets will turn and whether or not that end of \u201916, \u201917 but to Sandy\u2019s point we\u2019re putting together a plan today that says we\u2019re going to make sure that this business deliveries attract the margins at this level of economic activity and when it turns it will throw up very handsome new commendable profits. And so today clearly we\u2019re living in a period in the hydraulics space that we don\u2019t like it any more than you do, we\u2019re doing what we think we need to do, but we think this will be a very attractive business when markets turn and they will turn.","John Inch","And Craig would it also be fair to say, I mean Sandy intimated you, we\u2019re still dealing with a little bit of M&A even though you\u2019ve stepped up share repurchase. Rather than just ride out Hydraulics and the cyclicality, would it be fair to say you might want to make up for some of those other deals in terms of the timing and do some acquisitions in this space? Is that on the table still?","Sandy Cutler","So what we said really is, until we get a real sense for where markets are going to bottom out, it\u2019s really difficult at this point in the cycle to really value Hydraulic assets. And so to your point, we made a couple of acquisitions in this space a number of years ago and quite frankly we and the whole world got markets wrong. And so I would say as we think about hydraulics today in M&A it really is a piece that\u2019s off the table until we get a sense for where markets are and nothing bottomed out and we can really then predict the future.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Longbow.","Unidentified Analyst","Just following that up everybody picks on the toughest segment in the bottom and with every turn people say who benefits and you have good sector to benefit. But when we talk about hydraulics in front of the rest of the Company, can we talk about where inventories are, what did you see during the quarter as far as inventory liquidation and most of it\u2019s over or are we close to doing it? And where do you think inventories are as you go through this year for you guys into channels and particularly with lower volume maintenance [ph], so we\u2019re probably coming down some more?","Sandy Cutler","Our best sense and talk about the two segments where there are distributor inventories, I think that to answer your question is on the electrical side people have been seeing markets be tighter than they were a number of years ago. And so we actually think there hasn\u2019t been substantial change in inventory. They\u2019ve been low. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re either suffering from liquidation or there is a lot more liquidation to go on. On the hydraulic side, clearly the point Craig just made, our distributors have been dealing with this for prolonged period of time.","I think the one segment where you find when you travel regionally and you talk to different customers, if an individual distributor whether they were electrical or whether they were hydraulic had an unusually high exposure to oil and gas area. They may still be struggling with some inventories because I think that has continued to move in a way that many people didn\u2019t predict it would.","But I\u2019d say outside of that, I think they\u2019re fairly balanced. I think people have got their hatches buttoned down tight and they too are trying to live through a period of time when growth is less than they\u2019d hoped it might be a couple of years ago.","Unidentified Analyst","So, we're looking at production, it will effectively end market demand? [Multiple speakers].","Sandy Cutler","Pretty similar. I think the major OEMs are very much that way too, they've been at this for some time as well. So, with the exception of what I\u2019d call you'll find in some OEMs the big issue isn't the inventory, it's that the equipment they have shift is being utilized at a very low level. So there the utilization rates has to come up before their demand, before new equipment comes up. But I think it's less of an inventory issue today and that was just very low levels of utilization. ","Unidentified Analyst","And just a follow up, I mean we talked going up a little bit with Emerson's said yesterday in their numbers. But the one market that they pointed to was that datacenter market had bottomed and they talked about improving datacenter markets, I don\u2019t know if you are seeing that\u2019s or has that just happened, is probably better than what you are anticipating. Are you seeing any movements in the datacenter sector here or in Asia or so or is that still a hope that\u2019s happening rather than [indiscernible]?","Sandy Cutler","And we had action last fall and it\u2019s continued for us, that they were -- during a first half kind a disappointing year in terms of significant bookings. We saw really good activity and good wins in the second half of the last year that is going to help us with our shipments this year. And we've been very pleased with the fact that I think I've mentioned on several occasions that we came out with the new high-end three phase UPS which had an even higher energy saving component which was really sized for the web point, a 2.0 type of datacenter. So, it is allowing us to compete very advantageously there.","Unidentified Analyst","You have forecasted improving datacenter markets as we go through this year as part of the Electrical forecast of this month?","Sandy Cutler","Yeah. And I will say the overall PC market is not that great but some of that top end stuff is getting better. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Buckingham.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","So, just on the follow-up to kind of some of these comments on when we bottom and when comps will be easier. I guess maybe this is still down a little bit Sandy, do you think we exit 2016 just given the comp influence of maybe a little bit of destocking obviously not that much based on your last comment on easier comp. Do we start to see a business like hydraulics inflect positive by the fourth quarter?","Sandy Cutler","We are not forecasting it at this point, it's just we would love to be able to answer to the question, believe us for our own utilization as well but we just -- we think we're better the plan on the fact that we aren't going to see the rebound at that point. And if we do it will be an upside, there is so much time between now and the fourth quarter in terms of seeing what happens to crop prices, what happens to commodity prices and we've seen the volatility in these areas. So, we are not able to forecast that so, we are not assuming it's going to occur. ","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got you. And then maybe from the margin perspective on the other side of that. As restructuring yields out, I mean by the time we get to the fourth quarter you should be running well above that 10% just given the timing now and maybe any help you can give on that?","Sandy Cutler","Yeah. Very definitely, and again as we go back to the comments I made about the restructuring if you recall that of the $140 million of restructuring costs that we\u2019re going to incur during 2016, $70 million is in the first quarter, roughly $35 million in the second quarter, then the balance in last two. So that just itself helps margins. Now, you put the savings which their whole incremental savings occurs over the quarters of two, three and four and it gets bigger as three and four go on.","So, yes each of the margins should deal and very distinctly in Hydraulics, back to Craig's position you will start to see how this plan manifests itself. I think the real big takeaway from yours and many other people's question is that we are not counting on an economic rebound to drive our plan nor our earnings. What we are counting on is the things that we can control and that\u2019s the very important change that we made at the second quarter of last year when we announced that we were going to drive very significant restructuring and that we've now added another year to that, but then we've also announced an enlarged buyback. Those are two things we can control and we think in this environment where there is so much that people are so uncertain about, we are putting the premium on, let's deliver certainty where we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Thanks good morning and kudos on the cost control. Couple of things just wanted to go back for restructuring and I am just wondering does the nature of the restructuring change over the next couple of years and I am just wondering if we move from headcount to more facility based restructuring. And within that maybe just to make a comment on the CapEx, although the CapEx\u2019s comments around restructuring was interesting. I am wondering are we seeing some capital perfect use of labor here or just primarily consolidating small some of these into larger ones?","Craig Arnold","Hi Nigel, this is Craig Arnold. Maybe I'll take that one for you. The way we think about kind of this whole roadmap to reducing our cost is, we really think about it in three buckets. These was a big buckets around facilities. Our manufacturing footprint around the world and distribution centers and offices, and we have a pretty healthy appetite and the backlog of opportunities to continue to right size our facility footprints. So that\u2019s one big bucket of activity that is undergoing today and we think that continues for the next several years or so.","There is another bucket that really gets to what we call support costs, a numbers of management layers that we have and the span of control of our leaders, the size of our corporate infrastructure and that\u2019s a whole another element of activities that has done a lot to improve it in 2015 and we think that also plays out continually in 2016 and perhaps a little bit in 2017 as well.","And then there is the third bucket that I\u2019m put the category of really optimizing where you do, what should do and actually moving more of our activities to low cost centers and as we\u2019re opening up shared servicing [ph] in low cost countries and putting various activities that we do today that simply putting them in places and where we can do it to a much lower cost and in many case more efficiently. And those are really the three bucket of activities that we\u2019re undertaking across the company and we think it continuous being part of our go forward plans.","Nigel Coe","Okay. That's good color. And then secondly I appreciate the color on the cash deployment over the next three years. On the free cash conversion roughly $0.107 [ph] for next year what gives you confidence that that you can get the work to capital other system as your sales are declining 4% or so?","Craig Arnold","I'll take that Nigel. They are really two big elements to the improvement in free cash flow from 2015 to 2016. First of all we are not going to make a U.S. pension contribution and so that's is an improvement of about a $160 million and then secondly with sales going down generally classic working capital is about 18% of sales so as the 420 million or so of organic sales decline gets around $80 million and then we do have inventories that we have built up as part of Cooper that come out and frankly we ended the year with a little bit more inventories than we had hoped simply because of the speed of which sales had come down and so all of that leads us to say the expectation of a 160 million from lower pension contribution and another roughly a 140 million of working capital liquidation, that's how you get from this 1.9 to 2.2 midpoint of free cash flow.","Don Bullock","Our question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew Casey","Sandy I'm wondering within the nonresidential commentary that you gave little bit earlier whether you've seen any of the weakness being seen in some of your industrial end markets in the U.S. starting to impact any of the really nonmanufacturing sectors of nonresidential construction. ","Sandy Cutler","Let me take oil and gas kind of offset the table but if you speak to the other nonmanufacturing we obviously had a very good quarter, fourth quarter in terms of quotations. When we look at all quotations and negotiations we\u2019re involved in the stronger part of the commercial market from our perspective and we've got a very big window looking at, I'm speaking to the U.S. here has been the smaller project so it's been project that you could say or it kind of start off the residential base and they get up into kind of medium size projects is the really big ones that are intended to be a little bit less strong in the marketplace now you are seeing a number of big stadiums build around the U.S. that really started in the second quarter of last year and that's going to continue through this year. What I'd say the weakness we've seen in kind of construction in the U.S. has been very big power using construction where a lot of medium vaults are just used and that tends to be industrial or very big-big commercial and the strength has been more towards the smaller projects.","Andrew Casey","Thanks. And then I think kind of going back to some of the other questions but taking a different view point on it, if we look back at prior cycles you see some of the things that are weakening fairly significantly off of peak conditions, like truck. What sort of probability would you put on the U.S. instead of staying in this stagnate and just starting to go into recession, not this year but maybe next year?","Sandy Cutler","We don\u2019t see that as the high probability, We do think that we are in this frustratingly slow environment that can often cause people to use the recession word, but I think that's almost a more of a kind of an emotional issues than it is a the factual basis, we think that GDP is likely to grow in the mid-two's again this year. However as we are on the industrial side of the economy were seeing industrial production numbers that are more like 1.","So all that we\u2019ve been and I'm just repeating what we probably all read is that there has been more action on the kind of the consumer and services side then there has been on the industrial side and that's what's been leading to the lack of capital investment for this MRO industrial malaise and that is clearly been affecting ours and many of our peers market.","So I think I would say that's more of the tone and you compare the U.S. growth to around the world it's not significantly different in the total global GDP so there are countries slower and faster, but that's how we see it. We just think this is it is the time when it's really critical that companies get their cost base adjusted that they don\u2019t assume that economic growth is going to bail them out hence they control those things that they can control and that\u2019s exactly what our plan\u2019s all about, but it's not based on and nor do we think it's the high probability that there is a recession.","Don Bullock","Next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray ","Thank you. I had a question on the Aerospace number of the booking up 14%. How does that split between commercial and military, and how much of that will flow into 2016?","Sandy Cutler","The commercial side, Deane, continues to be the stronger side. If we look at the three elements of booking within Aerospace, we were seeing commercial be up on the order of roughly 7, military was down on the order of about 6, and then aftermarket was up the 14. That\u2019s not a bad way to think about how things work going forward. As we think about a market we\u2019re seeing will be up too next year, you\u2019d assume the commercials is going to be a slight premium to that market and the military is going to be a slight discount to it. And we would hope that the aftermarket that we could grow a little faster in the average, it won\u2019t be like the 14% or 15% number, but it\u2019d be slightly above our average number.","Deane Dray ","And then for Rick the tax rate for 2016 seeing a lift from 8% to 10%. Maybe just comment on what\u2019s going on there? And is there any update on what might be the natural rate that Eaton would level out to?","Rick Fearon","Our rate as you point was 8% for \u201915, the midpoint of our guidance of 10% for \u201916. And really that\u2019s the function of more U.S. income it's the function of the restructuring actions a lot of which do increase U.S. income. As well as the fact that the U.S. is -- some parts of our U.S. business that are still growing pretty healthily certainly relative to some other parts of the world. If you look longer term, I continue to believe that the rates will be somewhere between 10% and 15%, it\u2019ll probably slowly tick up. But I would emphasize slowly not like more than 1 or 2 percentage point moves in a given year.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeff Hammond","Just have a quick follow up here in corporate expense. Can you split out of that $80 million, how much is restructuring savings that we should put in the restructuring bucket and how much is something else like lower pension?","Sandy Cutler","I think there is very little that\u2019s restructuring at this point. And so I would regard that as principally the core corporate cost Jeff.","Jeff Hammond","So, we can figure that as a separate bucket from the incremental restructuring savings?","Sandy Cutler","No, it's all built into the total number that we gave you. But I guess what I am just indicating is that the amount of actual corporate cost for restructuring in \u201916 are very-very tiny part of that $140 million, it's single-digit million.","Jeff Hammond","How much is pension going to be down year-on-year?","Sandy Cutler","There is going to be a substantial improvement in pension or reduction in pension costs. And it's a number that will be -- for two reasons it will be a number that is down on the order of north of $50 million and the biggest part of that is going to be that we did move to the split rate pension that so many of our peers have moved to, we think it's better accounting. And so that\u2019s the biggest driver of that. And then also the U.S. discount rate has gone up about 25 basis points, simply a reflection of where interest rates ended the year.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Chris Glynn","So with the kind of commentary on the multiyear share repurchase plan, you opened up to some longer term, just looking at the capital structure. I think in 2017, you\u2019ve got a hefty debt coming due, billion of that. Is that extremely low rate? Are we looking at roll over to stay consistent with comments on excess cash to repurchase, or is the current 2.5 times leverage still above a sustainable zone, so more of a bevy of commentary than a single question there.","Rick Fearon","Our expectation Chris is that we would refinancing the debt coming due in 2017.","Chris Glynn","And then lastly on the split from the first half, second half. Given the highly strategic year and period of restructuring program, maybe give color on the ramp of benefits into the second half just in terms of perhaps an earnings split of the first half and the second half within the annual context?","Sandy Cutler","As I mentioned, the restructuring cost is 70 in the first, 35 in the second, and then the last 35 across the last two. And then from a benefits point of view, all of the benefits occurs in quarters two, three and four, and they build as you go from quarter-to-quarter. So the higher savings will be out in the third and fourth quarter.","Don Bullock","Thank you all for joining us today. Unfortunately we\u2019ve reached the end of our allotted time for the call today. As always, we\u2019ll be available for follow up calls for the remainder of the day and the rest of the week. And again thank you very much for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) And as a remainder, this call is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Don Bullock. Please go ahead.","Donald H. Bullock","","Good morning. I\u2019m Don Bullock, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Welcome to Eaton's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and CFO. As has been our historical practice, we will begin today's call with comments from Sandy, followed by a question-and-answer session.","Before we move to that, I\u2019ll take a moment to draw your attention to the materials on page 2 of the presentation on our website, regarding certain forward-looking statements. The comments included on page 2 in the presentation, outline a series of factors that could cause actual results to differ from what we presented in these statements. These factors are also noted in today's press release and the related Form 8-K. In addition, our presentation today includes certain non-GAAP measures as defined by the SEC rules. A reconciliation of all of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP equivalent is provided in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.eaton.com.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sandy.","Sandy Cutler","","Great, thanks Don. I'm going to work from the presentation, which was posted earlier this morning and I\u2019m going to start on page number 3, which is entitled highlights of the second quarter results. I would say a pretty busy quarter. We released that 8-K, a week ago, detailing the interaction of the several special or unusual items that we had in the quarter being the text of the gain on the sale of the aerospace business and our several legal settlements. At that point, we indicated we expected that our operating earnings per share would be in the $1.10 to $1.12 range and we\u2019re pleased this morning they came in right in the middle of that range, but that were $1.11 above the original guidance that we gave when we began this quarter.","Our sales were right on the button. We\u2019ve said they would be up 5% compared to the first quarter than they were and our margins were very much in line with our expectations. And you recall it when we gave you margin guidance for this quarter that was before the $0.08 of restructuring that we took in the industrial sector. So I will detail how that affects the full-year margin guidelines for each of those segments as we go on this morning.","Strong industrial sector, strong electrical product margins offset the weakness in the electrical systems and services margins. I will talk a little bit more specifically about electrical systems and services but the company really allowed us to command very much in line as I mentioned with our own expectations. Very strong bookings in electrical overall in both of the two segments report, obviously in aerospace as well. We also raised our guidance in terms of where we think the markets will be for that NAFTA heavy-duty truck businesses for 290,000, so a pretty good market activity in that respect. And in our integration of the Cooper acquisition, I will talk a little bit of a more of that stays a very much on track at this point.","If we move to the chart number 4, just quickly a summary of the impact of really several unusual items in the second quarter. If you recall the acquisition integration charges show up on two lines on our P&L, they have to show up both in the segments for about $30 million of the overall $37 million of expense that\u2019s shown and about $7 million at the corporate level. Then you could see obviously the subject that we released 8-K on last week, the Meritor litigation, the Triumph litigation, the associated legal cost and then the benefits that came from aerospace business divestitures in total after-tax impact of about $0.70 and that\u2019s how you get from the $0.41 operating earnings per share reported through the operating EPS excluding these unusual items.","We know what the interplay of all of these elements that makes following the tax line, particularly challenging in this quarter, so we try to provide a breakout from the tax rate as reported and obviously a very large negative income as a result of these litigation settlements that took place in the U.S. at obviously the high U.S. rate. You can see the tax rate excluding all of the unusual items was about 8%, a little higher than we\u2019ve been running and reflective of the fact that our mix of business has been a little stronger in the U.S. than it has been outside the U.S. I think a good reflection of a staffing in the global economy where generally the U.S. is one of the stronger regions at this point. And the weakness that we\u2019ve seen in our end-markets tends to be primarily in the markets outside of the U.S.","If we move to the page 5, once again, a quarter very much in line with our own expectations. Sales and margins, as I expected, slightly lower corporate expenses and offset the slightly higher \u2013 higher taxes as you can see a simply one set net of those two items and that led to the $1.11.","If we move to page 6, this is the overall financial summary. I think the one number I would want to comment on here is that if you remember our first quarter shipment number was $5.492 billion, so when you look at the $5.767 that\u2019s exactly a 5% that\u2019s what we have had thought we would see in terms of the growth in the second quarter from the first quarter. Overall, again, then if you look at the segment operating margin at 14.6 when you adjust for the $0.08 of restructuring that we told you would occur and this quarter would be $15.3 come back and maybe amplify now as we go through each of the individual segments. But overall core growth of 3%, if you recall, we had core growth of just slightly over 4% in the first quarter. A little stronger year-to-year market activity in the first quarter really happened in terms of the hydraulics market and the vehicle markets, which were not as much of an increase year-over-year when you look at the second quarter and versus the second quarter of last year.","Now let\u2019s move to chart number 7, which is entitled electrical products segment. Here again, about 6% growth from the first quarter where we had revenues of $1.726, up about 4% year-over-year. I think again a very good news here in bookings, you will hear this both in the electrical products and the electrical systems and services where we saw overall bookings up some 8% in the Americas, 8% in Asia-Pacific, and then obviously the area that we\u2019ve talked about of less strength is pretty flattish condition still in the European region.","Again, we just call out here that what\u2019s going on in terms of the LED lighting change in our business 41% of the overall sales now quite strong, obviously as we\u2019re continuing to introduce a lot of new products in that particular area. And when you get within the three regions on my comments, just on a couple areas, that the end market strength that maybe helpful for you to understand. I\u2019d mentioned lighting is obviously quite strong, residential has continued to be strong for us. Overall distributor demand what we\u2019re seeing here in this electrical products segment has been strong. The weak area has been the power quality market. And then the electrical product segments is where we report of the single phase side of that marketplace, actual negative growth in that marketplace continues to be quite weak. In EMEA, the strength continues to be really a story of weak in the continents, strong in the Middle East in portions of Africa. In Asia-Pacific, recovering strength, broadly in our components, which we\u2019re very pleased about weakness and the single phase power quality continues to parallel what we\u2019re seeing here in the U.S. and then we\u2019ve seen Australia where the economy continue to be quite weak there.","If we move to page 8, which is electrical systems and services segment, a couple of highlight comments here is that first sales up about 7% compared to the first quarter, when it was $1.524 billion. If you look versus last year, pretty flat, and that really reflects these slow bookings that we had. If you recall, we had a decline in bookings in the first quarter, a number of you had asked questions at that time, would that have a (indiscernible) into the next quarter because generally you have more of a backlog in this particular segment, where you don\u2019t have a backlog in the products segment.","Margins, obviously, a 12.7% pretty flat with the first quarter and down 200 basis points from last year, I\u2019ll comment on that in just a minute, if I could just comment on bookings first. Bookings, again, up 7% as the strongest in some six quarters. If you remember the later three quarters of last year where we actually had a negative quarter and the fourth quarter, negative quarter, and the first quarter we\u2019re very pleased with the substantial reversal here. The strength, as I mentioned from a regional point of view, is pretty much as I mentioned for the products area. Here we\u2019re seeing good strength. Canada has strengthened which you have probably heard from a number of competitors in this marketplace, but good activity across most of our products here with the exception of the large and of the power quality market. So again a common seeing that power quality is weaker than we\u2019re seeing on the power distribution side of the business, again weaker in Europe, stronger in Asia-Pacific and Americas.","We talked a little bit about the margin issue. If you recall it, we had weaker margins in the first quarter and we had about $13 million that we detailed for you in the first that dealt with a lot of the weather related expediting cost we had in the business. Different situation here in the second quarter and we really rolled it out into our full year guidance for the segment. I\u2019ll talk more about that when we get back to the page a little further in the packets here, but we really saw higher logistics costs and some unfavorable mix and this is a business where it is a mix of many, many different projects and some more competitive pricing in the segment.","We believe the second half will be stronger than the first half, you see that in our guidance. We have some view into that as a result of the backlog that we now have on hand with obviously a very substantial booking quarter here. But we do believe that some of the logistics costs and the unfavorable mix are likely to be with us as how we\u2019re seeing the market materializes here. The particular location of where those challenges really are is it\u2019s in the large power distribution and power quality assemblies where they are more competitive in terms of the pricing environment than they were a year ago. Those unfortunately did offset the synergies that we did get in this segment, so we\u2018re confident about the overall synergies we\u2019re getting both in the electrical products, the electrical systems and services and at the corporate level, but we did have some negatives as we tried to detail here pretty clearly in terms of the impact upon margin.","If we move to the Hydraulics segment, this is page 9. Up just a 1% from the first quarter, first quarter was $782 million of shipments, up 2% from last year. The second quarter bookings being down by 2%, I think it surprise some people, but if you recall that we\u2019ve seen a fairly substantial increase in bookings for the last three quarters and it is leveling at this point. And we really pointed two key elements. One I think is where both should not really be a surprise. First is the global agricultural equipment market seems to have gone over top. We\u2019re seeing most OEMs talking being down in the 5% to 10% range this year. And then the China construction equipment market continues to be very weak as you have heard from a number of OEMs who come into that and over the last month or so, we don\u2019t see that turning around here in the year of 2014. As a result, we\u2019ve reduced the market forecast down for the full-year from approximately 3% to 1% and the real issues you think about it is the U.S. is likely to be sort of a plus 2, the rest of the world is sort of a 0 really brought down by the large construction markets in China. When we look within our own bookings, the distributor side of the business up in the order of 9%, the OEM side of business down in the order of some 15% basically for the reasons I mentioned was the mobile market have been hit by this construction and ag weakness. And you recall that this was one of the three segments that we said that we were going to take some restructuring expense. During the second quarter, you will see in that first bullet point in the yellow section of the yellow box, it was about 160 basis points without that this margin is pretty much as it was a year ago about 14.2%.","If we move to chart 10, which is the aerospace segment up volumes some 5% from the first quarter, when it was $464 million up 9% from a year ago. As you could see, we still have some small impact in this segment from the two small aerospace business units, we divested in the second quarter, but you could see the bookings up very strongly and we\u2019re really quite pleased with a 20% increase in aftermarket orders on both \u2013 the good strong activity on both the commercial and the military side of the business. Once again, restructuring costs taken in this business, during the second quarter, reduced margins by about 40 basis points, so again margin is pretty similar to 14.6% without the restructuring expense.","Turning to page 11, the vehicle segment, first quarter shipments were about $996 million, so shipments from the second quarter up about 4%, up 3% from last year. Again after some large restructuring costs in this segment that we have said we were taking at the beginning of the first quarter, they would come up for about 230 basis points decrease in margin. So margins would have been 17.3%, so a very healthy level in the segment. Without those as we watched the June NAFTA orders coming in at almost 27 million units for heavy-duty trucks and now that whole second quarter at about 78,000 units. We\u2019ve raised our guidance for this segment for the NAFTA heavy-duty truck build to 290,000 units, coming out of this quarter at about 74,000 units build. It\u2019s a pretty flat forecast for the rest of the year. And, so we think lower than the sweet spot here. The offset for that is the South American markets continue to be very weak and we think are down on the order overall of about 11%, so pretty weak activities down in South America.","If we turn to chat, well really just one change in terms of our overall end-market growth, it is still 3% for the company, the change within hydraulics was not enough to kind of swing the total number and again that change in Hydraulics is the global ag market and then the construction equipment in China weaker than we have thought.","If we move to page 13, I\u2019d like to spend a couple of minutes on this chart today because I think it\u2019s important in being sure that we\u2019re all in the same page in terms of our margin expectations. If you recall when we gave margin expectations by segment at the end of the first quarter, we noted that that margin guidance did not include the then expected $40 million restructuring and as it turned out in our actuals, you saw $39 million of restructuring actually took place in the third quarter in our Hydraulics, Aerospace and Vehicle businesses. We are now taking those restructuring costs which were already in our earnings guidance for the year and simply reflecting them in the individual segments. If you recall, we did not do that at the time we shared the $40 million restructuring plan because we\u2019ve not made an announcements to our employees yet and until we did so, we did not want to reflect it in the segments. As a result, if I can start with Hydraulics, the Hydraulics $13 million restructuring was four tenths of 1% that explains the difference between the 13.5 and 13 revised guidance. In Aerospace, the $2 million of restructuring small enough it didn\u2019t really affect our 14% guidance that we had before in hand. In Vehicle, the $24 million of restructuring is 6 tenths of 1% and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve reduced from 16 to 15.5. So really no change in our underline guidance of margin for those three business segments.","Now let me go back up to electrical systems and services where we decreased from 14.5% to 13.5%. If you recall in the first quarter, we had about $13 of weather related variances. Second quarter is I detailed earlier the next logistics and pricing impact that\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken a point (indiscernible) margins, obviously with having been under 13% in the first two quarters of the year for us to be really we\u2019re going to achieve 13.5 for the full year. We are anticipating the second half being stronger and as I mentioned with larger backlog we have and the knowledge of what\u2019s in our backlog, we feel comfortable with those projections for the balance of the year, but we are taking the full year down by a point at this point. Now when you get to the bottom, the Eaton\u2019s consolidated number of 15.2% versus the 15.7% previously, the $39 million of restructuring expenses is worth 2 tenths of 1%. The electrical system and services segment\u2019s impact on the total company is 3 tenths and that\u2019s the difference of the 5 tenths. Hopefully that clarifies for you at somewhat of a complex set of numbers in terms of the margins, but really you can trace from those two sets of actions.","Moving to page 14, this is our full year guidance. We did lower the top-end of our guidance due to the change of margin outlook in Electrical Systems and Services and the fact that you recall when we gave our guidance for the year, it was based upon a range of market growth numbers of 2% to 4%. At this point having a half of the year behind us and markets growing at a lower number in these first couple of quarters more on the order of 2%, we don\u2019t think a 4% is realistic anymore and that\u2019s why we trimmed the top end, but we\u2019ve held the bottom end of our range at $4.50. All the numbers showing on this particular page do exclude the impact of the aerospace divestitures and the items related to the Meritor and Triumph litigation.","If we move to page 15, this is the full-year bridge and really just two changes on this full-year bridge. What doesn\u2019t appear on this page that was there and when we gave you guidance for the last quarter was we\u2019ve anticipated that ForEx, we\u2019d have about $200 million negative impact on revenues this year. We no longer think that is true as we\u2019ve seen a number of the currencies move or prepared to talk about that during questions. So that negative $0.04 is disappeared off this page and that negative $0.04 offsets the $0.14 \u2013 that negative $0.14 that you\u2019ll see is the second item listed on the several negatives here that is new on the page here and that relates to the logistics mix and pricing in the Electrical Systems and Services area, so a net of $0.10 and that\u2019s the difference in our midpoint obviously between the $4.70 that we have had is the midpoint of our operating earnings per share and now the $4.60.","No changes on page 16, which our Cooper synergy projections. We really just provided this for your reference. If we move to page 17, this is our bridge from our second quarter actual to the third quarter guidance, again starting with $1.11 that we\u2019re reporting today. Obviously, we removed the industrial sector restructuring expenses of $0.08 that was $39 million that we\u2019re incurred during the second quarter. We expect higher volume of about $150 million, or 3% very much in line with what we generally see between the second and the third quarter.","We\u2019ve got additional synergies. We\u2019ll be realizing from all the work we\u2019re doing at Cooper synergies of about $10 million and that\u2019s about $0.02 and then we\u2019ve got higher corporate expenses of about $0.04, yes, generally you\u2019ll see the second half of our corporate expenses run higher than they do in the first half and that\u2019s how we get to the $1.25 for our guidance \u2013 midpoint of the guidance for the third quarter.","Moving to page 18, obviously when you look at our first half earnings, first and second quarter together earnings at $2.12 to reach obviously our full-year guidance that means its $2.48 of operating EPS in this second half and we felt that will be (indiscernible) a little bit about this. Let\u2019s start with a top-line higher volume of about $500 million at the incremental that we\u2019ve been talking about this year of 26%, our best estimates are that our markets grew at about 2% versus the first half. If we see some gathering strengthened and we think they will grow closer to 4% in the second half and that\u2019s how we get to our 3% market guidance.","If you think about when you try to think through where does the $500 million of volume come from, please remember this is first half versus second half. So one of the big steps in volumes was the $275 million step up between the first quarter and the second quarter. As I mentioned to you in pervious chart when we detailed the third quarter guidance, we\u2019re talking about volumes moving up about $150 million in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. And then it\u2019s typical for us with our mix of businesses that volumes declined slightly in the fourth quarter from the third quarter that\u2019s the exact same pattern that obviously that what we\u2019re talking about that\u2019s embedded in our guidance. We won\u2019t have the industrial restructuring expenses in the second half that we had in first half, about $39.08 million, additional Cooper synergies of $0.05, lower pension expense of about $0.05, lower taxes of about $0.04 and then the higher cooperate expenses as I mentioned before was second half normally runs higher than the first half about a negative $0.12 and that\u2019s how you get to the difference between the first half and the second half.","If we turn to page 19, this is simply the summary we give you kind of key elements supporting our guidance. Just a few items that have changed here, if you scroll down to, I guess that\u2019s the sixth item the tax rate, we\u2019ve increased that to 6% from 5% and again remember all of these numbers here excludes the impact of the aerospace divestitures and the items related to Meritor, Triumph. The real reason for the slightly higher tax rate is that our earnings are higher in some of the higher tax jurisdictions, i.e., the U.S. for example. Again, that goes back to our view how the economic outlook is laying out this year with U.S. being one of the stronger regions and many of the areas outside of the U.S. is actually being weaker. Obviously, our operating EPS for full year, we lowered that by $0.10 at the midpoint by dropping the top end from $4.90 to $4.70, we kept the $4.50 the same at the low end. And then you will notice on the operating cash flow and the free cash flow, in each case, we\u2019ve lowered them by about $200 million, really reflecting the lower profitability that\u2019s comes out of our guidance and also a little higher working capital that we\u2019ve anticipated when we started the year, no change to CapEx.","So if we turn to Page 20, summary, second quarter results were very much in line with our guidance on revenues and margins either the guidance we gave at the beginning of the quarter or the update we gave through the 8-K of roughly a week ago. Excluding the unusual items and the restructuring costs in the industrial sector, EPS was up about 9% versus last year that Cooper integration remains very much on track. We\u2019re very much in the midst of many of the plant moves that we\u2019ve discussed with you at this point. We will deliver the $95 million of incremental benefits compared to 2013 here in the year of 2014 and another $150 million for 2015. The industrial sector restructuring is in place and we will yield as we have told you at the end of the last quarter about $35 million of benefits next year, so between the two about a $185 of benefits on next year compared to this year. And our best look at pension cost which we often try to share with you as we get to the middle of a year is that with this kind of rates that we used the last time that we calculated this based up on our fuller funding of these plants and the markets having done a little a better, it would be on the order of about $35 million less than this year.","Now with that I would like to add just one of the final note is that and it is not in those packet but there has been a lot of speculation about whether it would make sense of Eaton to spinoff any of our businesses in light of the transformation that we\u2019ve been undergoing over the past 14 years. And as I have commented in many different forums that each of our businesses remain really a key contributors to our results and we continue to see real benefits from being able to apply our multiple power management technologies to meet our customers\u2019 needs and these different verticals. But we also want to clarify that we are not able to do a tax free spin of any business for five years post the acquisition date of the Cooper transaction and that that limitation means that any spin would result in a very significant tax liability. So for the two reasons we think of our power management strategy and obviously this five year kind of prohibition that any form of kind of economic benefit means that that there is not a really compelling economic rationale for further portfolio transformation. So we hope that provide some clarification to a number of questions that a number of investors have either asked or written about over the last month.","So with that I wanted to really take the time to get through a couple of those specifics around the margins because I know they cause some confusion after our release. So with that Don, why don\u2019t we go ahead and open things up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Donald H. Bullock","Our first question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thanks and good morning. Just first question on ESS and S&S margin declined about 200 basis points, you call that would just takes mix in pricing pressure. You mentioned power distribution, power quality, was there any impact (indiscernible) your power systems from Cooper?","Sandy Cutler","As I said Steve, I appreciate the question, first good morning.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Good morning.","Sandy Cutler","It was a very much an as I mentioned that we see it in the large power distribution assemblies in the power quality business and that\u2019s specifically where we\u2019ve seen a competitive activity and the logistic issues lays across a number of the businesses, but again is primarily in those very big assemblies.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And within that you\u2019d call that back up and I would recall the February investor presentation, roadmap to about 16% in 2015 and it looked to me like I think two thirds of that was some synergies, I mean I am just talking about this segment, electrical systems and services and the rest between market and outgrowth. I assume this changes your outlook on that basis now? Or you\u2019re making it up something it up someplace else? Or how are you thinking about that?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, I think if you recall we also had increased our margins in electrical products and as you see, we\u2019re pretty consistently getting that available from the revenue and bookings point of view as well as getting the higher margins. I think it\u2019s a little early to put a number on 2015 and we would really like to get a better sense for how bookings progress here in the third quarter and obviously the second quarter was much improved in terms of the magnitude of the bookings as well as we think the quality of the booking. So a little early, I appreciate your question, but I think we will be in a better position to really be able to answer that we come out of the third quarter.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then just finally on the guidance first half to second half, I looked backwards. It looked to me like normal seasonal growth first half to second half as more or like to 15% ramp and then you would called out incremental synergies being weighted towards the back half of that $95 million and I am not sure the $0.05 really reflects that. I mean you can maybe talk through that a little bit more?","Sandy Cutler","Obviously a lot of \u2013 as you get underneath that $500 million of the higher volume in the second half versus the first half, a couple of issues relative to market. As I mentioned, we saw the vehicle markets and the hydraulic markets on a year-over-year basis were far stronger in the first quarter than they were in the second quarter. I mentioned that when we\u2019re talking about the vehicle businesses that we think the NAFTA heavy duty business will be relatively flat from this point forward and that you\u2019ve had roughly to 74,000 units production level which is basically what you need kind of finish these next two quarters, so won\u2019t get as much of an impact there so by deduction it was an Hydraulics here we call its generally weaker in the second half than in the first half each month so what really prepared us is Aerospace in electrical and you saw the very strong bookings in both those segments 9% in Aerospace and 6% to 7% in each of the two segments in electrical and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re really looking for the higher sales levels.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then on the some of the incremental synergy of that $95 million now first half versus second half.","Sandy Cutler","Yeah. And that\u2019s the additional 2% either you see of the about $25 million of additional benefits that higher in the second half than there is in the first half.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. All right, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi. Good morning, everyone. ","Sandy Cutler","Good morning.","Unidentified Company Representative ","Good morning.","Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Just to stand with ESS margins for a second and can you clarify a little bit more Sandy what do you mean by higher logistical costs, because it seems like a lot of the unexpected variants was in the legacy Eaton Business. If I\u2019m just trying to get a better handle of that.","Sandy Cutler","","That\u2019s primarily freight cost, that it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s been a surprise to us how quickly free cost move during the second quarter and part of this has to do with the size of the equipment that we\u2019re shipping and its moved up quiet significantly during this time period.","Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Is that something that is expected to continue just given that you\u2019ve had, now stronger bookings in ESS moving forward, I would imagine if that\u2019s the business insulting that has subsides in the near-term.","Sandy Cutler","That\u2019s part of the reason why we moved to our guidance, you\u2019re right that\u2019s one of the reason why we moved our guidance down for the balance of the year.","Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then I guess one other question on ESS, you mentioned pricing pressure and clearly, the bookings number with a positive this quarter plus seven, talk us through maybe that the pricing or competitive dynamics that you saw in the bookings that you put into your backlog just this quarter.","Sandy Cutler","","Well, as I mentioned earlier we\u2019re comfortable at the improvement that we\u2019re forecasting the second half really is driven by what we\u2019ve been able to successfully book here during the second quarter. I think if you look back over the last six, some quarters in this segment, you saw our bookings levels that when they were positive we\u2019re in this kind of 1% to 2% range then you recall it they went negative in the fourth quarter in the first quarter, those tend to have in this kind of the business which is a backlog based business tend to be sort of a precursor what\u2019s going to happen in the next quarter so, we\u2019re pleased how we see that we had a very strong quarter in all by what I would say is the large power of quality types because that side of market continues to be weak. But the power distribution side, whether and each of the end markets are continue to be quite strong. We\u2019re seeing good indications of continued strength in non-residential and oil and gas in particular so that we are encouraged by what we saw here in the second quarter now obviously we got to ship it and we are pretty comfortable we know how to do that but we don\u2019t think these logistic costs are likely to go away.","Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","It's interesting to me you think about the margin for the business for the back half of the year, you are basically implying something over the 14% for ESS which you are comfortably there last year, and so I guess a one last question on ESS. Can you kind of talk through may be the puts and takes to the specific margin guidance like where could be disappoint or potentially be more positive or constructive on in the back half","Alexander M. Cutler","","Yeah. I think in the guidance that we provided are they can add a lot more homework character to it is, I think that one thing we always tried to stress for people understand any of electrical systems and service business hence they have a higher data to it both when the market is expanding or contracting because it tends to be a lot of large projects are tend to go into expansion if you will, equally true in terms of what happens with the mix of projects that can change from quarter-to-quarter and we\u2019ve obviously did not have a good quarter in that regard here in the second quarter with the knowledge of what we have got in our backlog at this point, our best view is that we\u2019re going to see the improvements that you\u2019ve referenced in terms of second half being a stronger half than the first half, but it\u2019s still not to the level that we\u2019ve had anticipated originally this year and that\u2019s why we reduced the guidance for the second half.","Joseph Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks. I will get back in queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hey, good morning guys.","Alexander M. Cutler","Good morning Scott.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Can you give us just a little bit more color on aerospace margins in 80 bps down a year and you said half of that was from structuring. I would have thought in and up 9% sales environment you\u2019d have been able get some operating leverage is that just more of a mix issue?","Alexander M. Cutler ","Yeah its again a whole series of different projects in there, but I would say this is very much in line with our guidance I wouldn\u2019t be as concerned myself about this thing moving a couple of tens of a point one, one direction or another, the real issue that we are particularly pleased was is the aftermarket business is starting to rebound you may recall it over the last two years we\u2019ve talked about that one of the challenges is with the commercial OEM production increasing as quickly as it is after market hasn\u2019t been able to keep up with that. And we\u2019re now starting to see, seasons that fill in and we think some of the initiatives that our team has underway to help in larger aftermarket business are really starting to show up. So we\u2019re not yet seeing a 20% increase in what we\u2019re shipping in terms of aftermarket because this stuff has some lead time as well, but we are starting to get to a point where it\u2019s a more representative percentage of the total business. ","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Fair enough. And then question on ESS, that your comment on pricing pressures and I guess I am little surprised that incremental I mean power quality particularly in Europe has been weak now for a couple years, few years. Why is that incrementally getting worse on price. Is there \u2013 it\u2019s just a function of excess capacity or it\u2019s just someone in there as an rationale trying to gain share or new entrance anything that\u2019s changed.","Alexander M. Cutler","","I don\u2019t think \u2013 the single phase piece that we\u2019ve talked about which really is over in the product side, I think those conditions have been fairly similar with the weak server sales around the world. This tends to parallel or be a pretty good surrogate for the demand that we see then on the accompanying UPS and that continues to be much as the same issue. ","I think here on the larger products which tend to be the three phase products which tend to appear for us more in this systems and services segment. We\u2019ve got a couple of things going on, one we talked when we were at EPG this year about the fact that there is a change in the technology of the power solution in the large data centers. ","I remember that\u2019s not the biggest part of this market, but there you\u2019re ending up with a little less power quality equipment in a little bit more power distribution equipment in average large data center. I think that\u2019s going on its not as much of a technology change inside the UPS itself it is, it\u2019s a change in terms of how people are utilizing them.","So I\u2019d say that change is going on, but I would say we still have not seen the large enterprise system data center is accelerate to the extent that we\u2019ve seen the kind of mobile or let me call them hyper scale mobile data center is really come on and so then the enterprise have typically been the people like the big financials and large industrials and they\u2019re not spending as they were a couple years ago.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, fair. And then just clarification, Sandy you commented about that the tax status if you're to do a spend obviously that \u2013 it\u2019s off the table, but is there anything that would impact you selling a business.","Sandy Cutler","","No. Not versus any other normal sale that you\u2019d make in terms of looking at price and looking at after-tax proceeds.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Fair enough. Great and thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank"," ","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Sandra Pianalto","","Good morning, John.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi. So I just, I realized there is a lot moving parts, but in a nutshell so the 500 plus second half volume Sandy, if you compare the second half of 2013 versus the first half that was up 222 what is bridging the gap is it truck, is it something else, because you\u2019re taking your market forecast down, so I\u2019m just \u2013 just in a very high level, what\u2019s the accounting for the sort of $2.70 delta incremental second half volume this year versus last year?","Alexander M. Cutler","","You\u2019re continuing to have growth in the electrical markets overall, we\u2019ll continue to grow, and obviously as we look at a 3% number, and we\u2019re saying that overall the first half grew at roughly 2% and the second half is going to grow at 4%, you can have about 4% growth  overall.","Again we\u2019re seeing the aerospace market continue to grow fairly consistently. We\u2019re seeing hydraulics slow in terms of that growth this year. Better vehicle year-over-year growth, and that\u2019s different than we saw in the second quarter where it was a little solid and the rest of it\u2019s the electrical business.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Would you characterize your guidance as \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to put this into a context, because obviously, we don\u2019t want to get into third quarter, and have to cut this forecast again, is it an extrapolation of the run rate that you see or are you leaving yourself any kind of cushion with respect to kind of the 3% and then the 4.5% out growth?","Alexander M. Cutler","","Yeah, the 3% is our best estimate of these markets, and of course we can be wrong on that, but it\u2019s our best estimate at this point. So, we are not trying to build a cushion, John \u2013 or be overly rest of it, it\u2019s our best estimate at this point.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Can I ask about hydraulics, we had three quarter in a row of high-single digit or low-double digit bookings, and what exactly \u2013 why did that not manifest itself into some better top line, was it \u2013 I mean were there any sort of cancellations of orders, I mean I\u2019ve realized, you\u2019ve got a lot of exposure to say North American Ag, is there anymore color you can give us. We all know what the China headlines are \u2013 is there anything else, that\u2019s going on that might account for that discrepancy?","Alexander M. Cutler","","Our bookings numbers are net of cancellation, so don\u2019t simply gross book and not report cancellation. So, we\u2019ve seen, if you go back, really, you recall it a year ago, it was a fairly weak booking number in the same quarter. Since then, we\u2019ve seen three quarters that were really quite strong, and then we\u2019ve seen the second quarter, that obviously came down. I think what we\u2019ve seen is, the industrial activity has been okay, not great. And the biggest increase was occurring in the mobile side of the marketplace. So, was these with the ag manufacturers, who have clearly backed off at this point. And construction equipment, is okay in the U.S., it\u2019s not great outside the U.S., and it\u2019s pretty awful in China, and I\u2019d say that, that\u2019s where the difference has been, China has actually gone down further.","Richard H. Fearon","","In gentlemen, on the last call we\u2019ve pointed out that often the OEs when they start ordering they\u2019ve quite long dated orders, and so that means that you will have a surge of orders, but they extend that over a long period of time. And that\u2019s why we had some of a gains we had in the prior quarters, as Sandy mentioned actually OE orders were down in the second quarter.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Rick are you suggesting that the three quarters of the strength that actually can still manifest itself even though it\u2019s kind of in future quarters even though the markets are under the pressure you just described.","Richard H. Fearon"," ","Yes. Some of those orders do extend out. Now they are subject to cancellation, but some do extend out into the future. ","Craig Arnold","But John, we\u2019ve mentioned in numerous forms that often what you\u2019ll see large OEM\u2019s do as reserved capacity through orders and they can adjust those, but if they come out of a period of weakness they are trying to ensure they are going to have forward capacity.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","One more from me what would you say to this question that\u2019s out there with Cooper on the ESS side you perhaps there has been pressure on you with respect to market share and so you\u2019ve actually \u2013 you\u2019ve actually had to take price action specifically to Eaton versus the market to try and preserve some market share. I mean, is there aspects of some of that in perhaps some of the mix within the ESS business.","Alexander M. Cutler","","I don\u2019t feel so, I think if you look across the two businesses, the channel based business where you tend to have more of a mix of product where you\u2019d be presenting a mix of product into a channel, I think you\u2019re seeing very solid performance and would have been more likely if your premise was right you would have seen that in the products area. The other segment tends to be one where you are bidding on individual jobs their individual transactions and they don\u2019t always have all the products as your premise was. So I would say no I think you\u2019d see the reciprocal of this performance if that was true.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.\\","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with J. P. Morgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Mike (indiscernible) for Ann. I just had two quick questions. Can you talk about the margins again in Electrical Systems and Services? And I guess if would have pass the 200 basis point year-on-year decline. How much would you put in each of the three buckets you identified?","Alexander M. Cutler","They are about equal. There is not an overload in any one of the three.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then following up on that in aerospace you mentioned 20% growth in bookings for the aftermarket. Any idea or color around how much of that might be provisioning related.","Alexander M. Cutler","Hard for us to know exactly, because after market for us really includes spares, repairs and overhauls and so what we are beginning to see is we are beginning to see some of the news planes that came into service three years ago start to really get into the after business, but you are still seeing the commercial and you are seeing these releases from the large commercial OEM increased in double digit numbers and so that continues to put pressure and trying to get after market to catchup with that kind of number, what we are particularly pleased about in this quarter is the strength was both on the commercial side and military side. And so pretty broad-based strength in that regard. ","Unidentified Analyst ","","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Good morning. Another question on the margin guidance, I\u2019m trying to build up the 26% incremental margin embedded in the full year guidance after \u2013 from doing the math, right what appears to be a first half 19% extra structuring in Q2, and you\u2019ve somewhat addressed it aero side and S&S, but also within that, it looks like you\u2019ve fairly sizeable ramp in electrical products. Is it fair to look at implied second half electrical products incremental margin to be something north of 30%?","Alexander M. Cutler","","I have to do the same calculation you are doing, but yes, again remember our guidance for the segment is higher than what we have achieved for the first two quarters, so I want be sure we\u2019re doing the math the same, but it\u2019s \u2013 we are assuming that we continue to have even higher margins in the second half than we had in the first half, and we feel pretty confident in that. ","Andrew M. Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","And is that just underlying demand, Sandy or are there more synergies falling into the second half than there were in the first half?","Alexander M. Cutler","","There are more synergies in the second half, if you back that chart that we referenced\u2026 ","Richard H. Fearon","But that\u2019s broken up separately, Andy. So you have the normal\u2026","","Alexander M. Cutler","Yeah. Right now, I mean \u2013 that you have in the second half of the year, and obviously a big step up from Q1 to Q2, and then you step up again, about $150 million into Q3 in revenue, and just a slight decline in Q4. And what we\u2019re saying is, we believe of that 26% incremental is appropriate for that revenue increase second half over first half, and we\u2019ve broken the synergies out of the separate line item.","Andrew M. Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Okay, and then just a higher level, and thanks for that Rick and Sandy, a higher level question, if you step back and look at through demand trends, just within North America, I mean we\u2019re seeing kind of mixed performance, but in general things continue to get better, but it\u2019s a little odd, do you have truck acting well, construction okay, but not great, and then what appears to be underlying progress and improvement for electrical businesses, and what are you seeing out there, is it just continued hesitancy for the large projects to get underway, and if so, what\u2019s causing that?","Alexander M. Cutler","I think you describe it right, it\u2019s okay if not super. But I guess, you look at the flash PMIs at 56%, orders of almost 60%, manufacturing industrial product was up pretty solidly high single digits here in the U.S., here in the second quarter. We are seeing more signals we think around non-residential that it looks like it\u2019s picking up some more, the residential is drifted a little bit more and you\u2019ve all seen those numbers, we don\u2019t see utilities moving substantially at this point. ","The construction equipment is a little better but mining is not great. I think on the ag side it\u2019s weak. And if you think about the vehicle Markets, Class 8 is strong, light vehicle continues to be pretty strong almost a 17 million SAR in June and then weak government spending. So you do end up with a little bit of a Ying and a Yang, and that\u2019s why we say, we think, overall you end up with subpar economic growth in the U.S., but it\u2019s better than the rest of the neighborhood. And so when you\u2019re looking at Europe, still struggling to get its full momentum, South America is pretty rugged, China still an attractive overall number, but very inconsistent by market vertical within China.","So I would agree Andy with your general view on it, and that\u2019s why we say we still think the 3% is the right number we don\u2019t think \u2013 for overall Eaton Markets we don't think four is possible with the start, that the year started with. ","Andrew M. Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thanks. Just on hydraulics, the bookings numbers have been bouncing around a lot so I just wanted to check. The sort of operating earnings ex-restructuring were about the same year-on-year in Q2. When you are looking at the second half, you basically assuming a very similar EBIT progressions what you had last year in Hydraulics.","Richard H. Fearon","And generally Julian just in our Hydraulics business with its more heavy mobile loading, generally the first half is a little stronger, the third quarter tends to be the weaker quarter for hydraulics, when you look through the year. And we don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely to be substantially different this year.","Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","","Okay, will your hydraulics earnings be kind of up or down year-on-year in the second half in your guidance?","Richard H. Fearon","Though I have to \u2013 full year-to-year comparisons, we really been looking more in terms at our first half versus our second half.","Sandy Cutler","It should follows the normal seasonality that you saw last year though, Julian. We don't see any reason for us to be different than that.","Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","","Got it. And then in electrical products, as you pulled out a couple of times, you\u2019re looking at a steeper sort of margin jump year-on-year in the second half than what you had in the first half; is that solely related to the sequencing of Cooper synergies or is there something in the underlying business that\u2019s also driving that?","Alexander M. Cutler","","You are seeing pretty strong growth, again I remember second quarter up 6% from the first quarter up 4% from last year, you\u2019re seeing six very attractive quarters in a row of growth about what the most people consider the markets to be. So I think you are getting some leverage in the business there in addition to the fact that, then we get the synergies to drop in as well. So I think we\u2019ve got both of those working for us quite well there.","Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. I mean just lastly, I hate to come back to this, but electrical systems and service, is there \u2013 at some point a view on kind of the market segments that it targets or something more strategic, I guess you\u2019ve had it for about a year and half now, you moved some costing back in Q1 out of products, so I guess is there anything changing strategically on how you\u2019re viewing what\u2019s happening there or is it just sort of a bunch of bad one off items in the first half and those should normalize?","Alexander M. Cutler","","Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a change in market segments, because we serve with our market shares, we serve the very broader array of what\u2019s out there, clearly we\u2019ve made some very substantial progress in oil and gas, but it\u2019s not there is a different economics if you will to that set of end markets activity which is more an issue of logistics, this particular mix.","And as we\u2019ve said, from pricing that really comes, we think from this weaker period of demand, and so we\u2019re encouraged with what we\u2019ve seen with our bookings here in the second quarter. I don\u2019t want to overplay that, but it\u2019s the best set of bookings we\u2019ve seen in six quarters, and I think that\u2019s significant in itself.","Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","","All right. Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Alexander M. Cutler","","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC"," ","Sandy, I was wondering if you could come back to your comments on the spin, and may be just a little color on \u2013 or the difficulty in doing one so that speak, the color on kind of controlling regulation or law that brings you to that conclusion. And I\u2019m also just wondering, there\u2019s obviously been some fresh speculation from myself and others, but these questions have been out there before, I\u2019m just wondering why, what kind of learning aside to your limitation now, does this reflect the fact that you yourselves have dug in and looked at it much more closely, and have found the roadblock or is there some other explanation?","Alexander M. Cutler","","Jeff, let me comment. Because of the legal steps we had to do to complete the Transaction for Cooper, there are a couple of code sections that make it not possible to do a tax free spin for five years, and it\u2019s a conclusion our team can do it, it\u2019s not a simple analysis, but they came to it and then several outside advisors corroborated that. So, we are very certain of that analysis is accurate. ","And, Jeff it\u2019s not new knowledge, we\u2019ve been well aware of this all along and I have tried to indicate that, we had no intent to do any such actions, we\u2019re just trying to help make it clear for people that it\u2019s not simply an issue of will, it\u2019s also an issue of some very technical issues at this point.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","","And if you were to proceed with a spin or similar transaction the spin would just be treated as an asset sale. You can still spend something but it was just be treated as a sale for tax purposes?","Richard H. Fearon","","It actually would be taxed higher than just an asset sale for some complex reason.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","","Okay.","Richard H. Fearon","","So that has been difficult to make work economically.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","","Okay. And then just shifting gears back on price, one of your competitors noted that there was some price pressure in lighting and some of the low voltage areas of their portfolio. Are you seeing that anywhere in the lighting specifically or any of the other kind of industrial low voltage businesses?","Richard H. Fearon","","Again our lighting businesses and our electrical products segment in terms of just thinking where it appears for us and you can see our margins are continued to be quite strong there. I think as the LED conversion goes on, clearly there and we\u2019ve talked to this on a couple of occasions, there is a payback competition if you will between LED and to the traditional lighting sources that were very comfortable with \u2013 where we are positioned with our technology leadership there.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","","And then, just finally from me just a comment on pension, I get it it\u2019s an early read but the market could be in all kinds of gyrations between now and year-end with paper and everything else, that does your comment reflect something idiosyncratic at Eaton intention or is it just the general view on where we think rates and other kind of items might be?","Alexander M. Cutler","","We were simply trying to give some general indication of what would likely happen to our pension expense next year and the easiest way to do that was simply to say if interest \u2013 discount rate stayed about the same, just based on our asset performance and based on some particular things that happened in 2014. We believe that you would see a reduction on expense of about $35 million next year. That can change and will change but it give you a rough indication of what might happen.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","","Next question comes Chris Gleynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher D. Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","","Thanks. Good morning","Alexander M. Cutler","","Good morning","Richard H. Fearon","","Good morning.","Christopher D. Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","","I just had a question in the wake of the two legal settlements if you could comment on, if there is \u2013 you see any potential for customer backlash and market place push back?","Alexander M. Cutler","","I really can\u2019t comment, we don\u2019t expect any at this point, but no further comments.","Christopher D. Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","","Okay. And then on the tax rate, we have 6% for the year. There are a number of adjustments obviously, so it would be helpful if you could just address the 3Q and the two second halves specifically, what we\u2019re looking out for tax rate?","Alexander M. Cutler","","We are expecting the tax rate in the third quarter will be much like the second quarter, it will drop we believe based on our visibility right now, a bit in the fourth quarter.","Christopher D. Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley & Co.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks. Just a couple of clarifications. I hate to dive back into ESS margins, but Sandy can you put finer points on what's causing the second half improvement versus the first half and you\u2019ve mentioned price mix and freights and hopefully then we have the higher volumes coming through in the orders, is it repetition of Boeing leverage on the order pick up or is it, are we seeing improvement in price mix. And if you can just give us \u2013 if you can just give us quite a bit of detail on price mix delta you\u2019ve seen, second quarter and second half?","Alexander M. Cutler","I\u2019d say it\u2019s both of the items you mentioned, one is obviously it\u2019s having the far stronger quarter of booking. We start the quarter with a full backlog, and secondly we\u2019ve got, I\u2019d say an improved look in that backlog versus what we had as we came through the last quarter. So I\u2019d say bulk of those items are \u2013 were influencing our thinking relative to the second half being stronger than the first half?","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And what\u2019s caused the improvement in price mix in the last three months?","Alexander M. Cutler","It\u2019s better pricing. I don\u2019t mean to be flip about it, but it happens to be the mix of projects and there are 100s and 100s of individual projects that are represented in any one month. So it\u2019s very hard to be, it\u2019s this project or it\u2019s that project, but it\u2019s a collective math of what we\u2019ve seen in terms of projects in the marketplace and what we\u2019ve landed.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then, Rick, just coming back to the pension of $35 million, does that bake in the penalty schedule?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, it does. Again, this is still half year away. But it does bake that in.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","","We are going to have time this morning for one additional question because of the number of other calls going on simultaneously, we want to be respectful of that. So we have time for one more question this morning. And that comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeffrey Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hey, guys. Most of my questions have been answered. Can you just talk about what\u2019s driving the better free cash flow guidance?","Alexander M. Cutler","","That\u2019s slightly lower free cash flow you mean, and we reduced both operating cash flow and free cash flow by $200 million and it's two factors as our working capital performance has not improved to the extent that we had thought it might and then secondly the reduction in the net point of our earnings guidance that\u2019s what behind the $200 change.","Jeffrey Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","In the working capital is that related to the Cooper deal that you\u2019re hoping to get improvement there or.","Alexander M. Cutler","No. It\u2019s much more broadly just in terms of where we really seen receivables and inventory so far this year. So, it\u2019s really a tuning up based upon where we are at high year. ","Jeffrey Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks.","Alexander M. Cutler","I want to thank you all for joining us today.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn this conference over to our host, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead sir.","Don Bullock","Good morning. I\u2019m Don Bullock, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us today for Eaton\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings call. With me this morning are Sandy Cutler, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Sandy, highlighting the company\u2019s performance in the first quarter, along with our outlook for the remainder 2015. As has been our practice on prior calls, we\u2019ll be taking questions at the end of Sandy\u2019s comments.","The press release today from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we\u2019ll go through have been posted on www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.","Before we get started with Sandy\u2019s comments, I\u2019d like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and therefore are considered forward-looking statements.","Our actual results may differ materially from those forecasted projections due to a range of risk and uncertainties we\u2019ve described in our earnings release and our presentation. They are also outlined in the related 8-K.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sandy.","Sandy Cutler","Great, Thanks, Don, and welcome, everybody. I'm going to work on the presentation that was posted on our website earlier this morning. I\u2019m going to start on Page 3. I'll give you a moment to get there as titled Highlights of Q1 results.","We started the year, I think as you\u2019ve all seen with a solid high-quality quarter, and in spite of, what was obviously, weak economic conditions, I think we've all just seen this morning the 0.2% U.S. GDP growth. And in summary, really our balanced strategy is working. Our balance from a geographic point of view, our balance across our individual businesses and that's what allowed us to deliver what we think is a solid first quarter.","Operating earnings per share of $1.01 was a penny above our guidance, about $0.03 above consensus. And when we look through the individual pieces, the top line was just marginally weaker, a split about half between physical volume and additional FX impact. You've seen in our guidance that we now things that the FX full-year impact will be larger than we thought it would be when we started the year and I'll comment more on that in just a minute.","We continue to do, I think, a very strong job of controlling our corporate expenses. They were down about a penny. And our tax rate came in closer to 8% versus the midpoint of our guidance for the full-year of 10%. And that accounted for about $0.02. So overall we think a very strong quarter in spite of some bumps out there in the economy and think off to a good start for the year.","Our sales were $5.2 billion, down 5%. When you curve that apart, organic growth of 1%, and then this larger impact of FX of negative 6%. Our segment margins came in right where we thought they would be, 14.6%, up from 14.5% a year ago, down from the 15.9% in the fourth quarter, but as I said, in line with our expectations for the first quarter, which is normally a seasonally weaker quarter for us.","We did repurchased $170 million of our shares, about 2.4 million shares. You'll recall that last year we had repurchased 650 million shares or about 2% of our outstanding. And our Cooper integration is right on track. You\u2019ll recall that this year we\u2019re counting on $150 million of incremental synergy profits compared to 2014. And in the first quarter, we did achieve $29 million. So we are on track and I'll talk more about that as we go through the two electrical segments.","If you turn to Page 4, just a quick summary overall of the financial results. You see the comments in the light green box in the lower hand corner about organic growth versus Forex. You\u2019ll also I think get a sense looking at the sales number. Obviously a decrease in sales but obviously was positive organic growth. I think you\u2019ve probably digested most of the numbers on this page, so I'm going to recommend we turn onto Page 5 and start with an overview of the performance of our individual segments.","Let's start with the electrical products segment. Significant. Obviously it\u2019s about 33% of the total company revenues. Sales were down 2% from last year. And if I could refer you to start here, you\u2019re looking at the light green box in the lower left hand corner. Organic growth was up 4%, very solid again. You\u2019ll recall it was up 5% in the fourth quarter. Clearly we see a big impact of Forex here at negative 6% and that sort of results on the overall down 2%.","In terms of the booking activity, very strong bookings once again, up 5%. You'll recall in the fourth quarter, they were up 4%. And the story is much the same as we shared with you over the last couple of quarters. The strength was in the Americas, where we were up 7%, and then weaker outside the U.S. We were particularly pleased - and you will hear this as we talk about many of our businesses. The quarter started quite weakly in January and February. We commented on that when we were in New York at our meetings then. And we were very gratified obviously that the months ended strongly in March. So you'll see strong bookings results in a number of our businesses. And I think that\u2019s parallel to what we were seeing in the economy generally with the slow January and February and then quite a recovery in the month of March.","If we think about markets, we\u2019re continuing to see real strength in the residential and non-residential construction markets, particularly strength in lighting, where again we were up very strongly at 16% this quarter, so a very strong quarter. Also have seen some rebound in our businesses in our electrical businesses in Latin America and Canada. The weakness in the U.S. has been around industrial. And I think you have heard that from a couple of companies that there seems to be a little bit more of a malaise on industrial spending.","In Asia-Pacific, as the mentioned conditions continue a little weaker mixed country by country. And Europe is still caught and waiting for the recovery really to occur.","I did want to comment on the margin. You see the margins at 15.7%, actually below last year's 16.2%. And obviously there, there are a couple of things going on here that I wanted to provide some insights to you. The volume is down and we shared with you this year that we thought our incremental or decremental will be on the order of 20%. We did achieve about half of that synergy savings and remember the synergy savings of $29 million is made up of $24 million of cost and $5 million our profits that come from higher sales. So what you would see on this line is really the half of the $24 million or positive $12 million.","And what was offsetting it was actually embedded exchange of about negative $10 million. And this has to do with product made in the U.S. that is then used in Canada. And typically you heard us talk about our practice as being to manufacturing on the currency, clearly the drop in the Canadian dollar has not had quite the highlight that the euro and the Brazilian reals have, but it did impact us. We've been able to - as we\u2019d comment a little later on it, to put mechanisms in place that we think solve this in the second quarter. But it did hit us in both this segment and then you'll see also in the electrical systems & services. In spite of that, we made our full guidance.","Then the last would be is that we've had a little bit of negative mix. And here we think that recovers full-year. We've not changed our overall guidance. And so I'll be glad to talk more about that as we get to questions.","If we move to the electrical systems & services segment. This particular segment is about 29% of the company\u2019s revenues. You'll recall, we had as you see sales down some 5%. If you look down to the lower left hand corner, you'll see that Forex is the big contributor to that, although organic sales were down about 1%. You'll recall last year we talked quite a bit about the fact that the way to think about this segment is to look at bookings in the previous couple of quarters are good indication of what you'll see in shipments, because this is a backlog business. And you\u2019ll recall in the fourth quarter bookings were flat - in the first quarter, they were flat.","A little different regional participation here that the real strength here was in APAC, with the rest of the regions; America flat, Europe down, Asia-Pac up. And the business that really was up for us in Asia-Pacific was the large three-phase power quality market shipping into large datacenters, and we had a particularly successful booking quarter in that regard in Asia.","Very pleased with the margin performance. Obviously stronger than a year-ago, even though the volumes were lower. And we also were offsetting some Canadian embedded exchange problems here, and you see the benefits coming through of about $12 million of synergy cost benefits in this segment as well.","If we switch to the hydraulic segment. Again, roughly about 13% of the company sales, down 15%. If the organic pressure has not been enough and obviously you see it\u2019s 9% in this quarter. It was 2% last quarter negative. The Forex impacted obviously hit this segment pretty hard as well of negative 6%. So overall volumes down 15%, margins at 10.1%. We did, as we had shared with you, we are doing restructuring in this business in light of the end-markets. We can talk more about that later. But the way I'd have you think about the restructuring is that in light of the magnitude of the down wraps in these end-markets, we will have restructuring expense in every quarter as we go through this year and it'll be on about the same level as we had this year, basically taking somewhere between a point and point and half out of margins in every quarter as we go through the year.","If we talk about bookings. Bookings down 18%. I don't think the OEM news is probably noteworthy in terms of this is not tremendously different experience that we've been seeing over the last several quarters. But you'll recall in the fourth quarter, our distributor orders were actually positive and they were negative in this quarter. And what we are seeing is the roll-through in the distribution of some of these end-markets we\u2019ve talked about, oil and gas, Ag. Both of them - we serve some of the smaller OEMs through distribution in those marketplaces. That's where we see the weakness in distribution. We see strength in other areas in terms of construction, vocational vehicle, some of the marine markets and then kind of flattish conditions in industrial. But I think really what we're seeing here is the continued roll-through of negative oil and gas and negative Ag investment.","As we go outside the U.S, the story is very much the same in terms of the weakness in the global agricultural markets. And the China construction equipment market really does not show much signs of improvement at this point. So conditions not terribly different than we've been talking about, except for we\u2019re starting to see the roll-through in the distribution side. And that's why you'll see we've taken our guidance down in terms of the margin in this business, and I\u2019ll talk also a little bit about more negative outlook in terms of end-markets here.","The good news as we turn to page as this is being made up for by the performance in our aerospace segment, again one of the balanced - benefits of balance for Eaton. Flat sales. Profits up 24%. Again, we are quite pleased with the organic sales here. If you look at the lower left hand corner, 8% positive organic sales. That followed 9% organic last quarter, being offset by the divestitures that you\u2019ll remember that we divested in the second quarter of last year and then negative Forex.","If we look at the bookings, maybe a little caution though when we look at the 1%, but we still think the conditions are quite strong. Generally, we saw that some of the placements from the commercial transport segment within commercial weren\u2019t quite as strong during this quarter. As we\u2019ve seen them, we remained void however by the forward-looking line rates which we have from all our OEMs, which are continuing to expand. So we think that's fairly temporary. The military side was down in this quarter, but the aftermarket strong, and we are pleased about this continuing aftermarket booking, particularly on the commercial side where we've seen it pick-up during the last three quarters now.","And finally, if we can move to Chart 9, our vehicle business, about 17% of the company. Sales down 4%. But again if you look to the small green chart in the left hand corner, organic up 4%. You\u2019ll remember last quarter organic was up 8% percent, so continued strong performance offset by, not only euro but here you see the big impact of the Brazilian currency, down 8%. And so overall, the overall business down 4%. Profits helpfully up 9%.","And our outlook remains much the same as you've heard us talk about here in North America, where we continue to think that this year's Class-8 build forecast would be about 330,000 units. It's pretty well balanced half in the first half and half in the second half in terms of our outlook. We continue to think the backlog is healthy and supports that. Good strength in the light vehicle markets here.","But further weakness in the South America vehicle and agricultural equipment markets, not unlike I think you\u2019ve heard from a number of other companies and that's why we\u2019ve actually lowered our growth outlook for the full-year in terms of these markets. It's all based on the South American weakness.","If we move to Chart 10. As I said that economic conditions started a little weaker in 2015. We think we've had very strong margin performance in aerospace and vehicle that helped to offset some of the weakness on the hydraulic side. The overall 3% bookings improvement, when you put the two electrical sectors together, is encouraging to us particularly the pace in March. On the other side, clearly we're seeing continued weakness in hydraulics.","And we\u2019re pleased we\u2019re able to achieve 10 basis point improvement in our margins and only 1% organic growth increase. And our decision to go ahead and repurchase $170 million of shares, I think continues our pattern of opportunistic purchases.","If we turn to Chart 11. Just a quick recap of our expectations of organic revenue. You'll recall that our guidance, when we talked with you at the beginning of the year in total for the company was 3% to 4%. It's now 2% to 3%. And really where that change has taken place is the biggest changes in the hydraulics markets, where we had started this year thinking they would be somewhere between zero and negative 2%. You could see based upon weaker conditions in the U.S., Europe and Asia, we think it's likely to be more now in the order of negative 2% to negative 4%. No change in aerospace. Vehicle has come down from 5% to 7%, to 3% to 5%. That\u2019s all based upon the continued negative outlook in South America. No change in EMEA or North America.","And then electrical is down just one point from where we started the year. And that's really based on a little bit more tepid growth in Asia. No real change in the U.S. or Europe outlooks at this point.","Turning to Page 12. I commented a little bit on this, and you'll recall that when we gave our guidance this year, we talked about 20% incrementals and decrementals. That was based upon this economic outlook that I talked little bit about, slow global growth, challenges particularly in Europe and Latin America, hydraulic market downgrades and FX pressure. And so you\u2019ll see here is that we have not changed our overall margin performance. We came in where we expected to be in the first quarter. We\u2019ve strengthened our outlook in aerospace based upon the very strong performance in the first quarter and our expectations of that continuing on a pretty steady rate through the balance of the year. And then we\u2019ve lowered hydraulics down a point in light of the weaker start this year and where we think the markets are likely to be this year without any recovery.","Moving to Page 13. A couple of quick points about our guidance. This is our first guidance we\u2019re providing for the second quarter, $1.10 to $1.20 operating earnings per share. Obviously the midpoint of that is $1.15. You all know, for those of you who followed Eaton for sometime that we have a pretty standard 5% seasonal revenue increase between Q1 and Q2. On a physical volume basis, that's again what we expect this year. We think it's supported by what we\u2019re seeing in our markets. Offset by probably a negative point of additional FX compared to the first quarter of this year. So that nets you out in sort of 4% net of FX top-line. We do expect to get about a point improvement in our margins, again pretty usual for us between the first and second quarter. And because the tax rates started a little lower this year and we\u2019re maintaining our full-year guidance of 9% to 11%, we think that the second through fourth quarters are likely to be more in the area of 10% to 11% in terms of tax rates.","Full-year. We revised our guidance to $4.65 to $4.95, pretty much in line with current consensus that\u2019s been out there, $4.82. And a reduction of 2% from our original guidance this year is primarily due to higher negative FX impact. You'll recall we started the year thinking that FX would negatively impact our top-line on the order of about $900 million. We think it's closer to $1.2 billion at this point. And that really is the explanation for the change.","If we flip to Page 14. We\u2019ve tried to give you a quick summary of our guidance. We\u2019ve provide you with the February, all the points I just made about our April guidance and you can see where the changes are down one point and organic growth down $300 million of additional FX pressure. No change in the segment margins, but down in hydraulics, up in aerospace, again the benefit of our breath. About a $20 million reduction in the collection of our corporate expenses that we show you there. And then that obviously leads the $0.10 reduction or 2% reduction in our overall guidance for the year.","I think significantly if you look at the operating cash flow number, you'll recall that we've not change those numbers, still $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion. They do represent a 15% increase from last year, some $2.5 billion, $3 billion in operating cash flow. So we remain quite bullish in our cash outlook and that really sets up the discussion we\u2019ll have with your about capital structure following our second quarter\u2019s earnings release.","So if we move to 15, our summary. Again we think a very solid first quarter. We did see a necessary acceleration in March, recovering from the weaker January, February. I mentioned the FX that we think now will impact our top-line by about negative 5%, again the trade-off of aerospace versus hydraulic margins. And then if we think about this overall guidance of $4.80, it does represent 3% growth over last year. But within that, I think other factors we\u2019ve talked with many of you about this year is that we are anticipating obviously this $1.2 billion negative impact of Forex, which is about $0.26 full-year negative for us that's higher obviously than what we outlined to you in January. And then about a negative $0.17 for the tax rate. So there is about negative $0.42 from those two items that are embedded in our year-to-year comparison. And that negative $0.43 is compared to the $0.36 that we had outlined for you in the first quarter.","And then once again, the Cooper integration savings very much on target. Obviously it's one of the reasons that our profitability is higher in the second half than the first half because you'll recall back to Tom Gross\u2019s presentation in February, we are finishing out many of the manufacturing plant moves and that's the next big piece really, the savings that come in and I am very pleased to report those plans and actions are very much on plan at this point.","So with that, Don, why don't we open things for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Very good. [Operator Instructions]","Don Bullock","Before we begin our Q&A session today, I see that we have a number of individuals queued up with questions. Due to our time constraints for an hour today, I would ask that you please hold it to a single question and a follow-up. Thank you very much in advance for your cooperation, so we can get to as many of these questions as possible. Our first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning guys. Trying to sell get a sense of if the strength in March continued through April, and what would you attribute that the strength in March to, given the week start to the year, was it inventories finally got low enough, or there was a bit of a restock, or do think there is some real macro acceleration, particularly things like non-res?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, we don't have April results yet, Scott. But I guess our thoughts about March is that we really saw a fairly weak order patterns in January and February. Hard to know whether those are attributed to the weather, whether they were attributed to concerns about port strikes or all of the above. We\u2019re pleased. What we did see was a very strong activity in March. And I don't want to overplay that because as you normally find that the third months in the first quarter is disproportionately important. And so we see some of that pattern every year. But it was stronger really across the board in terms of end-market segments that we saw within those businesses. And we're off to, I would say a reasonable start from what we can tell in April, but we don't have final numbers yet.","Scott Davis","Understood. And I don't know much about the hydraulics business, but when I look at your total year for cash negative 2% negative 4% coming off of negative 9% this quarter. I mean that does imply maybe you expect a real improvement back-end loaded improvement of somewhat. Is that - I'm asking if it\u2019s a realistic assumption? I guess when I look at it, I\u2019m a little skeptical. Maybe you can make us feel a bit better about that?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, I think the issue again that what we are seeing is that the - we have seen a fair number or most of the weakness come out of the OEM side. That's not a typical when the hydraulics market is going through a change in cycle. So most of the bookings that we are receiving now are bookings that are coming in for the short-term, kind of one through three months. It feels a lot like what we saw when we saw the inflection changes back in 2008, 2009. We\u2019ve looked pretty hard at this forecast. We think it's a realistic forecast at this point, but we\u2019re not forecasting. This business will look pretty flattish as we go through this year. There will be some improvements in margins that will come from the restructuring we are doing. But we obviously took a point out of our margin guidance for the year in light of the fact that we don't see this rebound really happening at this point.","Scott Davis","Okay, good answer. Thanks guys and good luck.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you and good morning. So my first question I guess just would be on the aero margins this quarter. Was there anything specific that really drove the strength, the 320 basis points? I see that you guys have a step-down as the year progresses. And I'm just curious like what was really underlying the strength in that business this quarter?","Sandy Cutler","Well, again if you look back over the last portion of last year, our business was strengthening as well and so that we've got a business that we think is being very well run. There always is the two kind of issues that are going on in any aerospace business. There is the current shipments and then there is a development project or new order project work. And I think the team is doing a good job on both of those.","So I wouldn\u2019t point out any one issue of being unusual. We had good order placements all last year. You're seeing the commercial side of the market continue to be quite strong. The defense side hasn't been as bad as some people had forecasted. Now, that has a lot to do with the specific programs we are on. But I think we are also doing a better job of managing our new development projects. And so that has helped to margin structure as well. So while we\u2019re saying that we think the margins will be fairly consistent through the end of the year, I think that's a reflection that we\u2019re comfortable with the market outlook and I think our teams are doing a really good job on managing these big projects.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, fair enough. And maybe my follow-up. Just a question, Sandy, when you're walking through the puts and takes on electrical products this quarter, clearly organic growth was good. It seems like you had $12 million in synergies that came through that was a positive. FX was a negative $10 million and yet operating profit was down despite the organic growth that came through. And so I'm just curious, was there something about your mix this quarter on why you weren\u2019t able to grow profit on the electrical product side this quarter?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, and I did mention that there was a negative mix. And I think most people know that the lighting industry doesn't have quite the margins that some of the component businesses that we\u2019re in do. And I mentioned our lighting business was up some 16% in the quarter again doing very, very well. So we're very pleased with that business. But it didn't have a positive mix impact upon us.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, great. Helpful. I'll get back in the queue.","Sandy Cutler","Yes, thanks.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeff Hammond","Good morning guys. Just back on that FX transaction dynamic with Canada. Can you quantify what that was in the quarter? And then I think Sandy you mentioned - Rick could maybe clarify what you're doing going forward to kind of pull that out of the dynamics?","Rick Fearon","I mentioned it was about $10 million in the product segment. And it's less than that and...","Jeff Hammond","It\u2019s around $5 million.","Sandy Cutler","And the situation, Jeff, is that as you know we largely neutralize FX by manufacturing and selling in the same region, where we have an intra-region exposure, we attempt to put hedges in place to neutralize that. But you\u2019re limited by uncertainty about volumes and in some cases by regulatory limitations. And in the case of the flow to Canada, it's really the Cooper product flowing to Canada. They had not had a program in place because of some regulatory changes that occurred towards the end of last year. We weren\u2019t able to hedge as much of that Cooper flow as we normally would. But the good news is that we now have gotten through those flows what we hedged starting into second quarter. So this is an issue that should go away as those hedges works their magic [ph].","Jeff Hammond","Okay, great. And then, can you just, Sandy, give us an update assessment of what you're seeing in your energy facing businesses relative to kind of how you're thinking about it? And maybe just sliding one more, just give us a free cash flow number for the quarter?","Sandy Cutler","Our view on the oil and gas business is very similar to what we describe you upfront. Now you may recall, our forecast for this year was that it might have a little bit more pressure than some others had outlined early in the year. But the way we think about it is oil and gas is about 6%. It's the same number I told you in the last quarter. And that you really have to think about this in terms of sort of the upstream, midstream and downstream exposure. The majority of Eaton\u2019s exposure is downstream, approximately 70%. And so when we look through all of this, we've said we thought that the upstream onshore would be on the order of 35% impact negative this year. Offshore would be closer to something around 25%. Now you\u2019ve got to take all of these with - it's a plus or minus 5% off of those. And there is no accounting accuracy to forecast out in a market like this.","And we think the downstream gets affected a little less. It\u2019s more on the order of about 20%. So when you put that all together, you come up with something that probably says that we see something on the order of 20% pressure in terms of oil and gas for Eaton this year.","That indeed as we've spend a lot of time in a lot of regions in the world talking to OEMs, users, distributors, EPCs seems to be pretty well laying out in terms of the activity as we see it. We've also indicated, Jeff, that we think that some of the order weakness that people will see this year will manifest itself next year in terms of shipments. So a lot of the shipments impact will occur kind of in the second half and then into next year, because there are a lot of projects that are underway that they are going to complete versus just stopping those in half way through it. So that's our view of oil and gas at this point. It spelt differently in distribution than it is in terms of the OEM side as well and little different timing.","Rick Fearon","Jeff, you asked about operating cash flow and free cash flow. Operating cash flow, before the pension contribution, was $300 million. We made $223 million pension contribution both, U.S. qualified as well as the non-qualified portions and the international portions in the quarter. And CapEx was just over a $100 million.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore.","David Raso","Hi good morning. Questions on the electrical outlook. Your order growth accelerated a bit, but you lowered the organic sales outlook. Can you flush that out for us a little bit?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, it really is a mix as we look around the world, David. I guess I mentioned the change. We've not changed the U.S. That is where we continue to see strength and did last year as well. We are seeing conditions to be a little bit choppy in Asia. And clearly China is I think the question in many people's mind as to exactly what the growth will be and in what segment. Of our view is that it is slower than we had originally anticipated there. So that's the primary change. So we are continuing to do quite well in the U.S. and that is the area that obviously it\u2019s the best house in the neighborhood currently.","David Raso","And you made a comment about Europe not necessarily seeing a recovery yet. Is there any signs at all in the order book, or is it just status quo and it's just optimism at this stage?","Sandy Cutler","No, we've actually seen on the product side - speaking to electrical, we've actually seen there a slight uptick. We're seeing orders up kind of on the order 2% to 3% there. We've not seen it on the larger kind of system side at this point in Europe. So maybe a little bit more of a maintenance spend, if you will. I know we're seeing a lot written about with the euro dropping that we are going to see MLM [ph] or machine builders start to be more competitive. We've not yet seen that yet. Our, I guess experience with that is that it general takes more than a couple of months. It's usually six months to a year of these kind of basic currency changes to see substantial changes in the export patterns. And so that may still be out ahead of us.","David Raso","And lastly, the CEO succession planning with the mandatory retirement. When should we expect an announcement regarding that?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, we don't have a further update for you. The board will make that announcement when they are ready to make the announcement.","David Raso","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Don Bullock","Sure. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning, guys. Sandy, you mentioned the recovery sort of paralleling what you're saying in the economy. I guess fair amount of the economic data has been choppy too. Can you maybe just flush that out a little bit?","Sandy Cutler","So, I think we were hearing during the early part of the year, January and February, people were asking questions when you see a similar weather impact that we saw last year, while it was cold, we didn't have what I\u2019m going to call the devastating ice storms that we had a year ago that really hit that Carolinas in such a big way. And so I think as people got through that, they relaxed a little bit about the full impact of the weather. We obviously had the port strikes that went on that affected some portions of the economy. But I think it's clear that January and February were weak, and we saw those months not being spectacular months I'm talking to the U.S. in terms of activity.","The second issue that's a little different this year than a year ago, and all of you are well aware of this is that Chinese New Year was really prolonged period of time this year. Some people talk about it being almost five weeks long. I think a reflection effect that again that governments and companies took advantage of the holiday time to simply extend it to try to eat up some of the weak economic conditions.","But then March obviously came on much stronger. And I think that's somewhat the recovery for maybe people under-spending in January and February. Having said that, I think having the benefit of like four hours or three hours since the GDP numbers came out this morning, I don't think many people were surprised that the U.S. GDP came out that this fraction of what was already a pretty dollar forecast of 1% and it came out obviously you all thought as well at 0.2%. That's not a whole lot of growth in the economy that\u2019s supposed to be the one that\u2019s most ambulant in the period of time. So I think again it simply says we\u2019re in a period of time of relative moderate global growth. And that's why these self-help stories such as the $150 million of incremental savings from the Coopers deal are particularly important.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on the strength in three-phase power quality in Asia. Should we think about that as just kind of nice win for you in a tough market, or are you actually seeing market conditions get any better there?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, there is a lot of dataset - datacenter building being talked about in Asia. It says a number there being let is not still a very high number. So I think it's a reflection that we are doing quite well in a market that's not going growing as quickly as it was couple of years ago.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay, great. Thanks.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning. Can we go back to hydraulics for a moment? I have to admit that I share Scott Davis\u2019 skepticism. Given that 50% of that business is either energy, agricultural or construction\/mining, where exactly are you expecting the improvements, given what we saw in Q1 and where the orders are?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, and again our forecast is pretty flat in this business. So we are not expecting from a shipment point of view substantial improvement during this year. We are continuing to receive orders, but if you go back and look at the part of the challenge we\u2019re looking at the order comparison as we go back and look at orders, they were still relatively good in the early part of the last year. We\u2019re living off the orders of the second year. So we're much more consistent with the order patterns in the second half of last year in our shipment patterns. So we're not suggesting a big recovery. Neither are we suggesting a huge recovery in margins. We do think margins will be marginally better in the second half than the first half, but primarily as the result of the restructuring we're doing.","Rick Fearon","And if you just look, Ann, I might add that the growth rates - the comparisons get markedly easier as you go through the year, given that the business that started to substantially decline sales-wise in the second of last year.","Ann Duignan","Yes. I appreciate that primarily in the Ag space but okay, I'll take it offline maybe. Just a follow-up then on your half forecast. Sandy I think you mentioned in your comments that you now expect the 330 build to be roughly 50-50 first half - second half?","Sandy Cutler","Correct.","Ann Duignan","And last quarter that was most skewed seasonally to first half versus second half. What\u2019s change there or is it just nuance?","Sandy Cutler","I think it's far more nuance than anything else, Ann. We continue to think this is going to be a very strong year for truck. We aren\u2019t seeing any reasons to choose any differently. That's in NAFTA what we're talking.","Ann Duignan","Yes.","Sandy Cutler","But we see obviously the more weakness when we get down to Latin America, particularly driven by the real challenges in the Brazilian economy.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from John Inch of Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","Thanks. Good morning everyone.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning, John.","John Inch","Hi Sandy, do you think that if you kind of look at the way this winter played out, the Northeast and Canada and Midwest had a really tough February. And a year ago we had tough January and March. So just trying to think back to electrical and what happened. Is it possible given sort of end-markets and stocking\/destocking that sort of thing that effectively what happened is because March had, call it easier comparison February and wasn't as bad that maybe things that might have been delayed or deferred in February got slipped into the March. I'm just trying to understand if really the March trends you\u2019ve seen are sustainable?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, I would say, John, in both years, we really did not see a destocking in one month then a restocking in the other. I don't think that was as much of an issue, because it's hard for distributors to simply destock one month, restock the next. That's normally the way they think. They are trying to now think about spring, is what they are thinking about in March. And what they want to have on the shows for the time period and we think their view is that the non-residential and residential continues to be pretty strong this winter in the areas you just talked about. There wasn't much going on obviously with the weather being bad. We can't put an accounting accuracy to that. That's our best sense. We're trying to do the same thing you are, try to understand with a very, very strong March because it was both on the product side as well on the systems and services side.","Does that automatically carryover in the spring? It's a little too early for us to know because generally April is a tough month to read the whole quarter on. May and June become very important in the second quarter.","John Inch","I think that's a fair answer. I mean, we know that - and obviously we know non-resi and construction markets are still improving. Here is the sort of the second part of my question. I want to go back to restructuring. I think you had targeted 35% to 40% for the year, and this is going to be weighted to hydraulics and so forth. Your peer competitor in Cleveland, Parker-Hannifin, you sort of listened to their call and their offline commentary and you look at the GDP print this market. Debatably we could almost already be in an industrial manufacturing recession. And I realize each and every company has their own mix and buying your shares and so forth. But my question is, do you have a playbook that you would theoretically - because you did restructuring last year be accelerating restructuring? And if so, what is that playbook or you just sort of not there yet because you don't have enough information?","Sandy Cutler","I think maybe a very appropriate question, John, because I think everyone is trying to get a sense, particularly on the industrial side of the economy, so getting away from a commercial construction and getting away from non-res, so what's really happening. And our plan I think as you recall as we outlined it as that this year in our electrical business obviously we are finishing out much of the integration of the Cooper business, and inherent in that is about $40 million, that was in our guidance overall for integration expense of $45 million of work that we're doing there. And so that we have the benefit of still bringing those two franchises together and getting them sized and equipped well for what we think the current environment is.","We had said in hydraulics that restructuring would be somewhere between about a point and point and a half impact on margins, and you can obviously calculate that to the kind of number you just mentioned. And that we think that goes on all the way through this year. And so we have a fairly active playbook to your point in place. We have been obviously committed to being sure that we go deep enough to really deal with what is weaker in hydraulics. And we think that is the plan we put in place. We've got different businesses than some of our competitors, but we think we are well sized at this point for the outlook we've outlined for you.","John Inch","And Rick, raising debt to repurchase your shares? Is that a new strategy or are you being opportunistic or - it looks like you raised about $170 million of debt?","Rick Fearon","Well, we didn't really raised debt. We had a term debt maturity on April 1, which is a pretty unusual date do have a maturity. So we simply took down commercial paper to make that payment and the plan is as we get towards the end of Q2, we would not expect to have any substantial CPE on the balance sheet at the end of Q2. So it was really just, I'd call it a tactical funding requirement, because of the calendar of the term debt repayment.","John Inch","Got it. Thanks guys.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow.","Eli Lustgarten","Good morning, everyone.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning, Eli.","Eli Lustgarten","Can we talk a little bit questions of what's going on in some of the regions outside the U.S., particularly South America, which is Brazil is a complete mess it looks like, and it really has a big impact probably on hydraulics and vehicle in some of your reporting. And touching on that, can you talk about pricing? Of course those businesses and really around the world of what's happening in price competition at this point?","Sandy Cutler","The business that has the biggest impact for us, Eli, in terms of Latin America is our vehicle business. It really - and as we've shared with you, almost 30% of our revenues in vehicle come out of South America in particular. So that's really the focal point for us I guess as we think about that area. And you're right, the Brazilian economy. And we've talked with many of you at great depth about it, our concern over the last couple of years that there were a lot of macro policies that were just kind of end up with a problem and that\u2019s indeed what we've ended up with at this point.","So we don't see the likelihood that that economy is going to recover this year. Our own forecast is that the manufacturing IP is going to be negative several points in Brazil this year. It\u2019s a GDP that\u2019s likely to shrink one to two points this year. You don't see that in many countries. And so I think it talks about the challenge over there.","And you're right and if you get to the West Coast and a couple of the economies, it looked like promising a couple of years ago, be the Peru or Chile. With the mining pullback, they've obviously been heavily impacted as well. So it is a more difficult region in terms of growth. There are individual product lines and all that were doing well in, but I think you\u2019d have to market as a disappointing region versus ours and many people's thoughts a couple of years ago.","Eli Lustgarten","And can you talk about pricing across the businesses. So I mean, it looks like with not much inflation and pricing is getting relatively competitive in some of the electrical businesses and hydraulic businesses?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, our net on it - because I guess the way we all think about pricing is our cost versus pricing versus the new products that we are introducing that have got a better price point or better margin point and overall pretty neutral for us this year. We've just taken a pretty deep dive on that across all of our businesses and it's not that conditions aren\u2019t competitive, but I'd say that in terms of impact to our margin is pretty neutral.","Eli Lustgarten","All right. Thank you.","Sandy Cutler","Yes.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning guys.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just a follow-up on the electrical guidance and some of the tweaks to the organic growth there. Sandy, you mentioned Asia being a little bit of drag there and that was the reason for that downward revision, but you also talked about strength in ESS in APAC. So I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the two and where is the weakness, and is there is something in the order book that concerns you, or what's driving that?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, I guess I would start again and say recognize these are fine-tunings. They are not what I would call wholesale changes. And so it's a matter of which way we kind of round things. But markets generally were weaker in the first quarter than we had thought they would start. And I think that's really across many of our businesses, not just electrical or hydraulics. And I think you'll see that in the GDP data, not only here but elsewhere. At the same time, there are a number of encouraging numbers that are out there as well. I think some of the news residential in the U.S., you just saw new ABI data this morning which is never conclusive but at least is pointing at a little bit more positive direction.","And so I wouldn't overreact one way or the other on, and I think it's more of fine-tuning. I think one of the pieces of data I think everyone is struggling a little bit right now is the non-residential information which you saw as part of GDP this morning, showed a negative number in terms of non-res investment. We actually think non-res construction was probably up in the order of something around 3%-ish in the first quarter, and we think it will be somewhere between there and 5% when we look at the full-year. So obviously that means we think it picks up as you get into the better seasonal portions of this year.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Okay, I guess I meant specifically Asia sounded like it was both, better and worse?","Sandy Cutler","Let me come back to Asia. On Asia, I would say it's really an issue of China. We think China is continuing to slow. That doesn't mean it's going negative. It means its rate of growth is slower, and that does have an impact in terms of large projects in our power distribution business.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Okay. And then just one more follow-up on the vehicle business. Clearly some headwinds that you guys are seeing in Brazil on the Ag on truck side, but keeping the margin assumption there unchanged. I understand it's a pretty high mix business for you guys, so is there more that you're doing on restructuring or some other benefits that's offsetting that?","Sandy Cutler","No, I'd say that we think 200 basis point expansion in margins, so when volumes are coming down it really speaks to the productivity and the costs, but it's not wholesale restructuring. You'll recall last year we did some restructuring in our vehicles business. We had said that would provide some benefit this year, but as not as much about current year restructuring as it is about the benefits that we got from last year. Recall there is about $35 million of benefit that flowed into 2015 from restructuring actions that took place in our industrial sector, and vehicle was one of those segments we spent the money in last year.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Yes. Thanks guys.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","If you take a look at the oil and gas that you described, I think down 25%, and please correct some of my assumption if they were off, but I think about 90% of that's going to land in ESS. And it's pretty good mix to - you have solid margin expansion in the outlook. So I'm just wondering how you're factoring in that mix impact and maybe FX is actually a positive to ESS margin, I don't know.","Sandy Cutler","Chris I\u2019m sorry, I missed the first part of your question because there was another comment on the line and we couldn't hear you.","Christopher Glynn","Okay, yes. The oil and gas, I think you summed those down 25% overall. And I'm placing about 90% of that in ESS as good margin mix too. So I'm just wondering how that mix impact would square with the margin guidance for pretty good improvement?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, I would say firstly, it's 20% not 25%. They were thinking things will come down this year, and actually our oil and gas exposure goes across - everyone except for aerospace, it's less than vehicle but it's not an aerospace but it is in both our electrical and hydraulics, and it's not disproportionately in one electrical versus the other, because we sell a fair amount of standard comp, things that we call standard components and oil and gas as well as systems and services. So that's pretty well spread across.","And then the upstream, you can obviously think of that as being upstream onshore is fracking and that tends to be a fairly heavy use of hydraulics equipment.","Christopher Glynn","Okay, thanks. That helps. And then with lighting, I'm wondering about the LED opportunity for Eaton to leverage digital lighting and the low voltage access for data capture in the whole IOT environment?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, we are really very proud of the additional investments Eaton has made in the business we\u2019ve purchase from Cooper in our lighting business. LED is now over half of our total lighting sales. In some categories, it\u2019s as high now as 70%. We're really pleased. In this last quarter, we've introduced a new product that we call, Night Falcon, which now takes LED into outdoor to architectural lighting. That's traditionally been the prevalence of metal halide and low pressure sodium.","And so we're continuing to push those technologies into new areas and there is no question that one of the things we talked about when we bought Cooper was that we like the ability now to bring our ability to manage power for customers into the whole lighting arena as well as our traditional strength in and around controlling and having efficiency in and around electrical motors. And that allows us now to have an even bigger play for people in energy-saving. So yes we are not only thinking out but are successful now at this point and really making that play work for us.","The issue about digital lighting digital control, for those of you who've attended a couple of our workshops you\u2019ve seen us talk about where we think that real potential is and that's one of the reasons we are putting more money into this business.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks for the color.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Hi thank you. Just on the electrical systems and service margins. So you didn't have much of an increase off of very low base in Q1. Just wondering in light of the soft bookings maybe Q2 margins are also subdued. So why do you think we should see sort of 100, 150 bps increase year-on-year in the second half, given how bookings are trending?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, a couple of things here to think about. Number one is remember about half of our synergies, savings for the Cooper integration fall into each of our two electrical segments. So unlike last year we were about 75% of it felt into products. This year it\u2019s about 50-50. I shared with you the about $29 million of total $150 million was in the first quarter. Obviously you can figure out what the balance has got to be and it gets higher each quarters as we go through the year, because that's when we are finishing up many of the manufacturing consolidations.","Secondly Julian, we expect to eliminate actually was $8 million of embedded change, in this particular segment, and in addition to the $10 million in the other. And we expect to eliminate that as we go here into the second quarter. And then there is the benefit of some additional volume that we do expect to see if the non-res portion, particularly in the U.S. continues to strengthen as we go through the year. I would say those are the three primary elements.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. And then my second question just on capital allocation. I think before you talked about maybe having 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion of available to deploy capital through the end of next year. We look at the 170 million. We look at the trailing nine-months spend on buyback. Have you changed your view on sort of optimal leverage, or should we assume that now the available capital deployed at the end of March is now 1.3 billion or so?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, Julian we\u2019ll give a fairly complete view on this subject of capital structure as we come out of the second quarter. And so I don't want to get ahead of that discussion, but I think the timing you all recall as we\u2019ve said that we would address capital structure and the elements of capital structure when we get to mid-year and we'll do that at the time that we do our second quarter earnings release. But it's still our expectation that we'll be in a position to share with you and all investors, our updated view on that here in mid-year.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone. I know we've covered a lot of ground here. Just if we can go back to the non-res comments and that disconnect between what the GDP indicators are saying some negative spending and your outlook for up 3% to 5%. More specifically, what kind of customer behavior either front log, is there a particular vertical that's feeling a bit stronger that would give you better outlook at this stage?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, when we look across, Deane, the preliminary information that was available on strength in non-res, it was pretty well spread across the different segments. And that we see that areas like wastewater, education, healthcare, commercial buildings, even in the light industrial manufacturing has been pretty busy. There is also been some pretty good datacenter activity here in the U.S. And so I'd say those are the areas that we see has been particularly strong. If you get into utility, it tends to be not as strong as some of those other segments. And as I mentioned, the industrial area has been a little bit disappointing as you get into the bigger industrial type of installation.","Deane Dray","Great. Thank you.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stifel.","Rob McCarthy","Good morning everyone. Yes, two questions. One on non-res. I mean, obviously - and the interplay with oil and gas. I think you highlighted that 6% of your overall exposure is oil and gas. Obviously debatably there could be in a larger portion of sales that\u2019s kind of tied to that from the support of data of what's going on in terms of those trends. And Sandy to be clear on the last up-cycle, I do recall that you were talking about non-residential construction in the context of a supportive outlook for energy spending as a whole. So I guess the question I have is, what is the echo effect of oil and gas on non-res, and do you think there is a possibility that if we still continue to see challenging trends here, it could potentially choke off non-res recovery?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, we don't see that, Rob, at this point. And I know there was a lot of speculation in the November. December, January time period as to spending or contracting spending in the oil and gas segment have a disproportionate impact upon oil and gas. I think what we've all seen that has not materialized. And we don't believe it will at this point. We think as you go around to many of the major cities, you're seeing fairly active construction going on in those areas. And it's not simply what I would call the oil and gas boomtown, if you will. Clearly if you get out in the areas where there has been a lot of fracking activity, some of the activity that was just at a wild pace and in some of those areas like the Dakotas, that wasn't so much big commercial. It was light commercial and resi has pulled back. And I think that portion has - but it hasn't affected activity in San Francisco or New York or Philadelphia or Atlanta or Chicago and markets where we\u2019re seeing a lot of building activities. So we don't see that having an impact. I think the bigger question really right now is around this discussion around a heavy industrial investment and whether there is a pause in that.","And obviously remember that the non-commercial portion of non-res is about half of the non-res market. So that's the piece we've not seen pick-up the so-called really big projects. It hasn\u2019t picked up through this cycle. We didn't see it pick-up in the first quarter either. So we see this portion of the cycle being more of what I'm going to call the light commercial institutional type orientation without the breadth of really big projects that we've seen in the historic rebounce in non-res.","Rob McCarthy","And then just as a follow-up, I mean capital allocation obviously is pretty key here for the story and you\u2019re going through a management succession, and you\u2019ve kind of spoken to that ad-nauseam. But if a deal of size, kind of opportunity opened up, how do you think about the management of the company in terms of managing a succession and a large acquisition? Could you conceptually think that could occur, can you walk at the same time in that regard, or do you think it just kind of takes a larger more transformative deal off the table?","Sandy Cutler","I think, Rob, as we\u2019ve indicated in numerous forums that there is no one person who makes decision about major strategic alternatives for the company. We've always done that as a team and as a full management team and we have a great depth in that regard. And we've always done that with our board. So I see no reason why if we have the right opportunity and pricing was right, that would not cause us any hesitancy in that regard. But it's always about whether we think we can get the right return for our shareholders. And that's really the determining issue.","Rob McCarthy","Well, thanks, and I do like the answers to my questions.","Don Bullock","We have time for a couple more this morning. Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andy Casey","Thanks a lot. I just wanted to go back to that one question, and just broaden it out Can you - I'm trying to reconcile U.S. industrial and construction trends. Do you think it's possible for construction improvement to last a few years if industrial falls into persistent declines?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, hard to know, Andy, again it's about 50% of the market is just kind of non-commercial. I'd have to go back and look at history actually to say, can we see a period of time when that's been true. I think again remember part of what's in that lower areas is oil and gas and manufacturing. And so I would guess that if you saw industrial go into a steep decline and that's not what we're seeing. We are just not seeing as heavy growth at this point, that it would be difficult to see really big growth. I think you\u2019d be down in the single-digit type - low-single-digit type growth.","Having said that, we\u2019re seeing really quite good activity on that what I'll call the light commercial activity of the institutional and the commercial side. And so that piece has been encouraging, but I\u2019d actually - I'd have to go back and do a little research, Andy, to give you a really good answer on that one.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you, Sandy. And then second, you mentioned within the strength that you saw in non-res construction during the quarter, datacenters activity was pretty good. Did that impact the quarter for you, or is that yet to come-type thing?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, I would say that it's a yet to come in terms of actually shipping the stuff.","Andy Casey","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Don Bullock","Our last question today will come from Steve Winoker with Bernstein.","Steve Winoker","Hi, thanks for fitting me in. Let me do clean up here. Two questions. One operating cash flow, you're talking about growing 15% this year, and we just saw extension the number of, I guess about 6% last year. Where is it coming from? What is the real places especially trying to think about that relative to the margin expansion you have elsewhere?","Rick Fearon","We always start, Steve, with - by far our weakest operating cash flow quarter in Q1 and it's buffeted by lots of Q1 type payments related to year-end activities to rebuilding working capital. And so it's always a very modest number in Q1, and I wouldn't look at the year-over-year comparison as a particularly good for cash for the balance of the year. But we do quite a granular buildup to our cash flow for cash and we continue to believe that that range would have given 2.7 to 3.1. It is the most likely range.","Sandy Cutler","Steve, I'd add maybe two comments to Rick\u2019s, where we think this year will be very close to one-to-one cash efficiency ratio. And one of the other reasons for that is as you recall last year we talked about when we started in on this process of moving over 20 manufacturing plants, we did put in some safety inventory to assure that our customers were not feeling any interruption of service. We\u2019re pealing that back out this year. So while we\u2019ve built some working capital last year, we'll repealing it back to what we think are more optimal operating levels this year.","Rick Fearon","Which will allow us to - if you think about DoH, days on the hand inventory, it will allow us to move that down because it had to be elevated to deal with some of the inventory builds.","Steve Winoker","Okay. So it sounds like mostly inventory as opposed to receivables or payables?","Sandy Cutler","Yes. I think that's a right way to think about it.","Steve Winoker","Okay. And then the second question on corporate expense, the reduction. Can you just give us some clarity where that's coming from?","Sandy Cutler","I would say generally - once we saw that we were going to see obviously the hydraulic markets be a little lower, that the vehicle South American be lower, we're simply taking the approach on - and I wouldn\u2019t target it to anyone area, but to an overall, we are going to have to go through another round of really looking hard at expense levels. That's what we did in the first quarter. That's where we got an extra penny in the first quarter from that one, and that's what we would plan to duplicate for the rest of the year, and that obviously gets you roughly your $20 million if we do the same thing we did in the fourth quarter - first quarter, do it three more times, we are right at that number.","Steve Winoker","Right. It's a pretty big reduction though. I mean, are these growth initiatives you're going to find - I mean I'm just trying to get a sense for what activities no longer happen this year but maybe get deferred in another year?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, more than that, Steve, I would say, it\u2019s much more of the spirit of we have to continue all the time looking at ways to do more with less. And so lot of its process change. It's the great work our teams are doing in terms of productivity improvement. So I wouldn't say, no, it's not cutting growth initiatives. It's about, let's identify what creates value and let's keep working on that issue because we obviously are in a slower growth environment and that\u2019s got to be where you're headed is to create value.","Steve Winoker","Okay, great. Thank you.","Don Bullock","Thank you very much. And as always, we\u2019ll be available for follow-up calls throughout the day and the remainder of the week and next week. Thank you very much for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a remainder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Vice President of Investor Relations, Don Bullock. Please go ahead sir.","Donald Bullock","Good morning. I am Don Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Welcome to Eaton\u2019s third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and CFO.","It has been our practice, we'll begin today's call with comments from Sandy followed by our traditional question-and-answer session. Before I do that I draw your attention to the statement on page two of our presentation regarding forward-looking statements included in the presentation. There we have outlined the factors that could cause actual results to differ from our statements. Those factors are noted in today\u2019s press release and also related to the Form 8-K. Please take a moment to review this.","In addition to the presentation \u2013 also in addition, the presentation also includes certain non-GAAP measures, it is defined by SEC rules. A reconciliation of those measures to the comparable GAAP equivalent is provided in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.eaton.com.","With that I will turn it over to Sandy.","Alexander Cutler","Great. Thanks Don and welcome everybody this morning.","I\u2019m going to work from the earnings presentation that was posted earlier today, I\u2019m going to start on Page 3, since Don as already covered the forward-looking statement qualifications, that\u2019s the chart that\u2019s labeled highlight of the third quarter results.","We are very pleased with the third quarter as we noticed in our press release all time record sales on operating earnings and again the $1.12 of operating earnings per share compared to our guidance of $1.05 to $1.15 within this point of $1.10.","Our sales as we noted were up some 42%, slightly less than we had thought they would be at the beginning of the quarter, you may recall we haven\u2019t provided guidance at the beginning of the quarter we talked about expectation of sales might increase by $75 million, the increase closer to $5 million so relatively flat overall revenues second quarter to third quarter.","I\u2019m really pleased when we look year-to-year, core revenue growth of 3%, I think that\u2019s significant. Segment margins 15.6%, the same as our record second quarter, so we think on very similar volumes, a very strong achievement. We think the real news of the quarter is in this next bullet point, is really strengthening bookings in our electrical, hydraulics and aerospace as a reason we don\u2019t quote vehicle here as we really don\u2019t have bookings data in that business.","So in those businesses we have got bookings 5% up in electrical, 8% up in hydraulic, 6% in aerospace, I think significantly October has also started strongly. And then significantly our Cooper integration activities and savings remain on track with the same projections we provided you at the end of the last quarter.","If we turn to the next chart, one that\u2019s labeled comparison to Q3 guidance, pretty simple reconciliation versus a guidance we provided at the beginning of the quarter, $1.10 was the midpoint, the lower revenue of roughly $70 million threw off about $0.05 less earnings. Slightly higher corporate expense, here we call it, we have told you at the beginning of the quarter, we expected our corporate expense to go up by $15 million, it went up a little bit more than that accounted for about $0.01 negative. Then the lower tax rate of 1.4% versus the 9% guidance we have provided the $0.08 as a result we came in $0.02 over our guidance in line with consensus.","Turning to the next page, Page 5 titled financial summary. You have read most of this information, I\u2019m confident by this point really we just bring out one point again is that sales volume in the second quarter of 2013 was $5.602 billion compared to the $5.607 billion.","So again as you look down this chart, segment operating profit was virtually the same not only from a percentage but from a dollar point of view that we think again a strong quarter in terms of the core growth of 3%.","Let\u2019s get into the individual businesses at this point, as you turn Page 6, labeled Electrical Products segment, couple of comments here. Second quarter revenue as you recall were $1.758 billion, so this quarter\u2019s volume of $1.817 billion up some 3.4% very strong incremental margin performance having increased to 17.1% from 16.2% in the second quarter. You recall that all of the data shown in this chart, on the third quarter 2012 is pre the acquisition of Cooper\u2019s, so not directly comparable.","Really pleased with the \u2013 excuse me, the very strong combined bookings of 7% versus last year, really confirms some of the data we get from industry association market share data, which shows us nothing very strong booking gains in terms of market shares here in North America in particular this year.","If we look within that 7%, I would think it\u2019s somewhat predictable pattern you might anticipate, we are up some 10% in Americas really was kind of double-digit increases in bookings in residential and lighting [ph] business and particularly pleased that we talked to you about this technology opportunity within the lighting business moving to LED, over 30% of our volume is not only LED based, we are really leading the industry in that very important technology change.","About a 1% increase in the EMEA region really led by the Middle East got some very exciting I think wins throughout the Middle East at this point building on our strength there. Then about 5% increase in Asia Pacific, I would really highlight that the single phased our quality business system the business that has come back more strongly in that particular region.","So overall we think a very strong quarter of performance here. As we did talk about or as we looked at the month, while September accelerated, you have heard this from I think a couple of peers, the second half of September in terms of bookings lessen quite what we thought, but we are feeling quite good about how October as faired.","If you turn to the next chart Page 7, labeled Electrical Systems and Services segment, volumes in the second quarter were $1.614 billion so about a 1% quarter-to-quarter increase you can see, very strong continued margins and our systems and services business is 14.7%, a little flatter incremental didn\u2019t get a lot of incremental on the additional volume that really hadn\u2019t to do with slightly negative mix change, a little weaker service activity particularly as it relates to the government sector, if you can imagine that\u2019s been a little confused over the last three months in terms of demand and utility area continues to be weaker as we have commented this year than it was a year ago.","Again, on the booking side, 3% up, 3% in the Americas continuing to do really well in our large assemblies businesses, the three-phased power quality business was offset by the weakness in utility and service as I mentioned.","Europe still weak, still negative number, and Asia Pacific, pretty powerful snap back up 8% really led by a great strength in the three-phased power quality business in the beginning with some back in the forward markets at this point.","The acquisition number that you see in the lower green box on the left hand corner of this chart that does include not only Cooper as was true in the previous chart but also Rolec and Gycom acquisitions.","If we turn to the next chart which is the page 8, it\u2019s labeled Hydraulic segment, second quarter volumes were $772 million, so the third quarter declined by about 4% from the second quarter that\u2019s pretty much in line with the typical seasonality in this particular business.","Margins came down from 14.5% in the second quarter to 13.1% in this quarter but they are up solidly from last year\u2019s 12.8%. As you think about those incremental about 33% volume decline from the second quarter, the detrimental was maybe about $4 million higher than we might normally expect nothing really material in there as really more of mix issue, we are concerned about anything out of pattern in that respect versus last year volumes are down about $24 million from last year and profits only down $1 million, you can see the real beneficial impact of the restructuring activities that were initiated in the fourth quarter of last year.","Bookings I think maybe the most significant number on this entire page up 8%, it\u2019s the first year-over-year increase since the fourth quarter of 2011 within that 8%, the distributor demand was up about 4%, OEM demand up about 12% and if you kept the market differently and think about the mobile versus stationary side; mobile up about 9, stationary up about 19, oil and gas being a real driver in the stationary area and ag demand actually was a driver within the mobile area.","When we look around the world today, the softness continues as you heard from a number of large OEMs in the construction and in the mining marketplaces and we continuously have said really for the last 12 months to believe the most difficult market \u2013 end market to figure out from a geography point of view is that China market where there appears to still be significant over capacity in the construction equipment market and inventories.","Moving to Page 9, Aerospace segment, flat volume versus the second quarter as we had expected pretty much a $446 million in the second quarter, $448 in the third quarter. You can see the operating profit is slightly down from \u2013 they were 15% in the second quarter, 14.3% in this quarter, 11.7% a year ago. So again, very strong incremental performance of 52% incremental versus last year a little weaker in terms of the \u2013 versus the second quarter but frankly we are talking about a $2 million change in sales and a $3 million change in profit nothing really significant there.","If you look in the bookings, up 6% versus last year, very pleased with that, I think you may have all had the opportunity to read about two very significant wins we reported this week the Dassault Falcon 5X advanced hydraulic power generation system and the Embraer Air 2E platform \u2013 E2 platform and that hydraulic system is estimated to result in about $400 million of shipments over the next 15 years of the program.","We talked a lot on this year about aftermarket orders and trends in the marketplace. We saw a pretty consistent pattern here of strong commercial aftermarket being offset by weak military demand as a result overall aftermarket demand was relatively flat. And part of the story when you look inside the margins for our third quarter of 2013 versus the second quarter of 2013, while our shipments \u2013 excuse me versus last year. While our shipments went up some 7% aftermarket shipments only increased by 4%. So that again, that mix change we have been talking to the chair about the strong OEM and not quite as strong aftermarket shipments.","Turning to Page 10, labeled our Vehicle segment, a very strong quarter performance, you may recall the second quarter was $1.2 million versus the $964 million shown in this chart. So about a 4% decline from the second quarter to this quarter up 3% from a year ago if you look at the incrementals and decrementals in this particular segment, the 8% incremental over last year again reflecting the very strong results coming out of both running the business well and the restructuring we initiated in the fourth quarter last year. It\u2019s about 29% determental from the second quarter of this year again below what we would normally expect from this business I think really good cost control, so that 16.7% a very strong representation in the quarter.","And after heavy duty truck builds we are forecasting at 245 and for those of you keep track of this by quarter, we are thinking it was, our estimates 55 in the first quarter, 67 in the second quarter, 63 in the third quarter and 60 in the fourth quarter, if you recall, we came into this quarter thinking it will about 68,000 so market was weaker in the third quarter, its one of the reasons we have taken our forecast for the full year down to 245, we recognized there is some forecaster is out there still slightly over 250, 245 is our best estimate at this time.","If we turn and get to Chart 11, labeled 2013 end market growth forecast, I would represent the changes in this chart are more tuning than I think they are \u2013 anything of large magnitude. You see in the electrical markets between the two segments virtually the changes are insignificant. Hydraulics we did weaken slightly here in the U.S. and that took the overall down from 5% to 6% at this time. And DFO we dropped by 1% in terms of the total market and that really was fundamentally around the NAFTA heavy duty change down 260,000 units down to 245,000.","All that had the impact of reducing our end market growth from a percent to zero and I think its in line with the fact that we have seen slightly lower revenues here in the second and third quarter that\u2019s in our anticipation when we will talk about the fourth quarter guidance here in a minute.","If we turn to Chart 12, which are labeled 2013 margin expectation, just one change here. You may recall that our full year margin expectations for our hydraulics business 13.5%, we have lowered it to 13.0% in light of these little lower market activity in this area. No change to the overall Eaton consolidation really doesn\u2019t affect that overall rounding.","Turning to Chart 13, comparison of Q3 to Q4 2013, just really three items in terms of this reconciliation and obviously, starts with $1.12 that we reported for the third quarter, we expect the normal lower seasonal volume about 1% so its something on the order of about $70 million and that threw off about a negative $0.05.","We do expect the tax rate to go back to in the range of 6% here in the fourth quarter versus the 1.4% in the third quarter that is about a negative $0.05. Then the additional synergy realization from what we realized in the third quarter to the fourth quarter same projections we have provided with you earlier in the year about $0.03 and that\u2019s how we come with the $1.05 for the individual fourth quarter projection.","Turning to Chart 14, labeled 2013 EPS guidance. Couple of comments here, we trimmed the top end of our guidance by $0.10 and that\u2019s really in light of the weaker markets that we have seen here in the third and we anticipate that to continue in the fourth quarter but we have maintained the low end just as we did in the last quarter at $4.05. That\u2019s really been possible by the \u2013 made possible by the additional work we have done on productivity, I will comment on that in one of the upcoming charts here.","Chart 15 is the guidance range that we provide you to kind of give you some help in terms of what has changed versus the last time, if we set down this looking first at the green boxes. In the acquisition area that has come down by about $0.03 and that\u2019s really the impact about $100 million of volume primarily in hydraulics and then to a little bit the electric utility markets coming out of those projections.","Organic growth, the 33% margin that has come down by $0.21 and I will give you some dollars on that on the next chart. Then additional expense control is moved up by $0.09 and here we call in our last conference call, we talked about $55 million of additional expense control on productivity that we anticipated, we would achieve for the full year beyond our 33% incremental margin and beyond the synergy savings.","We have been able to identify an additional $35 million now a total of $90 million for the year of 2013 and that\u2019s driving that additional $0.09 or the full year $0.24 on the chart.","If you go to the yellow segment of the chart, the several negatives no change in the higher number of shares, about $0.02 improvement in the other corporate expense, about $0.10 improvement in the higher tax rate and then about a negative $0.02 in terms of slightly increased pension expense versus our earlier estimates this year for that segment comes to a positive $0.10 whereas the green segment above would sum to a negative $0.15 change and a net of those two obviously get to the one nickel decrease or the nickel decrease in the midpoint of our range, so $4.10 full year operating earnings per share at midpoint.","If we turn to Chart 16, just a couple of updates again for your record, so we try to give you a summary of some of the key elements that underline our guidance. The core revenue growth of $125 million that compares to $350 million in the previous guidance we have provided you again reflecting the market change. Net acquisition revenue was $6 billion now its $5.9 billion, no change in the incremental margin of 33%. The tax rate we have provided you 7% to 9% guidance but now 5%. I just covered the change in the full year operating EPS.","Operating cash flow down by about $200 million, it had been $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. We have reduced our CapEx from $650 million to $600 million as demand has been a little less this year and that results from the free cash flow coming a $150 million instead of the $200 million and that operating cash flow came down.","Chart 17, we have simply provided you for your record of no change here still forecasting $115 million of operating synergies and all that work is continuing to go very well, we are very much encouraged by the integration as we have updated this number twice here we call at started at $75 million for this year, we increase it to $90 million. And then in our last earnings conference call increased it to $115 million and that\u2019s what we anticipate it will close this year.","Then last but not least and we know significantly in terms of your thinking at this time of the year, few comments about the year and then looking into 2014. As we\u2019ve said at the end of the last earnings conference, we\u2019ve been really working very hard to offset these kind of slower growing markets, markets that are growing a little less than we had anticipated when we came into the year with additional improved productivity. And it\u2019s a very significant synergies to come out of the Cooper and other acquisitions.","We are in an environment today where we think the U.S. environment is improving slowly in spite of what goes down in Washington, that Europe is clearly beginning to recover that China is stabilizing and that we think that is an environment as we look into next year that would drive modest improvement in global GDP.","Our best view at this point is that means that our markets are likely to grow 3% to 4% as we detailed on the chart that we just covered on the Cooper synergies, we still anticipate incremental year-to-year synergies of $95 million there is no change from what we said earlier this year. Obviously, it gets hard to call exactly what pension expense will be at this point without knowing exactly where the interest rates in this roller-coaster is going to end up. But obviously, we\u2019re looking a little better couple weeks ago than they look right now. But we think something on the order of about $20 million is probably a good estimate at this time for a decline of expense.","We think a very modest reduction and interest expense from year-to-year and then we would expect our tax rate to return to the rate of more on the order of 8% to 10%. Now, if we think about this from a business perspective, obviously, electrical, hydraulics, aerospace and vehicle are slightly different market outlooks. We think there are a couple elements that you might give consideration to as you kind of peer into next year.","We continue to believe that the residential markets of \u2013 here in North America will strengthen. We think non-residential is actually strengthening at this point and some of the data is available from July and August would certainly underpin that. The three-phased power quality markets have been strengthening. We think Europe has turned and that Asia Pacific is strengthening at this point although the large infrastructure projects that typify the Chinese economy in particular a couple of years ago have not begun to materialize at this point.","On the hydraulics market, we commented in a number of forums this year that our expectation is that that market would turn to positive growth in 2014 and that still is our view as the U.S. is gradually improving, Europe we think has begun the turn and the real issue is trying to predict the Asia market where so much of the market is driven by the Chinese construction market and you heard us say that we think that probably doesn\u2019t turn until we get well into next year.","On the aerospace market, we see conditions being fairly consistent to what we\u2019re seeing this year. I think there is a lot data available on that one, so no really significant change. And on the vehicle market, a little slower growth but the light vehicle market looks fairly healthy around the world, clearly Europe is better than it was a year ago in Europe continuing to see strong demand in Brazil, the U.S. and in Asia.","The truck markets really most significantly for us, I know a number of you follow kind of North American heavy duty, its early to call that. Obviously with our having taken the demand down to 245 this year, it would have an implication from next year as well but we think still a year of some growth next year.","So that\u2019s sort of our best view of the color that we can provide you with as we look into next year but I think we take some real encouragement from these bookings acceleration that we\u2019ve seen here in the third quarter and that continued strength here early in October. While not all of those bookings are shippable in the fourth quarter; they certainly do build a very strong base for going into 2014.","So, with that Don, I\u2019ll turn things back to you, I look forward to everybody\u2019s questions.","Donald Bullock","At this point in time, our operator will give you instructions and then we will turn it to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions)","Donald Bullock","Our first question comes from Steve Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","","Hi. Thanks and good morning.","Alexander Cutler","Good morning.","Richard Fearon","Hi.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Just trying to make sure I understand that Slide 13 walk from 3Q to 4Q and just a little bit confused on -- is the core growth about 200, I get about $283 million or so implied based on your $125 million full year, is that in the range of what you\u2019re talking about?","Alexander Cutler","Chart 13?","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","I\u2019m sorry, slide, yes, Slide 13, 3Q to 4Q, I\u2019m basically looking at sort of what\u2019s implied organically in terms of growth and then the implied incremental margin on that compared to, if you\u2019re looking for $125 million in the full year now, therefore, given your run rate in 1Q and now 3 that sort of the math works out to $283 million implied in the fourth quarter. And then I\u2019m looking for what kind of incremental on that? I\u2019m just trying -- make sure I understand the seasonal volume commentary in light of it being a little bit lower and yet actually year-over-year yield that\u2019s still going to be a positive for growth number, right?","Alexander Cutler","I think the way we really to think about it, it\u2019s roughly $70 million of volume lower than the third quarter of 2013 that\u2019s roughly a 33% incremental, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been using this year.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","","Okay. All right. And that $70 million captures in Cooper excluding the synergies?","Alexander Cutler","Yes.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great. And what\u2019s your assume pricing versus cost tailwind, how is that kind of played into your performance and where do you see that -- how do you see that outlook going forward?","Alexander Cutler","We\u2019re seeing I think as everyone has commented this year that commodities have been a little bit more duffle this year than they have been in other years. The way we try to take the things Steve is that we tried to run a model that basically says between productivity, new product introductions and price increases that we -- roughly come out equal versus commodity prices so no material headwind, tailwind this year.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, okay. Are the pricing strengthen been pretty significant for a lot of -- I guess other companies that\u2019s why I was wondering where you\u2019re basically saying its neutral impact for Eaton?","Alexander Cutler","That\u2019s been our guidance for this year.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And just one last question, on your 2014 guidance, what -- how confident are you in that non-res construction piece of it and what maybe gets you some of that confidence in light of \u2013 this past year\u2019s experience?","Alexander Cutler","I\u2019d say a couple of things Steve. We have been talking about this for several months with investors is that the way we think you have to think about the U.S. construction cycle, is that really the first couple of years coming out of this downturn in 2008 and 2009 were very atypical in that residential which is normally early driver, earlier cycle did not come back for all the reasons we understand. And you saw a short-term, a non-res boom and some of those numbers went up into double digits.","We think we\u2019re now into a more normal, if you look at the 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 time period that is developers beginning to buy the land again because they have built out most of their residential areas that then leads to beginning of what we call the small commercial activity. These are the shopping malls, all of the strip stores that then leads you into the larger construction activity.","If you look at the actual data which has just become available in the last two days because some of the delays of the data stream, the July, August data for non-res private put in place, I think surprised most people with the strength. We think that this building, we\u2019re seeing pretty good bidding activity looking out ahead of us. And if you look at some of the consensus numbers that have also come out in the last couple of days from a number of the people who forecast U.S. put in place private. They are talking about numbers that would make a 5% type number next year look quite realistic.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Fantastic. Thanks.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning everyone.","Alexander Cutler","Good morning, John.","Richard Fearon","Good morning.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Just to [indiscernible] on your point about price, what sort of mix or price are you seeing in your bookings increase that obviously and just confirm those ship over what duration kind of a year so that helps out the first part of 2014?","Alexander Cutler","Yes. Bookings, let me just talk to kind of bookings timing for a minute. When you look at our electrical product sector, this largely in one month, I\u2019d say month or maybe out the beginning of the next month but because this product, its standard product, it seems to be the type of thing that is stocked, distributed with carriers and they are refilling. So that\u2019s to the most part kind of in and out business, in the electrical services and systems business that can be anything from a panel board that might ship in a couple of weeks to switch gear that might not ship till 6 to 8 months later.","And so, you can quite a range and I think a good way to think about that is that\u2019s generally a 3 to 4 months outlook if you will. When you are getting out of the hydraulics business, the distributor side generally when that\u2019s coming in that tends to be shipped same month or the next month, the OEM side often can be orders that go out as far as six months or longer. And so what we are seeing there in hydraulics because I\u2019m sure a number of people will have questions if you got a 8% increase in bookings so I want the fourth quarter immediately go up higher, which we would like. But we don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily going to happen as number of those orders are from both agriculture, construction, a variety of areas where people are kind of laying in their order pattern for next year. It\u2019s part of the reason that we are a little bit more bullish thinking about that market for next year.","On the Aerospace side, obviously when bookings, when aftermarket comes in that\u2019s generally a 1 to 3 months that\u2019s going to get shipped. The orders for the OEM side can go out quite a bit longer than that if you can imagine in terms of a build program for OEM platforms.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So that makes sense. And then what about, what you are seeing with respect to the mix of your what\u2019s your bookings look like, is it better or is it sort of consistent?","Alexander Cutler","I won\u2019t say consistent with what we have been seeing. No big changes one way or the other.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just sort of interpret your guidance, do you think electrical products because obviously we don\u2019t have compares right with Cooper pro forma or anything, if you take electrical products get better in terms of profitability or profit margins in the fourth quarter, I\u2019m just curious how this is going to play out, maybe you can comment on both the products and the systems and services business.","Alexander Cutler","Generally, again, what we will see is, in the electrical business the strongest quarters are normally your third and second quarters, your weakest quarter is normally the first quarter. And then as you think about the fourth quarter it tends to be the third strongest quarter if you will. So that trend is fairly true year-to-year you can always get a little bit of difference depending particularly in the electrical systems and services as to \u2013 you may have some large projects they are going to shift one year versus another. But, I think in the products business that\u2019s a pretty good rule.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So that sort of imply you are going to end the year around 15% margin for the products business. I guess, if I add all this up right and coming around \u2013","Alexander Cutler","We actually still think we are going to be closer to 16.5% in the products business and we think we will be around 14.5% for the full year in electrical systems and services.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, okay. I\u2019m sorry. You are right. That does have a net worth. So we will think Sandy as you kind of look at sort of \u2013 what\u2019s happening in non-resi and the progress you are making on Cooper kind of electrical products seem weaker this year but then there is some obviously signs of improvement. This business, I\u2019m assuming we can still retain the 33% contribution margins in next year. It sounds like the business should be over 17% margin based on your guide all else equal unless I\u2019m missing something.","Alexander Cutler","Remember just one quick note, in terms of the rate of improvement, we definitely think the businesses will continue to improve because again remember, we are going to be dropping some $95 million of incremental year-to-year synergy into these two segments. But again, if could just go back to the guidance we have provided in early February for this year, we said that our normal incremental for the whole company would be around 28%, the reason it was 33% this year that we took $50 million of restructuring in the fourth quarter last year and that we really felt to be intellectually honest in this, we need to back that out and give you an incremental over there.","So I think 28% incremental and some are between 25% and 30% that\u2019s how we get to 28%. It\u2019s probably a more realistic kind of overall margin for the company. We have not completed our profit planning for next year, so we are not providing a particular guidance but if you are to kind of use what we would have used this year without the restructuring from last year that would have been the range.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Still sounds like you are driving toward over 70% -- 17% next year is all right?","Alexander Cutler","We will see how the performance comes out and we will obviously give you a better insight on this when we get together to do our guidance for next year.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Alexander Cutler","Thanks John.","Donald Bullock","Our next comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Hi. Thanks a lot. Just a question around the sort of non-Cooper related additional expense control, you said that this year now looking at $0.24 of help from that versus $0.15 back in July. How much sort of more you are doing right now in kind of Q4. In other words some of these non-Cooper cost out issues, they are going to be tailwind into next year as well, are you kind of drawing those to a close because the bookings are good and you expect the market to accelerate?","Alexander Cutler","I understand the question. And I think the way to think about the additional savings beyond 55 we talked about as they drop into the third and the fourth quarter. We think the base of this year than it\u2019s a realistic base to build off of as we think next year. Your point about the momentum, it does feel to us like there is a momentum change with these bookings and in spite of I think the fact that we all were somewhat encouraged watching the Ford Theater in Washington several weeks ago and that we all anticipate we are going to see another stage of that as we get to the early part of the winter spring next year.","These economies feel like they are continuing to improve in spite of that and some of the businesses were that we had not seen as good order activity in the second quarter that reversed itself from the third quarter. So that gives us I guess Julian, the additional confidence that this sort of range we are thinking about for perspective market increases next year that\u2019s very realistic to us.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Got it. Thanks. And then your OpEx was up quite a bit, I mean R&D to sales was up 40 bps year-on-year in Q3. Is that just a sort of top-up going on in some of the electrical businesses on R&D or is that something that sort of a multi-year program in some channel areas?","Alexander Cutler","I say more a timing issue than anything else. Julian we have got, our development cycles in each of our businesses are fairly long and one of the areas we have really been carefully about trimming is that that basic investment in new power management solutions. So I don\u2019t think there is a big conclusion to be drawn one way or the other there.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Got it. Thanks. And then just lastly very quickly, I remember that the beginning of the year you kind of, you tried to move away from talking about Eaton growth relative to a market growth, do you have any sort of sense on your growth rate that\u2019s relative to the market so you kind of think it\u2019s the markets and then you have plus 1% on top of that sort of thing?","Alexander Cutler","Yes. We are still having a little bit of challenge, trying to get these data streams to settle down, it was not helped at all by the fact that we went through this period of not having U.S. government data. And so we don\u2019t even have full data for the third quarter, some of the data just came out for the month of August.","So I can\u2019t give you a good feel on that one. I would say that in the industry associations where we get good market share data and one of those is for the electrical business here in the U.S. The news is quite encouraging. And whether that kind of shipment basis or even more strongly on the booking basis, I think its verifying our view of the incremental sales capability that we put in place with Cooper.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Good morning everyone.","Alexander Cutler","Good morning.","Donald Bullock","Good morning","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","This is just a follow-up on the commentary on October having started strongly, Sandy, maybe you can provide a little bit more color by segment on where you are seeing the strength. And specifically, as it relates to electrical it looks like the comps get a little bit tougher in 4Q. And hence I\u2019m wondering whether you can see an acceleration versus the 5% bookings growth number, you saw in 3Q.","Alexander Cutler","All we can really do at this point is, is give you a sense for kind of year-over-year so far in October, we will see how November and December plays out. But, in both our electrical business and our Hydraulics business, particularly in the U.S. we are off to a very handsome start, I may put that way on year-on-year basis in October.","Now, one month doesn\u2019t a quarter make but its an awfully good start and we are very pleased by that. I think one of the reason is that I think its you worth talking about that October for a moment is that, I think you heard not only from us but from a lot of other companies that there was some strange kind of order patterns in flow businesses during the last two weeks of September. I can\u2019t tell you, I don\u2019t think our team can tell you that we know what that was related to but the early part of September was going quite well. The back end of September seem to slow down whether that was related to all the activity in Washington, we don\u2019t know. But, the good news is, it snapped back strongly here in October and so whatever cause that seems to be behind us and we seem to be on with strong numbers.","In spite of that slow down kind of September you saw that the 5% in our electrical businesses, you saw the 8% in hydraulics and you saw the 6% in aerospace. So we think we are powerful numbers in the third quarter and off to a really good start here in the fourth quarter.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s the type of commentary. And the government slow down the shutdown, did that have any impact at all to your 4Q estimate reduction?","Alexander Cutler","I think really its our view of the market, what\u2019s going on the market, that\u2019s hard for us tie specifically what impact that as per se, if the markets just earned and behaving quite the way we thought they would this year. But, as we some of the activity we are seeing now and I think the whole back drop to this that \u2013 this is a gradually improving economy. It\u2019s not rocketing back here in the U.S.","So most significant change and we were talking about in the second quarter as well is that Europe seems to have bottomed. So regardless whether you think Europe is going to be a positive one or positive half or positive one and a half versus its being negative, this last year that\u2019s a fairly powerful change year-to-year.","And I think the other one that\u2019s for us is significant and we are our watching, its what\u2019s going on in Asia Pacific, where you had a very weak Australian economy. You got a Chinese economy going through very substantial transition and within that transition, the consumer side that for us for example auto has been quite strong. The major industrial in infrastructure has been quite weak. We are beginning to see some change in that. And the key issue for us now in China is to see the inventories or construction and mining equipment come into balance because its fairly important influencer for the overall global hydraulics market.","We do not see that happening yet. We have said we thought it would be at least the middle of next year and I think that that probably the hardest piece for us to call in that respect. But, having said that positive Europe, a slowly growing U.S., a strong Latin America and stabilizing Asia is a lot better than what we have looked at in 2013.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. I guess one more question on the Cooper revenue synergies, you just commented on how that\u2019s progressing and as we get into next year I just want to make sure, I understand it correctly the 25% to 30% incremental you were talking about earlier that is x synergies, correct?","Alexander Cutler","Yes. That is correct. And quick updates in terms of how the revenue synergy is going, we are quite pleased, we had commented when we rolled out this guidance originally, that\u2019s the first year, would take a year to get a number changes put in place obviously to start to put the capabilities combined capabilities in front of our customers, we are very much on track on achieving, as you can see this roughly $10 million of incremental profits that come from I\u2019m talking in tandem within the overall 115 in 2013 that jumps up to $35 million next year and we really pleased where we are right now. And so feel very good across those four prime elements that we talked about introducing service business capability to the Cooper Power Systems business, major increases in terms of our effectiveness across channel partners, the ability to move into countries where one company or the other was significantly stronger than the other than some of these target markets like oil and gas where its very clear that we have got a very substantial capabilities having put these two companies together and it may have one of the broadest offerings available in that segment.","So, we are quite pleased with that and have a really great sense of confidence that we are right on top of these numbers.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Thanks everyone. I will get back in queue.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Good morning.","Alexander Cutler","Good morning Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Look pretty good color here on 2014, so I appreciate that. Obviously, the incrementals next year will be partly a function of the mix of businesses \u2013 how your different businesses grow. And I just wanted to know, do you have any strong views in terms of how some of your high leverage businesses like truck, hydraulics and products will kind of compared to that 54%?","Alexander Cutler","I think as we talked to the \u2013 it really does matter just as you mentioned, what that market percentage would be. I do think that the aerospace this is going to likely see demand that is fairly similar kind of demand increase we saw this year. We don\u2019t see any of those fundamentals changing. I think the hydraulic business you correctly mentioned is one that has some fairly high incrementals and decrementals and we expect that business will have positive market experience next year versus the negative, its been struggling this year.","And with all the work we have done in terms of try and improve profitability, incremental profitability and you can see that in that comparison of this quarter\u2019s performance versus last year\u2019s in hydraulics. We think there is an opportunity there obviously for us to do well. I think the electrical business is one that is likely to be close to those incremental numbers we mentioned. I think the biggest year-to-year market difference is likely to be in the hydraulics business.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And you mentioned the Chinese construction market being one of the big question mark for 2014 in hydraulics, obviously mining and ag are two big questions as well. I mean how do you view the progression of mining and ag? Maybe give us some current sense of what you are seeing right now in those term markets. You mentioned ag was quite strong but how do you apply to progress?","Alexander Cutler","I think ag is frankly we talk a lot about as well, its one of the most difficult markets to call right now. We seem to have two schools of thoughts that are about 40 yards apart. Clearly, its been a big production year, prices have declined. It really depends a little bit by segment. We continue to think of the capital equipment market in South America will be quite strong.","Again, we think Europe and the U.S. are replacement market, so they get heavily influenced by this issue of excess cash of the farmer and ability to reinvest. We follow really our major OEMs in this regard and one of the large ones that as a color that you recognize is quite bullish.","Next year in terms of their numbers, so far that\u2019s the order pattern we see and that\u2019s what supported into comment when we got a stronger hydraulic booking led by ag this quarter. We will have to see. I think these are single digit \u2013 mid-single digit numbers. I don\u2019t think these are big booming numbers more than that.","Mining is very much depends up on which commodity is being mined, obviously coal everyone was down in the ground about it. But if you look at some of the shipments of coal to China recently that has began to increase fairly significantly that have to increase a lot before you are going to have a lot of additional commitment but the demand is starting to move in the right direction.","Copper investment in the South America continues fairly actively in terms of changing by country because they are trying to get to places where there is better ore grade and yield and lower electrical cost. But, I would guess on this whole mining and construction area, its still mining it\u2019s going to be slower than we saw a couple of years ago and constructions got to go through the bleed off of the inventory that particularly is still necessary in Asia.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just quickly on pension, you put down $3 million place order for next year, I think if you snap the line like on discount rate, you get a bit more than that. And have seen that prior loss amortization would be lower next year given the move in market return. So I\u2019m wondering or there any offsets to discount rates and amortization.","Alexander Cutler","The $20 million we have laid out Nigel assumes 4.7ish type discount rate obviously its going to differ from that that will impact in just about a $60 million impact for 25 basis point. The other factor is always that our plan when it was under 80% funded and our plan is funded in the high collectively the high 80s for both plans a little bit lower for the Eaton only plan because we are now over 80, we are now offering full lump sum settlements and that means that fees will retire because we are not completely funded it, there is a bigger expense. And so that will be a drag on the pension expense next year.","So you got a balance out the interest rate whatever its going to be with the fact that you will have slightly higher lump sum settlement expenses.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Thank you very much.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from David Raso with the ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group","Hi. Good morning.","Alexander Cutler","Good morning, David.","David Raso - ISI Group","Two questions, just trying to think through the end market guidance. This time last year you are coming of a quarter where the orders were down mid-single digits and you are still thinking up 2% to 3% on the end markets for next year. And it prove to be optimistic end markets now flat, but so just thinking about how you are going through the process of forecasting. This time last year borders down mid-single, thought up 2% to 3% the following year in end market. But now we are actually looking at up mid-single, October is off to a good start and you are thinking 3% to 4%. Simply that analysis tells you are you being more conservative on the guidance you saw last year you are too optimistic or should I read something about the end markets from not \u2013 in a way I think the 3% to 4% is actually maybe a little better than I would have thought but still if the orders are up this much going through 3% to 4%, its interesting compared to what you are thinking last year of a lot weaker orders?","Alexander Cutler","","Yes, I think David maybe the missing piece and it\u2019s always a hard one to call is, what\u2019s the relationship going to be between manufacturing industrial production which tends to be actually a better a surrogate for our end markets than simply GDP. We came into last year and we started the year really with the belief that industrial manufacturing production would be higher than GDP which is the normal relationship when GDP expands normally industrial manufacturing production expands more. That actually has not been true this year and for the reasons both of inventory reductions and lower CapEx spending, we think what we\u2019ve seen is manufacturing industrial production be slightly less than GDP.","Our expectation is over what we think is been an adjustment year and that year, in this year that we\u2019re more likely to see the slightly stronger global GDP next year really led primarily by Europe going from a negative to a positive but a return to a pattern where manufacturing industrial production would be higher than an expanding GDP. That\u2019s probably the biggest variance from that respect -- our fake out if you will is this year is that manufacturing industrial production is going to be lower than GDP and that had more of an impact than we foresaw coming into this year.","David Raso - ISI Group","","Yeah, I guess so even taking that thought further, let\u2019s say you knew this year industrial production would be less of a relationship with GDP not below and say last year you said our orders just came and down mid single and we\u2019re thinking 2013 end markets are flat, just even if you knew that then you would argue if your orders are up mid single right now and October is healthy even going in a three to four seems seven, an air of conservatism and clearly that is justified. I\u2019m just trying to get into your head a little bit on what\u2019s making you a bit cautious on that outlook? Is there something very tangible or is it you know a little bit maybe lessons learned from last year and wanting to start with a little more conservative relationship between your orders and how you\u2019re seeing the end market?","Alexander Cutler","A couple of things David, I would say remember one that some of our large portion of our orders in our business as I was mentioning earlier I think maybe John\u2019s question come in and go out in the same month. So, they don\u2019t necessarily build the foundation for the next year. We\u2019ve seen this year-end slowdown occur three in the last four years and we have the prospects sometime in the first quarter of next year or having some more theatre in Washington. Hard to know exactly how that is going to impact the year. Our best estimate is just kind of 3% to 4% range we\u2019re encouraged that as you correctly knows by both our third quarter bookings and the strong start in October love to see a November and December behind it, of that level of strength and then I think I would feel a little differently about three to four, but you have to say we\u2019re off to a good start against it.","David Raso - ISI Group","","All right, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Donald Bullock","","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Alexander Cutler","Good morning, Jeff.","Richard Fearon","Hi.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Just a couple more not on operating questions if we could cover the pension. Just thinking about interest expense, is interest expense finishes Q4 flat with Q3 your annualized benefit for 2014 relative to 2013 out of this some $20 million of the tail, I don\u2019t know if that qualifies as very small but then on top of that, that you had some debt reduction that you\u2019re expecting next year and so if you could maybe just kind of size what\u2019s really going on there and if there is some other missing piece?","","Richard Fearon","Yes, Jeff, it\u2019s Rick. We do have a debt maturity of just over $500 million towards the end of the second quarter and clearly we have over the course of this year put on some things of floating swaps that you have to forecast exactly how those perform. All of that tells us we will have some reduction. We just haven\u2019t quantified exactly how much the reduction is, but as a starting point looking at our interest expense and in Q3 and expecting that over the course of next year, it would likely come down some that\u2019s a reasonable way to think about it.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","And then I was just wondering also on kind of the step-up in pension expense sequentially this quarter and then actually the lack of the step-up in amortization I think on the Q2 call, there were some talk of some reiterating on some of the Cooper balance sheet items that was going to take amortization up, that didn\u2019t happen, do those numbers track sideways from this Q3 level or if there is any change in run rate we should think about there?","Richard Fearon","They do track pretty well sideways into the fourth quarter. On pension the reason, the cost did increase from Q2 to Q3 really has become - because of the increase in the lump-sum settlement. We came out of restrictions on lump-sum settlement in the third quarter and so that\u2019s the impact you\u2019re seeing there. And on amortization we had made an adjustment to some of the purchase price bookings on Cooper at the end of the second quarter and that reset the amount of amortization and so yes there was handful of trade relatively sideways.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","And just on other corporate, within the corporate Rick, you had the inventory step-up in Q1 that came - the next line got a little bit in Q2, it\u2019s kind of back up again in Q3, how should we think about that? Is there any kind of discrete noise we can think about modeling or is that kind of a trend line assumption also?","Richard Fearon","I would assume that this other corporate was 97 in Q3 that is \u2013 the number in Q4 will be in the mid 90s as well, that\u2019s our expectation.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","And then finally just on tax, can you give us a little color what drove it down the way it did, it doesn\u2019t seem as highly related to kind of income fluctuations as I would \u2013 it\u2019s hard to guess, I know it\u2019s much more complicated than that and but - should - give us a little color there and how we should think about cash tax is are they tracking as low or even lower than your book tax rate?","Richard Fearon","Yeah, at the start of this year coming off of the closing of Cooper November 30th of last year, we indicated this would be a year of transition as the very significant changes in our legal structure of the fact that we\u2019re now in Irish Corporation and all of the related transaction to that settles down and so really what you\u2019re seeing is the continuing effects of settling down that transaction. And it\u2019s a complex thing to model all of the income effects from the various entities around the world and so you\u2019re just seeing the impact of those effects.","Next year, the 8% to 10% that we\u2019re forecasting will be a much more normalized reflection of the structure that\u2019s in place. And I might add that one reason that the rate will be higher next year from the 5% this year is in addition there was two years of benefit from the research and experimentation tax credit in the U.S. in 2013 and it\u2019s our expectation right now that you probably won\u2019t have any balance that from R&E tax credit in 2014 and so that itself there is a couple of rate points. And then the other changes, there were several one-off type impacts of the Cooper transaction and we don\u2019t expect those next year either. And so when you take the 5% for this year you make those two adjustments you get into the 8% to 10% range.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Great. Thank you very much.","Donald Bullock","","Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies.","","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies","","Hi good morning guys. It\u2019s just made it. Most of the questions I guess have been answered, but I\u2019m wondering Sandy as you were talking about incremental for next year. Does it make any sense to think about the productivity I guess gains what you\u2019ve made this year to some of those lead into next year and maybe help us a little bit?","Alexander Cutler","So I think the way and we\u2019re as I mentioned earlier we\u2019re not all the way through our final operating planning for next year, but I think the way to think about Steve there is so much the base for this year and they will work the incremental off of that date, so as the incremental synergies from the Cooper plus incremental that would get an additional non Cooper related synergy revenues.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies.","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just quickly, can you give us a sense of the - you mentioned some market share gains in electrical. Can you give us just a sense of exactly what we\u2019re talking about there?","Alexander Cutler","We don\u2019t quote our exact share numbers but we\u2019re really pleased that if even a stronger gain on the booking stream than it is on the shipment stream and I think that gives you an indication of kind of the momentum we have.","","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies.","But just maybe types of products or types of end market?","Alexander Cutler","It\u2019s pretty broadly across the products that we sale in the U.S. and I think it\u2019s a reflection of the fact that whether it\u2019s in the channel or whether it\u2019s working with users and OEMs, the capability we now have plus all the new products we\u2019ve launched that are being received really, really well.","I mentioned to you in the last call this WaveStream technology in our lighting business just got an off, it\u2019s just a bang of a start and that\u2019s the LED introduction and to really [indiscernible] lighting. We have introduced a whole new line of mid range UPS with the high efficiency that we\u2019ve talked you about that we\u2019ve always had in the large three phase that\u2019s off to a great start as well. And I think that, that\u2019s kind of push of new products plus the combined effectiveness we have is allowing to really drive this forward. So and more to follow as we come out of the fourth quarter but we\u2019re very, very pleased with the momentum.","","Stephen Volkmann - Jeff & Co.","Super. And then just lastly quickly anything would you like us to keep in mind vis-\u00e0-vis capital allocation for 2014?","Alexander Cutler","Well, I think as we\u2019ve said before couple of elements here is, that we\u2019re committed to the same practices we had around dividend that we don\u2019t run either a yield model or a payout model but we expect to increase dividends over time in line with earnings. Number two, we want to continue this pay-down of debt as we\u2019ve said and record details here in terms of the kind of payback schedule to get to a total of $2.1 billion pay-down from the start of our -- start of the Cooper acquisition.","We generally make our U.S. pension contribution in January, so you ought to be counting on that again probably not out of pattern with what we\u2019ve been doing in the last couple of years.","And we think in terms of the M&A market it means that we\u2019re not in the M&A market in any material way until we get that $2.1 billion payback and so I would say that\u2019s the primary activity. And then capital expenditure is likely to be the same number we\u2019ve talked about roughly 3% of whatever you project the current year\u2019s revenues would be. So I\u2019d say no dramatic change and we would continue to kind to buy-back shares only to the extent at this point that we\u2019re offsetting options solution and we\u2019ve generally suggested to you that\u2019s kind of a planning number of around $100 million.","Donald Bullock","Okay. And our next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Hi good morning guys. Thanks for putting me in here.","Alexander Cutler","Yes.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Just thinking about 2014 and the bookings growth here and you made some comments Sandy on commercial construction starting to pickup here in the U.S. And I guess historically you guys have talked about maybe greater strength or product capability and more the industrial side, in the power distribution industrial CapEx, those types of markets obviously that makes the change to a little bit with Cooper, but what sort of environment do you see characterize either our top line or earnings leverage if CapEx stay depressed but commercial picks up. Is that a positive environment for Eaton or is that kind of all wash out and be more neutral?","","Alexander Cutler","","It\u2019s a great question, Josh. If we go back to some of the guidance we provided in the first quarter of this year when we\u2019re trying to give you a feel for what are the end markets that support our individual and our individual segments. Here we call it just a little bit less than 50% of our electrical products business, the portion is here in the U.S. is related to residential and non-residential construction. So obviously a powerful play on that continued cycle at this point.","In the Electrical Systems and Services it\u2019s around 30% of that particular business that plays in those two markets as well. Obviously, the hydraulics business has a play in terms of commercial construction and to a little less extent the residential construction. And the truck business obviously within our overall vehicle business has a play in that area obviously as residential housing and commercial construction picks up most of those materials are carried by a truck.","So as we think about the environment of a strengthening residential and commercial construction market in the U.S. those are all very good things for us. Now when you get down within the overall mix of our U.S, private put in place construction about half that market is what we you call commercial, about half is what you would call the kind of heavy industrial side and that includes utility as well as mining as well as telecom and the traditional big areas like energy and power.","Our market share is a very similar across that entire range. So our really there is do we see an overall private put in place number that\u2019s a number like in that 5% range, that becomes pretty sweet music for us in terms of the end market conditions.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Okay. So you\u2019re little agnostic, I guess within --","Alexander Cutler","Yes.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Within some of those verticals?","Alexander Cutler","We are.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Got you. Appreciate it. Thanks.","Donald Bullock","Our last question today comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","","Good morning. And thanks for letting me on.","Alexander Cutler","Yes. Good morning Eli.","Richard Fearon","Hi, good morning.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","","One clarification, so you talked about the strength in orders, can you differentiate what\u2019s going on in a marketplace from the easier comps that we [indiscernible] September, October, November from a year ago versus what you might consider more strength in the marketplace and particularly maybe more market share gains. It looks to me like your strength is more a combination of easier comps in some market share gains within electrical?","Alexander Cutler","I just had have to go look in detail at all the future comps Eli, I would say, we tend to look at this not only a year-over-year but also on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And we saw a better activity here in this third quarter than we were seeing obviously a little earlier in the year. We think that\u2019s a reflection that we\u2019re starting to see Europe is clearly getting better in its bottom.","We think the same as true in Asia and many of our markets. That was not true earlier this year. And the U.S. is on this kind of steady recovery and I think highly fancy but it\u2019s getting better except for the occasional interruptions we have that\u2019s come out of budget discussions. But it\u2019s getting better and so, I think that maybe the most significant things that we\u2019ve been watching kind of around the world is, it looks to us like the oil and gas industry is going to be spending a lot of money in 2014, 2015 and 2016, clearly the additional assets we put in front of that with the Cooper acquisition. We think are very advantageous and our combined capability helps.","The power quality market the three-phased business which is one that was quite weak a year and a half ago as definitely picked up. This construction market and mobile and stationary users and hydraulics clearly we think that market is changing as well. So our feeling isn\u2019t simply an issue of weaker comps. We think we\u2019re seeing a momentum change.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","All right. And final question, last year, you\u2019re looking at roughly almost 1.5% margin improvement in effect with zero and market help. The Cooper -- the synergies are similar from Cooper incrementally year-over-year. So, if you\u2019ve a chance of getting anything close to kind of a margin improvement in 2014 versus 2013, if you do get market growth if you are starting to think about?","Alexander Cutler","I think that there is no question. If we can get some market expansion with incrementals, even this kind of -- if they turn out to be in this kind of 25% to 30%, that\u2019s going to be helpful. And so I guess the way, I would urge you to think about this as you get to $95 million of incremental year-to-year synergies that\u2019s a plus. And then we\u2019ll get the incremental based upon whatever kind of volume that we can drive off this 3% to 4% anticipated market and then outgrowth of that end markets.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","So getting a similar kind of margin improvement next year versus this year, it is something within a framework that we can think about and talk about given?","Alexander Cutler","And again when you think about trying to select an incremental margin on the non-Cooper synergy volume, I think somewhere in that 25% to 30% is the right range and not the 33% that we use this year because we -- that as I mentioned earlier in the call, came from the fact that we took the $50 million of restructuring the previous year.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Securities","Great. Thank you very much.","Alexander Cutler","Certainly.","Donald Bullock","Thank you very much for joining us today. As always Mark Doheny and I will be available to take your calls and questions immediately after our call today. And again thank you very much for joining us.","Operator","","That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference Service.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Don Bullock. Please go ahead.","Don Bullock","Good morning. I am Don Bullock, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us for Eaton\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","As is typical, our agenda today will include opening remarks by Craig highlighting the performance in the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2018. As we have done in our past calls, we will be taking questions at the end of Craig\u2019s comments. The press release from our earning announcement this morning and the presentation will be posted on our website or have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation do include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of the call was also accessible on our website and will be available for replay.","Before we dive into the details, I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore by definition forward-looking statements. The actual results may differ from those forecasted projections due to a wide range of risk and uncertainties that were all described in our earnings release and the presentation also outlined in our 8-K.","Before I turn it over to Craig, I do want to highlight a change that you may have noticed in our press release and presentation today. Since about 2001, we have used the term operating earnings and operating earnings per share in description of our financial results. Those terms have consistently been used to describe net income and net income per share less acquisition integration and transaction costs. The reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures of net income and net income per share have also historically been provided on our website. Going forward, the term operating earnings and operating earnings per share will be replaced with adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share. The definition of those measures, remain the same for Q4 that is the net income and net income per share minus any acquisition integration and transaction charges. We will continue to provide you with reconciliations to the GAAP measures of net income and net income per share on our website.","With that, let me turn it over to Craig to go through the results.","Craig Arnold","Okay. Hey, thanks Don. I will begin on Page 3 where we highlight our Q4 results. And overall I\u2019d say we are very pleased with our fourth quarter results. And just as important, the momentum that we are carrying into 2018, we generated net income and adjusted earnings per share of $1.43 and this includes as we noted $62 million of income from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. You will recall that we issued guidance in late December and we estimated that the impact of tax reform would lead to a one-time charge of between $90 million and $110 million.","As we completed Q4 and worked with the details of the tax reform bill, this turned into a $62 million benefit. The adjustment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower tax rate created $79 million of income, which was partially offset by a $70 million charge for the mandatory repatriation tax. Excluding these one-time items, our net income and adjusted earnings per share were $1.29, $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance and up 15% over last year, so really results that we are pleased with. Sales were also strong in the quarter, up 7%, of which 7% was organic. And as noted, orders were also strong across all of our segments. Segment operating margins increased to a record 6.5% and excluding restructuring costs, we posted operating margins of 17.1%, which was up 80 basis points from prior year. And given the strong orders, we decided to actually accelerate some of our restructuring initiatives, which resulted in a spending $41 million in the quarter and this was some $16 million above our prior guidance.","We also continue to generate robust cash, operating cash flow in the quarter, which was $879 million. Our free cash flow to net income was 112% and excluding the $62 million of one-time income from the tax bill it was 124%, so once again very strong performance. In last we repurchased $61 million of our shares during the quarter which brought our full year share repurchase to $850 million.","Turning to Page 4, we summarized the key income statement items and I want to just highlight a few key metrics here. We have covered some of this data already. So first I will highlight our segment operating margins were up 21% and excluding restructuring costs margins were 17.1%, up 80 basis points year-on-year on the 5% organic growth. And this reflects naturally the benefit that we are seeing from the restructuring program as well as incremental profits on our revenue growth. I would also note that our $41 million of restructuring expense in the quarter was $36 million in the business segments and $5 million at corporate.","Turning our attention to the segments, I will begin with Electrical Products. Our Electrical Products business grew 6% in Q4, 3% of the growth was organic and 3% from positive currency and our orders increased 5% with strength in both the Americas and the Europe region what we call EMEA. In the Americas specifically, we experienced particularly strong growth in industrial and large commercial markets as well as in residential products and in the Canadian market. And in Europe we saw strength in our power quality business, industrial markets as well as in large commercial projects. And so by and large we are pleased with the order growth that we saw in the Products segment in the fourth quarter.","On Page 6, we summarized results from the Electrical Systems and Services segment where we really have a very positive story unfolding. First the business has returned to growth both in revenue and the orders in the quarter. Sales were up 3%, 2% organic growth, 2% from positive currency which was partially offset by 1% from the divestiture of a joint venture that we had. I would add here that the organic revenue turned positive slightly ahead of our expectations on strength largely in harsh and hazardous, the Canadian market and in power distribution assemblies business which was primarily in the Americas. Perhaps more significantly orders in Q4 were up 12% over prior year and once again with strong growth in the Americas. As we have seen for the last several quarters we saw particularly strength in large power distribution assemblies, parts and hazardous systems in our electrical services business which also posted strong growth in the quarter.","Operating margins also improved nicely. Excluding restructuring costs, margins increased 140 basis points to 15.6%. And this improvement was primarily the result of incremental margins on the revenue growth, but also the benefits from the restructuring actions that we have been taking. You will also notice that we referenced a small divestiture here was taken a joint venture during the quarter. And I would say the way to think about this is it really represents the work that\u2019s ongoing across the company to continue to review our portfolio for strategic fit and also for performance.","Turning the page, we are also very pleased with the improvements that we are seeing in our hydraulics business. We continue to generate strong growth, 18% in the quarter, 17% of which was organic and 1% from currency. And the improvement I can only say that\u2019s very broad base with both distribution and OEM sales up both in the mid-teens and we continue to experience really strong order growth increasing 25% in the quarter with solid growth in all regions. And the growth in the quarter really matches our growth for the year both coming in at up 25%. Operating margins also continued to expand reaching 13% and this number excludes restructuring costs and represents a 150 basis point improvement over last year. And I\u2019d say we were pleased that after several years of significant restructuring and hard work by hydraulics team that margins excluding restructuring costs are now operating within the margin target range that we set for the business, up 13% to 16%. We certainly have work to do in this segment but we fully expect to continue to see margin improvements and to be solidly within the target margin range that we set for the business as we move forward.","As I noted last quarter, the business also continues to experience a significant ramp up in orders. As you can see we are addressing these issues and making progress. On Page 8, we cover aerospace. Our sales increased 4%, 2% coming from organic and 2% from positive currency and we also had another quarter of strong bookings, up a solid 9% with strength across almost all end markets and I would specifically note aftermarket bookings were up 9% and we saw very strong order growth in military OEM markets. Operating margins continue to represent strong performance and excluding restructuring costs increased 20 basis points to as you can see 20.2%.","Moving to our vehicle business, you will note that we once again had a very strong quarter with sales growth of 13%, 12% coming from organic growth, 3% from positive currency, and 2% reduction as a result of us forming the Eaton Cummins joint venture. The strong order growth was driven primarily by strength in NAFTA classic truck markets, which were up 37% and this was somewhat muted by global light vehicle markets, which were flat during the quarter. Operating margins, excluding restructuring costs, were up a solid 250 basis points from prior year and reached 17.3%. Unlike other businesses this segment is really benefiting by delivering the incremental margins on the change in volume, but also benefiting from the restructuring initiatives that have been undertaken in this segment.","Before we turn to page completely on 2007, I thought it would be helpful to briefly summarize some of the notable highlights at what we think was a great year of progress and our thoughts are summarized here on Page 10. First, our markets returned to growth with modest acceleration as we saw in the second half of the year. This resulted in 3% organic growth for the year. It would also appear that we are in a period of we call it synchronous global growth and we really have all seen the enthusiasm associated with the U.S. tax bill. So, we think these two factors are really setting the global economy and Eaton up for modest acceleration as we entered 2018.","Our net income and adjusted earnings per share was $6.68 and this includes naturally the gain from the formation of the joint venture with Cummins as well as the income on the tax changes. Excluding these one-time items, our adjusted EPS was $4.65 and this was $0.20 above the midpoint of our original guidance and up 10% over 2016. As we continue to generate strong operating cash flow of $2.7 billion, 2017 was a record year for the company and this by the way is after making a $350 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan, so very strong cash flow during the year. I would also add that our U.S. qualified pension plan was funded at 95% at the end of the year and as of last Friday actually was funded at 98% and so despite really having the lowest discount rates that we have seen in several decades, our pension plans are really close to fully funded. So, we really feel good about getting that issue behind us.","Lastly, we completed our third year of our full year share repurchase program repurchasing $850 million of our shares during the year and this was 11.5 million shares or 2.5% of our shares outstanding as of the beginning of the year. And between dividend and share repurchase, we actually returned $1.9 billion to shareholders in 2017. So, overall, I would say I am very proud of the entire Eaton team in the year that we had. We delivered on our commitments to shareholders and we continue to advance the mission that we saw for the company.","Turning our attention to 2018, Page 11 is the summary of growth and margins assumptions for Eaton overall and for each of our segments. We expect organic revenue growth in the electrical products business to grow approximately 3% and our forecast of 3% organic growth in Electrical Products is about the same as we experienced in 2017 with really broad growth in all geographies. In electrical systems and services, that business is really in the early stages of a rebound and we expect to see 4% growth in the year. Our forecast reflects growth in the America is driven by power distribution assemblies, harsh and hazardous systems and moderate growth in the rest of the world. For hydraulics, we really anticipate another very strong year of double digit organic growth of approximately 10%. The 10% organic growth compared to 12% in \u201817 and is certainly supported by the order book in the backlog that we carry into 2018. And the growth I would say here really continue to be driven primarily by the strength that we are seeing in construction markets around the world.","Our aerospace business is expected to grow approximately 3% and we expect to see strong growth in commercial OEM markets as well as in commercial aftermarket. We also expect military OEM markets to grow modestly and this is compared to a slight decline that we experienced in 2017. And finally, vehicle business is expected to see 1% organic growth and the strongest market is once again expected to be not the Class 8, which is expected to grow some 9%. And it\u2019s important I think to note here that much of this growth will be reflected in the Eaton Cummins joint venture where we don\u2019t consolidate revenue. And so some of you may have been a little bit surprised by the relatively muted growth number for vehicles and that\u2019s largely because much of this growth is being captured in side of the joint venture.","And in the global light vehicle market should grow 1% to 2%. Yes, with these rates of organic growth and in the benefits of the multi-year restructuring program we expect to see certain margins in the ranges that you see noted on the page. For Eaton overall, our segment margin guidance is in the range of 16.3% to 16.9%. And this includes the net impact of any restructuring actions. And so all of our restructuring expenditures are embedded in this number, so at a midpoint of 16.6% this represents an 80 basis point improvement over 2017. And looking at our segments, vehicle year-to-year margins are expected to be flat with other segments improving between the low of 30 basis points in aerospace to a high of 280 basis points in hydraulics. So we think 2018 will be another year of solid progress and the year in which we took another step forward towards delivering the 17% to 18% segment margins that we have committed as a part of our 5-year financial goals.","And page 12 our final slide, we summarized our full year guidance for 2018. Our guidance for net income and adjusted earnings per share is in the range of $5 to $5.20 a share at the midpoint of $5.10 which represents a 10% increase over 2017 and this obviously excludes any of the one-time items that benefited 2017. On revenues, we have already gone through the details behind the 4% organic growth outlook. But I would note here that we also expect to see $150 million of positive impact from currency, but this will be largely offset by $150 million negative associated with the impact of the joint ventures. And this includes both the formation of the Eaton Cummins joint venture in vehicle and as well as the dissolution of the joint venture that we referenced in electrical systems and services. And as noted we expect segment margins to be in a range of 16.3 to 16.9. And we think corporate expenses will be flat during the year.","We are also updating our prior December \u201817 commentary on the impact of U.S. tax reform in 2018. After further review we expect our tax rate to be between 13% and 15% instead of the 14% to 16% previously announced. And importantly here, very important here I think we expect our tax rate for 2019 onwards to stabilize in the 14% to 16% range. So we think it \u2013 as we think about tax reform, we are pleased that that particular uncertainty has not been taken off the table as we move forward. We also expect another year of record operating cash flow between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion. We expect to spend $575 million in capital expenditures with resulting free cash flow of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. And you recall that 2018 is also the year that we complete the final leg of our full year $3 billion share repurchase program and as a result we are planning to repurchase $800 million of our shares during the year. So in summary I would say we are very pleased with our Q4 and 2017 results. We expect 2018 to be another strong year and to continue to deliver on our commitments to shareholders that we outlined as a part of our 2016 to 2020 goals.","So at this point, I will stop and I will open it up for questions.","Don Bullock","Our operator will provide you with the questions \u2013 with the instructions for the question-and-answer.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Don Bullock","Our first question comes from David Raso with Evercore.","David Raso","Hi, good morning.","Don Bullock","Hi.","David Raso","The obvious star of this report here is the ESS orders, can you flush that out for us a little bit more this top in orders and like the core guidance is pretty healthy at 4% for that division, looking you will you help us a little bit with the cadence of this kind of order strength as you see it\u2019s starting the year further into \u201818 and maybe some timings is there some lag on those orders translating into revenue growth?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I would we are very pleased with the strength that we are seeing in electrical system and services orders. And as I noted in my opening commentary we think this recovery is coming roughly maybe a quarter even earlier than what we originally anticipated. But I would say we are really \u2013 we continue to see with oil prices rising and we continue to see a return to growth in our harsh and hazardous, our Crouse-Hinds business. That business is picking up nicely. And in the one \u2013 the large piece of that business that we had really been under a lot of pressure over the last a couple of years or so our large projects. And so our large systems business, really not just this quarter, but last quarter as well have started to improve markedly and so we are seeing that come through obviously in stronger orders in Q4. As you think about the timing of orders these are obviously big projects. They tend to have longer lead time until \u2013 as we think about 2018, we think the business starts a little slower in the first half of the year and picks up in the second half of the year and that\u2019s just a function of the timing of a lot of these large projects.","David Raso","And just two clarifications if you don\u2019t mind, the impact on the LIFO, FIFO change on the inventory for the 2018 EPS and also if I missed that I apologize, the restructuring charge the total for \u201817 and what we expected to be in \u201818 the restructuring costs going through?","Rick Fearon","Yes. I will address the first one Dave, it\u2019s Rick. The impact on LIFO in the fourth quarter was $0.01 out of the 129, so it was not at all significant. And typically and as we look back at past years LIFO has ranged between positive $10 million, minus $10 million, so really $0.01 to $0.02 timing impact. And just to comment, because I did see in analyst report somebody asked why did you make this change, well, the great majority of our peers are only on FIFO. And in fact in most of the rest of the world you have to be on FIFO. The reason that our U.S. operations have been on LIFO is that up until a couple of years ago for income tax purposes we run LIFO. And the rule was if you run LIFO for income tax, you had to be on LIFO for book purposes. But as we looked at all of our peers being mainly or most of our peers being on FIFO and we looked at the extra time and trouble it took to make these complex calculations to go on the LIFO it seem to us that the better move was simply to move everything to FIFO would have $0.01 to $0.02 impact in any given year. And we will in our K we will show you the impact over the last 5 years, but it is $0.01 to $0.02 positive, negative in any given year. The last comment I will make just so people don\u2019t misunderstand our segment results that we have been reporting all of these years have always been on FIFO. So the only impact on LIFO is in corporate. We take a LIFO charge or LIFO income and it shows up in our corporate numbers.","David Raso","That\u2019s really helpful. And the restructuring costs\u2026","Rick Fearon","Yes. It\u2019s a different restructuring, we have spent a $116 million in restructuring in 2017 and embedded in our guidance for 2018 we are going to spend $90 million. And so that\u2019s a little bit up from I know some of the prior guidance. And I think you were to see that as a really positive thing. The reality is we simply see lots of opportunities to continue to improve the company and we continue to make those investments that have very attractive returns and I will remind you once again that all of restructuring cost is fully embedded in the guidance that we provide. Now as we mentioned before, we were on this multiyear restructuring program, where we were every quarter talking about restructuring and calling it out. What we would intend to do going forward is that simply be embedded on our business, it will be embedded in our results and so we would not intend to talk about restructuring as we think about the reporting our results during the course of 2018.","David Raso","Craig, that\u2019s way more impressive, because I don\u2019t think the restructuring would be that high in \u201818 so you are still sticking to your 40% incremental, but you are taking a bigger hit on the restructuring like in a way the year-over-year help from lower restructuring is not as helpful as I thought. Did you bump up the savings or the saving still supposed to be around 50%?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I mean, if you think about some of the newer items that we are taking on many of those benefits will be in the out years and so we would not necessarily expect to see a very big increase in restructuring savings in the year on the increment, but I think it\u2019s simply a reflection of the fact that the underlying growth rates will be a little stronger than what we anticipated and we took this opportunity to continue to reinvest in the business and to reinvest in programs that were going to have future benefits.","David Raso","So your implied 39.2% incrementals here are a little \u201ccleaner\u201d right, they are not necessarily so much a year-over-year reduction in restructuring?","Craig Arnold","Absolutely. That\u2019s the way to think about it.","David Raso","Alright. No, I appreciate that. Thanks for the color.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Hey, good morning guys.","Craig Arnold","Hi.","Scott Davis","I was trying to reconcile a little bit that the comments about global synchronous recovery in the guide on Electrical Products side, I mean, particularly given bookings up 5%. I know the quarter, which is up 3%, but your comps are relatively easy. I mean, what gives you \u2013 I mean other than just being conservative, I mean, is there anything else there that leads to some cautiousness as far as that ramp \u2013 that 2018 ramp versus 2017?","Craig Arnold","Yes, I would say, your reference to the comps being easy, I\u2019d say our Electrical Products business during the course of 2017 had a solid year of growth and so it grew 3% in 2017. And I think post the growth in each of the quarters and so I don\u2019t know that the comps are necessarily easy, but maybe a little color on those markets that we think will perhaps grow a little faster and those that will grow a little slower as we think about the end markets, we think going into 2018 our industrial markets and large commercial business inside of Electrical Products will be above the average of that 3%. We think the components that we sell even in this segment into the oil and gas markets and applications will be above that number. We think that products going into smaller commercial applications could be a little below that number as well as single phase power quality and the other piece we report our lighting segment inside of Electrical Products and that business is very much like you have seen from some of the others in the industry, we think the lighting business in 2018 is more like flat to down slightly than it is growth. And so that\u2019s also probably having a muting effect at least on the overall growth of our Electrical Products segment.","Scott Davis","That\u2019s really helpful. And then as a follow-up, Craig, there is always a lot of chatter around your portfolio and lots of company\u2019s peers of yours going through different stages of de-conglomeration and such. I mean, is this the portfolio that you plan writing or can we expect further changes in 2018?","Craig Arnold","Yes. The way I would answer that question is guys, every one of our business today are measured against our criteria and we have laid that out in New York last year and the year before and we will talk about it again this year. And so one of the big changes as I think about the portfolio in the company is that we used to talk about the fact that we had a portfolio and the way this portfolio of businesses work together would enable us to create a company that was good for the cycle. Well, the big pivot that we made was that we said today, every business had to be a good business in its own right. And we have laid out a criteria that says here is the criteria, you have to be global business, you have to grow faster than GDP, you have to deliver mid to high returns. And with sales, you have to deliver mid 20s return on assets and if you are in a cyclical market you have to deliver a minimum of 13%. And so we laid out the criteria for each of our businesses. And I can tell you that each of our businesses today is making great progress towards those objectives the extent that they are not necessarily meeting them today. So we like the portfolio today, but having said that, we will always look at it. Throughout our history we have always continued to be tough minded about businesses and things that made sense and things that don\u2019t. So we will always continue to look at the portfolio and to make changes where we think it makes sense from a shareholder value creation. The way we think about portfolio management is more around the margins of what we do in our businesses and that\u2019s where we talked about a number of small divestitures things that we are stepping out of, things that we are going to manage the portfolio inside of the businesses that we do have, you can rest assure we will keep looking at it.","Scott Davis","That\u2019s good color, okay. Thanks guys. Good luck to you. I will pass it on.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Hi, good morning guys. Maybe just starting on ESS margins for a second in the guidance of 20 basis points to 80 basis points, obviously the fourth quarter was very strong and part of that may have been a little bit of less restructuring actions, but is this business is to add tough times and slow growth for quite some time and you think the incrementals on this business as even if even 4% turns out to be the right number from a growth standpoint next year or in 2018 you should expect incrementals on this business to be very strong, so maybe talk a little bit about that within the context of your guidance your margin guidance like what the puts and takes for margins in 2018?","Craig Arnold","I would say the electrical systems and services business is what we provided in the form of guidance is that we expect 40% incremental rate all in for Eaton inclusive of the restructuring benefit. And I would say that business does tend to perform a little higher than that and others inside the business perhaps are a little lower. But I would say that all of the benefits associated with the restructuring and the 4% ramp that we are seeing there fully baked into the guidance that we are reflecting inside the company. As we do continue to invest in the business across the board and we think that the numbers that we are proposing in terms of the guidance for 2018 are very much reflective on what we would expect from the business at this point in the cycle.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, that\u2019s helpful Craig. Maybe asking this a little bit differently, I guess if I would think about potential headwinds for 2018 and specifically as it relates this business I would think perhaps price cost you still have commodity inflation, so I would be curious to hear how you guys are managing that and whether 2018 should be better than 2017. And I guess secondly the other thing we are just kind of seeing just from a logistics perspective it seems like things are getting a lot tighter from a truck capacity perspective, so any commentary on like freight costs as well would be helpful?","Craig Arnold","I think it\u2019s clear that as we think about price versus costs going into 2018, we think 2018 is a better year and easier year than 2017. You recall that we experienced a bunch of unanticipated material cost inflation in 2018 and we are basically chasing it all year. But you see the same reports that I do. We are not really seeing commodity prices let up at all, but I can tell you that the businesses today are very well positioned to react and respond and to manage in this increasing environment of commodity cost increases. And so as we think about 2018 we don\u2019t expect commodity prices for the full year create an issue for us as our teams work on plans and initiatives to either pass it through to the marketplace or to offset it with a number of different cost on productivity initiatives that we have inside of the business. And to your point around truck capacity, absolutely we are seeing a little tightness there and that\u2019s part of I think what you see in the form of the strength in the North America Class 8 market as orders continue to drive up strongly. And that\u2019s because there is a bit of capacity tightness there and it is being reflected in freight rates and so that\u2019s once again though all fully baked into the guidance that we provided.","Joe Ritchie","Helpful color. Thanks guys. Nice quarter.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS.","Steven Winoker","Hi, thanks and good morning all.","Craig Arnold","Alright.","Steven Winoker","Hey, just Craig you just finished this multiyear restructuring program as you noted and that was an enormous effort that you have been talking about for years and really one of the main focuses of the organization. So, it begs the question on that front what\u2019s next around continuous productivity and additional restructuring, are you finished or where are you on the path now?","Craig Arnold","Yes, what I\u2019d say is no, we are not finished. And then as we noted earlier that we said it, you don\u2019t always want to think about an underlying rate of restructuring spending in the business and we originally targeted a number of $60 million to $70 million. And as we talked about on our guidance for 2018, well it\u2019s been $90 million. And so we really do believe there is infinite capacity to continue to improve things to do things better or different to be more efficient. And so I don\u2019t think we ever really run out of an opportunity for the foreseeable future to continue to find good programs to invest in, that results in us reducing our costs and building a more efficient organization. And so it\u2019s too early to give you a guide beyond 2018, but I think you can count on us just with a consistent cadence of spending dollars of restructuring to continue to drive margin expansion.","Steven Winoker","Focused in any particular business units though?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I think you can generally think about in the context of the high, the margin business, the less need there is for restructuring. I think you get to a point in some of these businesses where you over-toggle. So I just think \u2013 you just think about in the context of the margins and the lower the margins the probably the higher participation those businesses will be in the restructuring programs. And keep in mind it will always be fully embedded in the guidance that we provide.","Steven Winoker","Great. And that is best practice. And I know on ES&S, you last I think hit what 14.4% or so in 2013, so you are getting there. You would be thinking go beyond it?","Craig Arnold","Yes, absolutely. I mean, we can keep in mind and that business is just starting to cycle up too in terms of some of the key end markets that we participate in. So, we fully would expect \u2013 we are not going to give you another range, right, we have provided a range of 13% to 16% as a range through the cycle for that business. And so we are not in a position yet to change that range, but absolutely, we would expect it to continue to improve.","Steven Winoker","And sorry, one last, any detail behind the lower incrementals on the products front in this last quarter, I know it\u2019s a high-margin business, but there are any particular dynamics that work?","Craig Arnold","I appreciate the question and we are overall pleased with the margins. There were really two things inside of our Electrical Products that impacted us in Q4. One, we had a mix issue in our European business and nothing to worry about, we just had a number of very large shipments at the end of the year of products that has carried a much lower margin than we typically see in that business, but once again, a one-time kind of event. And the other thing if you recall we highlighted earlier that we would be dealing with in Q4 some of the fallout of the hurricanes that we experienced in Puerto Rico and that also impacted our margin. So, when you factor in, factor out those two events, our margins would have been 19.6% and a 20 basis point improvement versus prior year.","Steven Winoker","Okay, very helpful. I am glad to see that the good work in Puerto Rico that you guys did. Thanks.","Craig Arnold","Thank you.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Craig Arnold","Hi.","Jeff Sprague","Just wanted to get just drill into the couple businesses, first maybe back to ESS, so in the opening remarks, you didn\u2019t mention utility at all or if you did I missed it, what do you see playing out in the utility space here as we exit 2017 and then what are you expecting for 2018?","Craig Arnold","We see the utility markets continue to be in the low single-digit kind of growth range. And so if you think about that in the context of the overall electrical systems and services business and maybe it\u2019s a slight deduct from the 12%, but not much and that\u2019s really what we experienced during the course of 2017 in the U.S. market to specifically and that\u2019s really what we expect going forward.","Jeff Sprague","And then on lighting, I mean, what you are saying is definitely not inconsistent with what we have heard from others, but what is your view on the disconnect if you will between relatively healthy commercial activity in lighting continuing the lag is the channel, is it share loss at the low end across the industry and you have a review on when lighting might reconnect with what\u2019s going on in the construction related markets?","Craig Arnold","It really has been a bit of a conundrum, the market that has pretty consistently grown and grown faster than many of the other end markets that we saw this period of retrenchment or flatness in 2017. And it\u2019s really kind of consistent with our view going forward. I would say there is probably a couple of things going on and once again very much consistent with what you heard from others. We do think the market itself is probably more competitive today than it has been in the past as LED technology becomes more proven and more of a standard. We think certainly if you are probably seeing more competition, more price competition in that market than we have seen historically. And so we will have to wait and see how that plays through. We are certainly continuing to see the ramp in connected and controlled lighting. In fact our growth in that segment of the market was very handsome and very much consistent with what you heard from others, but it\u2019s not yet a big enough piece to offset the decline in the legacy part of the lighting. The other thing I would say on the positive side despite the fact that lighting overall as a category has been a little bit flattish, we continue to see growth in LED. In fact our LED business continue to grow nicely in Q4. Today LEDs represent 79% of our revenues and so that continues to be a positive for us. But it really is a bit of a wait and see story. We take a lot of confidence in the fact that buildings are built, they need lights and the end markets that we are serving continue to be quite robust, so where I think we are going to a little bit of a transition period right now and we will have to wait and see how it plays out longer term.","Jeff Sprague","And one last one for me just on hydraulics, could you comment a little bit on hydraulics China and also are you to keep this good track of what\u2019s going on in the channel, any concern that maybe people are double ordering or anything here as we have kind of a scramble upward here?","Craig Arnold","Specifically with respect to hydraulics China and what we are seeing there is very much consistent what we are seeing in the global hydraulics market which is a very significant ramp in the construction equipment market and the excavator market in China has been up over 100%. The rail loader market has been up 50%, so really strong growth that we are seeing out of China overall. And I do think to your point overall there is always a risk when you end up at this point in the cycle when lead times are starting to push out is always a risk that gets a little bit of over of ordering or booking early in the process. One of the reasons why you would say why 10% growth in hydraulics or orders about 25, because we do believe there is a little bit of timing associated with what\u2019s going on inside of that market. We will have to wait and see, I mean we really are encouraged by some of the retail sales numbers that you are seeing from some of the major equipment companies where retail sales are growing quite nicely. So it is a little bit of a wait and see in that market as well. But we think 10% is a number that\u2019s very much supported by what we have seen in other cycles and what we think we are ultimately delivering the business during the course of year.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you very much.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeff Hammond","Hi, good morning guys.","Craig Arnold","Hi.","Jeff Hammond","Just back on ESS, I mean any good lumpiness in the orders in 4Q that wouldn\u2019t repeat. And then just maybe as you think of quoting and talking to customers just the sustainability of this uptick you have seen in large projects and Crouse-Hinds?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I would say not really. I wouldn\u2019t say that we have seen any particular one-time orders or things that would be suggest that the underlying order rate is not sustainable in our order book. And so no particular concern is there in the systems \u2013 large systems business or in Crouse-Hinds. And so the other \u2013 I am sorry the other part of your question was?","Jeff Hammond","Based on quoting and customers as you look forward, sustainability around Crouse-Hinds in these large projects have upticked?","Craig Arnold","I\u2019d say I would point to you one of the things that we track as we track negotiations. And so I would say that very much consistent with what we are seeing in our order book. Our negotiations for the year in that business which is a prerequisite for an order were actually up running up as well kind of mid-teen levels. And so we are also seeing overall economic activity negotiations to be essentially growing at the same rate as the underlying orders and that\u2019s really encouraging for the future.","Jeff Hammond","That\u2019s great. And then just on the \u2013 to understand on the comments Eaton JV, so the JV income is that going to run through Vehicle segment Op income and just update us on when you think that the income from that JV starts to ramp?","Craig Arnold","The ramp is yes, it will run through the Vehicle segment. And in terms of when the incomes starts to ramp know, I can tell you today that we are investing heavily in the joint venture. One of the big kind of reasons why we have made the decisions to partner with Cummins in this particular space is because we saw an opportunity to really accelerate our growth by introducing some new products and doing some things that would allow us to expand beyond our historical customer base. And so at this point we are not prepared to give you a longer term forecast of an income while the new say we were still significantly in the investment mode and so we would not expect in 2018 to see income come out of a joint venture as we continue to invest for growth.","Rick Fearon","And yes, we have already built in the expectations of that investment into this 2018 guidance.","Jeff Hammond","Okay, great. Thanks Craig.","Craig Arnold","Sure.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Andrew Krill","Thank you. Good morning. This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. I was hoping can you give us some of your big picture views on non-resis for 2018, I think a lot of people have been concerned it could be choppy, but it seems to continue to grind higher, so any color you can give there? Thank you.","Craig Arnold","I could say in terms of non-resi markets, I would say that the way we think about it is that it\u2019s kind of no real change from what we experienced during the course of 2017. We think little magnitude. We think growth in the 4% range is kind of the consensus number out there as well from the other forecasting organizations. And so like we think in many ways, it\u2019s almost a little bit of a repeat from what we experienced in 2017. The one thing that could be a potential upside to that if we end up with an infrastructure bill at some point in the U.S., some of these numbers could get better down the road. But right now we are planning on pretty much a repeat of what we experienced in 2017.","Andrew Krill","Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up, I think one or your other like foreign domicile peers also know the dynamic where their tax rates should kind of go up in the out years, can you just give us any more insight into like the technicalities driving that? Thank you,","Rick Fearon","Yes. I will address that. As we said we believe our rate for \u201818 will be 13% to 15%. We think \u201819 and beyond it only goes up one percentage point, so to a rate of 14% to 16%. And it goes up partly because the tax bill does have some elements that do ramp in. In \u201818 there is a partial ramp and then in \u201819 there is a larger ramp. But we think that stabilizing in the 14% to 16% range seems to us to be a pretty good result and will be we think relative to most other multinationals an attractive rate. I would make one other or maybe two other comments here, because there have been some things written on our taxes that we are just not correct. I want to make sure everybody understands. I saw one analyst that suggested that because of the tax bill that we might need to change our manufacturing footprint and that is just not correct. We don\u2019t believe that there will be any need to make any significant changes of the footprint as a result of the tax bill. And secondly, there was a comment that our \u2013 the treatment of our dividend from a tax perspective would change and that isn\u2019t correct either because, at least in the intermediate term we continue to believe that our dividend will be 100% return of capital. And that means for U.S. shareholders there will be no present tax owed down it. And then at some point in the future, if our dividend ever became other than return of capital, the taxation of that dividend, the rates applied to it would be the same as applied in the other corporation based in the United States. And so I just wanted to make those clarifications.","Andrew Krill","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup.","Tim Thein","Great. Good morning, just going back to that the comments earlier on the JV with Cummins, on the truck orders for \u2013 in North America on the heavy duty side, Craig what\u2019s the split or what are you anticipating the split to be in terms of AMTs versus manuals, just thinking about how your underlying growth will track this normal build rates?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I don\u2019t have that exact split, but clearly AMTs are continuing to grow and manuals are continuing to decline. I can get you the further details through Don after the call.","Tim Thein","Okay, understood. And then and maybe you touched a lot of markets within ES&S, but maybe just a word on power quality more broadly, obviously impacting both single and 3-phase but just curious in terms of what\u2019s embedded in the outlook here for 2018?","Craig Arnold","Yes. And thanks for the question. Certainly power quality was one of the more disappointing market in 2017. And as we take a look at 2018 the single phase is the power quality. I think you will recall that we report it to our electrical products business. And the three phase will report to our systems and services business. And we think the power quality markets in 2018 we think grow in the range of low single-digit, so we think they have a better year than they had in 2017. And we think that\u2019s another one of the positive kind of year-over-year impetuses for growth is certainly our electrical systems and services business.","Tim Thein","Okay. Thank you.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andy Casey","Good morning everybody.","Craig Arnold","Good morning Andy.","Andy Casey","Can you \u2013 I guess can you comment on capital redeployment specifically on whether the acquisition pipeline activities picked up because the balance sheet is net debt to total cap solidly mid-20s, pension fully funded, heavy lifting from a management capacity for margin improvement seems to be down, I am just wondering where we should expect some of the improved cash flow to be allocated other than share repo?","Rick Fearon","Andy, it\u2019s Rick. We are spending much more time looking at targets and evaluating situations. Valuation levels are high as you well know and you also know that we have been incredibly disciplined and we will continue to be incredibly disciplined as we look at acquisitions. So I can\u2019t tell you exactly what we might get done this year, but rest assure that we understand that we have very adequate capital. And we would like to find ways to augment our growth and to augment the strategic position of our various businesses. But it\u2019s just hard to figure out exactly what will economically make sense over the course of the year.","Craig Arnold","Having said that, I would just add that what we have always said is that the first call on capital is to reinvest in our businesses to drive organic growth. And we certainly look forward to sharing with this group one way to get over New York some of the organic growth initiatives that we are investing in that really take advantage of some of the secular trends that are impacting our businesses. And so we think we have some exciting opportunities to invest in are internally to drive organic growth that perhaps can help bridge some of that gap.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you. And then a little bit more specific on vehicle, you anticipate a part of the question on revenue, but even with that flat margin year-to-year at the midpoint seems a little bit muted, is that flat performance due to the accelerated investment into the JV that you mentioned or do you expect vehicle to see a little bit more restructuring this year than it did last year?","Craig Arnold","What I would say the way to think about it, once you can appreciate the question is it\u2019s really investment, I mean it\u2019s investment and we will talk a little about this. And when we get together in New York it\u2019s really investment in some new technologies and electrification and so we are really taking this opportunity to reinvest in the business to really position the business to generate organic growth going forward.","Andy Casey","Okay, thank you very much.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird.","Mig Dobre","Yes, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a clarification, so the guidance implies $26 million lower restructuring cost in \u201818 versus \u201817 can you remind us what the incremental savings are?","Rick Fearon","Mig, what we have said is that we really going forward are not going to try to reconcile costs \u2013 restructuring costs and savings every year. It frankly is just everyday activity. And so we simply wanted to note that we had earlier said perhaps we would on a regular basis spend $60 million to $70 million on restructuring and we are going to spend a little bit more than that, but we are just going to treat it as regular operations and not get into the details on expected savings.","Craig Arnold","And the way to think about as we said at this point in the cycle, we would typically perhaps deliver a 25% incremental and one of the reasons why we are delivering a 40% incremental is because those restructuring benefits are flowing through. So, our way of thinking about calibrating the benefits that we are seeing in company.","Mig Dobre","Yes. I am trying to understand when I look at your first quarter guidance talking about 40 basis points on margin expansion versus the full year. I am trying to figure out how the costs and the savings and whatnot are coming through to net debt?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I mean, certainly, we always \u2013 I mean, if you think about the restructuring in general it\u2019s always more front-end loaded than it is back-end loaded. So, I think you are probably seeing some of the impact associated with just timing of spending and benefits throughout the year.","Mig Dobre","Okay. Then last question for me back to ESS margins, so if I look at your revenue in this segment down something like $800 million over the last 3 years, things were difficult. I guess when you look at that 13% to 16% target range that you put out there for margin, I am wondering at what revenue level do you think it\u2019s appropriate for us to be thinking that you can reach the high-end of that range?","Rick Fearon","We will address that in a little more detail at our New York conference. We have not modeled that exactly at this point, but clearly you are going to need a step up in revenues from what we expect this year given how far revenues have fallen in that business.","Mig Dobre","Alright, thanks.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning.","Craig Arnold","Hi.","Ann Duignan","Hi, just on vehicle, your outlook for organic growth of 1%. I had always assumed that on the transmission side for our heavy duty north market trucks that you were still going to be kind of contract manufacturing and therefore your volume in trucks should be similar to the industry volume growth. Am I missing something?","Craig Arnold","It\u2019s in the way to think about the impact of the joint venture and then how it impacts the vehicle businesses. First of all, there is a year-over-year deduct right because the joint venture was formed at the middle part of last year. And so you have to take out the revenues that we enjoyed in 2017 out of 2018 as those revenues will now be reported and started a joint venture and Cummins will consolidate. And the other thing I would think about is that a lot of the growth that we are seeing in our markets in 2018 is coming out of North America Class 8 truck and that growth once again will show up not in Eaton\u2019s revenue, it will show up in joint ventures revenue where we don\u2019t consolidate. And so we do participate slightly because we are selling components into the joint venture, but the denominator, the base of that is quite small. And so that\u2019s why you probably see a number that\u2019s perhaps more muted than you would have modeled for the vehicle segment.","Ann Duignan","Okay. So, I guess when I was liking at organic revenue growth guidance, I was thinking that you had with apples-to-apples, but I should take into consideration?","Craig Arnold","You really have to deduct the JV revenues and then you have to factor in how much of the growth is going to show up in the joint venture not in our vehicle business.","Ann Duignan","Yes, okay. I got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just a quick kind of more philosophical question, do you need to be in the lighting business long-term, I mean is there strategic reason why you would need to be in that business?","Craig Arnold","The way we think about lighting is no different in the way we think about the rest of the portfolio. We have set very specific goals with respect to every one of these businesses have to be good businesses in their own right. They have to stand on their own two feet. And so lighting is no different than the way we view hydraulics or vehicle or anything else. And we constantly look at these businesses and say is it a good business in it\u2019s own way, will it add to our growth, can it deliver the margin targets that we anticipate and so every one of our businesses go through that screen. Are there some synergies associated with going through similar distributors, sure there are some. But even having said that, every business has to stand on its own two feet and that\u2019s the way we view lighting and it\u2019s very much consistent with the way we view every piece of the portfolio.","Ann Duignan","Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Don Bullock","At this point, we want to wrap up the call. I know there are a number of other callers today. We want to be respectful of those we have got to move on to other calls. So, we are going to wrap up the call today here at 11.00. I do want to as always we are available for follow-up questions. Thank you very much for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Eaton First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode, later there will be an opportunity for questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead.","Don Bullock","Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for this morning's first quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are Sandy Cutler, our Chairman and CEO; Craig Arnold, President and Chief Operating Officer and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","The agenda this morning is going include opening remarks by Sandy, highlighting the performance in the first quarter along with the remainder outlook for the remainder of 2016. As we've done in our prior calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Sandy's comments.","The press release and the earnings announcement and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation do include some reconciliations to non-GAAP measures and a webcast of this call is accessible on the website and will be available for replay, later in today.","Before I get started, I want to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to future results of the Company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Any of the areas of uncertainty around those will be outlined in our 8-K.","And with that, I'll turn the comments over to Sandy.","Sandy Cutler","Great, thanks Donny. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll be working again from the presentation that was posted earlier this morning and why don't we turn to Page 3, it's entitled Highlights of Q1 Results. I think as you saw from our earnings release. Our quarter was slightly ahead of original expectations coming in the upper half of our range.","It positions us very much on plan for our full year guidance and really not much has changed in terms of our view of either how markets will progress this year. We're seeing the economy, nor how we see our prospects for this year. You saw the operating earnings per share were $0.88. Our sales of $4.8 million were down 8% from a year ago organic revenue was down 6%.","You may recall it, as compared to the fourth quarter. We had said that we had expected our first quarter sales to be down about 5%. We actually came in a little bit better than that. And then the Forex impact down 2%. Really strong segment margins, exactly in line with what we'd outlined in terms of our guidance and when you exclude the restructuring cost that are part of our three-year restructuring program margins were actually 15.1%, that are really quite strong for our business mix in the first quarter.","Very pleased with our cash flow, the first quarter $371 million. We were able to purchase back $100 million. We recall our full year plan as a $700 million buyback and then we announced the dividend increase a 4% increase in February.","If we move on to Page 4 and just to comparison to our guidance, pretty simple. Higher revenue, than we expected primarily organic, a little bit FX for $0.02. And then we did spend a little bit less than we had anticipated. We had shared with you, that we were going to spend on the order of $70 million in the first quarter for restructuring expense that total came in closer to $63 million. So that contributed about a $0.01 was up.","I'll mention in just a couple minutes. We do expect to spend those dollars of later in the year and I'll come back and talk a little bit more about that. But overall, $0.88 great start for the year. Turning to Page 5, I think you saw most of these numbers in the press release. I would remind you, that our fourth quarter volume, fourth quarter 2015 was $5.057 billion and so as you can see, came off just a little bit less than the 5%, we had guided to.","Our organic growth in the fourth quarter was 4%. Here in the first quarter, it was a negative 6%. We anticipate this is the worst quarter in terms of the year-over-year. You know that our full year guidance is a negative 2% to a negative 4%. Clearly, the comparisons in the second half get quite a bit easier than they are here in the first part of the year.","If we could flip to the individual segments. Now and we'll start with the Electrical Products segment, you'll find that on Page 6 of the packet. Clearly, a very good quarter. A number of you commented on that already, this morning that we're very pleased with the 16.1% operating margin, 17.1% without restructuring cost. If you look at our organic sales growth, it was zero or flat, this quarter. It was a negative 1% last quarter.","And we're encouraged that our bookings in the first quarter were 2%. You may recall, that in the fourth quarter of last year they were negative 1% and they were flat in the third quarter of last year. So a little bit of an acceleration. And as you look around the world and I'm sure you're all interested in terms of trying to understand sort of the tenor of the business and where the strength or weaknesses around the world.","The US continues to be stronger than that average of 2%. We're very pleased, what we saw or may have begun to tick up a little bit and I think that's in line with what you saw in some of releases last night, early this morning about more economic strength in the European region. The weakness continues to be in Asia. Where we've seen double-digit downs in Asia and I think, not only us, but you've heard from other companies\u2019 conditions in Asia continue to be quite weak.","Among the individual products, we had talked to you that generally the theme that we've been seeing over the last nine months. There's been weakness in industrial markets, more strength in residential and non-residential construction. We actually had a very good quarter in our single phase of power quality in our comment, when we get to systems and services. We also did in our three phase in that area.","If we flip to the next chart please, which is Chart 7, Electrical Systems and Services segment, the volume of $1.342 billion down about 10% from the fourth quarter. You remember the fourth quarter was $1.494 billion and I think as we told you, a good way to think about this segment in terms of shipment in prospective shipment volumes is to look at bookings.","And so bookings were down 2%, this quarter. You recall in the fourth quarter, they were also down 2%. In the third quarter, they were down 3%. So we continue to see weakness here and a number of traces to some of the macros that we've all discussed. Our Crouse-Hinds business it has a significant oil and gas exposure is in this segment.","Some of the large industrial projects that we would tend to work on are in this area. We continue to see those weak as well. And so that as we continue to look to the year, I'll talk to you a little bit about segment margins. We started off a little lower then we'd anticipated. With might, that's why we revised our margins for the year. I'll comment more on that, as we get to the next couple charts.","Within the regional area again, the US and EMEA being stronger areas, our weaker areas being Asia Pacific at this point. So our common theme and you'll hear that in number of our businesses.","Moving to next chart, Chart number 8 or Page 8, our Hydraulics segment. Sales of $551 million. Virtually flat with what we saw in the fourth quarter. You remembered it was $552 million at that point. You'll see the operating margin is 7.4% and when you exclude the restructuring 10.3%, obviously we're doing a lot of work in this segment has we had shared with you and as Craig and his team had outlined at our February, New York Analyst Meeting.","The organic sales down to 14%. We recall they were down 12% in the fourth quarter. Bookings down some 10% and here we saw weakness in the US, as well as in Asia Pacific. I don't think the story is much different here in terms of our seeing weakness both on the distributor and on the OEM side. And we've seen weakness both on the stationary and the mobile side.","So to the question, we bottomed in our hydraulic end markets. We don't have the visibility to see that it has bottomed at this point. We're comfortable and we shared with you some revised views of market growth in this area and so, our plan is very much the same to continue to restructure this business, during 2016 and not to count on a upturn in terms of volume.","Turning to Page number 9, our Aerospace segment. Volume is up just slightly from the fourth quarter down from a year ago, but really terrific, terrific results in terms of our operating margins 18% in the quarter, 18.9% without the restructuring. Very solid second quarter in a row, bookings up 6%.","Our aftermarket was down in this particular quarter. But we really believed that's much more of an issue having had a very large quarter of aftermarket booking in the first quarter 2015. So we don't think this is trend. We think it's really much of a comparable issue. Organic growth was down 3%. It was positive in the fourth quarter about 2%. So little lower growth but really strong margins and strong bookings.","If we turn to Page 10, our vehicles segment. Cleary, we're beginning to see some of the impact of our original forecast of the North American heavy duty truck market coming down to 250. We've actually now changed our full year forecast of coming down to 230,000 units. At first quarter, it was relatively strong but and we can talk more in the Q&A, as we've seen production schedules and orders progress into this year.","It's our sense that this market is going to be closer to 230 range than the 250 range, all this is already in our guidance. Strong margin performance, you see the organic sales down some 13%. We recall they were down 6% in the fourth quarter as we've begun to see this kind of roll over if you will in the heavy duty market.","If we move to the next page, Page 11. No change in terms of our view of total organic revenues for this year. Still we believe they'll come down 2% to 4%. Obviously, for the first quarter was down 6%. This does anticipate and we do believe, that we'll see much better comparisons as the year come on, so this center point of negative 3%.","As we looked at our first quarter experience and our update of looking at individual markets, you'll see two changes on this page from the guidance we provided you earlier this year. We've raised the guidance in terms of organic growth in electrical products, a great first quarter, residential markets stronger than we've had originally anticipated. Those being the two big contributors to our increasing our guidance for electrical products.","Then in the vehicle markets, really two changes there. That's a North American heavy duty market as I mentioned to you, would be down at about 230,000 units of production versus the 250,000, we had originally anticipated. So that's about 29% reduction the 230 over last year. And then Latin America continues to be weak and clearly we all are I think up-to-date with the tremendous problems in Brazil currently, and that's done nothing but weaker markets further and so, those really being the two changes within the vehicle market. Overall, sales 2% to 4%.","Quick update on our restructuring actions on Page 12. We recall again a three-year program. That is the work that's going on by teams all across the company, really well done. Keeping very much to our schedules, we did as I mentioned in my original comments this morning. We incurred bout $63 million of restructuring expense versus the guidance we had provided you of roughly $70 million.","We really have that, that expense of that $7 million will move out to the second half. We've got one project that's really moved from Q1 to Q3 but overall, we think that we will still be at about $140 million through restructuring cost. And as you look at the $42 million in the second half just to give you some sense for pacing, we think about 70% roughly of that is likely to be in the third quarter, with the remaining roughly 30% will be in the fourth quarter.","Importantly, our overall year-to-year incremental annual benefits of $185 million remained unchanged. Some of you may ask, how can you have a project move out and it doesn't change your overall, benefits. Remember that these incremental $185 million of savings included both carryover benefits from actions we had taken last year in 2015, as well as the new actions, we've taken in 2016.","It was in that overall mix, there are obviously our projects moving ahead and back and quite lot of activity overall, we're very comfortable with $185 million still being realized here in 2016.","On Page 13, its titled segment operating margins expectations. I mentioned to you, we made a couple changes here that relate to changes really what's going on in the market again. Our electrical products, as you can see we've moved our guidance up to 17.4% to 18.0% for margins after the very strong first quarter that we've had.","You recall it, it was 17.0% to 17.6%. In our electrical systems and services, we've moved down to 13.1% to 13.7%. It previously had been 13.7% to 14.3%. Really just a couple items driving that, a little bigger commercial mix, a little weaker industrial mix and continued pressure in the oil and gas markets.","No change in hydraulics, no change in aerospace. Then our vehicle business, we've moved it down to 16.2% to 16.8%, it was 16.7% to 17.3% and that's really the impact of the 230,000 units production for NAFTA heavy duty Class 8 versus our earlier forecast of 250,000 units.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, after what we think, that is a very solid and good start to the year in the first quarter, Page 14 its entitled EPS guidance. On second quarter, our guidance is the range to a $1 to $1.10 operating EPS and it's virtually the same as net income because we don't have acquisition restructuring expense.","Organic revenue sequentially moving up 5% from Q1, 2016 to Q2, 2016. As we've talked last couple of years, that is a pretty normal season for us, is that 5% step up from the first quarter to the second quarter. The first quarter is always our weakest quarter in terms of revenue. And then we would expect, this FX is turning out to be less than we had forecast earlier this year. That we expect, we'll get about a point bump up from Forex too, so likely revenue is up on the order is 6%.","Our segment margins, including all the restructuring expense and the restructuring benefits as well as incremental on the higher volume in the second quarter between 15% to 16%. And a tax rate that will be between 10% to 12%. Our guidance for the year remains unchanged and each of the comments underneath the guidance on this page, are the same that you saw from us in our first quarter guidance, so no change there as well.","If we move to Page 15, in 2016 outlook summary. Again, only changes that you find on this page, really no changes of this page. We just had some change, what I call the mix under a couple of these numbers. Once again, the operating EPS for this year is flat with a year ago and the net income per share is up some 2%.","So if you move to Page 16, a quick summary of our report today. Again, we think a really strong start to the year's solid first quarter. Record, first quarter cash flow and continuing to buy back shares as well as obviously have a dividend increase.","2016, as I mentioned earlier. We really don't see the year much differently than we did, when we laid out the guidance first year and laid out our operating plan and that's why we're continuing to work on our $400 million restructuring plan and the $3 billion share buyback plan because I think they're exactly what's needed during a period of this type of economic weakness.","We tuned two things within 2016, one is the modestly weaker NAFTA heavy duty production forecast and the second is that, we think Forex is now likely to be impact our revenues by negative $200 million versus the original negative $400 million. I'm sure, we'll have questions about why our EPS full year guidance hasn't changed and the very easy way to think about this is, roughly the reduction in Forex negative impact on sales and profit, basically offsets the lower market expectation now for the NAFTA heavy duty truck forecast.","Our restructuring program just full of good news here, continues to be very much as we thought, being able to realize the potential. Our teams are really creating great results around the world and our full year incremental benefits remain unchanged at $185 million and the cost remain unchanged at $140 million.","And as I said several times, already this morning, our capital allocation plan to buy back 700 million shares following the 682 million that we bought back last year remains unchanged. So with that, Don I'll turn things back to you.","Don Bullock","With that, I'll turn it to the operator, who will then provide instructions for our question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Don Bullock","Our first question this morning comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein.","Steve Winoker","I appreciate you moving that with lightning speed. And Sandy, I want to of course start by congratulating this might be your last earnings call, as CEO. Retiring and moving on. So fantastic, I think the stock is up like four times since you took over or more. So well done. I guess I'll just start also with tax and the treasury rules and regulations. Haven't really got a clear picture and how you're thinking about, how your tax rate may be impacted by this, the timing of intercompany loans etc. on a perspective go forward basis. If those proposed rules become final.","Sandy Cutler","Great, thanks. Steve. I'll ask Rick to pick that up, it's obviously something we've given a lot of consideration to.","Rick Fearon","Hi, Steve. We've obviously studied this at some gap and the conclusion we come to, we don't see any material financial impact to Eaton from the new regulations. We believe, our guidance for 2016 will not be impacted and in fact, the guidance I gave on the last call longer term, which is a tax rate between 10% and 15%, with the rate stepping up slowly from the 9% to 11% for this year.","We think it's still the appropriate guidance for later year. So in some, we don't see any material financial impact from the regulations. We do however see the need for additional administrative actions to meet the documentation requirement, for the new regulation for new debt that you put in place. I think as you know, the regulations only impact new debt, they don't impact debt already in place, but those administrative actions won't have any material financial impact on Eaton.","Steve Winoker","Okay, that's good to hear. Could you maybe dig into the electrical product improvement that you're seeing and I'm trying to get a sense also for what is and in this, probably goes some of the other segments? What sort of comp driven versus really fundamental demand changes. In this case, obviously LED penetration, large projects. Maybe just give us a stance for where the strength is business wise as opposed to just geography.","Rick Fearon","I'll be glad to, as I mentioned. The couple areas clearly the residential businesses have been doing very well for us and so that's both in terms of the load center circuit breakers, pull outs as well as wiring devices. Lighting continues to be quite strong, the single phase power quality which we report in our electrical products area, has been strong as well and it has helped. That, what we've seen over the last couple of years is we've seen strengthen these areas in the US, that haven't seen much strength in Europe in that regard.","Europe's had a far better quarter in that regard as well. So I would point to those as being the areas of real strength. The areas that have offset it, because you look at 2% and say that's not kind of growth we were seeing a couple years ago, then still the industrial markets. So that's both industrial MRO and industrial OEM continued to be the weak spots and so we see that on a number of our products, we sell directly into those markets.","Steve Winoker","Okay, all right. Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan.","Ann Duignan","Can we dig into the vehicle business a little bit Sandy or whomever wants to address it? That business, that Brazil piece is trucks and agriculture. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in the fundamental both of those businesses? Any either of them reaching trough [ph], any signs of life standard [ph] in either of those end markets, please.","Sandy Cutler","Yes, I think its signs of life is maybe the right way to describe. Obviously the political and economic situation is so difficult in the country right now and to say, that we've got better transparency than anybody else on what's going to happen there. When we overestimate our capabilities to have those insights, so we continue to see this year's that, a year that is actually declining in Brazil. In our view of Brazil at this point, where our vehicle markets is, as I mentioned upfront worse than it was starting the year. So no, we're not seeing a turn in Brazil.","Ann Duignan","Okay, thank you and then just a follow-up. Asia is a large place. When you talk about Asia across your different businesses is it all China or is there any other markets that are worth noting?","Sandy Cutler","I think, China is clearly one of the big players in that regard and you know, we have for several years, felt that the China economic data was maybe a little bit more bullish then we were actually seeing at the street level. That continues to be true but, we're not seeing our business in China growing at this point and in fact, we've seen it pull back slightly.","So and when you get into certain segments, you're seeing in our electrical business or example some of the utility activity in China has pulled back. And in our vehicle businesses, the markets on the light vehicle side has stayed relatively strong. They've been pretty choppy in the commercial vehicles, over the last couple of years. That's probably the biggest piece of, but I would say that Asia in general is not been stronger in this time period.","Craig, would you want to add anything to that?","Craig Arnold","No, I think you've covered. I mean, I think it's maybe a green shoot or two, in terms of what's going on in some of the hydraulic market. It's too early to really to call that we've hit bottom. But we certainly saw in the month of March and probably some of the other data that you follow as well that, perhaps some bottoming in some of the construction equipment markets in Q1, but once again probably too early to call if we've really reached bottom or not.","Sandy Cutler","Say the one area maybe [indiscernible] didn't mention Ann is, that the aerospace markets really outside the US and that does include Asia, it remains strong.","Ann Duignan","Right, thank you. That was pretty broad. So I'll leave it at there.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Just on the vehicle segments again. Obviously, you went through last year in hydraulics in each quarter you were cutting the sales and or the margin guidance as you went through the year. One quarter in for vehicles you've cut the sales and the margin guidance. So I guess, what issues do you think different for this year, when you're looking at vehicles, guidance and the assumptions behind it versus where you were on hydraulics one year ago.","Craig Arnold","Maybe I'll grab that one, Sandy, if you're okay, with that. But I say Julian the big change for us at vehicle this year really is centered largely on North America class 8 truck. The other market buy in large are performing as we anticipated. The light vehicle market in China is doing fine. Europe's in light vehicle is doing well. As you probably saw on some of the data, we're not a big player, but the truck market in Europe is doing well.","Yes, we had some perhaps a little bit of another leg down in South America, but at this point the denominator is so small that it really doesn't matter a lot. And so really it's a function of the North America class 8 market, and coming into the year. We had a 250 number out there for the market, which was quite frankly one of the weaker numbers of anybody forecasting the market and coming into the earlier part of this year.","It appears that we have about 20,000 units of inventory overhang, that's fundamentally affecting the North America class 8. If you take a look at 80 [ph] truck tonnage, where some of the key markets that are the indictors for those markets for longer term. Those markets are doing okay and so we're really, we're going to a bit of inventory correction right now, in North America class 8 and that's principally reading, we reduced our forecast.","And that's 230, we think once again, we have one of the more conservative numbers out there. So at this juncture, we think we're well positioned in terms of the year and so we don't think, that there's going to be a case of every quarter another down to revision.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks, Craig and then just my follow-up with the on the electrical businesses. Just wondered if you saw any change in demand trend as you went through the last few months in any of the major regions or verticals?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, we've seen nothing substantial, Julian. And I think, a more broadly a number of people I'm sure are curious about how do we see March difference than January, February and I'd say that, not significantly different than we would normally see it, first quarter. So we have not seen an acceleration in demand if you will, that has been unusual in the month of March.","And if go back to the comments that we made right at beginning of the call, is that. We see the year letting out very much as we did, number of you thought we were conservative in terms of our economic outlook for this year, but when we see US GDP coming up, the kind of numbers that did the other day.","We think it's more confirmation that, this is likely to be a slow growth the year on the industrial side and the real premium has to be placed upon getting cost out and then trying to buy back shares and that's very much, what our plan is built around.","Julian Mitchell","Very clear, thank you.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis","We've seen a bit of pop up in steel prices, copper things like that and I think at least in the US, your LIFO accounting, I think. Memory serves me right. But, are we at the point of cycle where you can go out and get price even potential a little bit more than just a pass through. Are we still just trying to get a pass through here and can you, probably get a pass through I guess particularly when you think about things like vehicle or hydraulics.","Sandy Cutler","It maybe, these things have issues of timing and there is usually some sort of lag. I think, when I'll ask Craig to comment as well. We're more a view at this point, that we're getting slight positive in terms of margins as we mentioned our guidance this year from the tailwind. Yes, some things have picked up but I think you have to see pick up a little longer in this before you'd really see price traction from commodities.","I don't know, Craig. How do you feel?","Craig Arnold","And I absolutely agree with that. Despite the fact that we have seen a little bit of pick up you know over the last 30 days from a standpoint of planning assumption. We're still within in many cases below our original assumptions for the year around where commodities are going to go. So at this point, I think it'll be clearly premature to think about, we're moving into an inflationary piece of the cycle. Only balance that we've set in the past, we think our net between material cost coming down in price are about a net neutral for the company and we continue to believe that's where we're positioned.","Scott Davis","Got it, fair enough. And, I don't think you guys mentioned M&A in your prepared remarks. At least, I didn't hear and no one's asked about it yet. But are there, transactions out there that you guys could perceive getting done by the end of the year?","Craig Arnold","Yes, I'd say on the M&A front, what we said is that from a priority standpoint today. You know we're really focused on first and foremost, you know investing in our businesses to drive organic growth. We think we have plenty of opportunities to do that. Secondly, we said we're really focused on making sure that we maintain a strong dividend and then we also said, that share buyback in this environment where our stock is trading at below the valuation that we think is fair, is the priority.","And so at this juncture, we continue to be focused on those priorities. We've committed to buy back $700 million worth of stock this year. And quite frankly, given our priorities right now we don't think there's going to be a lot of latitude from balance sheet standpoint to do much in the M&A front. There's always things that we're looking at on the margin and we'll continue to look, but today that's not the priority.","Scott Davis","I'll pass it on to Sandy, congrats in your retirement and it's been a pleasure. So I'll pass it on.","Sandy Cutler","Thanks, Scott.","Don Bullock","The next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities.","Operator","Your line is open, sir.","Eli Lustgarten","I'm sorry, can you hear me?","Don Bullock","Yes.","Eli Lustgarten","My best wishes to Sandy, upon retirement and I just hope you need to survive this summer.","Sandy Cutler","Thank you.","Eli Lustgarten","Other things also. We just started talking about, we're hearing a lot of price competition coming in a lot of markets in a break [ph]. Can you give us some idea, I mean, there's a lot of mentality among competitors that nobody wants to lose a deal, and pricing particularly outside this country is getting very, very competitive in what we're hearing. Can you give us some idea? I know you just talk about these, but you're still kind of neutral, but are we seeing any real changes in pricing competition around the markets.","Sandy Cutler","I think if you see, if you look at our margins in the first quarter. That's maybe the best way to give you some sense, I'd say not that we haven't anticipated and with the benefit of all the work we're doing on restructuring. I think you're seeing our decrementals be extraordinarily low. And so, there's no question when commodities come down. You're going to see some impact. We talked about that in our last calls, but I don't think it's anything that we haven't really anticipated at this point.","Craig Arnold","I agree completely, Sandy. And certainly in the negotiated project piece of the business there's always on the margins of some places where you're being more or less competitive and there's some regional differences, but on balance and across the company nothing that would not be consistent with the guidance that we provided, no indications that anything is changed.","Eli Lustgarten","Okay, not much going on. And one of the things we're hearing a follow-up from lot of companies is, [indiscernible] are getting better but a decelerating decline across market and is that what you're seeing of course, anything. There's no expectation for things getting better very quickly it's part of the guidance. But are you seeing things stabilizing and even in the oil and gas sector. The question is, when do we anniversary the big declines that things begin to be more stable across the company.","Sandy Cutler","I think the best, Eli to think about our volume forecast for this year is, while you've seen an organic decline for us in the first quarter 6% and then I mentioned to you, if you looked at our guidance for the second quarter and if you were to calculate it versus a year ago because I gave it you versus the first quarter and it will be less in the 6%. The comps for the second half get a lot easier and that's how we get to this down 2% to 4%.","Now that's kind of quarter-to-quarter look, but I don't think we're saying that we're seeing markets begin to accelerate at this point. So we think we're kind of cruising down towards the bottom, if you will at this point. And we don't see a significant market growth at this point and so that's the kind of tough scenario we find ourselves in this low growth global environment and that's why again we put the premium on taking this time to do the restructuring and do the share buybacks.","Eli Lustgarten","All right. Thank you very much.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Just wanted to holding on electrical. And firstly just on the system side. The down 2% to 3% order trends, I guess over the last two or three quarters. What should we expect revenue growth to recouple to that kind of cadence and then second part of that question would be on the Canadian Dollar. We've seen a pretty sharp strengthening of the Canadian Dollar. And I remember last year, you had some struggles with margin deleverage due to that weakening.","So I'm just wondering the reversal of that trend, does that help you on the margin front.","Sandy Cutler","Yes, first on the volume level and kind of the looking ahead. I do think as we mentioned Nigel, you correctly referenced it as at, looking at our bookings is a pretty good way to think about what's coming out ahead of in terms of these, the electrical systems and services segment. There is a portion of that business that does come in during the quarter and go out and that's the piece, it's a little higher for us to forecast.","And in some cases, that is MRO for the oil and gas area. So that's an area it's a little harder for us to look ahead. I think and we entered this year, thinking oil and gas will be down on the basis of 15%. It's every bit of that, whether it turns out to be more than that, I guess we'll know come year end, but even though we've seen oil move up to the mid-40s. That segment is just not investing right now and there's still very much in a cutting back mode at this point.","It's going to take some time before we see that start to come back from the other direction. I say the other issue for us to keep an eye on here as whether we start to see confidence in and around reinvestment in industrial projects and we're really not seeing that to-date and we think that's likely to take more time as well.","You're right that the pricing is a Canadian Dollar versus the US because most of our production is in the US that we serve Canada with. It did hurt us last year. If it stays on a sustained basis and that's the key here, that will start to help us from a margin perspective.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that's great and then just quickly. You gave us some good color on the end markets within electrical. You didn't talk about utility, which is about I think about 10% will serve your electrical sales, a bit more within systems. But it seems like distribution spending is coming back a little bit.","I think first of all, have you seen that and how much of that's weather, what is your view going forward on distribution spending in the US?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, we did see a little better quarter on bookings. So it comes in obviously bookings first on the distribution side. So you're correct. Have frankly seen that from a couple of our peers as well. There are some other issues going on within, what we call our Power Systems business currently in, you may recall there were regulations that were put in place about transformer last year. It caused sort of pop-up in bookings on the fourth quarter, a little bit of an overhang in the first quarter. We expect to see that stabilize as we go through the year. So, our original guidance of 0% to 2% for utilities, we did better than that in the first quarter.","Nigel Coe","Great. Thank you very much.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just maybe to go back to some of the earlier questions on the complexion of business. Sandy, you touched on not a lot of appetite in the market place for project business. Are you seeing more stability though on the MRO and piece parts side, how would you characterize kind of the price or mixed dynamics between those as well?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, I'd start and let me ask, Craig to comment on this too. But, I'll start with a couple of high level issues. Construction is better than industrial activity. So industrial activities around the user or the OEM side is weaker. And then when you get in fact, construction, construction is better on commercial than it is industrial and it's strong on residential. And when you get inside commercial, it's better in light commercial than it is in heavy commercial and that has been pretty much our experience through the much of last year, as well as we're seeing now.","So we're not seeing strengthening on the industrial side and either the MRO or the user side. I think, you've seen that parallel on a number of our peers, who reported quite recently and their big weakness is been on the industrial side, both user and OEM and it's been on the large industrial project side, whereas strength has been moreover in the construction side, particularly light construction in residential.","Josh Pokrzywinski","And would you characterize the light construction and I guess residential not as much as the business, but is that light construction profit mix favorable or because there ends up being more lighting in there and maybe a lower engineering content that it does hold down the margins and some of the strengths we're seeing is, really unrelated to that.","Sandy Cutler","Again, I would say a lot of this industrial MRO and user it tends to flow into products and you typically in the industry you see products as a higher margin in systems and services. So it does play a little bit that way.","Josh Pokrzywinski","All right, great. Thanks a lot guys.","Craig Arnold","And that is more of a reason in terms of the margin guidance that we provided in electrical systems and services. Basically those margins and got it, really is that issue that the industrial sides of business, the MRO side of the business that tend to be a little bit more profitable and we're seeing relative weakness there and strength on the commercial side.","Josh Pokrzywinski","All right. Great. I'll pass it along and Sandy, congratulations.","Sandy Cutler","Thank you.","Don Bullock","Next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeff Hammond","Just back on the conversion changes, maybe two questions there. One, how do you think differently or not differently about tax re-spins and wanted or not wanted to do that, out beyond December 17. And then as you look at deals perceptively, how should we think about the ability? How do we look differently or the same at tax synergies within that?","Rick Fearon","Yes, let me jump on that, Jeff. And I'll deal with your second question first. The new debt regulations as I said a bit earlier. Mainly impact us in having to have a more comprehensive documentation around newly issued intercompany debt and it doesn't seem likely that those requirements would significantly impact any financings, we would undertake as part of new acquisition.","So we don't see much impact on future acquisition. In terms of, impact on spins those regulations haven't changed. It's a five-year some, five-year period from the time, that you undertake a transaction like the Cooper transaction. So as we get to the end of next year. We will be able to undertaken spin tax-free. Again there may be some more documentation for some of the financing around that, but we don't believe that the fundamental transaction will be impacted.","Jeff Hammond","Okay, great. And then, Sandy or Craig, can you give us the quarterly cadence NAFTA truck production, how you're thinking about that?","Sandy Cutler","That was 64 in the first quarter and where our thoughts, it's going to be approximately 60 in the second quarter and then approximately 54 in the third quarter and then 52 in the fourth quarter.","Jeff Hammond","Okay, thanks guys.","Rick Fearon","And all that's obviously in our guidance.","Craig Arnold","Best guess recognizing, there could be a little bit of in precision [indiscernible].","Rick Fearon","Absolutely.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray","And Sandy, you may have answered part of this question, in your response to Josh's question. But, it was interesting one of your big electrical products, should be there as yesterday talked about little more cautiously on non-res calling at flattish. But maybe, I don't believe they have as much exposure on the light commercial and residential. But just, how would you reconcile those comments among your distributors?","Sandy Cutler","Obviously, we have many, many distributors across the country in Canada and most of the, my comments really to it NAFTA region is that, again for people who are participating in the really, really big projects on either the commercial side or the industrial side, it is not as strong. And so that it's really a quite a mix issues in terms of where you're exposed and again, it's the lighter commercial activity that's the stronger side of commercial and everyone's individual exposure will be little different depending upon which market and how they're rate in terms of services.","We continue to see non-res as a pretty good year. We've talked about this kind of 3% to 5% growth here. So we're not talking about 10% year, but a good solid year. As we look at our negotiations and we talk about this, Deane over many years. Because of our very large sales force. We get a pretty good look at the projects that are out ahead of us as well and that's 10%, feels pretty good at this point.","Deane Dray","Great, and then just second question. You called out the decremental this quarter and when we look at those, they really jump out as a positive in terms in tough markets in declining revenues, if you can manage somewhere in and around, a 25% decremental and you handedly did that. So with their actions, that you had to take within the quarter to manage to that, those numbers or was that prior restructuring.","Sandy Cutler","Its' both. I mean, but thanks for asking the question. Because I think it is important for us all to remember that out of that $185 million of incremental savings year-to-year. A bunch of that is from actions we took last year. Remember we pivoted at the end of the first quarter and Craig and the whole team has really put in place the very aggressive set of restructuring. We obviously got benefits from that in the fourth quarter, we got benefits from that in the first quarter and obviously, will through this year.","So in addition to that, now we've also kicked off this whole set of additional actions here in 2016. So we would not be able to have those light decrementals unless we have been working on this for some time at this point.","Deane Dray","Great, thank you.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Just wondering, if we could just go back one more time to tax. In particular, just thinking about the potential for spin off dynamic size. I appreciate that the five-year period may have not changed. But, I was also under the impression that perhaps there was just the high level of complexity, if you wanted to go down that path and I'm wondering is that complexity and kind of the disentangling of structures that you have in place currently, particularly in light of the treasury regulations would make us spin, especially difficult if not on economic.","Rick Fearon","Yes, let me answer that. These new regulations really don't fundamentally affect a spin and disentangling any subsidiary to spin, is always a complicated exercise because sometimes the assets are not owned in a separate legal entity. Sometimes you need to sell a legal entity to another entity in order to create one vehicle that you could spin if you look at other companies that have gone through spins.","It usually takes a period of month sometimes, even as much as a year to disentangle all that. but it's really is a function of just getting all the assets in businesses into a single legal entity and these new debt regulations won't have any significant impact on what you need to do.","Craig Arnold","And maybe before we go too far down the path around kind of this magical line of demarcation that happens at the end of 2017. So we don't read too much in that, as we said in New York. We have a game plan for all of our businesses. And we have a game plan that we like. We laid out plan around, how we get these business to deliver significant market margin through the economic cycle, was due certainly participating in certain businesses that are most cyclical than other. But we're not sitting around waiting for 2017 to make some magical decision around what we do with our businesses. We have a game plan that we like and we think, each of these businesses will continue to contribute positively to the company as you've seen this year and then prior years.","We know how to manage cyclical businesses and we know how to deliver growing margins despite the fact that, our markets are performing poorly right now. And so as we think about the company overall, we have to plan to run these businesses and I don't want to any much sitting around thinking that come the end of 2017 that we're going to announce some big transaction. We have a plan that we like, there's certainly risk in some of our markets as you saw in the vehicle discussion just recently. Clearly, we in some of markets being a little weaker than what we anticipated but we're not done with restructuring in the event that markets are a little weaker. We have lots of programs and plans lined up, to do more restructuring if we need to.","So, we're very confident that we can deliver the margin targets that we laid out for each of our businesses independent of what happens with some of these end markets.","Jeff Sprague","Thanks, Craig that's very helpful. Would it be also fair to say that, no plan so set in stone, that if there is significant economic value to be unlocked by doing something else, you would be open to doing that?","Craig Arnold","Absolutely. It goes without question. We've done it many times in the history of the company as we shared with you in New York, in the event that we feel like these businesses no longer meet the expectation that we set out for everyone one them. Now we've demonstrated historically that we're willing to pivot and we're willing to divest it and so that's, it's still acquisition.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Could I just have a little more color on lighting? I think Sandy just characterized it as strong, which I'm sure it is, but can you give us a little bit of color on how quickly it's growing, whether the LED penetration is, a couple metrics around the business.","Sandy Cutler","Sure, maybe two that might be helpful to you, Jeff. Is that our LED business is not over 60% of our total lighting business and so, we really think see it continuing to leading that respect. That LED business grew it over 30% in the quarter and so it continues to be a very fast growing and exciting area.","And part of the advantage and you've seen a lot of reports come out after light there is that, every one of our competitors has its own unique strengths and weakness. We again are the only company that's really able to combine all the advantages of independent lighting with the full power control and distribution system in the building and that's really where we think, we build very unique value for our customers.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you very much.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore.","David Raso","Two question on cash flow. I thought the cash flow in the first quarter was pretty strong. Definitely one of your strongest first quarters on record, I think you said. The cash flow to the full year. I'm surprised it was an increase. I think from the analyst meeting one of the more interesting statements was, how much stronger you expect the cash flow to be, this five-year period versus the prior.","What was going out with the lack of cash flow increase?","Sandy Cutler","I would David, really and I would say this about a number of elements out of the first quarter. It's still early. We're - end of the first quarter and that we really, what we're seeing the danger in the kind of slow economic times is, just assuming that everything continuously get better. I think by the time you get to the end of the second quarter or middle of the year it's probably more appropriate time to look at this.","David Raso","Okay, so it's fair to say that cash flow year-to-date is ahead of plan?","Sandy Cutler","We had said that remember, a full year is that we would have a cash efficiency ratio of one or better and that's still very much our plan.","David Raso","Okay, one last just housekeeping. Maybe I missed it. The net savings or if you want, even lay out the cadence of the $185 million of savings over the four quarters. How did it play on the first quarter and the rest of the year?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, we'll give you a full accounting on this by quarter, when we get to the end of the year. But I think the best way to think about this is, approximately 45% of that savings is in the first half, approximately 55% to the second half. And you might say, how could you get that much in the first half, remember part of it is, the carryover for the full year benefit for actions that were initiated in 2015, that was our plan coming into the year. It's built into our quarterly guidance and so again, hopefully that plus the kind of layout we gave you for the restructuring expenses on the charts that are in the presentation, give you a sense for help out the cost and the benefits lay out over the year.","David Raso","So the net actions in the first half are still slightly negative than the positive delta of second half?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, I think, yes. Correct.","David Raso","Okay, thank you very much.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","On hydraulics margins. Maybe just a little bit more color on how you feel the actions there taking hold and when do you think, you can get those to kind of the low teens expectation extra structuring when does, when sort of the demarcation line for them to be required to get there.","Sandy Cutler","Yes, its' a great question and it's a as you appropriately pointed out. So much of restructuring, we're doing across the company today and going back into 2015 is absolutely focused on the hydraulics bit. And today we have margins that are running as you see, in the 10% to 11% when you look at both Q1 and Q4 less restructuring and we're, I'd say order of magnitude about half way through the restructuring opportunities that we're working through. So we really think, by time we get to the end of this year, for early next year that we ought to be having a business at this level of economic activity, not banking on any significant recovery markets that is running the low-teen rates.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay, great, that's really helpful and then. Rick sorry to beat the tax thing to death here, but you know a lot about this. [indiscernible] more, is the fact that there is not an impact and you're still, your 10 to 15 is still hold, is that because potentially differing treatment within equity and things like that, doesn't have an impact or is it because you've already incorporated some tax-free into your range in the first place, when you say 10 to 15.","Rick Fearon","Well we had very carefully put together our financing plan for Cooper and really all the financings we've done over the years. And we've been very careful to be compliant with all the different IRS, Safe Harbor's and IRS Regulations and so, these new debt regulations don't really impact if you follow carefully those prior rules and so that's why, it doesn't have much impact on us.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Andrew Owen with Bank of America.","Andrew Owen","Sandy, congratulations for great work over your tenure.","Sandy Cutler","Thank you.","Andrew Owen","Just question on aerospace aftermarket. Bookings were down on the first quarter, is it tough comp or what's driving it and any risk to aerospace margin in the second half of 2016 from lower aftermarket?","Sandy Cutler","Really a tough comp on the aerospace aftermarket. We had a really exceptional first quarter last year, with a number of our large aerospace distributor. So we're not concerned that this is a bigger trend.","Rick Fearon","And in fact, we take a look at what happened with revenue passenger miles and generally ii in Q1. It feels like the consumer is very much in the economy jumping on planes and those numbers were up solidly and perhaps little strong than we originally anticipated starting the year so. It's an encouraging sign, that consumers continue get on planes and ultimately that's good thing for aftermarket.","Andrew Owen","And just a follow-up question on China particularly on the electrical side. You know because the way I think about the cycle by the time, machine manufacturers will places orders for your equipment, by the time you ship it, things are probably have been turning for a while, what are the leading indicators that you guys use internally to gauge the state of the Chinese market particularly on the electrical side?","Sandy Cutler","So I'd say that, maybe there a couple there, there's a large project business obviously that goes on, it has a lot to do with utility and infrastructure, there you get some look and awful lot of our business in China though is daily flow business and whether that's on a power quality or whether it's in the power distribution side, that's a lot harder to gauge because it has a lot to do with how inventories are distribution and whether the OEM or the construction side of the market is moving very quickly.","So we don't get a lot of lead time in China. We probably get a better view here in the US than we do in China in terms of future view.","Andrew Owen","Thank you very much.","Don Bullock","With that, we going to have time for one more question this morning and I'll ask, Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andy Casey","Good luck to you, Sandy.","Sandy Cutler","Thanks very much, Andy.","Andy Casey","Question on the ESS, you talked about weak industrial markets in the current period, but I'm wondering, if what you mentioned in the past conference calls about some of the large industrial projects maybe starting to come on during the second half. I'm wondering if that's still the case or have they just been pushed out again?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, I would say outside of projects that we're committed that contracts behind when there were some of those natural gas in that, in that area and they may not like their contract so much today. I'd say, we aren't seeing the big projects come on for the second half.","Andy Casey","Okay, thanks and then lastly, in vehicle. I just wanted to ask question about the automotive side specifically in North America. There is been some concern about current dealer inventory levels and I'm wondering, if you're starting to hear any commentary about potential changes in production schedules for some of your customers in the second half?","Craig Arnold","Yes at this point, we think, we've really have not heard anything that would suggest that there's any concern in terms of our view. We still think, 17.3 million units is a good forecast for the North America auto market. Incentives have certainly creaked up a little bit. We track the number of dollars of incentives for vehicle that are being offered to encourage consumers to come and by and that maybe a little indication of some concerns.","But by in large, at this point and we think our forecast is still valid and there is no real indication that the market won't grow - relatively modestly this year, but off of a high base.","Andy Casey","Okay, thanks Craig and once again, Sandy. Thanks for all your help over the years.","Sandy Cutler","Thanks, Andy.","Don Bullock","And maybe a way of concluding today's call. This is I think, if I counted correctly it's my 59th earnings call with Eaton. And all of us here in the management team really appreciate your support. Your questions and your helping us sort of think through many of really key issue in and around running a business successfully. I've got enormous confidence in Craig and this team and I hope you're beginning to share that confidence at this point. A lot of experience here on this team and Eaton's best days are ahead of us.","So we hope we'll continue to earn your support. Thanks very much. I've enjoyed working with all of you. Don?","Don Bullock","With that, as always, we will be available for follow-up questions for the remainder day and all of next week. Thank you very much for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and using the AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",""],"8088":["Eaton Corporation (NYSE:ETN) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 29, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Yan Jin - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Richard Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Planning Officer","Conference Call Participants","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc","Dave Raso - Evercore","Scott Davis - Melius","John Walsh - Credit Suisse","Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Andrew Obin - Bank of America","Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Julian Mitchell - Barclays","Rob McCarthy - Stephens","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Eaton Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I will turn the call now over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Yan Jin. Please go ahead sir.","Yan Jin","Good morning. I am Yan Jin, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for the Eaton third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today including opening remarks by Craig highlighting the company\u2019s performance in the third quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we will be taking questions at the end of the Craig\u2019s comments. The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we will go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation, includes reconciliations to the non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and it will be available for replay.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments today including statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. They are also outlined in our related 8-K filing.","With that, I will turn it over to Craig.","Craig Arnold","Thanks, Yan. Appreciate it. And we will start on Page 3 with a highlight of our Q3 results. And overall, I would characterize this quarter\u2019s results as really strong earnings results and strong cash flow despite weaker end markets. Earnings per share as you saw in the press release were $1.44 on GAAP basis, a $1.52 excluding transaction costs and acquisition and divestiture in excess of our businesses, $1.52, our results were 6% above last year, excluding the 2018 arbitration decision and within our guidance range of $1.50 to $1.60. However, sales were certainly lower than what we expected, down 1% organically, negative currency impacting us by 1.5 points and acquisitions adding 0.5 point to our results.","We continue to deliver strong margin performance with another record and all-time earnings on margins. Segment operating margins of 18.7% for an all-time record for Eaton and this includes records for electrical products, for electrical systems and services, and for aerospace. These margins were also above the high-end of our guidance and 110 basis points above last year. We continue to generate very strong operating cash flows of $1.1 billion, up 8% over Q3 2018, an another quarterly record. Lastly with summarizing results where we purchased 539 million shares in the quarter bringing our year-to-date purchases to $949 million or 2.8% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.","Turning to Page 4, we show a summary of our Q3 performance versus prior year and I will just point out a few highlights here. First, we delivered $41 million of increase in segment operating profits despite a 1% decline in organic revenue and this was really driven by strong execution, effective cost control and favorable mix in a couple of our businesses. Second, we incurred $0.08 per share of after-tax cost primarily related to the planned divestiture of our lighting business. And lastly, adjusted EPS increased 6% excluding the 2018 arbitration decision. These results I would say are consistent with our boarder message on how we intend to run the company doing periods of market weakness, with strong execution, proactive cost control and increasing our share repurchases.","On Page 5, we show our quarterly results for our Electrical Products segment. Overall revenues were flat made up of 1% organic growth offset by 1% negative currency. We saw revenue strength in both commercial and residential markets in North America partially offset by softness in industrial controls globally. Segment operating profits increased 6% and operating margins were up 110 basis points to 20.3%, which was an all-time record for the segment. We also announced the sale of our lighting business to signify for a price of $1.4 billion and we have seen a good outcome for our shareholders and another example of how we are actively managing the portfolio to create higher margin and higher growth set of businesses for Eaton. This was a decision that was also good for our employees who will now be part of a larger and more focused lighting company. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 and I would say for our core products business which now excludes the lighting, orders were up 1% led by strength in residential and commercial construction largely once again in the Americas.","Moving to Page 6, we summarize our results for our Electrical Systems and Services segment. Revenues increased 3%, 3% organic growth. We also had a 1.5% growth from the acquisitions of Ulusoy and Innovative Switchgear Solutions and a 1.5% of negative currency. Organic growth here was driven by strength in data centers, commercial construction and actually also in engineering services. Our ES&S business also produced all-time record margins of 18.3%, which were up 290 basis points from prior year, operating profits increasing some 23% on 3% organic growth. This business benefited from higher sales for sure, but also had very good operational execution in conversion. And on a rolling 12-month basis, ES&S orders were up 5% with growth really across I would say all regions here. And if you exclude hyperscale data centers, the 12-month rolling average of our orders was up 8% which was really in line with what we saw in Q2. So once again, a long cycle business very much performing at very high levels.","On the next page, we show our results for Hydraulics for Q3. Revenues were down 10% with an 8% decline in organic revenues and 2% negative currency. Organic revenue declines were driven primarily by weakness in global mobile equipment markets and in quite frankly de-stocking that we have seen both at the OEM level and also within distribution. Segment operating margins were 11.9%, down 290 basis from last year but I think on a sequential basis, margins were actually up 40 basis points despite seasonally lower Q3 revenues that came in about $100 million below Q2. And our order declined to 14% really as a result of continued weakness, as we mentioned in global mobile equipment markets around the world.","Turning to Page 8, we summarized our quarterly results for Aerospace segment. Once again, this business posted very strong results with record top line and bottom line performance. Revenues increased 7% with 8% organic growth and 1% negative currency. Orders on a rolling 12-month basis increased 13% with particular strength in the military market, specifically for fighters, for watercraft and also aftermarket. We also saw strength on the commercial side in business jets. We continue to demonstrate strong incremental margins with nearly 60% growth in margins on organic revenues which drove over 23% increase in operating profits and a 310 basis point improvement in our margins. And as you recall, we announced the acquisition of Souriau-Sunbank in July and we expect this transaction to close before the end of the year, so all things are good in aerospace.","On the next page, we summarize our Q3 results for the Vehicle segment. Our revenues were down 13% which includes a 12% decline in organic revenues and a negative 1% impact from currency. The organic sales decline was due to a combination of global weakness in light vehicle markets which we think were down approximately 4% in the quarter and primarily the impact of the transfer revenues into the Eaton Cummins joint venture. For 2019, the NAFTA Class 8 market remains solid. We expect production to be roughly 340,000 units this year and up 5% for 2018. We do however expect global light vehicle market to be down some 4% for the year. Despite lower organic revenues and volume, operating margins continue to run at very high level at 18.3%, margins were down only 60 basis points from last year. So our vehicle team once again did a nice job of flexing spending which allow them to deliver detrimental margins of approximately 25%.","Moving to Page 10, we show our eMobility results for Q3. Revenues were down 1% with flat organic revenues and negative 1% from currency. Flat organic revenues in this case of due primarily to a mix of platforms that we\u2019re on, I\u2019d ask you to keep in mind that in this business is really made up of a mix of the new electric and hybrid platforms plus the legacy electrical content that we have on internal combustion engines. Once again, we increased our R&D spending which was really the primary reason why operating margins declined 740 basis points to 5.1%, but we continue to pursue a large number of additional electric and hybrid programs here and we are very pleased with the progress that we are making to-date.","Next on Page 10, we summarized our outlook for 2019. We now expect organic revenue growth of approximately 1% and as you know this is down from our prior estimate of approximately 3% and this is really based upon reduced global growth, particularly in our short cycle businesses but also includes some slow growth in non-res construction as well, still growth but slower growth which has impacted our electrical business. Within electrical, we now expect full-year organic growth of approximately 2.5% for electrical products and 4.5% for electrical systems and services. Hydraulics global mobile equipment markets remain weak and this weakness is being amplified, but really de-stocking in both the OEM and distribution channel. As a result, we now expect organic revenues to decline by approximately 4.5%. Aerospace remained strong across the board and we\u2019re reaffirming the midpoint of our full year growth estimate of 9.5%. In Vehicle, global automotive markets remain weak so we\u2019re reducing our organic revenue estimates to be down approximately 10% for the year. And we\u2019ve also slightly modified our estimates for e-mobility as well which we think will be growth of 4% at the midpoint of 2019.","Overall, our long cycle businesses within ES&S and aerospace are expected to continue to deliver attractive organic growth rates for the year, while we project low single-digit growth for electrical products overall. Business conditions have clearly been impacted by trade, by the political environment and a number of one-off events that have weakened our second half outlook, maybe as a kind of confidence as we look to the future, we would say, what the fundamentals of the economy still solid, low interest rates. High employment, strong consumer confidence and we hope that is pulled back would be short-lived but we have to wait and see.","Moving to Page 12, we show our margin expectations for the year and I think based upon the strong Q3 margins we are increasing our consolidated segment operating profit margin guidance 20 basis points to a new range of 17.3% to 17.7% or 17.5% at the midpoint and this includes increasing margins for three of our six segments, Electrical Products up by 30 basis points, Electrical Systems and services up by 50 basis points and Aerospace up by 120 basis points. And due to expected volume declines we are lowering margins in two of our segments: hydraulics by 110 basis points and vehicle by 40 basis points. With this updated guidance, I would say that we are really on track to deliver another record year of margins with a strong 70 basis point increase at the midpoint over 2018 despite lower revenues can we anticipated.","And finally turning to Page 13, we show our guidance for Q4 in 2019. For Q4, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 to $1.46, other assumptions for Q4 in our guidance include, we think our organic revenues will decline by approximately 2%, we would expect segment margins of 17.2% to 17.6%, flat corporate expenses of two last year and an adjusted earnings tax rate of approximately 17% we are slightly lowering the midpoint of our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.72, $0.09 below the current consensus and due to lower market conditions. This does still represent a 6% increase over 2018 when you exclude the impact of the arbitration decisions. We are also increasing our operating cash flow guidance by an another $100 million as you recall that we increased it by $200 million so far through this point and we now expect to deliver $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion for the year, because I mentioned the second time that we will increase our operating cash flow guidance which highlight really the strong cash flow generation capability of our businesses. For 2019, our free cash flow to adjusted earnings conversion is expected to be over 120%, while free cash flow to sales is estimated to reach approximately 14%.","Other full year guidance assumptions include 1% organic growth, a $100 million of revenue from the acquisitions of Ulusoy and Innovative Switchgear Solutions, foreign exchange impact of a negative $350 million and this is actually $50 million worse than our prior guidance, segment margins in the range of 17.3% to 17.7%, up 20 basis points at the midpoint. No change in our tax rate, we think our CapEx spending this year will be roughly $550 million and this is about $50 million lower than prior guidance and we estimate for our share purchases to be increased to roughly $1 billion and this is up from our prior guidance of $800 million as we continue to deploy our strong free cash flow. So overall, we are very pleased with the company\u2019s performance this year. We are delivering very strong cash flow, solid EPS growth despite what turned out to be a much weaker economic environment for many of our end markets.","So I will stop with that and turn it back over to Yan for Q&A.","Yan Jin","Thanks, Craig. Before we begin the Q&A session for our call today, I do see we have a lot of individuals have interested in the queue with questions. Given the time constraint of one hour today and our desire to go to as many of the questions as possible, please limit your opportunity to just to one question and a follow-up. And I will thank you in the advance for your cooperation.","With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay. We will take the first question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning.","Craig Arnold","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Obviously lot of good detail on the call, you did a great job of adjusting to the trending conditions in 3Q showed us a very nice margin, you are assuming margin step down a bit more than normal seasonality in the 4Q. I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s driving that Craig I recon, is there any additional restructuring coming through in 4Q and where we stand on additional restructuring actions in lights of that weaker volumes?","Yan Jin","I appreciate the question, Nigel. I mean to your statement, absolutely, if you think about kind of the bridge between Q3 and Q2, we\u2019re really outstanding performance in Q3 there were number of items that were impacting us in Q3 and Q4 that are taking the margins down, one is a higher level of restructuring and you could imagine, it\u2019s largely in those businesses where we\u2019re seeing additional market weakness. We certainly are seeing a higher tax rate in Q4 than we had in Q3 if you saw the operational tax rate of roughly 17%. In addition to that there is a few normal factors, healthcare cost tend to run higher in Q4 than in prior quarters. And so this is a number of, one-time items that we are dealing with in Q4. Obviously, we dealing with the GM strike that a little bit of an impact as well in Q4 that take the margins down, but I\u2019d say that as you think about the outlook for 2020, I feel a lot of these are one-time items and I know that a number of the analysts wrote about extrapolating Q4 into next year, I guess I just ask you to keep in mind that there are a number of one-time and seasonal items that are impacting Q4 that you really would not be justified and extrapolating for the full year.","Nigel Coe","That\u2019s great color. We will dig into the details offline but I do want to switch to ESS margins and we probably 2 years ago thinking 15% and this business will be a dream and here at 18%. So I am just curious how confident we feel that you can defend this level of margin going forward and maybe just address what\u2019s changed to drive such a high margin?","Craig Arnold","Once again we agree, 18% is outstanding performance by our team in general. And as I mentioned in my commentary, it is a function of really strong execution by the organization on higher volumes that we saw in the quarter and we will clearly need to revisit the long-term margin guidance for our ES&S segment. If you recall, we talked about this segment performing at 13% to 16% through the cycle, we\u2019re already performing well above those numbers and so as we think about giving the outlook for the business and setting expectations, we do believe that this business will perform at higher levels on a go-forward basis.","Nigel Coe","Thanks, Craig.","Yan Jin","Okay, good. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeff Hammond","Good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Hammond","If you can just talk about kind of where we stand in the de-stocking for Hydraulics? And then just are you seeing any de-stocking in electrical and maybe just speak through where in the guide you are seeing softness within, I guess particularly EPG?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I think in terms of Hydraulics, as we talked about on our commentary, we have seen broad-based de-stocking significant, let\u2019s say, de-stocking at the OEM channel as productions continues to run well below retail sales and you see that in a lot of the public data in also in distribution we are seeing the same thing. I think the question becomes how long does this go on and that we could sit here and attempt to speculate when does the de-stocking and it\u2019s really going to be a function of what ultimately happens with the end-markets and it\u2019s indicated in the end-market demand. I will say that today we take a little confidence in the fact that the end market demand in many of these hydraulic markets around the world are certainly performing okay. We are talking about, let\u2019s say, on average low single-digit growth in a market like construction flat to slightly down in markets like ag, but what we are experiencing as a supplier is our numbers at a much worse than that. So we take some confidence in that that we are approaching the end, but I think ultimately it will really be a function of what\u2019s going to happen with these end markets in terms of de-stocking in hydraulics business. I would say in the electrical business more broadly, at this point we are not really seeing significant de-stocking in electrical and what kind of impacted our growth a little bit in electrical in the quarter was largely project delays given the kind of the uncertain political environment that we are living in right now. It\u2019s been really more of that issue than it\u2019s been an issue of de-stocking. And certainly if you think about our Electrical Products business much of which goes through distribution in periods of uncertainty, they are kind of being cautious around the inventory levels that they are putting on the shelf in general, but not at this point I would say a significant amount of de-stocking.","Jeff Hammond","Okay, great. And then Craig I think in past years you provide kind of initial views on out-year in third quarter and I didn\u2019t see anything in there? Anything you can give on kind of how you are thinking about the markets, incrementals and non-operating items and kind of uses of cash around the lighting sales? Thanks.","Craig Arnold","Yes, Jeff, your observation is absolutely accurate, Jeff. We would typically in this call give kind of some insight into 2020 given the level of uncertainty in the environment that we are currently dealing with whether it\u2019s trade or geopolitical or some of these one-off customer events. We thought it would be prudent at this juncture not to provide guidance for 2020 some of the Q4 play through and that we would then be providing guidance as a part of our earnings call in January. And so that\u2019s kind of the way we are thinking about that. The specific question around uses of cash, obviously we sold the lighting business \u2013 we will sell the lighting business for $1.4 billion and it would be our intention to use those proceeds to buyback shares. We are going to attempt to be smart and strategic in the timing of the buyback program, but the intention would be to use those proceeds plus our very strong cash flow generating capabilities to make sure that we fully offset any dilution associated with the divestiture of lighting.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. Thanks, Craig.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Raso with Evercore.","Dave Raso","Good morning. Apologize, I missed the very beginning of the call, but for the electrical businesses exiting 2019 into \u201820, the lighting business is still officially in the guide for fourth quarter for EP, correct, just to be clear?","Craig Arnold","Yes, yes.","Dave Raso","Okay. So, the orders were up 1% ex-lighting for ET and in ES&S orders. I\u2019d say overall we\u2019re probably a little better than people feared but can you help us understand, what you\u2019re seeing beyond the quarter in the sense of, what\u2019s in the back half, further visibility, short the normal, just trying to get a sense of Electrical start the year healthy because obviously people are wondering can we get the more cyclical businesses bottoming out at some point in the first half and hope they are all growing together in the end of the year?","Craig Arnold","I appreciate the question, Dave. The business that obviously we have the greatest visibility within our Electrical Systems and Services business and I will say that our order input in Q3 was quite strong across the board. Most of the end markets that we serve, I\u2019d say posted anywhere from mid to high single-digit order growth in the quarter which really bodes well I\u2019d say for the long cycle piece of our business with Electrical Systems and Services into 2020, I think it\u2019s too early to make a call on it and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we are not providing guidance, but certainly if we take a look at the order book and what happened during the course of Q3 in Electrical Systems and Services, we feel very good about the order intake and how the 2020 is shaping up and Electrical Products which tend to be much more of a book-and-bill business and as we mentioned, we did see a little bit of conservatism on the part of distribution, and in that business it just doesn\u2019t tend to be a longer cycle business and so we\u2019ll just have to see what happens with some of these other kind of world events and what level of distribution confidence we\u2019re taking in with us into 2020.","Dave Raso","And the ex-Lighting in the fourth quarter or I should say it another way is lighting down in the fourth quarter, so I assume that will be out of the business when we give the guide in January [indiscernible] core business?","Craig Arnold","What I\u2019d say is I appreciate the question, Dave, given the fact that we have entered into a transaction we signed, we prefer not to comment on lighting as it\u2019s going to ultimately be somebody else\u2019s business on a go-forward basis. And so as we think about lighting on a go-forward basis and we would prefer not to comment on that business given the transactions and the fact that ultimately somebody else is going to own it.","Dave Raso","I can appreciate that. Okay, thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning guys.","Yan Jin","Hi.","Scott Davis","Craig, just to kind of address the elephant in the room when you have quarters like this, where you missed your guidance on the top line which doesn\u2019t happen to this extreme very often, does it make you kind of rethink the portfolio a little bit? I mean you got Hydraulics and vehicle that will actually goes around every cycle and is it worth the headaches? I mean I\u2019ll just leave it at that.","Craig Arnold","I appreciate the question, Scott. And as we have talked on this call before we would like to I\u2019d say laid out our criteria for businesses that we like and the conditions under which we think we are going to stay in business and the conditions in which we\u2019re going to step out and I will say that if you take a look at our track record over time Eaton has done a lot of work around the portfolio and the lighting divestiture is the latest example of that. At the end of the day, you think about today hydraulics and the quarter delivered 7% of our company profit facility, at the end of the day whether Hydraulics grows 5% or shrinks 5%, it really doesn\u2019t have a significant impact on the ultimate earnings of our company. So we like to think that we\u2019re getting some of the execution issues behind us and it is a cyclical business, it will always be a cyclical business, but at the end of the day what really drives Eaton, as we said on the earnings call 80% of our earnings come from electrical systems and services electrical products in aerospace and that\u2019s really what drives the company. And we will continue to work on our internal plans to improve the execution of Hydraulics, they know what they need to do in order to continue to deliver and be a value creating part of the company. So I would say at this point we are comfortable with the portfolio and at the end of day will continue to focus on the things that we can control and side of the business, recognizing it these will always be cyclical businesses.","Scott Davis","Fair enough, Craig. And just as a follow-up, I mean I know you mentioned that you have got this billion dollars coming in and you are going to do more buybacks, but is this types of environment or you want to take another more aggressive look at M&A or is this the type of environment or it\u2019s so uncertain that it\u2019s better to push it to the right there?","Craig Arnold","We always look at the trade-off. We have been very disciplined over the years around in terms of understanding what our cost of capital is and we think it\u2019s roughly 8% to 9%, and we would expect the return order of magnitude to 200 to 300 basis points over, our cost of capital as a minimum. And so we have been very disciplined buyer through both at a low point in the economic cycle and we would continue to maintain that and that\u2019s the way we\u2019ll run the company. And so for us, it\u2019s always going to be a matter of trading off what an acquisition would do for the company in both strategically and in terms of EPS versus the option that we have of buying back shares at very attractive prices.","Scott Davis","Okay, good enough. Thanks. Good luck, guys.","Craig Arnold","Thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.","John Walsh","I wanted to go back to the Aerospace margins, obviously very strong. I know a couple of quarters ago, we had a conversation around OE versus aftermarket mix but similar to that ESS line of questioning, we are above kind of your through the cycle look on that business, how do you view the sustainability of those really strong Aerospace margins?","Craig Arnold","I appreciate the question and I\u2019d say as I\u2019ve said on prior calls, this is really been a little bit of a Goldilocks period for the Aerospace industry overall because you have really strong market demand, you have a very strong aftermarket and you have relatively by historical standards low program spending. And so you\u2019re seeing the result of that deliver very strong margins but that is certainly another one of the segments that we\u2019re going to clearly have to take a look at as we provide once again our longer-term outlook for the business in terms of what margin should look like through the cycle. And clearly that\u2019s one that will be revisiting and will likely go up, given the levels of the business is performing at today. But I\u2019d say today when we think about whether or not 25% margins are pretty extraordinary and the business probably won\u2019t perform at that level every quarter but I will say that we\u2019re very comfortable today that the margins in this business will perform at very high levels and very attractive levels for some time to come and primarily because consumers are continuing to get on planes and that drives the aftermarket. The military business is really just kicking into gear right now and and Boeing and Airbus are sitting on very large backlog and so we think this business will be good for a very long time.","John Walsh","Great, thank you for that. And then obviously there has been a lot of questions around capital allocation addition In the strong cash, it\u2019s going to be coming in the door. I know you don\u2019t want to get ahead of yourself for next year but you\u2019ve historically had this expectation to take down 1% to 2% of float next year. I mean, should we assume that the high end of, that\u2019s kind of where we should be base casing it?","Richard Fearon","Yes, it\u2019s. Rick, I would think of it this way, Our expectation would be take down 1% to 2% float and then the proceeds from Lighting on top of that, so you\u2019ll end up with considerably more than 1% to 2%.","John Walsh","Great, thank you for that.","Craig Arnold","And this is an important point because one of the things that we committed to you and the investor community in general is that as we think about how we would manage the company during periods of market weakness is that we said that we would use our strong cash flow generation capabilities in our balance sheet to essentially buyback shares to help offset pressures in terms of EPS and that\u2019s clearly what we did in Q3. And you could expect that as we look into 2020 depending upon where markets end up, that will continue to kind of run the same play.","John Walsh","Great thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes, Thanks. Good morning guys. And maybe just the first question around the increase in the operating cash flow guidance, I guess, key drivers of the that it looks like the receivables balance is down inventories up a little bit, so just trying to reconcile where that\u2019s coming from?","Richard Fearon","You\u2019re right. Working capital was very strong. If you look at the combination of receivables and payables, the change from Q2 to Q3, you\u2019re just shy of $200 million and so we have done a good job all year at managing working capital, we expect that to continue into Q4 and already our initial thinking about next year would have further improvements as a variety of programs relating to for example correcting any billing inaccuracies that makes a big difference on receivables, but also in payables and making sure that we are paying our suppliers in a commercially reasonable time-frame and we believe we have further opportunities to improve both receivables and payables.","Craig Arnold","And to your point, Nicole, inventory is actually are up slightly. When you\u2019re facing into an economic downturn, we typically take inventories out of the organization so we quite frankly have a big opportunity still on in front of us in terms of really reducing our overall inventory levels and so to Rick\u2019s point we would expect 2020 to be another year of very strong cash flow.","Nicole DeBlase","Thanks, Craig. You actually just pre-answered my second question any thoughts on the monthly progression of organic growth throughout the quarter? Things are getting a lot worse for you guys in September and then I guess anything initial that you have to say on October relative to the guidance that you\u2019ve provided today for the fourth quarter?","Craig Arnold","One of the thing that was out at the Investor Conference Nicole and Laguna, and it\u2019s been kind of indicated there that we have already seen really in the first couple of months of the quarter, some market weakness, which really I\u2019d say persisted throughout the quarter. So if I say no, not particularly, September wasn\u2019t particularly weaker month than the other two months in the quarter in terms of the progression and how it unfolds. And in terms of October, I\u2019d say, what we\u2019ve seen so far is largely consistent with the forecast that we have provided.","Nicole DeBlase","Thanks. I will pass it on.","Craig Arnold","Thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Craig Arnold","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","So, Craig, I wanted to touch on the just the disconnect between what you\u2019re seeing on the order growth side on ESS and what you\u2019re expecting from a growth perspective and you mentioned in your prepared comments project deferrals and so I\u2019d love to get a little bit more color on where you\u2019re actually seeing project deferrals and how that kind of plays out into 2020?","Craig Arnold","Yes. And what you referred to as a disconnect I would say largely, if you think about the Electrical Systems and Services business, it does tend to be a longer cycle business. And probably the best proxy for what we would expect for that business in fourth quarter probably would have been orders that we have received in Q2 of 2019 and if you recall, we had a relatively weak order intake in Q2. So there is a time lag to that business but once again to your point, we did see very strong orders in Q3 and we think that does bode well for 2020. And so that\u2019s really the way I would think about that. And in the second half of your question was with regard to the\u2026","Joe Ritchie","Just basically, how that played out for 2020. And I guess if I were to kind of ask a clarifying question, are you seeing any cancellations in your orders at all or is it just, really just deferrals at this point.","Craig Arnold","Mostly deferrals as it is always the odd ball cancellation that you would do it always see in these businesses but I\u2019d say nothing that\u2019s increased significantly. Mostly, it\u2019s really delays.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. And then\u2026","Richard Fearon","That\u2019s particularly true on the larger industrial projects.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, got it. Thanks, Rick. I guess my one follow-up and somebody asked this earlier, but I wanted to see if we can get some type of quantification. On the aero margins, what\u2019s the expectation for R&D stepping down both this year and then into 2020?","Craig Arnold","I think with respect to R&D, we\u2019ve already seen the step down in R&D that\u2019s currently reflected in our businesses. And so today, I\u2019d say we\u2019re probably running with respect to R&D as a percentage of revenue, we are probably running right now at historically low levels, primarily a function once again of new platform development from our customers, both on the commercial and the military side and so I would not expect an additional step down in R&D spending. It\u2019s really already reflected in the businesses run rate today in our earnings today.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, got it. Thank you, guys.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Craig Arnold","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Just a question on restructuring and I\u2019ll wrap it around lighting, a little bit, can you just elaborate a little bit on what you\u2019re doing on the restructuring front? Maybe help us think about how much additional there is in Q4 and is there kind of a stranded cost element with lighting that we should be thinking about?","Craig Arnold","I\u2019d say that if you think about the incremental restructuring in Q4. I mean, order magnitude, Jeff, we\u2019re talking about a couple of $0.02 to $0.03 or so in Q4 from where we\u2019ve been and I think the source of that question is what do you do with the stranded cost, You sell a $1.7 billion business obviously there is some stranded costs associated with that and we would fully expect to deal with all of the stranded cost. And so we will obviously in the context of the overall restructuring number that we put up and the cost of the ex that we talked about a $200 million of costs associated with the exit of Lighting embedded in that number was cost to deal with stranded costs, both at the corporate level and also inside of Electrical Products. And so we would expect to fully deal with our stranded costs inside of the business.","Jeff Sprague","Could you also elaborate a little bit, and I don\u2019t know if you need to pull it apart EP versus ESS but just kind of the trajectory of price in your business. And then just kind of the price cost algorithm looking into Q4 in the early part of next year.","Craig Arnold","Yes, what we have always said around price cost is that we are net neutral and that\u2019s really today I\u2019d say where we ultimately will end up. I think we\u2019re slightly positive in Q3, just slightly positive but we would expect once again on a go forward basis that commodity cost inflation tariff driven cost increases that the company will fully offset that and we\u2019ll do a better job of making sure that we\u2019re getting price at the same moment that we\u2019re experiencing the cost but we really expect it to be net neutral to Eaton overall.","Jeff Sprague","Alright. Thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Hi, guys. How are you?","Craig Arnold","Good.","Andrew Obin","Just great execution. Question on Hydraulics as we think about production cuts at Cat and Deere, when do those get incorporated into your revenues, are we seeing some of them in Q3 or is that something we\u2019re going to see in queue? When do we see the bulk of it, that\u2019s what\u2026","Craig Arnold","I appreciate the question Andrew as well, because it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been dealing. We typically would run about 90 days in front of our customers in terms of whatever they\u2019re forecasting in Q4, we would have experienced in Q3 just given the lead time all the way back to the supply chain on many of the components that were sourcing and this is typical, by the way, if you take a look at this business over time, we typically see an outsize impact both on the way up and on the way down, when our big OEM customers go through these periods of a market correction.","Andrew Obin","Got it. And then the question in terms of shortfall, I know there was a quote from you that you were expecting 3% you got 1% and I know you gave it to us by end markets but can you just give a big geography buckets which one disappointed the most and that is obvious. I mean\u2026","Craig Arnold","Sure. And I\u2019d say that, in terms of end market specifically, it really was a down shifting in the growth rate let\u2019s say, the biggest market for us is always the U.S. market and I would say\u2026","Andrew Obin","Yes, that\u2019s what I was referring to. Yes.","Craig Arnold","Still positive growth for sure across the board but certainly we saw a downshifting in the rate of growth in the Americas, we saw it in our Electrical Systems and Services business in large projects we saw in the distribution channel and Electrical Products. We saw a downshifting and growth in the oil and gas space, specifically in our Crouse-Hinds business.","Andrew Obin","Okay, thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Chris Glynn","Thank you. Good morning. So on Hydraulics with the restructuring kind of back-tail and a little more in the fourth quarter, and some comments about moving past inefficiencies, just wondering can you raise margins a little on, you are moderately down revs next year and the 13% kind of the bottom of your through the cycle range. Do you see that is being attainable?","Craig Arnold","I appreciate the question and the goal that we set for this business 13% at the bottom of the cycle, we think it\u2019s absolutely the right goal for the business and we think it\u2019s certainly attainable. I think the real question becomes where do these markets ultimately bottom out at but I think it would not be an unreasonable expectation that the business deliver, 13% margin at the level of economic activity that we\u2019re seeing right now in the business.","Chris Glynn","Okay, thanks. And then a bookkeeping one, any early kind of notional comments on the corporate guidance for next year, should we just leave it comparable?","Richard Fearon","We have got to work through our planning. As a general matter, we have been quite successful at holding our corporate costs flat year-to-year. And then down years taking it down a little bit. So that will give you some color.","Chris Glynn","Perfect. Thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan","Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered. If I look at ESS, the Momentum Index has been weak all year, up a little bit in September but that reflects new projects being considered and should be a good leading indicator for ESS for next year. Where is the disconnect because they are seeing is it may be not momentum index, but you\u2019re seeing the actual Dodge Data improves and that\u2019s subscribing current orders?","Craig Arnold","I appreciate the question and because we spent a lot of time obviously internally trying to figure this one out as well. It is a long-cycle business playing across a very wide set of end markets. And I\u2019d say that a lot of the macro data to your point and what we saw certainly in our own order book in Q3 was quite positive and with orders up 5% on a rolling 12% and 8% excluding data centers, those are pretty strong numbers. And I\u2019d say you can always find in this business that in any given quarter, you could end up with numbers that vary from the kind of the longer-term or medium-term growth rates. And I think what we experienced in Q3 as we indicated was this largely a pull back, a large projects and some project delays and a bit of slowdown on oil and gas, but certainly what we\u2019ve seen in Q3 and what we see in most of the macro indicators for this business, non-res construction continues to do well across the world. I mean, a little bit of moderation in the growth rates but still growth. And so, we remain optimistic about the prospects for this business.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I appreciate the color. And then just a follow-up on e-mobility, you normally report mature year revenue win but that business has accomplished. Could you update us on that?","Craig Arnold","In this quarter and I say we haven\u2019t had any new material wins in the quarter. So what we try to do in this business as you know these wins come in large chunks and as we get large material wins we will be sure to update you on how we\u2019re doing. But by and large we continue to be very optimistic. The business as we reported historically we are ahead of the schedule that we originally set out for the business and we\u2019re still extremely confident in our ability to create a $2 billion to $4 billion new segment for the company.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And I have from the last quarter that you\u2019re material revenue wins were about 390 million, is that still what I should think about?","Craig Arnold","Yes I mean they would have moved up slightly from that end but we\u2019ll try to get report, material wins, when the number moves in a material way, we\u2019ll give you an update.","Ann Duignan","Okay, I appreciate that. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Craig Arnold","Thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning.","Craig Arnold","Hi, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","May be just a first question around these ESS incrementals, very, very good performance, just wanted to make sure that there was nothing particular you saw around mix or something as a tailwind that you think would fade, what do you think this is just normal course of business and reflect sort of good project discipline?","Craig Arnold","I\u2019d say that we obviously took a strong look ourselves that this business because the margins at 18.3% are very, very high and above our own expectations. And no, we did not see favorable mix in the quarter when we look at that issue specifically and it wasn\u2019t mix it really was largely this strong execution in the quarter. And I mean obviously there is always a mix of projects in any given quarter in ES&S.but no there was no particular unusual of one-time events that drove the performance.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly maybe switching to Electrical Products, you do have some reasonably large industrial and industrial controls exposure within EP, particularly now that Lighting is coming out? Maybe talk about that more industrial piece of EP, how you saw demand trends there in recent months and if you expect in Q4 demand in that industrial piece of EP to be any different in Q4 than Q3?","Craig Arnold","We appreciate the question, without a doubt, that the weakest piece of the business today, year-to-date and what we\u2019re forecasting is really what\u2019s going on in industrial markets in the manufacturing sector. And we generally talk about that being about a third of the business itself. And so it\u2019s a big material segment for us and we clearly have continued to see weakness in the industrial controls part of the business.","Richard Fearon","And then that was true Julian both on sales and orders in the third quarter.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you very much.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stephens.","Rob McCarthy","Hi, Rob McCarthy here. I guess the first question I would have is, and thinking about the sale Lighting, I mean I think it was 7.5 times trailing, it was certainly less than that on a forward basis. Horseshoes and hand grenades paid between 11x and 12x for Cooper, even if that was like, I had a company average. I mean, yes, we will be good to have of maturity of what you\u2019re talking about. But this is an exactly value creating into you are buying assets 12x and then at 7.5x trailing call it 7 or 8 years later. So, I mean do you think that this kind of activity kind of the, why the fact that perhaps we should look they can look at a part of what we had breaking up the company?","Richard Fearon","Well, Rob, let me just address that. I don\u2019t think your perspective is exactly correct, I mean do you have an idea the Lighting business when we bought Cooper. It was just under $1.2 billion and now at $1.7 billion, so we\u2019ve grown the business quite significantly over the time period. And if you sort of disaggregate what we paid for the Lighting business as part of Cooper, it\u2019s not an awful lot different than what we sold it for. And now we thought that the business could migrate in certain ways and mailed closer to the broader Electrical franchise and it really has not and that\u2019s one of the reason we believe it\u2019s more appropriate as part of another Lighting enterprise or possibly as a public company, which was our original game plan but we would argue that we haven\u2019t dramatically impacted value in the case of Lighting. If it happen sometimes businesses don\u2019t end up developing in a way that you expect.","Rob McCarthy","Alright. And then in terms of the cash generation of the businesses, I mean, in the context of how you\u2019re thinking about your trough and the cash EPS trough, certainly, I think you would highlight rightfully so strong cash conversion overall. Are you still subscribing to the kind of the trough and the way to think about the trough as you articulated earlier in the year and as anything change there with respect to either cash generation in the down cycle or the trough itself, can we rely on that as we kind of anchor to win work particularly as we go into a tougher macro economic environment?","Richard Fearon","If you\u2019re talking about by trough, well our cash flow change markedly in a down year, we still believe it\u2019s not likely too, right and simply because we liquidate working capital that offsets the profits loss through lower volume. So, even if we had down year at some point in the next couple of years, we don\u2019t think you\u2019d see a market change in cash generation and one other point I would like to make about cash flow, I think it\u2019s important if you think about our free cash flow in 2019 based on the guidance we\u2019ve given and that compared to 2018, we\u2019re guiding to up 23% and I think that\u2019s a pretty notable number. At the end of the day, the real value of most businesses of the cash they generate and we\u2019re generating really attractive increases in cash flow in \u201819 and we would expect continuity and debt cash generation next year. And absolutely cash flow is a very strong. I guess what I was alluding to specifically was the framework I believe Craig laid out for a trough scenario we are still arriving to that.","Craig Arnold","Yes. You are talking about, we have at least flat EPS in a trough year and we continue to believe that is the base case plan. And the only caveat we\u2019d add is that we said post the spin off of our sale of Lighting and post this divestiture of FCD and we would expect to get the FCD transaction done by the end of the year, and lighting some timing in Q1 but post those transactions we absolutely have the plan and fully committed to delivering flat EPS what we call a typical economic recession which we define is two to three quarters of GDP contraction.","Rob McCarthy","Thanks for your time. I appreciate it.","Yan Jin","Good. Our last question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Craig Arnold","Hi, Deane.","Deane Dray","I was hoping to get a spotlight on a specific geography and a vertical, what can you tell us about China, the tone of business, the outlook and then data centers has come up during the call, any specifics there in terms of the outlook? Thanks.","Craig Arnold","I appreciate the question, Deane. I think China, if you think about across the broad swath of businesses that we deal and maybe deal with a positive first I\u2019d say kind of the non-res construction and quite frankly even res construction in China actually continues to perform very well and you see some of this data as well. But that will off starts in Q3, we\u2019re actually up 10% and are up 16% year-to-date. Residential starts are up 6% in Q3 and 9% year to date. And so the whole kind of construction market in China is doing well. And quite frankly, even on the Hydraulics side excavator sales continue to grow quite nicely in Q3, up 16% and excavators and up 7% in real world and so that piece of the business in China is actually doing quite well. By contrast, light motor vehicle production is down quite significantly, down 7% in Q3 and 12% year-to-date as well as heavy duty truck production is about flat. And so, it really is a very different story depending upon which end market you referring to. But in the most important part of our company, let\u2019s call it, in the Electrical side non-res construction the market is holding up quite well.","Deane Dray","Great.","Craig Arnold","And then typically the data centers, as we mentioned in the opening commentary, in our data center business performed very well in the quarter. We ended up seeing high single-digit growth in data centers and so that market continues to perform very well. And as we\u2019ve mentioned on other earnings calls that the hyperscale stuff does tend to be lumpy, and we continue to see that lumpiness, but by and large, we continue to see very good growth in data centers.","Deane Dray","Craig, just last one for me, the lowering of the CapEx by $50 million. Is there any story behind that?","Craig Arnold","No, I\u2019d say that\u2019s just really fine-tuning the outlook for the year. Our businesses tend to be low optimistic. The only course of the planning process around what they can get done, that\u2019s really just largely a true up. We\u2019ve not done anything to put any clamps on our capex spending. We\u2019re still spending on every program that we can get done.","Deane Dray","Great, thanks for the color.","Yan Jin","Great. Thank you all. We have reached to the end of our call. And we do appreciate everybody\u2019s question. As always Craig and I will be available to address any follow-up questions. Thank you all. Have a good day.","Craig Arnold","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

I\u2019ll turn the call now to Mr. Donald Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Donald Bullock","Good morning. For those of you I\u2019m Donald Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you to all of you for joining us for Eaton's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman Chief Financial and planning officer.","The agenda for today\u2019s call includes our opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the performance in the fourth quarter, our outlook and our guidance for 2019. As we\u2019ve done on our prior calls, we\u2019ll be taking questions at the end of Craig\u2019s comments today.","Before we dive into that, I do want to make couple of quick passing comments. The press release for our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we\u2019ll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, and a webcast of this call will be accessible on our website and available for replay after today\u2019s call.","Before we get started, I do need to remind you that the comments today do include statements related to expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Any results may differ materially from a forecast that could be due to a wide range of risk and uncertainties, and those are described in the earnings release and the presentation, and they will be also outlined in our related 10 Q filing.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Craig.","Craig Arnold","Okay. Hey thanks, Don. I\u2019ll start on page 3 with highlights of our Q4 results, and I\u2019ll start by saying that I\u2019m very pleased naturally with their report this morning and another very strong quarter performance, which really rounded out our solid year overall.","Earnings per share of a $1.46 a share, up 13% from last year, and above the midpoint of our guidance. And this was driven by flows strong growth in sales, as well as higher margins. Sales are actually $5.5 billion in the quarter, an increase of 5% and this includes 7% organic growth and this was above our guidance of 6% for the quarter.","Bookings growth in the quarter was also strong, led by double digit growth in both Electrical Systems & Services and in Aerospace. And so we continue to be pleased with our margin performance as well, which increased 100 basis points to 17.4%.","We had solid margin performance really across all of the segments and all time record margins in Electrical Systems & Services and in Aerospace. We also generated very strong operating cash flows at $1.1 billion, up 27% and a quarterly record if you exclude the $300 million arbitration payment that we made earlier this year.","And lastly, we reported and repurchased $700 million of shares in the quarter, taking advantage of what we saw this frequent pullback in financial markets. And if you\u2019ll recall, we had planned to purchase $240 million in the quarter to achieve our target of $800 million to $1 billion for the year.","I\u2019d say for now, you can think about this as an acceleration of purchases and that we were planning to make in 2019. However, if markets remain weak, we\u2019ll certainly take advantage of those opportunities as well and buy at higher levels.","Moving to Page 4, you\u2019ll see our financial summary for the quarter. You can read these numbers for sure, but I\u2019ll provide maybe just a bit of context here. First, our operating segment profits increased 11% and we generated strong incremental of almost 40%.","Second, segment margins of 17.4% were at the high end of our guidance range, and 100 basis points above Q4, 2017. And finally, our net income as reported was flat with prior year and prior year included income related to the U.S. tax bill, excluding this onetime benefit from Q3 -- Q4, 2017 our net income increased 10%. On page five, we\u2019ll start our segment overviews with electrical products. The revenues grew 3% in Q4 and this includes 5% of organic growth offset by 2% in currency.","And this was really a strong finish to the year and in the end it was actually our highest organic growth rate for Electrical Products since Q4 of 2014. As we expected, growth in our lighting business turned positive and was up mid-single digits, while orders increased 3% and this was led by solid growth in the Americas.","I\u2019d also note here that our backlog increased 15% and while we generally think about this as a book-and-bill business, this increase does suggest that we didn\u2019t see any unusual pre-buying at the end of the quarter.","Segment margins were 18.2% flat with prior year and this was largely a result of some unfavorable product mix between the businesses.","Next, we can move to Page Six and a summary of our Electrical Systems & Services Segment. As I noted in my opening commentary, this segment posted excellent results for the quarter. The business continued to strengthen. We posted 10% organic growth in the quarter in with strength across all major end markets.","The 10% growth represented an acceleration of growth, which was above our Q3 growth rate of 9% and above the Q2 growth rate which was up 7%. And as you can see we did have some negative impact from foreign exchange and a small divestiture during the course of last year.","Orders were even stronger up 12% on strong growth and all major end markets in the Americas, and in EMEA. And I\u2019d say that there\u2019s strong growth in Q4 was against a very strong comp from last year where orders were up 12%.","You\u2019ll recall from our Q3 earnings call that we noted a pause in orders during the month of September. We had expected that this was largely project timing and temporary. So things really played out as we expected in this segment.","In addition, our backlog continued to increase and was up 13%. So overall, the segment is performing very consistent with what we would expect from this long cycle business. And lastly, segment operating profits were up 19% and we generated all time record margins in this segment of 16.6%, so a very strong quarter across the board.","If you turn to page seven, we'll summarize the results of our Hydraulics business. Here, we had another strong quarter of revenue growth with sales up 6%, 8% organic growth offset by 2% negative currency. And we continued to see strength really in mobile and with Industrial OEMs, and Construction and Ag markets and in the distribution channel, so pretty broad based.","Orders were down 4%, and I would say here on tough comps and if you recall Q4 2017, our orders were up 25%. In the quarter, we did however see continued strength in Asia with orders up 10%, orders in the Americas were flat, but at very high levels. And we continue to see order weakness in EMEA with orders down some 24% as lead times continue to improve.","And I\u2019d also add here, but this was the region where we had our most difficult comp, orders in Q4 of 2017 were actually up 38%. And so we feel once again pretty good overall about the activity levels in the hydraulics business.","Our backlog does remain strong; it increased 6% from last year. And turning to operating profits, we increased profit by 15% and our operating margins increased 90 basis points to 13%. So I think the right conclusion here is that we made solid progress in this business, which was held back in some prior quarters by some supply chain issues, but that progress needs to continue and is expected to continue going into 2019.","On Page eight, we moved to Aerospace, and the business here is clearly firing on all cylinders. Now begin by noting that growth continues to accelerate in Q4 with organic revenue growth up 13% and this is up from 9% growth in Q3 and 6% growth in Q2.","Orders also accelerated, they are increasing 17% with strength in commercial transport military fighters and both commercial and military aftermarket. And our backlog continues to grow up some 13% in the quarter.","Now the business here also demonstrated very strong operating leverage with profits increasing 30% and delivering record operating margins of 22.9%. I would add that favorable mix certainly contributed to these record margins as aftermarket revenues continue to perform well, but our team also is doing an outstanding job of executing.","Moving to the Vehicle Segment on page 9, we\u2019re also very pleased with how this segment performed in the quarter. Our revenues were down 2% with flat organic revenues, and 2% percent negative FX. The NAFTA Class 8 truck market remained very strong in the quarter and reached 324,000 units for 2018 and this is up some 27%.","You\u2019ll recall here that revenues for our automated truck transmission business are now included in the Eaton Cummins joint venture and are not consolidated in our financials. The JV actually had revenue growth up 45% in the quarter. So our business overall is performing extremely well.","On the other hand, our global light vehicle production was down in Q4, with North America up modestly offset by slight declines in Europe, and particular weakness as you\u2019ve all heard in China.","Despite flat organic revenues, operating profits increased 4% and our operating margins increased 90 basis points to 17.9%. And finishing up our segment summaries, eMobility is on page 10. Organic revenue growth was 11% offset by 1% negative currency.","Not unexpected, operating margins declined to 11.3% as we continue to ramp up our R&D spending. You\u2019ll recall that this new segment was created in Q1 of last year. At last year\u2019s investors meeting, we told you that eMobility would become a new $2 to $4 billion offset of our company. And I\u2019m pleased to say that we\u2019re on track. 2018 was a busy year and a year where we ended ahead of schedule.","We\u2019re in ongoing discussions with a large number of customers on new programs, and we remain very optimistic about the long term growth outlook for the business overall. We\u2019re ahead of schedule on new product developments. These new products are allowing us to quote on a broader range of opportunities and quite frankly to move from selling only components to selling systems.","So we remain very excited about the future of this segment, and the work that our team is doing and what this represents as a growth opportunity for Eaton as we move forward.","And before we turn our attention to 2019, I would like to just take a moment to recap some of the key highlights from 2018 now which we see a strong year as a strong year of progress. First, end markets improved allowing us to generate 6% organic revenue growth and this was double the growth rate of 2017 and above our initial estimate for the year, which was 4%. We continued to make good progress on enhancing our margin performance with a 100 basis point improvement and setting an all-time record for the company at 16.8%. As a result, our net income per share of $5.39 when you exclude the $0.48 [ph] impact in the legacy Cooper arbitration decision was up 16% over 2017.","And our teams very effectively offset both the impact of tariffs and commodity inflation with incremental price. We generated $3 billion of operating cash flow and this would exclude the $300 million impact from the arbitration payment.","This allowed us to return $2.45 billion to shareholders. $1.15 billion in dividends and another 1.3 billion of share repurchases and the 1.3 billion represents 4% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. So, overall very proud of the team. We exceeded our financial commitment to shareholders. We invested in the future of the business and really are building a stronger company.","Now turning to 2019. Let me begin by summarizing our growth outlook. Overall, we\u2019re expecting 4% to 5% organic growth, and this is consistent with the outlook that we provided in Q3, 2018 during our conference call.","As we take a look at our individual businesses, we expect 4% to 5% organic growth in Electrical products, with continued strength in industrial and large commercial projects. We expect modest growth in lighting, and also modest growth in single phase power quality and small commercial projects.","For Electrical Systems & Services, we see 5% to 6% organic growth. And here our backlog is very strong. We expect continued market strength and power distribution assemblies in the Americas and in the datacenter markets globally.","We also see modest growth, in both the utility and harsh and hazardous markets. For hydraulics, growth is expected to be 5% to 6% on revenue levels that are already very strong, but we see continued strength in mobile markets in Asia and in North America.","And Aerospace markets really are universally strong, and we expect to see 8% to 9% growth on strength in OEM and aftermarket, and really, with both military and commercial customers.","Vehicle markets are expected to be flat for both North America heavy duty truck, and global light vehicles. But, both are running at I\u2019d say very high levels, and we expect to see strong growth in the Brazilian truck market. Overall, our organic revenues are expected to be down 2% to 1% for the year, but once again keep in mind, that our revenues for automated truck transmissions are expected to grow and are now apart and reported as a part of the Eaton Cummins joint venture.","Finally, we expect eMobility to grow 11% to 12% organically, consistent with a level of growth that we experienced in 2018. And while we\u2019re still a few years away from what we call a major growth inflection point, our optimism for this segment continues to grow as we look forward.","Moving on to Page 13, we lay out our margin expectations for 2019. For Eaton overall, we expect segment margins to be between 17% and 17.4%. At the midpoint, this represents a 40 basis point improvement over 2018 and it really places us solidly within the 17% to 18% range that we set as a 2020 goal. And I would add, one year ahead of schedule.","And with the exception of new eMobility, we investing \u2013 we were investing heavily in product development. Margins are expected to increase in each of our segments, specifically Electrical Products at 18.6% to 19.2%, to a 50 basis point improvement and Electrical System & Services at 15.2% to 15 8%, up 60 basis points. Hydraulics at 14% to 14.6% up 90 basis points. Aerospace at a very strong level already, but at 21.4% to 22% up 70 basis points and Vehicle at 17.4% to 18% up 20 basis points.","eMobility as we noted, we\u2019re investing heavily in this segment. Margins will be down to 6.1% to 6.7% from 70 basis points, really just as a function of heavy R&D investment.","And on page 14, we pick up the balance of our guidance for 2019. So we expect our full year EPS to be $5.70 to $6 a share. At the midpoint, this represents a 9% increase, excluding the impact of the arbitration decision that reduced 2018 earnings by some $0.48.","As we discussed, organic revenue is expected to be up 4% to 5%, but this growth is expected to be partially offset by some $250 million of negative currency translation. We expect our corporate costs, including pension and interest and other corporate items to be flat with 2018 and our tax rate to be between 14% and 16%.","This will result in operating cash flows coming in between $3.1 billion and $3.3 billion and we expect CapEx to be $600 million. As I noted, we accelerated some $400 million of share repurchases into Q4. So the target purchases for 2019 are now at $400 million.","And for Q1, we expect EPS to be between $1.18 and $1.28, a 12% increase at the midpoint. And for Q1, we also expect organic growth to be approximately 4% to have segment margins between 55 and 59 and a tax rate of between 13% and 14%.","So overall, we expect another strong year. And this concludes my opening comments, and I\u2019ll hand it back to you and you can open the line for Q&A.","Donald Bullock","Thanks, Craig. Before we go ahead to operator to open it up for questions, I do want to make a couple of comments. First, we do acknowledge today, is a day that has an enormous number of peers out there and earnings announcements. So we are going to hold our call to an hour. To do that, it\u2019s important that you limit your questions to a question and a follow up if you would, so we can be sure to cover everyone\u2019s questions.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over the operator to give instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] ","Donald Bullock","Our first question today comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning. Thought very solid Craig, I was wondering, if you could provide a little bit of additional color on how you saw things play out during the quarter, obviously the quarter itself was very strong. But we did have that peculiar slowdown in September. Did you see people tapping the brakes in December as the market got wobbly and what are you seeing here in January?","Craig Arnold","Jeff, I guess you\u2019re referencing largely what we talked about on the Q3 earnings call and Electrical Systems & Service where we did see this pause during the month of September. We\u2019d indicated at the time that we thought that was a temporary pause, that these products do at sometimes tend to be lumpy, and we thought that, that would come back in Q4, which it certainly did.","No, I\u2019d say Q4 was really pretty much a consistent quarter. We saw the high level of economic activity really across the quarter, pretty consistent across each of our businesses and as I\u2019d noted, with no real significant, no measurable pre buy at all, as evidenced by the growth in our backlog.","And so, I think it was a solid clean quarter across the board, and despite the level of economic uncertainty that\u2019s out there. Activity levels are fairly good, and in through the month of January, we\u2019ve really seen kind of a continuation of that performance. Certainly, in the context of our guidance for Q1, which is a little lighter than the growth rate that we saw in Q4, we do think there is some economic uncertainty out there, which is essentially what we have reflected in our guidance. But by and large, activity levels across our businesses are still quite positive and quite strong.","Jeff Sprague","Thanks and unrelated. Just on tax, Rick. I mean your guidance is pretty straightforward, but we\u2019ve seen a couple of companies getting hit by this IRS change and deductibility of interest. Is that an issue for you or a wild card or is that fully encapsulated in your guide?","Richard Fearon","It\u2019s fully baked into our guide. One of the reasons that the tax rate jumps from roughly around 13% to 15% in 2019 is because we\u2019re reflecting the implications of all these regulations that came out last year, some of which, I think surprise some companies. But we had anticipated that they would come out largely as they did. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re comfortable with this 14% to 16% range for 2019.","Jeff Sprague","Great. Thank you.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning guys. So Craig, maybe just on the EPS range. $0.30 wide versus kind of like typical is closer to $0.20. Maybe, can you just give us some insight into why you expanded the range, and what market conditions have to be in place to drive you to that towards the higher end or the lower end of the range?","Craig Arnold","Yes, I would suggest Joe that don\u2019t really over read or read much into the fact that the range is a little bit wider. I mean, I think it\u2019s as our EPS in absolute dollar terms increases the percentage and the range will naturally widen a little bit. But I\u2019d say that, for us, the big variables as we look forward into 2019 that could potentially influence whether you\u2019re on the low end or the high end of the range. It\u2019s largely a function of what happens with our end markets.","Right now, I said we\u2019re feeling fairly good. It was a strong fourth quarter, coming in stronger than what most had expected ourselves included. And so I think, it\u2019s really a function of how end markets perform going into 2019, and to what extent some of the geopolitical kind of concerns that the world we\u2019re dealing with in various kind of countries around the world get resolved.","But I wouldn\u2019t read anything into the fact that the range has been opened up a little bit. We\u2019re feeling very good about kind of you know the company\u2019s performance overall and degrees of freedom that we have around things that we can do in the event of a little bit of an economic slowdown. So I would not over read that at all.","Joe Ritchie","Craig that said, that\u2019s good to hear. And I guess my follow on, you guys cited power distribution assemblies and data centers as strong growers in 2019. I think data centers are up high single digits. This is though a little at odds with some of the announcements we\u2019ve heard from some of the chip makers, so maybe talk a little bit about like the strength that you\u2019re seeing in data centers that makes you feel good about the prospects for 2019.","Craig Arnold","Yes. I mean the data center market I\u2019d say if you look at the long term trend of what we\u2019ve been seeing in general, the whole world generates and consumes more and more data. I think it\u2019s pretty compelling for the long term growth prospects. We saw strong double digit growth in 2018 and as well as a lot of major projects being announced. And so, as we think about data centers in general, while on the hyperscale side of the market, it can be somewhat lumpy. We do think that what we\u2019re looking at in the form of an existing backlog and projects, that were in the pipeline, that the numbers that we\u2019re talking about for 2019, which is kind of mid-single digit growth are very much in line with what we have visibility to.","I think the chip maker piece is perhaps one that\u2019s a little bit more nuanced in terms of whether or not that\u2019s a direct proxy for what we\u2019re seeing specifically in the data center market, as a lot of the big data center companies are actually in many cases vertically integrating and doing a lot of this work themselves as opposed to relying upon third parties.","But now we feel very good about the data center market and about how we\u2019re positioned and about the number of projects that have already been announced. And so we think it\u2019s going to be another strong year.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Great, thanks Craig.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase at Deutsche Bank.","Nicole DeBlase","Morning guys.","Craig Arnold","Morning, Nicole.","Nicole DeBlase","So I guess maybe starting with the 1Q outlook, it seems to me like the step down to 4% organic growth could be a little bit of conservatism reading between the lines of what you said in response to Joe\u2019s question. But I guess, maybe thinking about from a segment by segment perspective, where the step down is coming from?","Craig Arnold","Yes, I\u2019d say that as we take a look at Q1, we\u2019re certainly seeing a step down in the growth rate. I\u2019d say principally and Electrical Systems & Services is one of the big drivers and hydraulics, I\u2019d say would be another one and then also in Aerospace. So those would be the three big ones that I\u2019d say that\u2019s a relative step down in the growth rate.","And I think, largely the way we think about it in the call is the way I answer the question earlier is that, there is a lot of economic uncertainty out there whether it\u2019s Brexit or the funding of the U.S. government or trade disputes with China. And so, we think given the level of uncertainty that\u2019s still out there in Q1 that you could largely see a little bit of a pause in economic activity until some of these major structural issues are resolved there.","And that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s baked into our forecast. Could it be conservative, it could be, but given kind of just a level of economic uncertainty out there, we think it\u2019s prudent to plan for these issues to at least extend through Q1 and be resolved at some point and we think all of that logic is baked into our guidance for the year of growing some 4% to 5%.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay understood. Thanks Craig. And I guess, maybe my second one just around hydraulics. So one of your big distributors talked about solar power demand stepping down a bit in the last two weeks of December. Curious about that, as well as a confidence in the outlook for China Mobile to remain strong just because I think Cat is looking for more like kind of a flattish equipment environment in China in 2019?","Craig Arnold","Yes, I know China has continued to -- maybe I\u2019ll deal with that one first before I get to the distributor one. China has continued to perform extremely well. If you take a look at excavator sales in Q4, and [Indiscernible] sales excavator, sales are up more than 20% in Q4.","Vehicle [ph] order sales up more than 10%. And so the China construction equipment market at least in terms of looking at the public data continues to perform extremely well and our business does as well. And so, we think as we look into 2019, we do think that growth rates are moderate, but we still think that we see growth in the China mobile market specifically going into 2019 and that\u2019s kind of consistent with what we\u2019re hearing from many of our customers.","And quite frankly, Eaton in the region we\u2019ve done extremely well in terms of new wins and gaining some market share on platforms and that also influences our thinking as well.","But in terms of the distribution market, I can\u2019t really speak to one distributor in one part of region. I would say that, our hydraulics business in Q4, we had growth of organic growth of 8% and that growth was pretty even throughout the quarter. And so, we felt very good about the growth rates and we did not see generally speaking, or here generally speaking of any slowdown that took place at the end of the year. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me that there is a distributor someplace who saw a slowdown someplace. But more broadly speaking, our business continued to perform well.","Nicole DeBlase","Understood. Thanks Craig.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan","Yes. Hi good morning. Maybe Craig, maybe you could dig a little bit deeper into some of your end markets and give us some color in terms of where you\u2019re seeing the strength and looking particularly maybe Electrical Products, which specific industrial markets, which some segment of commercial projects and then likewise maybe power distribution. Just so we get some color as to what\u2019s going on out there.","Craig Arnold","Yes and I\u2019d say that in the beginning with Electrical Products. One of the things we noted was lighting business returned to natural growth. It\u2019s been a business that obviously we were taking some strategic steps to work through some specific market segment issues, and so that business for us returned to growth in Q4. And we think the outlook for lighting going into 2019, is that business will continue to grow low to mid-single digits.","We think that the single phase power quality business, another business that grew mid-single digits in Q4. We had order growth that was a little better than that actually in Q4. And so that market continues to do well, and then largely the power distribution components, a lot of what we sell in the component side goes into small and large commercial projects in general. And so when you think about some of the growth that we see today in our Electrical Systems & Services businesses, mainly most of the components that support that business come through our Electrical Products business, and some of that goes to distribution is aftermarket as well. And so that business continues to do well.","So we saw generally speaking, pretty decent growth as I mentioned the strongest growth that we\u2019ve seen since 2014 in Electrical Products and the orders are performing solidly. And so, we think that market continues to have a decent year in 2019.","In Electrical Systems & Services and it\u2019s really as I mentioned almost strength across the board. Large industrial projects, commercial projects, those markets continue to perform extremely well, and you see many of the same data streams that we see, non-res construction numbers continue to be up strongly mid-to-high single digits. The Dodge non-res contracts on -- were up 23% in dollars in Q4, and on a square footage basis up 10%.","And so we\u2019re really seeing strength in most of the non-res construction markets and as we talked about in data centers hyper scale and data centers in general had very strong results, up strong double digits in 2018 and we think a little bit of moderation in that growth rate as we move into 2019, but still strong growth.","And so we think in general, these businesses continue to perform very well and that no real evidence of any economic slowdown at this point. And so we\u2019re feeling very good about 2019.","And then [Indiscernible] what your own guess is another one of those segments that\u2019s been a lot of stuff talked about, but we had very good growth in Q4 and our [Indiscernible] business up, strong, single digits, high single digits. And so that business as well despite a little bit of pullback in oil and gas prices at the end of the year, we saw some recovery in December. And so we think that market also continues to grow going into 2019.","Ann Duignan","Okay, that\u2019s good color. I appreciate that. And then just to follow up on that sustainability of aerospace margins. I mean we know it\u2019s great that high margins in aerospace, but we also know we have to be investing in the future, so can you just talk Craig maybe about the near-term maybe positive mix versus the longer term. You need to be on the next platform in order to sustain those high margins?","Craig Arnold","Absolutely, and appreciate the question. I think there\u2019s two things that are really driving the high margins in aerospace. I think one, it is the fact that aftermarket is continuing to perform extremely well. In better than most I mean at the end of the day, you make most of your money in aerospace and aftermarket, and an aftermarket is performing extremely well both in commercial and in on the military side.","The other thing that I\u2019d say that we and others are getting a real benefit from right now is really what you alluded to and it\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re in a bit of a pause period as an industry in terms of new programs.","We went through a massive refresh over the last 10 years, and most of these new programs are actually going into service at this point in time, and the next, by the time you get to the next generation, the next refresh you\u2019re probably 5 years to 10 years out. And so I do think that our aerospace margins will continue to be at very high levels for the next number of years and until we get to the point where we have the next round of major investments required for the next generation of commercial and\/or military aircraft.","And so, we are investing in the future. We\u2019re doing a lot of investments in offline technology development to be ready, for insertion to get to a technology readiness level that says that we\u2019re ready to participate on the new platforms. But I say it\u2019s really those two things that are really benefiting our business as well as very strong execution by our operational teams.","Ann Duignan","Right. Thank you. I leave it there. I appreciate there.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","Thanks guys. Good morning.","Craig Arnold","Hi.","Nigel Coe","So, what a difference [Indiscernible]. I\u2019m just trying to understand the turnaround in ESS because it feels like there\u2019s probably economic concerns in the U.S. than there was back in September, October. So I'm wondering what are you hearing from fields, your sales, engineers, customers whatever in terms of what cause the pause and why there risk now? And maybe just in terms commenting on creep activity this quarter pull ahead a price increases as such. Did you see any of that? And could that explain some of this pressure?","Craig Arnold","I\u2019d say \u2013 Nigel, I appreciate the question. We spend the fair amount of time talking about Q3 earnings call. And I think the way we characterize it at the time was we said the business we thought was in fine shape, at least that we saw a specific pause in the month of September and the business tends to be lumpy anyway and we try to encourage everyone to the look through September and say everything will be fine, which is to way it turned out. And so, I wish I could give you the exact answer to why we saw this pause in the month of September other than saying at sometimes it does happen in these big systems businesses where orders tend to be lumpy. But by and large I think what we characterize in Q3 what that our Electrical System & Services business was doing great. It was in fine shape. And we expected that we would continue to post strong growth in that long cycle business and that's essentially what\u2019s happened.","Now and to the point around pull ahead, we\u2019re not really seeing any pull aheads at all. We talked about. As we continue to build backlog in that business. It\u2019s up some 13% from last year. And so I that would, the way I characterize Electrical Systems & Services is once again very much like long cycle business. Its performing as expected and you will occasionally find a month or so where things tend to be lumpy.","Nigel Coe","Okay. That\u2019s great color. Thanks Craig. And then just maybe address price and in particular lighting price. I feel that lighting price is getting a lot better. And so I just appreciate your comment in what you're seeing in term of demand for lighting, obviously low single-digit since 2019, but specifically the price component of that what you\u2019re seeing in the market?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I would say that lighting prices in general and some of this could be as a function of trade and other things that are perhaps putting a little bit of a floor underneath some of the pressure that have been coming historically from the Chinese import, but yes, I would say that it did has the pressures in around lighting have somewhat abated. It still remains a very competitive industry and historically speaking if you recall in this business a lot of the lighting price get back was really a function of the fact that the price of semiconductors and electronics in general continued to fall and those prices were essentially passed on to our customers and to the consumers in the form of lower prices of LEDs.","And so some of that is also that the price of the core electronic component is not falling at the rate that it has historically and we reached a little bit about bottom on some of that. And I think that also influencing the fact that lighting prices are foaming somewhat. We did have a much better Q4 with the mid-single digit growth. Our outlook going forward is low to mid single-digit and so we do think that the lighting business performs better for sure going into 2019 even it becomes no longer a headwind for the business becomes a little bit of a tailwind with respect to growth and so we\u2019re enthuse by that.","Nigel Coe","Okay. I\u2019ll leave it that. Thanks Craig.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Good morning.","Craig Arnold","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning. Maybe just the first question around the hydraulics business in the margin profile, as you said you had some operating inefficiencies in 2017 and 2018. If you could quantify at all what kind of margin headwind they comprised in 2018? And how quickly you catch up from those in 2019 and may be any other respects in which it changing how you sort of manage the productivity and the manufacturing pull-through in that business?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I appreciate the question, Julian, because this is obviously been one of the segment that we spend quite a bit of time talking about during the course of our earnings calls and one of the segments were we did in fact reduce our guidance for the year. And the way we characterize and then, I think it's the largely the case Julian, is that, this industry went through a very significant ramp of V-shaped [ph] recovery the supply chain and our supplier to many cases were just not ready for the ramp. And so we had a lot of inefficiencies in the business as a function of having to expedite parts. We had some challenges in ramping up hiring, not only in our facilities, but our suppliers had the same issues. And so there was just a whole host of inefficiencies associated with an industry that went through a V shape recovery and we were all caught a little bit flat footed.","And as a result of that, those inefficiencies I\u2019d say, if you think about the reduction in our margin guidance for hydraulics during the course of the year, you can largely say that is about equivalent to the level of inefficiencies that we saw in the business.","And as one of the reasons why we as we look at the guidance for 2019, we think most of those efficiencies come out of this system and we would get to a business once again that\u2019s performing more like what we would expect.","And so I\u2019d say that, while we\u2019re not 100% out of the woods, most of the issues that we dealt with doing a course of 2018 and the efficiencies therein are largely behind us now.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. And then my second question. I think a lot of the Q&A so far has been on demand dynamics, so maybe switch to talking about capital deployment a little bit. You did some accelerated share buyback spend in Q4 when the price was down and obviously you\u2019ve seen a good rebound since so the timing looks very good on that. Maybe flesh out a little bit how you are thinking about buybacks versus M&A and what kind of M&A appetite you have looking out this year?","Craig Arnold","Yes. Appreciate the question. No we did like, you articulate we saw the overdone Q4 pullback as a real buying opportunity and we did take that opportunity to accelerate some planned purchases into the end of the year. And I\u2019d say, if you think about a capital deployment strategy, I think we\u2019ve laid that out historically and we talked about, as we think about capital deployment. The first call on cash will always be reinvesting in each of our businesses, and making sure that every one of our businesses has the capital that they need to be successful and the win in the marketplace.","With respect to M&A versus share buyback, we have been out of the M&A market for the last several years. We do -- I would say that the environment today is such that we\u2019re looking at perhaps more opportunities and more deals in than ever. Pricing continues in some cases to still be a challenge and we've agreed that we\u2019re going to maintain our pricing discipline through this period of perhaps pricing being above what we think is reasonable.","We\u2019ve said that our cost of capital is anywhere from 8% to 9%. We want a minimum of 300 basis points over our cost of capital. And so we\u2019re going to be disciplined through this period. But having said that, we would like to get back into the M&A market, and the way I would think about it is our priority will be largely around bolt on acquisitions where you get a lot of leverage within our existing businesses, and therefore we can deliver synergies and value in these acquisitions that we acquire.","But having said that, in the event that we\u2019re not able to put capital to work through M&A, we will generate as I mentioned a lot of free cash flow in 2019. We won\u2019t let capital build up on the balance sheet. And so we\u2019ll certainly in the event that we\u2019re not successful in the M&A market, we\u2019ll certainly be more aggressive in buying back our shares.","Richard Fearon","And Julian, if I might add. We brought our debt levels actually even a little bit lower than we had originally anticipated after Cooper. And if you just do a quick little math of our midpoint of 3.2 operating cash flow on takeout CapEx, takeout of about 600 million, takeout dividends, take out the 400 million repurchases, it leaves us with about $1 billion of just excess cash to use on acquisitions or if we don\u2019t find them presumably raising our repurchase amount.","Craig Arnold","I might add to that Rick, and we\u2019ve been, we\u2019ve been quite aggressive quite frankly. If you take a look over the last four years, in aggregate, we\u2019ve we bought back some 13% of our shares over the last four years. And so we are certainly willing to step in, when we see these opportunities of weakness, and buy the stock back and given our dividend yield and the current stock prices, we think that it\u2019s a tremendous value to buy Eaton at these levels.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you very much.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore.","David Raso","Hi. Good morning. I apologize, had phone issues earlier, so I apologize if this has been asked. Just trying to figure out the first quarter organic is slower than the full year. So obviously there's some assumption of some reacceleration as the year goes on. But the comps don't really get any easier. You mentioned ESS starts the year little bit slower on the step down, but the backlog for that business has been up double-digit for three quarters the orders have been the obviously lumpy in the third quarter, but two of the three quarters have been strong. So I am just maybe trying to dig into little bit more why ESS organic slows that much in the first quarter? And if we think of the businesses that you said maybe they start a little bit of a pause period, the acceleration in growth as the year goes on, is that more ESS? Is it aerospace? Just try to understand so that we have a cadence correct?","Craig Arnold","I appreciate the question, Dave and we did talk about this little bit earlier. And I think it\u2019s really we talked about this. The level of economic uncertainty that exist in the marketplace right now across so many parts of the world that\u2019s really giving us a little bit of a pause with respect to how aggressive we are on this Q1 number. And so I'd say it's really that issue more than anything that has been baked into thinking around acceleration. I mean, you have Brexit coming up. You have trade disputes with China. You have debt issues in the U.S. and so there\u2019s a so many, I\u2019d say, let\u2019s call it geopolitical issues that we\u2019re dealing with around the world that we thought that it would potentially have an impact on Q1 activity levels and that's really what\u2019s baked into our thinking.","David Raso","Well, I guess more directly. I\u2019m just trying to figure out. Is there something you're actually saying, meaning anything reflective of what we saw on September? Maybe the backlog that you have -- have a little more -- they are little bit further out than traditional. I\u2019m just trying understand how much is \u2013 again prudent understanding of some economic uncertainty right now versus something you're actually saying? That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to dig into.","Craig Arnold","Yes. No. I'd say that if you characterized the backlog there\u2019s really been nothing in terms of the characterization of the backlog whether that's in Electrical Systems & Services or hydraulics or the other businesses where we build backlog. The characterization and delivery timeframe of our backlog does not look significantly different than it looked historically.","David Raso","Okay. Now I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.","Steve Volkmann","Hi. Good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. So, just may be related to that. I mean, historically I guess when ESS orders start to ramp up and backlog stretches out a little bit there's an opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive with pricing. Can you just talk about what pricing looks like in your order book in ESS? And how much that might have some upside going forward?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I think the way we generally think about pricing in general, Steve, is that, as to me there are net positive or net negative as we tend to over time offset commodity driven cost increases with price in the marketplace. And I would say today the pricing environment overall on Electrical Systems & Services is better than it's been, better than it\u2019s been largely because of the level of economic activity overall has been better over the last 12 months or so. So, I'd say, as we think about price in general I wouldn't really think about it being a big contributor to pricing, but I think the overall environment today makes it a little bit easier as we think about negotiating with on large projects and with customers simply because from a capacity standpoint, in many cases we\u2019re sold out, our competitors have sold out lead-times and in some cases have pushed out. And so I do think the environment overall is a little better as a function of volume more than anything else in our factories.","Steve Volkmann","Okay. All right. Fair enough and maybe I\u2019ll ask only eMobility question. Obviously there's lots of platforms that are getting announced for the early 20s. Is it too early for you guys to have actually signed any contracts for any of those platforms? Or is that actually happening?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I'd say that, we have signed some contracts already. Most of what we signed to-date there\u2019s been relatively small, but I'd ask you to stay tune.","Steve Volkmann","I will stay tune. Thank you.","Donald Bullock","Next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeff Hammond","Hey, morning guys.","Craig Arnold","Hi.","Jeff Hammond","Hey. Just a couple of final point questions. One, your margins in EPG looked a little bit lighter on the incremental, any anything there to point out?","Richard Fearon","What I try to comment on that one, Jeff, appreciate the question, because as you mentioned margins were a little bit lighter than we anticipated as well. And this is largely a function of product mix. And as you think about that to be a very large segment and when you have some of the segments that have lower overall margins growing a little faster; lighting for example that tend to have an impact on your margins overall. But I'd say, overall absolutely nothing to worry about there. The margins in EP are at very high levels and as you saw our guidance going forward we feel very good about 2019.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. Then vehicle, looks like you\u2019re calling for the markets to be flat to up and yet organic decline is -- anything to read into that in terms of share shift? Or is that just the Cummins JV moving around?","Craig Arnold","Yes. It\u2019s really the Cummins JV. And it\u2019s another question I appreciate, Jeff, because there has been a little bit of confusion around the way the JV impact easting it. So as the JV increases, as the world continues to consume and move from more manual transmissions to automated transmissions that revenue ends up showing up in the joint venture as I mentioned that the JV revenues grew 45% in Q4. And so we obviously get piece of the profits, but you\u2019ll find it as we move forward the revenues for our business really have to be looked at, I\u2019d say, largely in combination with the joint venture. We really want to get a sense for how we\u2019re doing in the marketplace. But it\u2019s really that issue that is driving essentially the flat revenues.","Jeff Hammond","Okay, great. Thanks Craig.","Donald Bullock","Next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andy Casey","Good morning everybody.","Donald Bullock","Hi.","Andy Casey","Question on the margin outlook and price cost. Does that 2019 guide embed neutral price cost? You typically do that. And I\u2019m wondering because you probably going to have carryover pricing benefit that spills in the 2019. And you may see raw material cost decline as the year progresses?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I\u2019d say that what we generally do build in, Andy, to exactly your point is we build in neutral. And there\u2019s always a little bit of timing on the upside and downside depending upon what\u2019s happen with commodity prices. And so typically speaking as commodity increase environment we tend to be a quarter or two behind it. In a deflationary environment we tend to be maybe a quarter or so or two above it, but over the period of say, a 12 month period it kind of washes out to be neutral. And that\u2019s really what we baked into our plan.","Specifically as it relates to tariff and what we said in the Q3 earnings call was that we expect $110 million of headwind associated with tariffs. Since then the implementation had been delayed by two months. And so we think that number is now at $100 million, but our base assumption today still would assume that the tariffs -- the phase three tariffs moving from 10% to 25% go into effect and that our teams essentially go out and offset that with incremental price, but don't necessarily get a normal incremental margin on the additional tariff driven cost increases.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you, Craig. And then on that 4x impact, the 250 million for the year, is that heavily weighted to the first quarter?","Craig Arnold","Yes. It would be more heavily weighted towards the first quarter, just given where how currencies have performed during the course of 2018, that\u2019s be largely true.","Andy Casey","Okay. And does that weigh out in the margin for the first quarter at all?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I\u2019d say, not really. It really doesn't in terms of the margins itself and it really doesn't weigh on the margin. It certainly weighs on EPS for sure, but it really doesn't necessarily weigh on the margin rates.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you very much.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Mircea Dobre with Baird.","Mircea Dobre","Hi. Good morning guys. Going back to EP, maybe try and understand your growth guidance a little bit better. I'm trying to figure out exactly how you\u2019re thinking about getting to 4% to 5% growth. We really haven't seen order growth to that extend yet. Is this simply a factor of lighting no longer being a headwind and everything else pretty much staying the same or some other end market acceleration in there?","Richard Fearon","I think you kind of hit the nail on the head Mircea, with that one. As you think about what we talked about the course of 2018 where we've made some very specific decisions around our lighting business and walking away from business that wasn't profitable. And during the course of 2018 that business actually contracted some low to mid-single digits. And as we look forward that goes from a negative to a positive. And so that's really what's driving the big difference in the relative growth rate in our EP business.","Mircea Dobre","All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then back on vehicle you're expecting some margin expansion there even though obviously revenues not so much, so what exactly you generating that? And as you look maybe beyond 2019 presumably this businesses going to start see some volume deterioration. How do you plan on managing that?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I\u2019d say, one of things that we talk about is the fact that we set this joint venture up obviously with Cummins and we don't consolidate the revenue, but we obviously get half of the earnings until the JV we\u2019ll see revenue growth, our earnings growth in 2019 and that will obviously be -- will help us with margin expansion. And then I would say, more broadly, I mean, this is just a business and a management team that just done an outstanding job over decades of very efficiently running our business. And so operational improvements, efficiency improvements, cost out is something that we do extraordinarily well as a company and even better within our vehicle business. And so, we would fully expect that this business continues to operate at very high levels of margins even in the event of economic downturn of somewhat.","Mircea Dobre","Thanks.","Donald Bullock","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with BofA Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in.","Craig Arnold","Hi.","Andrew Obin","Just with economic cycle being so healthy and you guys executing well. How do you think about your capacity overall and North American capacity specifically, how do you deal with these high volumes?","Craig Arnold","I\u2019d say that, it\u2019s one of the reason, Andrew, I appreciate the question that our incremental rates as we provided our guidance in 2019 are perhaps a little bit less than what we experience in 2018, but we are having to make some investments in a lot of our businesses that are running at very high levels whether that\u2019s Electrical Systems &Services, whether it\u2019s in Aerospace. We made some really big investments in hydraulics during the course of 2018. And so we are having to reinvest in capacity expansion in many of our businesses that are running at very high levels. And so I think that's really the way you deal with. You spend the dollars and you make the investments and in some cases you look at your business models as well around what you invest and what you rely upon your supply base to do, but by and large we are making investments to expand our capacity.","Andrew Obin","And are you\u2019ll be thinking your global footprint? I mean, the ratio where you investing that\u2019s what I mean?","Craig Arnold","No. What we always try to do is really manufacturing zone of currency. And so we try to minimize the amount of goods that we ship around the world. And so what we today sell in Europe we largely make in Europe and what we today sell in Asia we largely produce in Asian. And so, from a footprint standpoint there was a lot of work that we've done over, say, the last 15 to 20 years around making sure that we have manufacturing capability and facilities in the right regions of the world. Most of that work is largely done. And so today it's really expanding where we need to in those regions of the world where we have capacity constraints.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up if I can. What\u2019s your cadence in China through the year what are you expecting?","Craig Arnold","I\u2019m sorry, your cadence around\u2026","Andrew Obin","Oh, just cadence of revenue growth in China in 2019 through the year seasonality how you want to address it? Thank you.","Craig Arnold","Yes. I\u2019d have to probably go, take a look at that question specifically as it relates to China. I don't have that level of detail in front of me. But I would say that in general what our belief is that the Chinese government will likely stimulate at some point we saw as you saw as well, the significant slowdown in the economy in Q4 specifically highlighted by what took place in the light vehicle markets which were down some 16%. So we believe and I think it\u2019s largely belief that the Chinese government will stimulate at some point during the course of the year. So we do think that the second half of the year is stronger than the first half. But beyond that it\u2019s difficult to really estimate at this point.","Andrew Obin","Thank you very much.","Donald Bullock","At this point in time we\u2019ll have time for one last question, Rob McCarthy with Stephens.","Rob McCarthy","Thanks for fitting me in for the buzz. Can you hear me?","Craig Arnold","Yes.","Rob McCarthy","Sure. Two questions. One just on oil and gas, how do you think about your exposure there given the fact that you\u2019ve seen the experience not only explicit oil and gas exposure but the implied bleeding of that oil and gas exposure into your industrial business. How do we think about the outer bound of that as we kind of think about your portfolio going forward and assessing the risk of what could be a continued downdraft year?","Craig Arnold","Yes. I appreciate the question Rob, especially given what I think we all experienced during the last kind of cyclically downturn in oil and gas market. And I\u2019d say, the first thing I just remind the group that we tend to be more downstream focus and we are upstream focus. So it has a much longer cycle. We saw a little bit pull back in oil prices in the fourth quarter, but they came rebounding in December. And I would say, by and large our business performed well through Q4 and we\u2019ve not really seen today any let\u2019s say significant changes in our business in terms of the outlook.","The rig count actually for 2018, that actually ended up some 20% for the year when you compare the year overall. And so we think that oil and gas is always a bit of a wild card and tough to predict exactly where it\u2019s going, but given that we\u2019re really coming off of, let\u2019s call it a three or four year pretty significant downdraft in oil and gas market and we\u2019ve just got our legs underneath us that we think oil and gas holds up over next number of years. It\u2019s difficult for say for certain, but I think our base case would be that we don\u2019t see a significant retrenchment in capital spending round oil and gas.","Rob McCarthy","I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Craig Arnold","Thank you.","Donald Bullock","With that, ladies and gentlemen we\u2019re going to wrap up the call. As always we\u2019ll be available for follow-up and questions following the call. Thank you."],"7937":["Eaton Corp.

At this time all participant lines are in a listen only mode, and later there'll be an opportunity for questions.","As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded, and I'll now turn the floor over to Don Bullock.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's second quarter 2015 earnings call. With me today are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Sandy highlighting the performance in the second quarter along with our outlook for the remainder of 2015.","As we've done on our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Sandy's comment. The press release from today's earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation do include reconciliation to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. Before we get started with Sandy's comments, I'd like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the company and as such, are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those in the forecast due to a number of risk factors and uncertainties that we've outlined in our earnings release and in the presentation. They're also covered in the 8-K.","With that, I'll turn it over to Sandy for his comments.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, Don, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm going to work from the earnings presentation which is posted on our investor page. But before I start through that packet, let me share a couple of overall comments.","Our second quarter results we believe were solid and they're really highlighted by the very strong segment margins and terrific enterprise-wide cost control which allowed us to offset the originally higher \u2013 offset the what we had originally anticipated in terms of slightly higher volumes. You'll recall at the end of the first quarter, we had said that, when we looked into the second quarter, our guidance was based upon that volumes would step up about 4% from the first quarter to the second quarter, and in fact, they increased only about 3%.","And in that guidance at the end of the first quarter, you may recall we had anticipated that the volumes on our Electrical business would then increase slightly further for the balance of the year beyond the second quarter, while we anticipated revenues in the Hydraulics, Aerospace and Vehicle businesses being pretty flat for the remainder of the year. That would be the second, third and fourth quarters.","Well as you saw from our earnings packet, our bookings in the second quarter were disappointing in our Electrical, Hydraulics and Aerospace businesses, and as a result, we believe it reduces the likelihood of more robust revenue growth in the second half. And I'm talking here about revenue again, because there is a time difference between when we book orders and when we ship them.","So in this context, we think that we're in an environment where cost control, operational excellence and structural cost reduction are really critical. And that has to be coupled with operational focus on cash generation, and use of the balance sheet, and therefore, really re-deploying how you utilize your cash. And it's in that context that really we're sharing two additional pieces of information beyond our traditional earnings release.","The first is this $145 million restructuring program we've announced today, and it is aimed at structural, not variable cost reduction. It involves elimination of positions, closing of a limited number of facilities, consolidation of internal organizations, and frankly, elimination on a permanent basis of some activities within the company. This is not, I would say again, it is not a variable cost reduction exercise. This is a program aimed at reducing structural costs across the company in anticipation of markets not showing substantially stronger growth in the second half, nor next year.","The restructuring program is going to provide a very strong payback in 2016, and that'll occur both in terms of segment margins, which you continue to see are focus on increasing segment margins, and in reducing our corporate expenses. All of this on the order of about a $130 million benefit year-to-year between 2015 and 2016. And I'll go through that in a little bit more detail as we go into the individual charts.","That with the additional Cooper incremental synergies of $115 million, and that's no change in terms of the incremental numbers, so we feel are appropriate for 2016 versus 2015, will together deliver about a $0.45 benefit in 2016 versus 2015.","The second announcement that we're sharing with you today is the next phase in our cash redeployment strategy, and it's clearly more of a recognition of the progress we've made in repaying the acquisition debt we incurred as part of the acquisition of the Cooper industries, and a couple highlights.","Now we're targeting an A- long-term credit rating, and that is a change for us. And that really is centered then around allowing us to return 4% to 5% annually to our shareholders through maintaining a commitment to a strong dividend, and then repurchasing shares, and that starts here in the second half of this year, as well as every year going forward. And then as a third priority, undertaking value creating M&A, if we see the right opportunities, and if we see the right pricing to really create value.","And with that, let me turn to our traditional earnings packet. And if you'll turn to page three, it's the page that is titled Highlights of Second Quarter Results. I commented on most of these already. Again we think a solid high-quality quarter. Operating earnings per share of $1.16 versus consensus of $1.13, obviously the midpoint of our guidance of $1.15. And as I said before, the real highlights here are margins which were 0.2 of a point higher than what we had guided you to. You may recall we had said that we expected our segment margins to be 15.6%, one point higher than the first quarter. They actually came in at 15.8%, so 120 basis points higher. Really good enterprise cost control, and you see that not only in the margins been better, but you also see it in our corporate expenses being down $0.03.","Volume was down some 7%, and obviously within that was an organic revenue decline of 1% excluding the Forex impact of almost 8%. If you turn to the next chart, this chart, four. I think you have had the chance to review our financials already. Really only one number that I would point out beyond what you can read here yourself is obviously our sales did move up 3% from $5.2 billion to $5.372 in this quarter. And the $5.2 was in the first quarter. But if you go back to our first quarter conference call, you recall that our organic growth in the first quarter was 1% positive, now 1% negative and obviously, that's part of the concern that led us to kick off this comprehensive restructuring program.","If we move to the next chart, chart five, titled Electrical Products Segment, revenue is down 3% from a year ago, up 6% from the first quarter. So revenue is pretty much in line with what we'd been anticipating for this quarter. Operating margins of 15.8%. Frankly a little disappointing from where we hoped they might be. Really three key issues within that. One, we continue to experience some embedded exchange problems. That takes about $13 million out of the margins this quarter. And frankly, this hasn't been a marketplace where you're able to really announce significant price increases to offset embedded exchange issues.","We did get the targeted $11 million of Cooper cost synergies in this segment in the quarter. But then the same issue we talked about in the first quarter is still with us, very strong growth in our lighting business which has a slightly lower incremental. And then weakness, and I'll come back and talk about this more broadly, on the industrial MRO, kind of industrial production demand. I think you're hearing from a number of players in multiple markets that that industrial side of the marketplace continues to be weaker than we'd hoped it might be this year.","Bookings continue to be a good story, up 4%; frankly up about 50% more than that in the Americas. So continue to do very well in the Americas. That continues to be the region that is stronger for us. More flattish conditions as you get to Europe and Asia-Pacific.","And as I mentioned, the strength in the marketplace is really in the lighting area, it's in residential, and it's in selective parts of the non-residential construction market, and I'll come back and chat a little bit more about that in just a minute.","If we move to the second chart, Electrical Systems & Services segment, obviously we think a very good quarter in terms of margin performance, really outstanding margins of 15.1%. Again, baked in there is also about $11 million of Cooper synergies, so overall about $22 million in the quarter between the two of them.","If you look at the volumes, you see down 8%. Obviously four points of that, if you look in the green chart in the lower left-hand corner of that, was due to ForEx. And if you remember, this is a segment that as we've talked with you, say look at the bookings in the previous couple of quarters to get a feel for what is likely to happen to shipments in the successive quarter. You may recall that in the first quarter, our bookings were flat; in the fourth quarter 2014 they were flat. And so we're obviously not seeing a lot of strength in the collection of businesses that are within this segment currently.","Once again, in the bookings area, you saw a weak quarter. Just not seeing the array of large projects in this business. We see the power systems business being weaker, the three phase power quality market having been weaker. This is the business at Crouse, at Crouse-Hinds, which does have an oil and gas exposure then as well. So in spite of these weaker volumes, we're really very, very pleased, obviously, with the margin performance in this segment.","If we turn to page seven, this is titled Hydraulics Segment. I think the story's quite similar to that which we've been sharing with you. Obviously, organic growth of negative 11%, which you see in the lower left-hand corner, green box. It was negative 9% last quarter, so continuing to see weak year-on-year comparisons here.","The volume was down just roughly 3% from the first quarter as you see, down 18% from a year ago. Clearly, this is the business where we're suffering the most adverse business conditions in the company, which fortunately are being offset by some very strong results in other segments. We're pleased with the margin performance here, 11.7%. That was up from 10.1% in the first quarter. So all the extensive work that's been going on in this franchise to get at cost levels and get our resources aligned for the kind of volumes that we're dealing with, I think, are being successful.","If we look at bookings, bookings were down some 13%, and they're down both on the OEM side as well as the distributor side. And I would say, the only notable area going on within all those different bookings is we did see ag bookings begin to level out. Whereas you recall the last several quarters, we've seen a fairly dramatic reduction from our major agricultural OEMs.","We do think that by the time we complete the restructuring program, and I'll come back to talk about that in just a couple charts, that it may well push margins in this segment below 10% in the third quarter. But we would expect them to rebound in the fourth quarter. As you'll hear when I detail the restructuring program, our guidance by segment at the present time for the balance of the year does not include the impact of the restructuring costs. It will reduce overall margins for all five of the segments together by about 0.3 of a point for the full year. And again, I'll come back and clarify that when we get to that chart.","If we move to the next chart, chart eight, the Aerospace segment, fairly flattish volumes versus the first quarter, down 2%. Our organic growth was down 2% this particular quarter, but as you'll see in the note that we reflect it both in our earnings release as well is in the yellow colored box on this chart. We did receive some payments in the second quarter last year for nonrecurring engineering programs, so reimbursements from customers.","If you take that out, you really get an organic growth that is fairly similar to what we're seeing across the industry of about 3% currently. We're very pleased with the terrific margins achieved in this business here. Again, a reflection, we think, of great operational management, really effective program management, and the fact that the aftermarket bookings, which had trended up over the last several quarters, began to materialize in shipments, giving us obviously a little bit more favorable mix there.","On the bookings side, down roughly 9%. Maybe three elements to keep in mind there. The commercial side is continuing much as we've seen, up roughly 4%. Military was down just over 30% in this particular quarter. Part of that's timing. And then the aftermarket was not as strong a quarter this quarter, down 5% overall. So sort of a mixed picture on the aerospace bookings side.","And then on the Vehicle segment, that's chart nine, really a terrific quarter in our Vehicle business. Volumes up 4% from the first quarter, down 4% from last year. But if you look in the green box in the lower left-hand corner, you'll see continued strong organic growth of 4% this quarter. It was also 4% last quarter. So very strong production \u2013 or results. And those 19.2% margins clearly have to be regarded as outstanding margins. We had a lot of things go right for us, but frankly, our team made a lot of things go right in this quarter, so, really proud of their achievements.","From a market point of view, Class 8 number, but we continue to think the build will be around 330,000 units here in North America this year. It is \u2013 the highest quarter of the year, we think, did occur in the second quarter. And our view of the remainder of the year is that while we were at about 89,000 units for industry production in the second quarter, it's likely to be on the order of 82,000 and then 80,000 as we go through the balance of this year.","And then on the South American vehicle market, I think you hear from us, and you're hearing from many others, we just don't see any recovery occurring in that marketplace during this year.","So if we turn now to some broader indices around the company, let's go to chart 10. We did reduce our organic revenue growth this year. And as you recall, we, in April, had shared with you our view that it would be up 2% to 3%. We now think 0% to 1%. Frankly the biggest change took place here in the hydraulics market where we now think the organic growth was in the order of a negative 6% to negative 8% where we thought it might be negative 2% to negative 4%. Anticipating a question, when does this stop the fall? We've obviously got to start to see bookings start to stabilize, and at this point, we have not seen that occur yet. We believe this is our best estimate of where this market will end this year, but clearly if you're watching many of our OEMs' customers' results, you're seeing they're continuing to talk about very weak economic conditions.","This overall mixed global economic environment that is laid out by our ability only to grow 0% to 1%, again is the reason we decided we needed to take further structural cost out of the company. And we think that puts us in a very good position then to be able to produce year-to-year earnings gains in 2016 over 2015.","If we move to chart 11, the next chart, it's labeled Segment Margin Expectations. Again, if you look down this overall chart, this set of guidance for the individual segments is being provided, excluding the impact of this 2015 restructuring program we just announced. Until we have the opportunity, and we'll be doing this over the next couple weeks, to fully share in our internal communications each of the actions we're undertaking, we're not prepared to share how much of the cost or how much of the benefit will drop into each of the segments. We'll obviously do so in our next earnings result, just as we have in the past after we've completed making those types of announcements.","If you look on this chart, the three segments that have changed, the electrical products margin change, really two issues driving that. This issue of embedded exchange which has been stubborn for us with the Canadian piece being one of the big pieces of that, and then the mix that I talked about of less industrial market activity, and then higher lighting activity. In the Electrical Systems & Services, it's just the slow bookings basically. And in Vehicle, the move up is just really great execution out of our team in that particular area.","If we move to the next chart, chart 12, maybe a couple of the highlights for the restructuring program which we've announced today. Once again, structural, not variable cost reduction. To complete this chart and anticipate a question, we spent about $15 million in the first half of this year in terms of our restructuring cost. So the total for 2015 will be this $120 million you see on the top line of this chart in the third column, plus the $15 million we spent in the first half, so a total of $135 million. This particular program which we're announcing here has about $145 million as you can see. It's spread across the third and fourth quarter this year and then about $25 million will extend into next year.","Of the savings versus the $120 million of cost this year will be about $45 million. A lot of these actions we're taking have fairly immediate payback, for a net negative this year of about $75 million. So when you think about our guidance reduction that was in our earnings release today of roughly 6%, roughly 3 points of those 6 points comes from this proactive program to address structural costs and give us a running start on 2016.","Then, if you were to look at the year-to-year numbers just to help you understand those for a moment. It's our belief that we will always have restructuring in any given year. In these types of slower times, slower growth times, we think an appropriate planning number in that regard is $50 million to $60 million of restructuring, so we're not suggesting that restructuring would go away next year. In fact we think it has to be a part of the portrait every year in these kind of conditions.","So the way to think about the year-to-year benefit is there's an $80 million incremental savings in 2016 on top of the $45 million of savings this year. So that's the first $80 million plus for next year. And then we would have spent $135 million on restructuring this year. That was the total of the $120 million in the second half and the $15 million in the first half. We will spend $25 million on this program next year, so $135 million minus $25 million, then minus \u2013 if I took the high end of our range of the $50 million to $60 million range, that would be a difference of $50 million of less restructuring next year spent. So you get to $130 million by adding the $80 million incremental savings and the $50 million less restructuring expense, that's an incremental $130 million.","If we move to the next chart, chart 13, operating EPS guidance, I think we've covered a number of these items but as we think about our third quarter, our guidance for operating earnings per share is $1.10 to \u2013 excuse me, $1.00 to $1.10, midpoint $1.05. We anticipate organic revenue will move up about 2% to 3% from the second-quarter. That's fairly typical for us and it looks reasonable to us at this point. Tax rate between 9% and 10%. The guidance does incorporate the restructuring charge and the savings, so this net impact, as you see here. And as we think about margins in the third quarter, net of this restructuring expense, we think margins would be around 15% in total. And then as we get to the fourth quarter, we think they'll be just over 16% and our best estimate on volumes at this point is the fourth quarter volumes will probably look a lot like the third quarter, so no real substantial change. But once again then, when you look at the full year, the $4.40 to $4.60 which is a reduction of $0.30 from our previous guidance, $0.15 of that $0.30 change has to do with the restructuring programs which we just discussed.","If we move to chart 14, labeled 2015 Outlook Summary, just, we've tried to provide you here with kind of a summary of our guidance as we go through this year. I would call to your attention in the right-hand box labeled July, that is in the gray color, just a couple numbers that we haven't talked about yet. Obviously, you saw that we had lowered our corporate expense in the first quarter; we lowered it further in the second quarter. And if we look at the full year this year, we now expect our pension, interest and general corporate expenses to be $10 million to $30 million below 2014 levels. It really reflects, I think, a great symmetry with what's going on in every one of our businesses as we're working really hard on cost control in this kind of environment.","I would also \u2013 if you look to this chart on the very last number in the lower right-hand corner, you'll see that we've reduced our CapEx spending this year by $100 million. That allows us to, with this lower activity level, only have our free cash flow decline by about $200 million this year.","Now let me turn to the second subject that I briefly previewed which is our capital allocation strategy. If you turn to chart 15, it's the chart labeled Our Capital Allocation Strategy Has Changed Over Time. What we tried to lay out here was three different time periods in terms of what we were doing with our capital. Obviously in this period of 2000 to 2012, we were undertaking a fairly fundamental portfolio transformation of the company. We divested some businesses, we acquired some 66 businesses. And as you can see the preponderance of our capital was flowing into the new businesses as we built a different portfolio for the company. Obviously we acquired Cooper at the end of 2012. We took on $4.9 billion of acquisition debt. We made a commitment to repay $2.1 billion of that and I think we would characterize this period of 2013 to 2015 as one of repaying debt while still expanding our dividend at very attractive levels but clearly we curtailed and virtually withdrew from the M&A markets in that time period.","Now having repaid roughly $400 million of debt in the first half this year, with the prospect of we have a payment of $600 million in the second half of this year, so repaying $1 billion of debt this year, we're now really ready to be looking at what do we do in these next several years in terms of capital. And I think what you see here in the chart, and I'll detail it more a little bit on the second page, is a more balanced approach to what we would be doing with capital going forward. And so you can see there's a continued commitment obviously to maintaining (24:10-24:11) to grow the company to continue to have a very strong return of value to shareholders obviously through both repurchase and a strong dividend program but we do reenter, or anticipate reentering the acquisition market.","So if we go to the next chart, chart 16 which is labeled Summary of Future Capital Allocation Plans. A couple key points; we're comfortable maintaining our A- long-term debt rating instead of pushing in the short term to get back to an A. That allows us some flexibility in really starting to utilize capital for other purposes on a little bit of an accelerated basis. And really the key element I think off this entire chart is, we intend to use dividends and share repurchase to return between 4% to 5% of our market cap to shareholders on an annual basis. Historically, we have been a more opportunistic purchaser of shares. We still plan on doing that opportunistically so we're not scheduling it by individual month or by individual quarter, but we are making the commitment that we will be returning to shareholders 4% to 5% of our market cap on an annual basis. And we think that's an important part of our shareholder value strategy going forward, particularly in these periods of times.","Then for the balance of the capital, we'd intend to pursue M&A to continue to advance our business strategies. And as you kind of tie all of this into where we are here at the middle of 2015, we do plan on repurchases in the second half of 2015. And we'll feather that along with the $600 million debt repayment we have in November. And then I think it's reasonable to believe that share repurchases would then accelerate further into 2016 as more capital becomes available. So while some of that may feel a little anticlimactic versus what a couple of you had speculated on in various different pieces of research, I think the big headline here is annual return to shareholders of 4% to 5% through dividend and through repurchase.","If we then turn to chart 17, I think we've touched on most of these. That obviously organic growth has been slower; it's been disappointing for us this year. We think the appropriate response to that is take cost out, restructure in terms of corporation, continue the focus on cost containment and margin improvement. That is why we've implemented this restructuring program. After we pay down this debt, we really are in a position to again, to be able to actuate this capital allocation program that I mentioned to you. And then again, our lower midpoint in terms of $0.30 operating earnings per share lower midpoint, 50% of that or $0.15 of the $0.30 change really comes from the restructuring plan which we think lays an attractive foundation for 2016.","If then if we move simply to chart 18, the initial thoughts, it's labelled Initial Thoughts on 2016. We do feel that this program is one that will create real value for us. We think this $50 million to $60 million restructuring level is a level that's appropriate for a company of our size during relatively slow incremental growth. The Cooper integration incremental savings, those decisions are largely completed now, and the biggest portion of what we'll finance, the additional cost savings portion of this next year will be the finishing up of the plant programs and they're very much on schedule at this point. Then I spoke to the cash deployment and strategy.","So hopefully that gives you a feel within the specifics within the overall comments I shared with you up front. Again, we think cost control, operational excellence, cash generation and then cash deployment, particularly on the share buyback as well as a strong dividend are the real priorities for us at this time.","Don, with that, I'll turn things back to you.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. Operator will give the instructions for the question and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our first question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Steve.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Just a couple of questions. First, in terms of the acceleration that you're expecting, the 2% to 3% in Q3 relative to the down 1% in 2, and tough in Q1 and then the bookings deceleration. So where should investors count on that acceleration to take place?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Again, I would say 2% to 3% is not a big number to start with.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","It's all relative.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","That's third quarter versus second quarter.","Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer","It's from Q2 to Q3, sorry. Don't confuse that, Steve, with year-over-year.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right. Okay. Okay, but where is the acceleration that you're \u2013 the 2% to 3% is just a sequential increase?","Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer","Yeah. That's correct.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","What's your year-on-year?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Boy, I'd have to go look because you've got ForEx differences and all and that's why we focused on the \u2013 we gave our guidance for the second quarter based off the first quarter as well, and that's the same way we're providing this because the ForEx gets to be pretty confusing when you start to look at that year-to-year.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, so, but basically you're just telling us that it's normal seasonality.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Correct.","Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer","Yes.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And no acceleration?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","No. I think, Steve, I think there is an element I think where there is some conflicting data out there generally, and others may have the same question and that would be in the U.S. nonresidential market. Because you did see, I think everyone saw the ABI index came out at 55 last month. Many people regard that as a predictor of the commercial side of nonresidential and that you may see the commercial side start to strengthen through here. You know that we use an index for nonresidential that also includes oil and gas and mining. Some do not do that. And so we do think you're going to see the nonresidential market for this year that doesn't include oil and mining probably go up between 4% and 5%.","By the time you put in an anticipated 25% reduction in the oil and gas markets, those numbers become closer to 1%. So you may hear some very different numbers quoted by different people. It has a lot to do with what they include in their index. We do think the small project side has strengthened a little bit. But we don't see that this is an 8% to 9% nonresidential year not including oil and gas. Our view is that you do see ABI bounce around a little bit month-to-month. We too are encouraged but we really would like to see those orders getting placed and that wasn't our experience in the second quarter.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right. And when you talk about initial thoughts on 2016 and expecting continued slow market growth, you're talking about growth that's consistent with where you're exiting 2015. Is that correct?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we haven't put a specific number on it next year but it just, it feels like we're still in this global GDP condition that is similar to the full year this year. And as we look forward at this point, without putting a specific forecast on it, if you continue to see the U.S. grow kind of at rates like they are now and Europe more or less like it is, it's hard to point to other major economies that are going to accelerate. There are questions, obviously, in China. Everyone's got their own view of that. India is perhaps the one area that is accelerating but it doesn't have that big an effect on global GDP. And so it feels to us more like we're in a period of rather prolonged slower growth. And that's why we felt the right proactive action here is get structural cost out so that we can continue to grow EPS even if markets stay relatively slow.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And that's at that normal 25% or 26% incremental margins that you would usually use or...","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We used 20% in our guidance this year. We haven't put a number on it next year, but I do think what you heard from us, obviously, is we think there's two big propellants of earning growth next year, the $130 million year-to-year that comes out of the additional savings for our restructuring plan and then lower restructuring plus Cooper. So we've got two big pluses going into next year.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right. But excluding those, it's in that same 20% range.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think at this point it's a good number. We'll be able to tune it when we get into this fall.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And just lastly on the buyback, the 1% to 2% programmatic buyback, why not think about that in terms of a larger number, at least given where the stock has been earlier in that period, (33:17), or how are you thinking about that, Sandy?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","And I think the way \u2013 and thanks for the question because it's one I think that's important to everyone who's a shareholder, is that at these kind of price levels, clearly our preference, or first priority is the share buyback. And so we always tune these things to kind of the value of our stock vis-\u00e0-vis what we can create in terms of value of the \u2013 with an acquisition. And that's why when I stated my kind of summary at the beginning, I said our priority is a commitment to maintaining a strong dividend. It's repurchasing shares both in the second half of this year and each year going forward and then, as a third priority, undertaking value-creating M&A.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So Sandy or Rick, I think the product margins obviously, Sandy, you mentioned that they were disappointing and you talked about the impact of the exchange problems and the inability to price against that. I'm wondering what actually improves in the second half of the year to get us from a 15% handle into an 18% handle for the back half of the year.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say a couple things. One, a slight volume increase because these are products that have attractive margins on them.","Our embedded is getting less as we're going \u2013 change is getting less as we're going through the year.","And then third is, normally our peaks occur in the third quarter. And so that we would expect to have that kind of strong seasonal lift that has to do with some of the mix that occurs within the business. I'd say those are the three main items, because we'll continue to get synergy savings, but that's in both segments and in products.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So it's richer mix combined with a waning FX headwind. Okay. Yep, yep. That's pretty clear. And then on Hydraulics, obviously you've taken another bite out of that one, but I'm wondering, is the down 6% to 8% enough given the order numbers? And if I run the numbers through my model, it implies that sales seem to stabilize at 2Q levels. And I'm wondering, normally we see sales down sequentially in 3Q and 4Q. So I'm wondering, is that appropriate given the fact that you mentioned that orders haven't stabilized yet?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Nigel, I think it's a very reasonable question. This has been a challenging one for us to get as well. So I'm not going to stand on a pulpit and tell you we know this one to a decimal point. Clearly we're spending a lot of time with our customers really trying to understand their order patterns and their degree of visibility. We were slightly encouraged that the ag piece, at least for a quarter, appeared to bottom. I'd like to see that for a few more quarters. We're not seeing that turnaround yet in global construction.","And clearly the oil and gas side still is pretty tough in this area, because we're more exposed to fracking type of oil and gas here than we are in electrical. And clearly it's been pretty flattened, if you will. So our assumption is that we're going to be able to operate it at relatively similar volumes here for the balance of the year, but it's one that I wish we had a little bit better visibility to as well.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's fair enough. And then one final one, if I can. You've given us some good framework for 2016 in some of the non-operating items. One more might be pension and I'm kind of just talking about pension tailwind in 2016. And I'm wondering, do you have the data point if you snap the line today on pension? What would that tailwind be for 2016?","Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer","Well, Nigel, I'll jump in. It's a little bit hard this early in the year to make an estimate, because it does very much depend upon the discount rate. And the discount rate is, depending on Fed action over the next several months, may well change. I will tell you just to give you a couple of data points, we did end the second quarter at 88% funded in our U.S. plan, so pretty nice level of funding. And that is a help, of course, as you look at expense for next year. So modestly optimistic signs about lower expense next year, but it's really too early to make a precise forecast.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. First, maybe, Sandy, you could give us some color on your outlook for the remainder of the year, maybe into next year but break out Electrical Products versus Electrical Systems & Services.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, see I think that when you get within, let me just start on Electrical Systems & Services, because there are a number of different businesses within that. And if we think about our view of markets as to what's going on, we continue to see on the utility side that that's a pretty flattish market at this point. I think you're hearing fairly similar numbers from, and I'm not talking about the transmission side. I'm talking about primarily the distribution side here. And I think you're hearing those from others.","On the harsh and hazardous sides of the market, and not all of our Crouse-Hinds business is harsh and hazardous, but that portion which is really in and around oil and gas, we continue to think oil and gas is like a negative 25 marketplace. That's very much where we started off the year. Industrial, we think really two very different things going on with industrial. There are some very, very large industrial projects going on. Those tend to be around liquid gas. Some of these projects are some of the biggest projects that have been seen in the U.S. in many, many years. But all the electrical for them has not yet been awarded. So you're seeing some of these projects show up in big construction put in place numbers, but the actual awards haven't been made yet. And so we think the numbers are getting pushed around. So I'd say on the very, very big projects, there are a couple of really big ones.","But then if you get to the industrial MRO and the machine builder, that's where we describe the industrial malaise is still very much in place and seeing markets, individual segments kind of 0% to 1% in those areas. So that's one of the areas that has caused us some mix issues this year. Resi continues to be quite attractive, kind of 6% to 8%. We see that continuing. There've been some individual months of up and down. On non-resi, we would agree with others who say the commercial side of non-resi is kind of growing in those mid-single digit numbers, but the oil and gas and mining side which does affect construction, obviously as well, we think is at negative 25.","So that's kind of our view with what's been going on in the nonresidential markets and also why you're starting to see some different numbers being quoted in terms of the industrial markets. It really depends whether people are in MRO or are they in machine building or are they in major industrial construction. And I'd say the data center markets, the data center markets overall are probably growing in terms of electrical content several percent, say 2% to 3%. I'm talking about the big data centers. But it's different depending upon whether you're selling UPS or whether you're selling power distribution equipment. The UPS is probably slightly negative and then the power distribution, because the size of these centers is getting bigger and the power consumption's getting bigger, is probably on the order of a plus 5%. So that hopefully gives you kind of a quick feel for, within the electrical businesses kind of how we're seeing those individual markets.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Wow, yeah. Good color, Sandy, because I was just curious about the very large manufacturing infrastructure build that's going on and whether you'd seen any orders in that sector yet. But are those orders on the up-and-coming, you think, into 2016? They just lag the actual construction? Is that the way we should think about it?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well I think two things, and thanks for the follow-up, because it's very much on point, is that some of those have been awarded. The largest portion of them have not yet been awarded, but then the second issue is that even if they're awarded in the third quarter, those very big projects may be nine months to a year or a little longer before they get shipped. So those big projects will not have an impact upon 2015 shipments. There'll be much more of an issue of middle of or second half of 2016.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up then on the restructuring. Could you at least \u2013 I know you're not willing to give us guidance by segment, and I appreciate that. Could you give us some feel for what percent of the cost in savings will be in the segment line items and what percent you think might be in the corporate line item? Could you break it down that way for us?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, the segments themselves will \u2013 it's about three-tenths of 1% is how that net of cost and benefits this year will reduce segment profits this year. I think on the corporate side, it'll be largely self-liquidating this year, that the benefits will offset the costs. And so I think that's about where to think about it for this year.","Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer","Well, essentially, Ann, all of the net cost will end up in the segments given that the corporate is basically neutral after the savings.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yup.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Eli.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Let me get some clarification. Sandy, during your presentation you gave us $130 million savings and restructuring $115 from Cooper. That was a net $0.45 for 2016. That excludes the ongoing $50 million to $60 million restructuring costs, is that how you're looking at that?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yes. It does exclude it because in that calculation, I netted the restructuring of next year plus the $25 million against the restructuring this year. So that is a net-net number. Correct.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. And the reason you have restructuring that impacts the segment which is typically \u2013 we've always been Xing them out in some form \u2013 this is plant disruptions and plant closings and stuff that really affects operations that you can't exclude and that because it affects the business. Is that the reason why we have to include it in that business?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, our restructuring costs we've always included right in the segments. We don't break them out in our financials. It's only the acquisition integration charges that we break out separately. So this runs right through our operating costs.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Okay. And one other clarification. The $48 million in corporate costs is down, like, $15 million or something like that. Is that the new run rate for the rest of the year or does it go back up to $60 million plus, or...","Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer","If you look at the guidance we've given, Eli, we think it'll go up a little bit and that's consistent with the \u2013 we gave you guidance on corporate pension interest and general corp going down $10 million to $30 million. But it will still be a run rate that is better than \u2013 it's certainly better than last year, and frankly, a little bit better than the first quarter.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Going back to the question that Ann had on electrical businesses, you gave us the breakdown. Is it basically the Electrical Products organic growth at probably 2% or 3% positive, and Electrical Systems & Services is like -3% organic growth or so? Is that the best way to look at those two businesses as you look out for the year?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Boy, we'd have to break that for you once more, because we try to really provide that guidance together because they're a little difficult, the markets going forward to bust them apart, but the products will be higher obviously than the segment, and we would think that the markets in electrical S&S will be negative, slightly negative this year, whereas Electrical Products will be slightly positive. I think that's not a bad way to think about it, Eli.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And then my final question, in hydraulics you kept the margin forecast the same, but with the lower volume and the uncertainties have you, is that actions you've already taken that give you confidence that the margins will stay \u2013 will actually improve in the second half of the year to get you into that range, or...","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we were pleased with our margins in the second quarter and I think it reflects the traction of the team really working very hard on that, and with the additional actions we'll be taking, that's what gives us our best shot is we think this is about where they'll settle for the year.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yep. Thanks, Eli.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. I'll keep the questions brief. Firstly just on, you talked about the need for a corporation to react to an ongoing low growth environment and the restructuring is obviously part of that. I just wondered how you could talk about the portfolio in that same light around dealing with low growth. I think you talked about cutting some activities at the very beginning. Also obviously, the balance sheet is now available to use for M&A. So maybe talk about the portfolio in the context of low growth.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'd say that I think our thinking there is A, number one, it's about the cost control, operational excellence, and cash generation. So I think those are the three upfront pieces. I think we were fairly clear this morning that we see in terms of the discretionary use of cash, the first calls are the dividend and share re-buyback. And so in that context, I would then say, what are we then going to do in terms of continuing review of portfolio. And that is an ongoing activity we have within the company. Some of the things that we will discontinue in the company in terms of individual activities will be areas where we feel we're not creating value. So no portfolio transformation announcements to make, but I'd say we're working on that tuning as part of this as well.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And then just circling back to Electrical Products, EBIT, if we just \u2013 I realize quarters, different things move around. But if we just look at the first half overall for the Electrical Products group, sales were down about $80 million, EBIT's down about $40 million. And I think that FX translation and transaction as well as Cooper synergies net off against each other, they're $20 million, $25 million each for the half. So maybe just try and explain exactly what is going on in Electrical Products. Is it something about pricing? I realize there's a slight mix hit from lighting, but that shouldn't be big enough to cause a 50% incremental margin.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","It's two issues on the mix. You correctly note the lighting, but equally, or more powerful is the fact that the industrial MRO activity is very weak and those products carry significantly higher margins than the average, nor lighting, which lighting being below the average. Those are the big ones that really hit it.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning everyone.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah I guess, Sandy, kind of dovetailing off some of the others' comments, and you might not be able to answer this question, but clearly you're battening the hatches in terms of the incremental restructuring, the cut, the 20% cut to CapEx. When did you kind of arrive at this? And did it change your overall conveyance of what capital your capital allocation plan was? Obviously not in terms of details because you can't share that, but just in terms of substance and philosophy, do you think it changed over the past 45 days?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I think a number of people, as we've listened to other calls too, have asked the question about momentum during the quarter and I think this sort of gets to that subject as well. And I'd say the big momentum change in the quarter was that I think some parties came out of the first quarter encouraged with the relative strength in March versus the strength in January and February. We cautioned not to get overly enthused about March because in many ways we thought March was a recovery for a very poor January and February.","We saw April come out feeling very much in line with what our caution had been, that it didn't continue the very strong surge that we had seen in the month of March and May was a fairly weak month in terms of bookings. And we've seen that across the industries we participate in. I think with that view that the economy did not feel like it was accelerating, there's a fair amount of choppy economic data that's been coming in from around the world. That's what really \u2013 and then obviously watching our own bookings, led us to believe that we're not going to see a year in 2015 of significantly strengthening economic activity in the second half. And so that really, I think was our clue that it was time to think about the alternative plan for the year and that's very much what we had in hand in terms of a restructuring program.","Having said that, that doesn't mean that we don't think there's potential, obviously, in these markets over time, but we do think that you can't go through a period where the economy is sort of stalling a bit, and I'm talking globally here, without taking cost out. And that's why we're committed to take prompt action to take cost out because we think it both protects margin, it guards against any further downside and it sets up, we think, a very attractive 2016.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Related to that point, I think in the past in terms of your public pronouncements and meetings with investors, you talked about just the strong core cash generation you particularly expect, particularly going into 2016. And I don't want to throw numbers out there but clearly, a pretty sizable number that can be used for ample capital redeployment. How does that view change given what you've seen now?","And then two other related questions to that, really quickly, is just how do you think about M&A given the bid-ask in this environment versus your own stock price, and then how about succession just given the fact that we could be in a very volatile environment for the next 12 to 18 months?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","We don't necessarily see great volatility because I think that is not what has typified the last couple years. In this lower growth environment, you tend to have less volatility. And so I would say I think our view is more that we're in a period of prolonged slow growth that does put pressure on cost. That's why we're taking the actions that we're in. We did obviously cut back our CapEx by $100 million because we wanted to ensure that our cash flow would decline only by about $200 million, and that's not enough to really move our plans one way or another. So we think we're well within that band of flexibility to put our plans in place.","But once again, we think the prudent position in these kind of marketplaces is to be sure you've got a team that really can execute on cost, that can really execute on deliveries and getting all the key product introductions done on time, and that you can really deploy cash into ensuring that you've got strong returns for your shareholders. And in these kinds of markets, we think a 4% to 5% annual return to shareholders is very powerful and that's why we've put this plan in place.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then just succession, and just talk about your own stock price versus prevailing M&A deals because the problem is, you're dealing with an environment where the multiples have started to be fairly robust in what could be a pronounced cyclical rollover here.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and I think our record has been one of being careful on pricing. And again, I tried to be pretty clear in my introductory comments that as we think about these three uses of cash, after we do R&D and after we do capital expenditures to grow and maintain the business and assure we have safe workplaces, we remain committed to a strong dividend. Second, repurchasing shares, and that starts, as I said, in the second half of this year. And then the third priority is the M&A, and that is very much the way we think about it and I think it's pronounced when you see our share price in the low $60s. It's pretty clear which one's our priority in that regard.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Sandy, I just want to drill down on the distributor orders and hydraulics and all the commentary about industrial MRO, and can you just speak to maybe the level of destocking you're hearing about, how long you're hearing that lasts, and maybe just more broadly, why all that \u2013 why we're seeing such weakness there?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think whether we talk in the Electrical business or we talk in the industrial business, and I'll speak to the \u2013 or the Hydraulics business. I don't think it's as much a huge destock as that people just have not really rebuilt deep inventories and they're not going to at this point. I think they see it, as well, as a slow growth marketplace. I think the piece that has probably surprised people more than anything else, and you really started to hear about it the end of the first quarter, is this lack of industrial MRO spending. And we hear it from partner after partner after partner, from \u2013 whether it be in Hydraulics or whether it be in Electrical, I'd say that's the piece of the market. And people have different theories as to why, whether this is related to machine builders not exporting as much because of the currency differential, whether it's just concern at this point, whether it's the fact the economy's not growing hard enough, really, to be pushing equipment for renewal and utilization. But that's the side of the business that is much slower than we would've anticipated it would be.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Helpful. Thanks.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","How you doing John?","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Morning. So we did \u2013 I guess we had originally planned to do $40 million of restructuring in Hydraulics and we did $15 million. And so I'm just trying to understand here. The incremental restructuring, did you guys \u2013 was the idea that Hydraulics restructuring was not structural so have you replaced that program with the new restructuring numbers? I don't know if I'm being clear, but the $120 million is obviously inclusive of the extra $25 million we were including. Is that not correct? And then is there a mix sort of in terms of how you're restructuring within the Hydraulics segment?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me address Hydraulics first, is that no significant change in what we were and are doing in Hydraulics. And we've been working obviously on trying to get the business properly sized for what we think has been a weaker market conditions that weren't going to go away. So I'd say no change there, John, in terms of what we're trying to get done. And the reason we broke the $15 million out for everyone's benefit today is that we wanted you to be able to get a feel for what the full year restructuring in the company was for 2015 so you'd be able to compare it to the prospective run rate in 2016. But no, I'd say the Hydraulics what we plan to do in Hydraulics is within that $120 million. We've never said exactly what it was going to be but we tried to provide some ranges for people.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And so, Sandy, is the extra $80 million, is that proportionately spread? I apologize if you said this before. Or did you sort of take Hydraulics as a template and spread it into the other businesses then?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","No. Each business has got its own priorities and areas where we thought we needed to address structural cost, and that's true at the corporate level. So I'd say what is common and what we're trying to do in all the businesses and the corporate areas is really get at structural costs, because we're not as interested in a variable cost reduction. We're really looking to take a layer of cost out that doesn't creep back into the business as volumes come back.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yep. And then just to go back to the organic growth comments for the year, so we were pretty flat in the first half. You're thinking the year is now flat to up a little bit, but do you think the third quarter \u2013 I realize your comment's sequential versus year-over-year, but you have said the third quarter's up 2% to 3%. So does that imply the fourth quarter is flat to possibly down? And I realize there's a very slightly tougher compare, or is there anything beyond seasonality to read into the fourth quarter trend?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","No, and we think that the fourth quarter's likely to look a lot like the third quarter on a sequential basis, not a year-to-year basis, so that you step up this kind of 2% to 3% in the third and then generally the fourth quarter is close or just a little bit less than the third quarter.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just lastly then, the capital allocation for M&A, Sandy. All of this is sort of a free cash flow capital allocation. What are your thoughts toward possibly raising that debt if opportunistically some acquisition opportunities were to come along? We're starting to see that a little bit with a couple of your peers, so would you rule that out until you're paying off this Cooper debt or possibly would you think about possibly raising some debt to do a larger deal in the second half?","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we've got a $600 million debt payment in November of this year and we're committed to make that payment. Frankly, if we were going to be working on some deal, the likelihood that it would close in the near-term is fairly low. So I think it really gets to be more of an issue of in early 2016 would we prospectively look at some other financing alternatives. And I'd say honestly, that would depend upon the quality of the opportunity. We obviously have got the ability to do that but, again, our top priorities here, again, are maintaining a strong dividend and having this 4% to 5% annual return to shareholders and then once we can do all of that, it's looking at the M&A alternatives.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","I recognize this morning we have a number of earnings releases. So we're going to have time on the call for one more question and at that point in time we'll be available afterward to answer any follow-up questions. Our next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Morning, guys.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. One just quick follow-up kind of on Julian's question a little bit. I mean we're going to have, I guess, Electrical profit down this year even with the $115 million of Cooper synergies and I understand the points around FX and mix. I'm just wondering if \u2013 I just want to make sure we're actually getting the FX hit right. I mean, do you have what that impact is to this year? That's one part of it. And then also in terms of this mix dynamic, I mean, do you see anything changing that? It seems like lighting probably is going to continue outgrow industrial MRO for a while. So just maybe some thoughts on anything that could change that mix.","Richard H. Fearon - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial & Planning Officer","As I think Sandy commented, Shannon, other than the normal sequential uptick the mix is not likely to change dramatically and we don't have a detailed forecast on FX by segment for the whole year. I mean it's pretty darn hard to forecast it for the quarter coming up just given all of the volatility. But I would expect that you're going to see, as we've said, overall a decline of about 5% due to FX so you can roughly back into that based upon the first half.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. I just didn't know if you were getting an extra high level of margin hit or something like that, but that's fine. In terms of Vehicle going from sort of 4% first half, flat second half, maybe just a little more commentary on the dynamics there. Thanks.","Alexander M. Cutler - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well the big \u2013 as we mentioned at the end of last quarter is there are some years in which the North American heavy-duty truck market is either accelerating or decelerating quarter-to-quarter. We had thought this year would be relatively flat. It looks like a little bit more volume got pulled into the second quarter and so the third and fourth quarter will actually be lower activity levels there than it was in the second quarter. On the North American light vehicle marketplace, fairly flattish as you look through this year, obviously at very attractive levels. And then I guess the market many people have been keeping their eye on right now is the Chinese market in terms of having seen the month-to-month volume crack here in the last month in terms of light vehicle so when we put it all together and of course we've talked about South America probably enough that we see the volumes being relatively flattish as we go through the back half of this year.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, later we\u2019ll conduct the question-and-answer session; instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Don Bullock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Don Bullock","Good morning. I\u2019m Don Bullock, Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us for Eaton\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings call. With me today are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO; Craig Arnold, Chief Operating Officer and President; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Sandy, highlighting the Company\u2019s performance in the third quarter along with our outlook for the remainder of 2015 and some preliminary thoughts on 2016. As we\u2019ve done on our past calls, we\u2019ll be taking questions at the end of Sandy\u2019s comments.","The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we\u2019ll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. And a webcast to this call is accessible on our website will be available for replay.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that our comments today do include statements related to expected future results of the Company and as so, should be therefore be treated as forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasts or projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties and those are described in both earnings release, the presentation and also in the related 8-K.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sandy.","Sandy Cutler","Great. Thanks Don, and I\u2019m going to work from the presentation we posted earlier this morning, and if I could ask you all to turn to page three of that presentation that\u2019s entitled highlights of Q3 results. Couple of comments in terms of our third quarter results. So, we\u2019re with our margins, we\u2019re particularly pleased with the great cost control and all the restructuring work that\u2019s going on across the Company. And that allowed us to offset the lower volumes that we had outlined in our earnings revision just a week and a half ago as well as more negative FX. I think the big news is that we continued markets. And as you saw, our weaker bookings have really caused us to drop our second half guidance. And I\u2019ll talk more about the implications for that for 2016 as well.","Our operating earnings per share we reported at this morning at $0.97 was in line with our revised guidance. As you saw, our sales were down a 9% with 6 points of those 9 points due to ForEx the other three organic revenue decline. Segment margins of 14.5% that\u2019s a little bit below the 15% that we had guided to original life of the third quarter and that\u2019s really due simply to the volume impact being down as far as it was from our expectation. I think the very good news is when you take out the net restructuring impact, and I\u2019ll be talking more about those restructuring plans as I go through my comments this morning, our margins were 16.2%. Those net restructuring costs, so that\u2019s the costs minus the benefits for about $98 million in the quarter, about $8 million higher than we had provided in our guidance for the third quarter. So that\u2019s all really due to timing and as you all see as we talk through those results for this morning. We really quite pleased with the overall restructuring program and it\u2019s actually going to drive even more benefits that we had shared with you initially.","A quarterly record operating cash flow; really pleased with that $973 million, obviously a reflection of the work we\u2019re doing in terms of not only improving profitability but also really pulling dollars out of our working capital. And doing that allowed us during the quarter to buy back about $284 million of shares. That brings our year-to-date repurchases to $454 million. That\u2019s about 1.5% of our outstanding shares. And I know you\u2019ll all recall that in 2014, we also bought back about 650 million shares.","If I could ask you to turn to the next chart entitled financial summary. One number -- I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve looked at these already but I wanted o reference on this chart is if you look in the green box in the lower left hand corner, our organic sales of negative 3, if we go back and look at the second quarter, our organic sales were up positive 1. And this really reflects I think well what we\u2019re seeing in the downshift in the number of our end markets where we saw positive organic growth in the first half and now we\u2019re seeing negative growth here in the second half.","If we turn to the next page and let\u2019s talk through our five reporting segments. I\u2019m on a page titled Electrical Products Segment. Really great margin performance here this quarter. As you can see, we reported 18.5%. And if we don\u2019t include again the net restructuring and the savings that came from that, 19%, I think really demonstrating the strong performance and margin position and cost position we have in this business. Again this business is a third of the Company, so it\u2019s really significant for us.","The bookings were flat this quarter. And I think if you look back over the last several quarters, you recall that in the second quarter, they were 4%; in the first quarter they were 5%; then all during the previous year, they were 4%, 5% or 6%. So, clearly we\u2019ve seen a downshift. As we\u2019ve talked with so many of our distributors around the world, they have been seeing a slowing in their end demand. They clearly are not comfortable taking on more inventory in this environment. And we saw this slow as we went through the third quarter. And so I\u2019ll comment more about that when we get to our fourth quarter guidance. Still positive in the Americas and in Europe but Asia was particularly weak, and it was not simply China; we saw weakness across the region.","We told you in our second quarter conference call, we would share with you the specific restructuring costs and the benefits by segment. You see them detailed here. So, I simply won\u2019t go through repeating them. I think you\u2019ll they are stayed on a consistent basis as we go through each of the segments here.","When we get inside the bookings, the strength has been where hit has been historically, a strong residential here in the U.S., strong lighting activity, weak industrial, weak oil and gas. We get into the Middle East and Europe; clearly the Middle East is the strongest of that region. We also saw some pretty good demand in the single phase UPS market. And then Asia was basically weak across the board and was the primary reason that the total bookings were flat instead of slightly positive.","If we go to the next chart labeled Electrical Systems & Services Segment, again a large segment for the Company, about 28% of the overall Company. And if you look at this particular chart, I want to call out a couple items. Let me start with the organic growth again in the lower left hand green box. It was a negative 4% last quarter, negative 5% this year. Again if you look at the bookings being down 3%, and if you back just last several quarters and look at the trends there, it was down 7% in the second quarter; it was flat in both the first and in the fourth quarter -- fourth quarter of last year. So we\u2019ve been seeing weakness in this segment, it has continued. You\u2019ll recall that we report our Crouse-Hinds business in this segment which has a very large oil and gas exposure. We\u2019ve also seen weakness in the power quality market this year and the utility market\u2019s been pretty flattish this year.","Finally, we\u2019re seeing that the large industrial projects within the overall construction market remain weak. And that\u2019s an area that also affects this particular business. Bright spots in the quarter for us where we saw our systems business and bookings up very substantially. That\u2019s something we normally look for in the third quarter because there is quite a lot of work that gets completed during the fourth quarter for many of our customers and also on the private side as well as on the government side.","And we were pleased and in spite of fairly flattish conditions in the utility area, we had a good quarter of booking there, our one of the stronger areas. And then finally, our own three-phase UPS business, these tend to go into these larger installations, had a very good quarter of bookings as well. Crouse however was down very substantially and that obviously affects the margin. So, if you flip up to the margins here and you compare the third quarter to fourth quarter, you\u2019ll see that we reported margins of 11.2%. Without the restructuring costs and the restructuring savings, they were 12.8% but a 180 basis points lower than last year. And I would say really the factors I mentioned in bookings are exactly what is influencing the margins here that\u2019s the weaker mix and activity for Crouse oil and gas related, it\u2019s the weaker activity from the industrial side, and then we have not had strong bookings for couple of quarters, so they were operating at lower utilization levels.","If we move then on next chart labeled Hydraulics Segment, about 12% of our Company. I don\u2019t think much new news here from what we\u2019ve been chatting with you all about here as these markets continue to be weak, commodity markets across the board around the world are weak. If we simply look at the bookings number are down 13%, not a whole lot different region to region around the world, nor is it substantially different between OEMs and distributors, as you can see in the comment below. Within the overall mobile area is again as mentioned, most of these commodity markets continued to be weak and on the stationary side clearly oil and gas are still a negative. Last quarter, again if I can ask you to look at the green box on the left, organic growth was negative 11% this quarter and negative 10%. And you can see in the yellow box, the magnitude of the restructuring that we\u2019re doing in this business to respond to these weaker markets. You can obviously see that\u2019s significantly affected the reported margin versus the margin without our restructuring costs and benefits.","If we move to the next chart, Aerospace, about 90% of the Company, really good quarter. I think when you look at the margin performance, whether it\u2019s the 17.6% that we reported or the 18.7% that would not include the restructuring costs and the benefits. Bookings down some 16%, not different than you\u2019re seeing from most of the companies in the aerospace industry during this quarter. OEM activity order placement on both the commercial and the military side weak, whether it\u2019s a matter of comparables or whether it\u2019s a matter of weak, it was a weak quarter. The one bright spot here, a couple of you have noted was in aftermarket, up solid 11%. And we are making progress towards getting the aftermarket business up toward that historic mix of 40% of total. Again restructuring not as much elsewhere really responding primarily to as programs start to diminish or come to a lower level in this industry. We\u2019re obviously tuning our manpower and structural costs as well.","If we could move to the next chart, the Vehicle Segment, about 18% of Eaton. You can see another very strong quarter in terms of margin performance, 15.2% and then 18.2% when we take out the restructuring costs and benefits. Our organic growth was a negative 3; you\u2019ll recall, it was negative 4 last quarter. We are seeing a downshift in terms of NAFTA heavy duty truck market build. If I could comment on that just for a moment, you\u2019ve known that our forecast throughout this year has been 330,000 units. We think it\u2019s coming off here in the fourth quarter. We have dropped our forecast to 325, so a reduction of 5,000 units. And if you look at the third quarter production rate of roughly 83,000 units, our best estimate at this time is it\u2019ll come down to about 74,000 units in the fourth quarter, so down about 11% quarter-to-quarter. And you get a sense for that when you look at the whole third quarter NAFTA Class 8 orders were about 65,000 for the industry and the backlog has come down approximately 20,000 units during this last quarter.","If we move to chart 10, if we look at our markets this year and we review our organic growth, we do expect -- and I\u2019ll cover more of this on the next chart that our organic revenues will shrink about 1% this year. And that\u2019s driven by our markets coming down approximately 2% during 2015 compared to 2014 and that we will outgrow them by about 1. So that\u2019s how we get the net of a negative 1%. They\u2019re detailed here in terms of the total organic growth segment-by-segment. I won\u2019t go through each of those. I\u2019ll be glad to answer the questions little later this morning.","And the next chart, our chart 11, which is labeled 2015 Segment Operating Margin Expectations. You\u2019ll recall when we provided segment margin, a guidance at the end of the second quarter; the segment guidance we gave you did not include the restructuring costs or benefits because we had not yet announced those specific plans internally. These now do, and to help you kind of bridge between the last quarter and this current quarter, the electrical products margins here are affected about by about 20 basis points from the restructuring and savings Electrical Systems and Services, similar at about 20 basis points, Hydraulics at 80 basis points, Aerospace at 20 basis points, Vehicle at 60 and then the total consolidated at 30. So, you obviously can get a feel of the biggest restructuring that we\u2019re doing proportional to the businesses are in Hydraulics and in Vehicle at this point.","If we turn to the next chart, and I want to spend a little bit of time on this chart and the next chart to be sure that how we have displayed our restructuring is easy for you to understand. Let me start with just a couple of summary comments. Program is on track that we announced to you at the end of the second quarter; it is indeed going to produce even more savings than we had shared with you, at that time. We are reducing our employment by approximately 2,900 employees; we\u2019re closing eight manufacturing plants.","And if you look at this particular chart, you will see that -- you\u2019ve got the actual numbers displayed for both costs and savings and you can see that we actually had higher net cost of about $8 million in the third quarter than we had in our plan, that\u2019s the 98 million versus the 90 million. We do expect in the fourth quarter that we will have slightly higher net savings and that\u2019s the result obviously you see us taking our savings in that quarter up by $10 million. And if you shift to 2016, you will see the difference that we\u2019ll spend about $5 million more than we thought originally, but we\u2019re going to get about $20 million more savings that\u2019s the $100 million versus the $80 million.","So, when you go to the bottom of this chart and we say total restructuring program that we announced at the end of the second quarter, we\u2019ll have a program cost of approximately $153 million, up $8 million, $3 million of the $8 million occurs in 2015, $5 million of the $8 million occurs in 2016. Similarly when you look at the savings of $150 million; of the $25 million of increase of savings, 5 million occurs in 2015, $20 million in 2016. So, that is the program that we\u2019ve announced to you, again about 2,900 employees and closing eight manufacturing plants.","But based upon what we have seen, if we could go to the next page, it\u2019s labeled With Continuation of Weaker Markets. We had originally shared with you on our second quarter conference call when we were talking about 2016 that in these weak market conditions, we would ordinarily undertake about $50 million to $60 million of restructuring on an annual basis. We have mentioned that to you so that if you were trying to look at estimates of respective earnings next year, you wouldn\u2019t drop restructuring out of the program. What we had not shared with you is what the anticipated savings it would come from that $50 million to $60 million will do.","So today what we\u2019re doing with this second set of actions which is labeled on this chart, the 2016 program, it is a second set of actions; it\u2019s not any of the same actions that we were taking before; these are actions in addition to those actions, is that we\u2019re going to increase the expected cost of restructuring for these new actions from $50 million to $60 million to $90 million to $100 million. So if you\u2019ve taken the midpoint of $50 to $60 and had $55 in your estimates and you now take the midpoint of 90 to 100, you have 95; it\u2019s about $40 million more restructuring next year than we had provided you before.","We do expect over a two-year time period that we\u2019ll get dollar-for-dollar benefits for this $95 million. So, if you see on this chart and if you look to the second line from the bottom that\u2019s in the green box, you see that we expect to get $40 million of savings in 2016 and we\u2019ll get the full 95 by the second year, in 2017. So again, we have two sets of actions, the set of actions which was announced at the end of the second quarter that is resulting in reducing employment by 2,900 people and eight manufacturing plants being closed; and a new supplemental set of actions labeled here as 2016 program. When you add the two together, you\u2019ll see that from 2015 to 2016, there is a year-to-year benefit of $138 million. Then when you move from 2016 to 2017, there is a year-to-year benefit of $190 million.","Now, I would urge you, don\u2019t use the whole $190 million in your estimates because there will be some regular restructuring action that will go on within the Company as it does on an ordinary basis, in 2017. I think for planning purposes, you might assume that that could be on the order of $50 million to $60 million, so a midpoint of $55 million, and then we might get on the order of $25 million of cost. I mentioned those numbers not because they are our forecasts but we don\u2019t want you to simply drop any net cost estimate which is probably on the order of about 30 million bucks out of this comparison, so you might take that $190 million and reduce it to a net of something on the order of $160 million.","So, I hope that\u2019s helpful. I know Don will be able to walk through this individually with you. I understand it can be a little confusing when you think about initial set of actions and a second set of actions. But clearly the reason we\u2019re undertaking an even larger set of additional actions prospectively here in 2016 is the fact that these markets have fallen off more than we had anticipated at the middle of this year as I\u2019ll detail in just a moment; we think we\u2019re likely to see continued shrinkage of our markets in 2016. So, we are working hard to get out ahead of these reductions in markets with these very aggressive and I think well led out and being very well executed restructuring programs.","With that as a base, let\u2019s move to chart 14, which is labeled Operating EPS Guidance. Our guidance for the fourth quarter is the $1.05 to a $1.15 operating EPS. And probably the two most significant items here in terms of our thinking on this is, we think organic revenues will come down another 3% from third quarter level. This is not year-to-year; this is compared to the third quarter. And we get there really that\u2019s more than what normally happens if you look at our seasonal patterns by the fact that we\u2019ve seen bookings obviously decelerate in this last quarter. And we continue to hear from specific markets, I cited one but it\u2019s just one, the heavy duty truck market, that there are many more days being scheduled now to be closed from our customers than they were just three months ago. And so we\u2019re basing our guidance that our organic revenue will come off 3%; the tax rate will be between 5% to 6% and the reason that\u2019s lower than we\u2019ve run in some of the other quarters is that our best estimate is we\u2019re going to have a lower mix of income in some of the high tax countries. And some of you may have seen just yesterday the recent reduction in the UK tax rate and there is a legislation going through on that. And so we\u2019ve tried to pick the benefit of that as well.","And then last very importantly, the very prudent actions that we kicked off earlier this year in the second quarter are going to allow us to have a net restructuring benefit between the third quarter and the fourth quarter of $123 million as was detailed on the previous chart and that\u2019s about $0.25 that gives us -- helps our run rate during the fourth quarter. That brings our full year guidance to $4.20 to $4.30 operating EPS and that does include the full net restructuring charge from this initial set of actions that we announced at the end of the second of $73 million net charge or net impact of the negative $0.14.","Next page titled 2015 Outlook Summary, just the basic summary that we provide you here. Obviously the big change on this one is that we had thought in July that our organic revenue growth would be zero to negative 1 and it\u2019s clearly going to be negative 1. We\u2019ve been working really hard on all of our expenses in the Company, so that whole collection of pension, interest general corporate expense we believe will be $30 million below last year that\u2019s more than we had told you before and the tax rate is a little lower. And then very importantly with all this change, if you look at the operating cash flow, we had told you 2.4 billion to 2.8 billion at the end of July and that is still our guidance for this year. The team\u2019s really doing a great job in that regard. And because we\u2019re operating at lower levels of activity, we\u2019ve taken another $100 million out of CapEx, not unlike many industrial firms in this weaker environment that we just don\u2019t need to spend that extra capital. So we actually have taken our guidance up for free cash flow in spite of all this weakness by $100 million. So, it was $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion, it\u2019s now $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion.","So, if we turn to next chart, 2015 Summary, I covered most of these points. Organic growth at about 1% that assumes our markets go down. It clearly reflects what I\u2019ve been commenting on in terms of the slowdown here over the back half of the year. I already commented on the restructuring program, and that the operating margins are depressed by above 30 basis points for the net restructuring impact. We have repurchased 7.2 million shares through the third quarter of this year. We will pay down this large tranche that we\u2019ve talked about for some time of $600 million of debt in November. And I think the really good news is, based upon the strong cash flow, we were able to do this level of repurchasing in the third quarter and we\u2019ve got the flexibility to continue to repurchase in the fourth quarter if we deem that\u2019s prudent.","Last chart is very important looking forward. And clearly I think this is the Ouija ball that we are all trying to get a good handle on currently in terms of with the second half of this year having them slower, what are the implications for 2016. And clearly my comments here very inform our decision to go ahead with an even larger second set of actions in terms of restructuring in the Company.","We expect our markets in 2016 compared to 2015 to be slightly negative. And our best thinking -- and please don\u2019t put a decimal point on this, this early time because we\u2019re in the process of trying to get all of this tuned up ourselves, is it\u2019s likely to be on the order of down to 1% to 2%. This year it was down 2%. And as you try to think through our businesses, because I can hear each of your enquiries of can you give me some color about how might that lay out across your different businesses. Our best thinking -- but please, it is initial thinking at this point, is that to support that we think that the electric business be up on the order of 1, hydraulic is going to have another down year, we think on the order of roughly 7, aerospace will continue to be strong on the order of about 3 positive and vehicle will come off about 5 and we\u2019re anticipating that the North America heavy duty class 8 business comes off about 15% from this year\u2019s 325.","Now, all of that frankly would get you to a number that feels a little bit more than just one, I think prudence, having watched what\u2019s happened to markets this year is what leads us to believe that we need to be planning based on a negative 1 to negative 2. We\u2019ll obviously have more to say about that as we work through our profit plans and share guidance with you after the New Year.","The restructuring program highlights just what I talked to you before. The way to read this chart is -- because we didn\u2019t get the labeling quite correct on the little small bullet under the restructuring year-to-year benefits is between 2015 and 2016, we get the $138 million of benefit; between 2016 and 2017, we get a $190 million of incremental savings but remember by caveat, you probably want to take that 190 and reduce it to something closer to 160 because it is highly likely the Company would continue to do some former restructuring on an annual basis which is sort of normal fair.","The Cooper integration savings of about $45 million; the free cash flow up from 2015 by 10% to 15%. And you say how can you feel relatively confident about that? We will not have a U.S. qualified pension contribution; it won\u2019t be required in January. Recall, last year it was about 200 million. If you look at our guidance for this year and take the midpoint of 2.1 billion, 200 million over 2.1 billion gets you pretty close to 10%. And so, we obviously think we\u2019ll do a little better than that. We do have one more debt repayment in January of 2016; we\u2019ve disclosed this to you before, 240 million. And then the really good news is that as we\u2019ve shared with you at midyear in 2015, we\u2019re going to continue to have very strong cash flow. You saw that in our third quarter, really exceptional cash flow. That\u2019s going to give us the capacity to deploy over $1 billion of capital through either stock repurchases or acquisition. And we\u2019ve a strong bias toward repurchases, obviously with our price -- stock price into the range of this at this point.","So in total, I would say that I think we\u2019re being realistic about what\u2019s happening in our end-markets. We are taking the restructuring actions, both with the first set of actions we took and now the second set which will kick off next year. As the timing, we would expect to kick off those restructuring actions, the new actions we\u2019ve talked about in 2016, will get at them early in the year that means probably the first quarter which obviously means that we can pull more savings into the year as well. The company is really focused on getting cost down to ensure that obviously we can be competitive and produce the kind of returns that we hold ourselves accountable to as well.","And so with that Don, I\u2019ll turn things back to you and look forward to everybody\u2019s questions.","Don Bullock","Before we begin the Q&A and have the operator guide for the Q&A portion of the call today, we do have a number of individuals that are queued with questions. Given our time constrains of an hour for the call today and our desire to get as many of those questions as possible voiced, please limit your questions to the single question and a follow-up. And thanks in advanced for your cooperation.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator to provide guidance on the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Don Bullock","With that our first question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis","Can you give us a sense of what your view is on -- I guess the first part of the question is your benefit from price cost in the quarter. But probably more importantly, what your view is, as you look out in 2016 on potential price weakness in some of your markets?","Sandy Cutler","I think let me start with the commodity side. We continue to believe we\u2019re in a period of weak commodity and obviously to inform some of the demand side for us in our hydraulics business, we don\u2019t see -- and of course we\u2019ll all guess wrong when the interest rates will begin to start to be increased but it feels like that\u2019s coming sooner rather than later. We don\u2019t see pressure on the commodity side. Hence, we don\u2019t see a lot of pricing actions that are likely to be successful out in the marketplace. So relatively neutral in that regard.","I think the key is going to be for us all to understand when that commodity pressure starts to come back. But we\u2019re not seeing any evidence of that at the present time.","Scott Davis","And can you quantify the benefit that you saw this quarter on price cost spread?","Sandy Cutler","I wouldn\u2019t say we were seeing a benefit because in terms of we can\u2019t do it -- I think you know our mode; we tend to keep our pricing pretty much in line with the commodity side. So, we\u2019ve not been getting net price increase, if you will.","Scott Davis","And just quickly, any color you have for us on U.S. non-res? I mean it seems like it\u2019s still reasonably good but you\u2019re outlook there?","Sandy Cutler","On the light side, if I could cut it into maybe three pieces, on the light side and that\u2019s the portion that was attached to residential, I would say continues to be quite strong and looks a lot like the residential demand. On the really large commercial projects, not all that strong. On the industrial large projects that\u2019s where the weakness has been. And if you look at the Dodge reports, part of the reason we commented in our press release that we saw bookings get weaker through the quarter. Some of the Dodge information about future activity has been concerning. We don\u2019t think that means that we\u2019re going to see a negative number from non-res. So, we do think it may not grow quite as quickly as it has been.","Don Bullock","Our next comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein.","Steve Winoker","Couple of questions. First, on the 2016 thinking, assuming that organic growth does come in, let\u2019s say flat at best or a little bit down for you specifically, what kind of incremental margins do you think you can hold excluding the restructuring and excluding the Cooper synergies?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, we\u2019ve not -- you\u2019re right on point with the question, Steve, and we\u2019ve not really tuned it formally at this point. But we\u2019re getting down this far in the cycle, earlier on we were able to hold 20% decrementals; we think it\u2019s more on the order of 30 but we\u2019ll have a better chance as we get out. That\u2019s obviously why we\u2019ve been launching the restructuring we have. I think there always are capacity issues any company that has sort of knees in them and both in the way up and the way down. And with this having come down this far we need to take another knee out. So I think for planning you might use 30% at this point.","Steve Winoker","And then on the Cooper side, am I correct in looking at the $45 million of integration savings you put on slide 17, is that comparable to the 115 you talked about before?","Sandy Cutler","You\u2019re absolutely correct. And two issues that are leading to lower synergy as we get out here towards the end of the four-year time period. The first is with the lower volumes that we\u2019re seeing -- we had obviously hoped we would see some market growth with this time period. There is a scaling effect on procurement and plant savings. We also have experienced negative CapEx and it\u2019s not only affecting the base business, it\u2019s also affecting the synergy. And frankly, we just had enrolled it through to the synergies. And as we\u2019ve been tuning all those stuff, it was clear to us that we had missed the piece of that as it has to do with the synergies.","The last has to do with the oil and gas industry, as well as three regions that have really slowed far more than others. Canada as you know is really been hit very hard in terms of being a natural resource area. Latin America, let me just say, it\u2019s been gutted and leave it right there. And those are the issues that have led to the change. So, we do think at this point, a more realistic number for next year is about $45 million incremental savings over this year. Once again, Steve, that all informs part of our feeling for why we\u2019ve got to do more restructuring.","Steve Winoker","And is most of that cost savings now or is there any revenue in that 45?","Sandy Cutler","There is a very little revenue. Most of it coming right out of the large plant closings that we\u2019re finishing up.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. ","Ann Duignan","Just a follow-up, quick question on the Copper synergies. Can you just remind us, Sandy, what were the synergies for 2015 versus 150 million as expected?","Sandy Cutler","We think they will be on the order of about 135 million versus the 150 million and then we think next year it\u2019s this 45 million versus the 115 million.","Ann Duignan","And then my question is really around Brazil and the impact that financing programs might have on -- particularly on your vehicle business. How are you thinking about that both into year-end and for 2016?","Sandy Cutler","We have been a bear on the Brazilian economy, as you know for a couple of years. And while I think it\u2019s salutatory that they are trying to find some ways to turn the economy, our base assumption is that Brazil continues to be weaker next year than this year. And we just think there are so many macroeconomic issues that have to be addressed, we\u2019re not planning on an upturn effect; we\u2019re planning on it still sliding some more in 2016 versus 2015. ","Ann Duignan","And that\u2019s embedded in your hydraulic outlook I presume; are there any other businesses?","Sandy Cutler","Hydraulic and vehicle.","Ann Duignan","And vehicle? Okay, thank you.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. ","Jeff Sprague","I was wondering first just on working capital, Sandy or Rick, if you can give us a little bit of color how much you actually got out in the quarter and what kind of opportunity that is in the next year?","Rick Fearon","Jeff, we\u2019re just shy of 300 million from Q2 to Q3 and change in I guess what you talk classic working capital, we really put a full court press on receivables and manage down inventory but we think much more is possible partly because when you\u2019re sales slide off is very hard to keep the inventories going down in line with unexpected sales decline. So, we would look into next year and view additional opportunities for working capital liquidation and we also do have inventories -- bank inventories we built up for some of these Cooper plant consolidations and we would expect that most of those would be removed by the end of the year.","So, I think you\u2019ll see continued strong management of working capital.","Jeff Sprague","And then maybe flipping it more to the customer level, Sandy, you made a comment about inventories at the customer level. It seems pretty clear there has been a drawdown going on across a lot of these channels. Do you think your customers are properly sized to current state of end demand or is there still more inventory liquidation that needs to take place in these channels?","Sandy Cutler","Let me talk to the two channels if I could, Jeff. I agree with your comment on the distributor issue. I think that industry was maybe buying in a little too strongly in the first quarter and second quarter. And as things began to back up here in the second half, they are obviously not buying or trying to window down our inventory. And our feedback is they\u2019ve got little bit more to do before they\u2019re going to really feel they\u2019re going to optimally sized. When you get out to the end markets, some of these end markets have been week for quite some time and you would hope that they are starting to get it right. But our view is when markets are falling off like this, it usually takes a while for people to catch up and get right-sized. And so that\u2019s all kind of big into our view in a number of these markets in 2016, we\u2019re still going to see some negative numbers on the growth side. Don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to be absolutely right on that, but we think we\u2019re better to plan with that outlook and we\u2019ll get the cost out of the Company, and we can manage up if we need to. If we\u2019re wrong in this market, it\u2019s always harder to manage down.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","I may just -- your point around capital deployment is more buyback focused, but just taking a step back, the EPS top line is down a bit, your earnings next year 4ish or so. So that\u2019s the way you were before the Cooper acquisition back in 2011. So, I just wanted how happy you\u2019re with the current state of portfolio, or if your view is that times are tough, so we take out cost for new buybacks and then maybe in a couple of years time where there is clearer macro, you can do something with the portfolio?","Sandy Cutler","Without giving confirmation one way or the other to your 4 number, I would say our focus right now is that we\u2019re seeing markets have weakened and we need to get the cost out of our overall corporate portfolio that\u2019s at the corporate level and each of our individual businesses. And we think with the stock not creating at the levels that we think it\u2019s worth, we need to get this cost right so we\u2019re in a position to drive earnings growth in 2016 over 2015. We\u2019ve not finished our planning on that. But that is our primary focus right now is to drive the restructuring program. We have a singular focus on getting these costs right at this point.","We\u2019ll continue to look at the issues of portfolio, as I\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times, there is nothing that prevents us from making changes in our portfolio on a taxable basis at this point. Part of that change is then when we get out to November 2007 when we have other alternatives that are available to us. But I would say for right now Julian our primary focus that we are driving with single minded purposes across the Company is to get our cost right.","Julian Mitchell","And then just a follow-up on the ESS business, margins under pressure for those volumes I guess. Is anything happening there on pricing on some of the large projects activity as well, or is it just a volume driven mix phenomenon?","Sandy Cutler","I\u2019d say a couple of things, Julian, remember that is the sector where we put Crouse-Hinds in and you may recall when we gave our guidance for this year and indicated that about 6% of Eaton\u2019s revenues are in oil and gas, and that we expected that marker would be off about 25%, we\u2019d also said that we thought the primary impact of that would be in the second half of 2015 and that is indeed what we\u2019re experiencing. While bookings weakened early in the year, we really seeing that impact come through in terms of the shipment side. So that\u2019s the first area.","Second area has been this continued weakness in what I would call power systems and in the power quality three-phase market on shipments. We are encouraged that there is some fairly significant projects that we think will indeed be built and shipped -- they\u2019ll be asking us to ship on next year. So, we see that three-phase issue potentially turning around next year.","And the last but not least is the industrial construction big projects have been weaker this year. That\u2019s part of what\u2019s infecting this as well. And so whenever -- and I\u2019ve candid before that whenever you see weakness in these end markets, you do get more price competition. And so, there is more of a beta of that. And I would say the industry is operating at lower levels of utilization right now.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeff Hammond","So, I know it\u2019s early on \u201816 when you give some color on the segments. But just given the downtick in orders in electrical, what\u2019s the comfort level that you do get growth there in to \u201816 and maybe where do you have the most confidence that you will see that growth?","Sandy Cutler","Jeff, obviously we\u2019re in the midst of all of our planning and once we start trying to pull that string of yarn, we\u2019re into an awful lot of detail that we don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve got fully vetted enough. I think the biggest issue to think about in electrical is what\u2019s happened in the second half in terms of distributors destocking. And at some point we all know that that comes to a conclusion and you get rid of that negative impact. But there is so many end markets there. I did mention before that we do think that residential will continue to expand. And certainly that area of non-residential that surrounds residential, so that light side looks pretty solid. And then I did mention that we\u2019re seeing some better activity obviously out ahead of us in terms of the power quality markets. But I think beyond that we need to really finish the reviews that Craig and I are heavily involved in, in terms of looking at the operating plans for this next year. And we\u2019ll have a better set of insights when we give you our full guidance for next year.","Don Bullock","Next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray","With regard to the second phase of the restructuring plan, was there any consideration to doing some of that now in the fourth quarter and get a jump start on this?","Sandy Cutler","Yes clearly, we obviously have thought that through very, Deane. Part of this is the issue of just how much capacity there is to do how much all at one time, and that\u2019s what we really felt. And our best judgment is laid out the right sequence for trying to assure that we not only forecast savings but that we indeed execute them well. So, Company has been really busy during the third and fourth quarter getting this first group done. And we\u2019ll kick off with second group as I said most likely right in the first quarter. But we really felt that was the right timing and we\u2019re trying to be transparent about the fact as to how the timing of these will feel through. But that\u2019s our best estimate, the best way to do this.","Deane Dray","And then just so we have a perspective on how the third quarter did play out, can you share with us the cadence of the months on an organic basis and how you arrived at the decision that you did need to negatively pre-announce?","Sandy Cutler","What we had indicated in a number of forms both Craig and Rick and I were in sometimes together and sometimes in different locations is that we saw July and August continue to be very slow. And as we came through the end of August, it was evident that September was going to have to really strengthen substantially. Now, it did strengthen but it didn\u2019t strengthen enough and that\u2019s where Rick was out at a conference in the middle of September, we shared at that point that we were concerned that revenues looked like they were going to fall short.","We\u2019re right in the midst obviously of working through all of those actions that we had announced in restructuring from the second quarter. But at that point, we believe be looking at whether we were going to need more in terms of restructuring to get cost down. So that\u2019s sort of how it laid out over the time period. I\u2019d say September was a good month and it\u2019s always a disproportionately big month in the third quarter. It just didn\u2019t come through like we thought it would. And it wasn\u2019t in just one business. I\u2019ve had that question from a number of investors as was the 300 million just in one line of business. No, it was fairly broadly. And so, our concern that we think we\u2019re correctly responding to is that this is a general slowdown and then you GDP numbers come out lower than people thought again; you saw the industrial production numbers come out now lower than people thought and not seeing a lot of different news from around the world. So, we\u2019re trying to get ahead of this as fast as we can. And no one likes having negative markets but the way you deal with them as you get the cost out and you manage your cash and you be sure you\u2019ve got a strong balance sheet for this time period. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with UBS. ","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Maybe one for Rick, just initially. You talked about the UK tax change; you also have BEPS going on. Maybe just an update on the implications of recent global tax activity and how we should think about any implications for Eaton going forward?","Rick Fearon","You\u2019re right to focus on some of these changes. It is interesting that despite the BEPS initiative, you still have places like the UK in the process of lowering their tax rate. So, it is an evolving tableau. The impact from BEPS, frankly, is going to turn out we believe to mainly for us be around all the additional information requirements, the filings for the calendar year 2016 of detailed country-by-country tax reports and increase in required transfer pricing documentation. So that\u2019s going to require some extra manpower, some extra efforts. We think we have a good plan to do that cost effectively. And we are working right now to put all those resources in place.","I think you\u2019ll also see additional audit activity just because that\u2019s been focus we\u2019ve seen over the last year around the world that countries are needing more revenue, so they\u2019re going to do more audit. So I think that\u2019s another part. All-in-all though the biggest impact on Eaton year-to-year let\u2019s say from 2015 to 2016 is simply likely to be mix, where the income is actually earned and we don\u2019t yet have a good handle on mix for 2016. It is possible that our rate could move up a small amount from the 7 to 9 that we expect right now, but I wouldn\u2019t expect anything very dramatic.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","And then on the hydraulic, minus 8% new organic guidance for the year, it seems like that implies a somewhat more favorable 4Q before we start to get worse again next year. Is there anything going on in the fourth quarter that I\u2019m missing on hydraulic?","Sandy Cutler","No. And Craig, maybe you want to comment.","Craig Arnold","No, I would say no. I think if you take a look at how hydraulics performed during the course of 2014, I think you\u2019ll find that Q4 2014 was also quite a low quarter. So, I think the denominator in this case helps a bit but we certainly are and when we take a look at the sequential performance of hydraulics, what we\u2019re forecasting is that Q4 will in fact be weaker than Q3. And if you take a look at the seasonality of the business, it\u2019s consistent with what we seen in prior years. And we\u2019re not assuming any of our end markets get any better.","Don Bullock","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. ","Nigel Coe","So obviously Sandy, recognizing that you\u2019re still in the midst of plan of the next year, the detail you\u2019ve given is really helpful. Just if next year doesn\u2019t turn out to be a down 1% to 2% type of situation for Eaton, it feels like you\u2019ve taken enough cost out to achieve your aim of growing earnings next year. Is there anything from a mix perspective or maybe from a pension or tax that maybe hold earnings flat to maybe down next year with these reconstruction actions in place?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, we don\u2019t -- at this point again, it\u2019s really early Nigel but we don\u2019t see any headwinds if you will in those areas, and little too early to call whether they all be positive. But we\u2019re relatively confident they are not headwinds in those particular areas. So I think your premise is right.","Nigel Coe","And then just picking up on Deane\u2019s question about how the quarter played out, as we went into October, did some of that relatively good news from September filter through into October? And how would you describe your confidence levels on the down 3% for 4Q which is obviously in line with 3Q but down 3 for 4Q in light of the possibility of extended holiday shutdowns. Do you think there is a bias to the upside or the downside the number or based on your visibility today either in backlog or trends you\u2019re seeing today the down 3 feels really good.","Sandy Cutler","Typically where we\u2019ll see this practice and we\u2019ve talked about this in previous years where major OEM customer of ours will decide on either the Thanksgiving or the Christmas holidays to add a couple of days of shutdown. We tended to see that in our vehicle business; we\u2019ve tended to see that in our hydraulics business. And so we\u2019re starting to hear and we did during the month of October what I\u2019ll call a little bit of rolling thunder in terms of people adding additional days. Normal our experience has been when people start to add a couple, they are going to add a couple more. And so our 3% is more than we would normally see our fourth quarter revenues come down from the third quarter. We\u2019re trying to be very realistic about in a market that -- in a economy that appears to be slowing and more so, clearly on the industrial side than what I am going to call the retail consumer side that we\u2019ve got to anticipate that. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve tried to say we\u2019ve got to learn to live within 3% volume down is the most likely case here for the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll know more week by week because these things tend to -- they don\u2019t give you a lot of warning. But I\u2019d say our history tells us this is likely to be a whole lot closer to the negative 3 than just the flat quarter-to-quarter.","Don Bullock","The next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","Could we get a little more color on just the broad based Asian weakness in electrical? And maybe just what\u2019s going on under the hood in that region; is it starting in China and spread or just anything Sandy that maybe you sort of observed there throughout the quarter that could lead to some conclusion one way or another?","Sandy Cutler","Maybe a couple of items, John. You\u2019ve heard us say before is that we actually think that manufacturing IP in China is growing much slower than has been stated. Having said that, now you look within it and look what\u2019s going on, most of the infrastructure projects have been pulled back. There is not much manufacturing capacity. And many people are talking about the construction side -- I\u2019m talking commercial construction that has gotten much slower. We\u2019re not seeing the export; this will be machine tool activity, be particularly strong either and that has to do with the receiving countries, not being that strong. And last but not least, the corruption investigations that resulted in a lot of practices that are -- let say, it\u2019s causing delay in projects and it\u2019s causing very intense price construction because they\u2019re really trying to sure of price pressures because they\u2019re trying to be sure that there are not reasons that awards are being made at a higher price level, be it for futures quality delivery, none of that is accepted at this point.","So, I\u2019d say China is -- I think you\u2019ve seen it from just about everyone was reported on the industrial side has had a very weak third quarter, and it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s going to be significantly different next quarter. I\u2019d say if you go down through Indonesia, Malaysia, wherever else, clearly the oil situation is acting as a depressant in that particular area. You get up into Korea and of course there\u2019re not a whole lot of ships being built currently and you\u2019re seeing this back up again. And so, we\u2019re not a real big player in Indian market. And so I would site those three as the primary reasons where same things be slow in that area.","John Inch","Sandy, since you\u2019ve been CEO, you\u2019ve seen a couple of U.S. recessions, maybe in 2001 it was little more traditional and 2008 was a credit crisis. And what\u2019s going on now seems to be different still. If I think about your own forecast of markets down very low single digit next year, it\u2019s not that bad but it also begs the question why is it only not that bad, if we\u2019ve seen the sequential deterioration. I am trying to draw a little bit on your own experience and then the backdrop of what got us to here. So, it\u2019s really just understand why isn\u2019t next year possibly more like a classical recession that\u2019s down perhaps more analogously to 2001; why things are only holding it down smaller level than might be otherwise the case based on historical precedent?","Sandy Cutler","I think, John, it\u2019s the great macro that we\u2019re all trying to understand. I think there are a couple of salient reasons why they\u2019re different. We don\u2019t see significant bubbles having been created out of this very long, low grinding growth rates. The banks are in awfully good shape and a lot of the regulations are ensuring very fulsome capital ratios in that regard. We have not yet seen any form of inflation and the prospect that we could get a couple of quarter point interest rate increases doesn\u2019t feel like the thing that will derail an economic growth at this point.","Europe seems to be mending, albeit on a slow basis and a frustratingly slow basis. India is clearly getting better but it\u2019s not big enough to make a difference worldwide. South America is just a washout, let me just take that and put on the side. So, the issue really gets to be how much more a negative impact does China have upon global growth. And that\u2019s a hard one to put our fingers on. I would say in addition if you look at some of the other issues that we think are influencing things is very big currency changes. It clearly affected capacity assessment. If you were a person exporting out of U.S. at the beginning of this year versus now, you\u2019re 18% less competitive. That has caused a lot of people to back up. At some point that capacity appraisal will be made and people decide what they\u2019re going to do.","And then the last item which we\u2019ve almost all forgotten about is with natural gas dropped two-three years ago, people speculated on the reindustrialization in United States. We cautioned at that time that that\u2019s going to take five years because designing these plants and building these plants and putting them into production is a five year cycle. Guess what, end of \u201816 and early \u201817 is when a lot of that starts. And so there is a phase of construction going to come here in the country that\u2019s going to be of a very large size and that is traditionally an area where Eaton has participated quite well but it\u2019s not quite yet.","So again, we don\u2019t see this very slow grinding recession that doesn\u2019t have a monetary crisis attached to it, we don\u2019t see a reason why that goes dramatically negative. But it is a difficult, frustrating, grinding environment, and that\u2019s why we say again, our strategy has to be built upon on this point. We\u2019re not going to change the markets but we can get our cost down and we can drive superlative cash flow performance that gives us the ability, both to maintain a strong dividend, buy back shares and invest in the business selectively where it makes sense.","John Inch","And Sandy, is China really what you\u2019re going to be watching here? In other words, based on your experience, I realize you\u2019re not economist but is there one or two things you\u2019re really going to be focusing on in the coming months to discern if the down 1% to 2% is the scenario or in fact it gets worse like more of a classical recession?","Sandy Cutler","We have to watch because we\u2019re in a couple of different lines of this. We\u2019ve got to watch a bunch of different things. But I think the likelihood we\u2019re going to see these commodity businesses change substantially during 2016 is probably pretty low. So you talk about ag and construction and mining et cetera. So, we\u2019ll be watching industrial investment, industrial capacity, MRO spending. I think those are issues that will help inform all of us as to what\u2019s the nature of this going to be. I suspect that residential and light commercial, non-residential constructions will be relatively steady. I think it\u2019s going to be more around this industrial side that is going to be the area to watch.","Don Bullock","Unfortunately we have run out of time for our question session today. But we\u2019ll be available to answer questions following up the call today. But I want to thank you all for joining us. We appreciate your time. And as I said, we\u2019ll be able to address your follow-up questions afterwards. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

Welcome to the Eaton First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Don Bullock. Please go ahead.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's first quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer.","The agenda today as typical will include opening remarks from Craig highlighting the results in the quarter along with our outlook for 2017. As we've done in our past calls, we'll also be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through today after some initial technical delays were posted on our website at www.eaton.com.","Please note that the press release and the presentation do include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this, today's call will also be available for replay after the call. Before we get started, I do want to remind you that our comments today do include forward-looking statements and the actual results may differ from those and that any of those risks and uncertainties are outlined in our related 8-K that's filed.","With that, I'll turn it over to Craig.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thanks, Don. Hey, we're very pleased with our Q1 results. As you've seen, net income and operating EPS coming in at $0.96 per share and 13% above the midpoint of our guidance which was $0.85 a share. And we're especially pleased to see the return to positive revenue growth in the quarter. This quarter represents the first quarter in over eight quarters where revenue growth is positive and reflects improving market conditions in many of our businesses with real acceleration in the month of March.","Organic revenues were up 2% with ForEx being a negative 1% in the quarter. Segment margins were 14.4%, and we'll speak in more detail about this later in the presentation, but excluding restructuring costs of $17 million in the quarter, segment operating margins were 14.8%.","We also had very strong cash flow in the quarter of $463 million which was a Q1 record. And this does include a $100 million contribution that we made to our U.S. qualified pension fund in the quarter. In addition, we repurchased $255 million or 3.6 million shares in the quarter and increased our quarterly dividend from $0.57 to $0.60 per share and we announced this back in February.","Turning to page 4, we've outlined the major drivers of the Q1 EPS results which exceeded our guidance which we, as you'll recall, was $0.85 at the midpoint. And the real story here is revenue. Organic revenues were up slightly below 2% but approximately 3 points higher than our original guidance. And as you'll recall, our guidance for net revenues were going to be down 1.5%. FX was also 1% less negative than our original guidance of 1.5%.","Total restructuring costs in the quarter were actually $20 million, with $17 million of that in the reporting segments, which was about $6 million lower than our original plans. And we'll talk more about the restructuring program for Q1 and the remainder of the year later in the presentation.","Finally, total corporate expenses were up about $0.02, driven by largely pension expense in","the quarter which was slightly higher than we anticipated. But on balance, we think a very strong performance really led by the increase in volume.","Quickly looking at segment income statement. As we mentioned, organic growth was up 2%, driven principally by strength in Hydraulics and Electrical Products segment offsetting about 1% negative FX overall. Segment operating profits were up 4% or $30 million in the quarter to $700 million. And excluding the impact of restructuring costs, segment margins were down about 30 basis points from Q1 of 2016 but at 14.8%.","As we discussed when we provided guidance for Q1, we did see commodity cost inflation in the quarter that in many ways largely offset some of the additional restructuring benefits that we would ordinarily have seen flow thorough, but we do expect this issue to wash out by time we hit the second a half of the year. So we see it as largely a first half issue, and between the work that we're doing around cost and pricing, we don't expect to see this impact linger on into the second half of 2017. Overall, restructuring expenses declined from $63 million in Q1 2016 to $20 million in Q1 2017, with a portion once again reflected in the segment results declining from $59 million to $17 million respectively.","Turning to Electrical Products segment, revenues were up 2% with organic revenues up 3%, so you have 1% negative FX. And revenues were up in all regions, consistent with the pattern that we've been seeing, where we saw strength in residential products and lighting. What's really new this quarter is the strength that we experienced in industrial controls, and particularly in the European market.","Orders were up 3% in the quarter. We saw growth in the U.S. and in Europe. Residential products were up low double digits. Lighting was up low single digits. Industrial controls was up low single digit. And the areas of strength were particularly offset by some weakness that we saw in single-phase power quality, largely a result of a onetime order that we had in Q1 of 2016. Order growth in Q4 2016 was also up 3%, so this is really a continuation of the pattern that we've seen in our Electrical Products segment. We're also very pleased with the operating margins at 17.4%, or 17.6% excluding restructuring costs, up some 50 basis points over Q1 2016.","And looking at Electrical Systems and Services, organic revenues were flat in the quarter, and we see this as really good news after eight quarters of consecutive revenue declines. ForEx was down 1%. Sales in the quarter continued to be impacted by weakness in what we call large industrial projects, and in the oil and gas segment, so very much consistent with what you've likely seen from others and heard from others.","Regionally, we saw strength in Europe and Asia. We also experienced strength in the Americas in commercial assemblies, and in three-phase power quality. Our orders in the quarter were flat. We saw notable order strength however in Asia, offsetting continued weakness in the Americas and in Europe. And I will point out though, flat orders in the quarter, this does compare to a 7% decline in Q4 of 2016, so perhaps an inflection point.","Margins were down 30 basis points year-on-year to 11.6%, down 90 basis points to 11.8% when you exclude restructuring costs. And so we do continue to experience a negative margin impact as large industrial projects and oil and gas remain weak in this segment.","On to Hydraulics, and perhaps in the biggest story in the quarter, as it appears that markets are showing significant improvement. Organic revenue was up 9% in the quarter following strength in orders that we noted in Q4, and orders were up 22% in Q1 on strength in what we saw in really all regions of the world with particular strength in Asia followed by Europe. And the order strength really extended both to the OEM and the distribution channels, and both were up double digit, so really a broad-based strengthening in our Hydraulics business.","Segment operating margins continued to improve. They were up 280 basis points over Q1 of 2016, at 10.2%, and excluding restructuring costs up 150 basis points year-on-year to 11.8%. And this improvement reflects the continued benefit that we're seeing from the restructuring program for sure. But I'd also note that it's been somewhat mitigated by a regional mix impact from stronger revenue growth in Asia-Pacific where margins tend to be modestly below those in North America.","Turning to Aerospace, organic revenues in the quarter were down 1%, with foreign exchange down 3% in the quarter. This is primarily a function of the weak British pound where we have a major presence. We experienced weakness in military aftermarket and military rotorcraft, bizjets and regional jets, I think pretty much consistent with what you've heard from other companies, and this was offset by strength that we continue to see in commercial transport and also in commercial aftermarket.","Orders were up 2% in the quarter on strength in commercial transport, commercial aftermarket, military rotorcraft, biz and bizjets, and this was particularly offset by weakness in military transport, fighters and particularly in NRE, our customer reimbursed engineering expenses. And excluding NRE, orders were actually up 6% in the quarter. So we think that's a really encouraging sign in our Aerospace business, and we continue to see strong margin performance out of the segment with operating margins at 18.5%, or 18.7% when you exclude restructuring costs.","And lastly in our Vehicle segment, organic revenues declined 2% in the quarter, largely driven by weakness in NAFTA heavy duty production which was down some 20% in the quarter. You'll recall that in 2016, the year started quite strong and weakened significantly as the year progressed, so the comps do get easier from this point forward. So we'd expect that, relatively speaking, Q1 was our most challenging comparable versus last year.","Margins in the quarter were at 13.7%, 14% excluding restructuring, down about 240 basis points from prior year. And while largely consistent with our guidance, margins were below normal for two unusual items. First, I'd say we're ramping up the Procision medium duty transmission, and volumes are not yet at scale. So we're still running some inefficiencies there. And secondly, we did have a warranty issue in the quarter, that also depressed margins. So we'd expect things to improve from this point forward.","Page 11 is a summary of the revenue guidance for the year, and as a result of strength that we experienced in Q1, we're increasing our growth expectation in three of our segments, in Electrical Products, Electrical Systems and Services, and in Hydraulics. And in all three businesses, revenues and orders came in above expectations in Q1.","We've also generally seen better than expected conditions in a number of the end markets that are important to each of these businesses, and we're increasing, at the midpoint then, our guidance for Electrical Products by 1 point, in Electrical Systems and Services by 2 points, and in Hydraulics by 6 points. Our view is unchanged for the other two businesses. Now these three changes take the midpoint of guidance for Eaton to \u2013 up 2% for the year, 2 points higher than our prior guidance.","Now turning our attention to restructuring, we thought it would be helpful to provide a bit more guidance on the pattern of restructuring spending for the remainder of the year, since the pattern of this year's spending is somewhat different than what we've seen in prior years. If you'll recall, we pulled forward $70 million of spending originally planned for 2017 into Q4 of 2016, and that resulted in our Q1 spending being somewhat lower than it would have otherwise been, with a step-up in restructuring beginning in Q2. So we outlined this plan on page 12, our expectations for spending for the entire year. And consistent with prior guidance, we expect to spend $100 million this year, and we'll obtain $155 million of incremental benefits in 2017 over 2016.","In Q1, we spent $20 million, modestly below our plan of $26 million, primarily driven by the timing of a couple projects that were shifted into Q2. In Q2, we plan to spend $40 million, with the remaining $40 million for the year planned in the second half. Overall, our restructuring plan remains on track. As we reported earlier, we expect, on an all-in basis, the program to cost $440 million, and to see benefits of approximately $520 million.","Page 13 is a summary of our segment margin guidance for the year. In Hydraulics, due to strength that we're seeing in markets and higher volumes that we now expect, we're raising the midpoint of our guidance by 40 basis points. Overall, other than Hydraulics, we think that each of our businesses are within the margin ranges that we guided to for the year. And due to the relative size of Hydraulics business, the change in Hydraulics margins does not change the overall margin guidance for the company for the year.","And the other thing I would point out, and as a point perhaps of clarification, as a matter of practice, we would intend to change our margin guidance only when we believe our performance will be outside of the ranges provided, and this holds true for each of the business segments individually and for the company overall.","And on page 14, we've provided the customary summary of our guidance for both the year and subsequent quarters and, as we've covered most of these numbers in prior slides, I'll just summarize by indicating what's changed. First, a $0.15 increase in the midpoint of our guidance, with a new range of $4.45 to $4.60, a 2 point increase in the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Also a change from our prior guidance, we think FX will be negative $150 million for the year, and this is down from our prior guidance which was $300 million, and all other items remained unchanged from prior guidance.","Turning to Q2, we expect EPS to be between $1.05 and $1.15 with $1.10 midpoint, organic revenue growth to be up 1% to 2%, negative FX to be negative 1.5%, and segment margins between 15.2% and 15.6%. And this does include restructuring cost. And lastly, a tax rate of between 8% and 9%. I'd also note that this guidance does not include any impact from the recently announced JV with Cummins, as we continue to expect that the JV will close sometime in Q3.","And lastly, page 15 is a summary of the key points covered in today's presentation. And I'll just close by stating that we're encouraged by the signs of improvement that we're seeing in a number of our end markets, and we generally feel better about growth prospects for the year. We would naturally expect this to translate into higher EPS and that's our expectation, and that's what's reflected in our guidance. Our cash flows remain strong. Our share repurchase plan is on track, as is our restructuring program.","So we remain cautiously optimistic that 2017 continues to represent a turning point for a number of our end markets, and a turning point for our company. So I'll stop there and turn it back to Don.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","The operator is going to provide for us instructions for the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our first question today comes from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So it's nice to see the Hydraulics numbers pick up so quickly, but I have to ask, can you satisfy demand that quickly in a segment you've been restructuring aggressively? I mean, I assume your supply chain as well, and are you comfortable, at least, you can ramp up production fast enough?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes. I'd say the short answer to the question is Scott, it will certainly take a concerted effort and good execution by our team. But we're ready for this turn. We've been living as you know in down markets in Hydraulics for the better part of three years and so our team is ready, willing and able to take on the volume challenges that we're facing. And so at this point, we're comfortable that Eaton, and we're working obviously through our supply chain to make sure that they're ready as well. But our team is ready for it.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And just on ESS, when you think about the oil and gas markets, and specifically pointing to commonly oil and gas markets negatively impacting margin. I assume that's a big part of that's Crouse-Hinds. But help us understand the mix of your oil and gas onshore\/offshore and if you expect that to come back in 2Q. So I think a lot of your peers have already seen a somewhat meaningful snapback at least in the onshore stuff that's short cycle like that.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Want to take it, Rick?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. Scott, it's Rick. Our mix historically has been more downstream than upstream and so we aren't as impacted by improvements on the upstream side. We have not really seen our upstream activities accelerate at this point. We're looking for it. We have seen a little bit of improvement in MRO in the harsh and hazardous space and even in the industrial controls that go into some of the onshore rigs particularly. But we have not seen any broad-based pickup yet on the project side.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Good luck, guys. Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. This is actually Evelyn Chow on for Joe. Maybe just turning to ESS for a second, very encouraging to see maybe some incipient signs of stabilization or recovery. But it looks like the project business hasn't picked up much yet. Does your higher organic guide imply any acceleration there? Or is it sort of flowing through things as status quo?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, at this point it does not. I mean, we came into the year with what we'd say is a relatively well-grounded assumption around the way large projects would unfold through for year and to date I'd say it's largely playing out the way we anticipated. So we do not have a return to growth in large projects built into the second half of the year.","Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful context, Craig. And then maybe just turning to price costs for a second. Totally understand the dynamic of maybe things normalizing, but in the second half. Just wanted to see how that squared with your previous expectation of about $80 million of material inflation in 2017.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, appreciate the question. Certainly, as you pointed out, we did come into the year anticipating about $80 million of let's call it uncovered commodity price inflation that we would experience in the business and we'd indicated that that would be largely a first half issue. And that's largely what we've seen. We saw it certainly come through in Q1. We came into the year with an expectation that commodity prices would start high and we'd see some mitigation in commodity prices as the year unfolded. That is still largely our belief that number one, commodity prices will probably mitigate as the year unfolds, but more importantly, we'll have some time under our belt and we will have essentially been able to offset this commodity price with price increases in the marketplace. And that is largely still our anticipation. It is mostly a second half event and that is the plan that our teams are currently executing towards.","Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, guys. Congrats on a good quarter.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Could you just give us a little bit more color on the Hydraulics business? On the orders, if you could break out maybe by region, mobile or construction versus ag, mobile versus distribution, and then just around the world. And then a follow-up, Craig, you highlighted the industrial controls, Europe, as up. If you could just give us a little bit more color in that also, I'd appreciate it.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, I'd say, Ann, if you think about Hydraulics orders and you obviously know this market well, and what we've seen is largely a relatively pronounced snapback beginning in the Asia-Pacific region, largely in mobile markets. Those markets have been down and down hard over a period of multiple years. And so clearly, the biggest strength that we're seeing today inside of Hydraulics is coming out of the China market and largely coming out of the mobile market on the construction side of the business. But having said that, Europe was also quite strong and stronger than what we anticipated. And there too, a lot of the growth was in the mobile segment. But also we saw strength in the industrial segment as well.","And so I would say that in general, the recovery in Hydraulics has been relatively broad-based, but principally led by mobile, construction. But also I'd say equally balanced between what we're seeing today in both the OEM channel and the distribution channel, which we find quite encouraging. We also, in doing a bit of a channel check, we think today that the distribution channel is selling through, that we're not building inventory at this point in the cycle, so we're really encouraged by the outlook, so.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then the comment on Europe industrial controls, Craig.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, I think we see that more broadly, and as I mentioned in the commentary, what's really changed today in our Electrical Products business is the fact that industrial controls, we're seeing pretty broad-based strength in those markets. And I would argue that a lot of that strength quite frankly that we're seeing in industrial control is a function again of what's happening in the China market. As those markets continue to improve, we see industrial controls in Europe really picking up a lot of that equipment that actually flows into China. But even in the domestic market, we're continuing to see strength in industrial controls. Too early to say exactly how this unfolds longer term, but certainly a pretty broad-based basis of strength around the world in industrial controls in Q1.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is that fair to say, Craig, just the ISM PMIs in Europe have been strengthening? I mean GDP in Europe's strengthening. Is that underlying what you're seeing over there?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes. And I'd say, yeah, we're certainly seeing perhaps even more underlying strength in many of our end markets than the PMIs would suggest, and industrial production would suggest, which tells us perhaps some of that is also tied to what's going on in markets outside of Europe, namely what's going on in China. But in general, what we've seen across each of our businesses, and I think what we've generally seen in industry, is that Europe turned out to be much stronger than most of us anticipated.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Yes. That's what I was thinking you would say. So I'll get back in line. I appreciate the color.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thanks, Ann.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Hi. Morning. Just one more on ESS, I'm afraid. I guess this question would be really around the margin progression through the year. The margins were down a bit in the first quarter with flattish sales, so when you're thinking about your guidance for up margins for the year as a whole, is that because it's what you see in your backlog today, and that gives you six to nine months of visibility? Or is it really just basic stuff around the restructuring charges comp from late 2016, the commodity cost headwind abating in the second half? That sort of thing.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes. I think, Julian, it's more the latter of that today. We have been undertaking a fairly significant restructuring effort in our Electrical Systems and Services business, and those benefits certainly improve as the year unfolds. Secondly, we talked about the commodity inflation issue that we're dealing with, and so we certainly saw in our Electrical Systems and Services business, like we did for the balance of the company, we saw commodity price inflation that also that we were not able to offset with price increases or other cost-out measures in Q1. And that also begins to mitigate itself as the year unfolds as well. So we think it's largely, those are the reasons why we're confident that our margins will improve in Electrical Systems and Services. And also, volume tends to grow as well, and we tend to be more back end focused from a volume standpoint in Electrical Systems and Services. And that will help margins as well.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Thanks. And then just switching over to Vehicles, you had a nice sequential increase in revenue in the first quarter, so back to some kind of normal seasonality, perhaps. Could you discuss a little bit your expectations for the balance of the year in terms of truck versus light vehicle? I think a lot of companies had a very strong first quarter for light vehicle supply chain. To what extent do you think that persists through the balance of the year? And maybe give any color you can on the truck side, the build rate plans of the OEMs?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes. First maybe on light vehicle markets around the world, and I'd say they continued to perform and hold up very well. And quite frankly, we've been surprising by the size of the strength in certain markets, principally I'd say Europe, where markets were quite strong in Q1. And so at this juncture, we'd say there's no real reason to suggest that light vehicle markets around the world are going to turn out to be any different than what we anticipated when we set our plan for the year, which was to be essentially flat to up slightly. So we remain very much convinced that that forecast will hold to be true.","With respect to the NAFTA heavy duty production, I mean right now if you take a look at the production schedule for last year, it was essentially a year where we started quite strong, and we saw weakness in the back half of the year. And today, most of the indicators are that the NAFTA Class 8 market is strengthening. And so we think, as I mentioned in the commentary, that Q1 represented the most difficult comparable where production was down 20%, and we think that things essentially begin to improve from this this point forward. And so our number for NAFTA Class 8 is flat for the year. There are a whole multitude of forecasts out there, some of which are lower, some of which are higher. But we remain convinced that flat is the right call on the North America Class 8 market for 2017.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","And Julian, in the context of flat, this is how we think about the market. We think that, or at least ACT data is that production was 51,000 units in Q1, and by the time you get to the back half of the year, we think you're going to see production per quarter in the neighborhood of 60,000 units, and that's how you get to flat. Now, if you actually look at the straight build plans that we collect, they would actually total to a bit more than flat, but we think it's a little early to make that firm conclusion.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","And then the build plan typically is above the market, so it would be very much consistent with pattern historically.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Very helpful. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to dig into lighting. Obviously, we've seen a couple of your big competitors in North America report somewhat disappointing trends. Your quarter had low single digit growth, I think, in orders. I'm just wondering if maybe just shine a bit of light on lighting pricing, and maybe the impact on margins this quarter from any price pressure you saw.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, no, what we saw, the way I'd characterize the underlying performance of our lighting business and what we're seeing, Nigel, is this really continues to perform in line with the patterns that we've seen. A lot of lighting, it's going into non-res construction, into commercial buildings. It's going into residential housing. And so we think lighting to be up low single digits is very much in line with what we've seen from the market, and very much what we expect going forward. And if you think about the key industries that essentially drive that market, we don't expect it to perform any differently.","To your question around margins, clearly we continue to see the price of LED underlying technologies come down. That's being \u2013 many ways being passed on to the marketplace, and so we continue to get cost out of lighting. That is largely in line with the underlying reduction in the input costs, and our underlying margins overall in our lighting business actually continued to improve.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. So I think the NEMA data is calling for lighting to be flat to down this quarter. I think actually down (32:17). Is there anything in your footprint, be it new construction versus replacement, or resi versus C&I, that would explain that performance? Or do you think you're gaining share like-for-like?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Right. If I could just make a comment, Nigel. The NEMA data is not inclusive of the entire market, and so it's a subset of the participants, and so you got to take that data with a little grain of salt. And so, as we create our own index of the lighting market, we use the NEMA data and then we use some estimates of what other participants likely have done, and our belief is that the market is growing in the low to mid single digit kind of category.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","We'd be disappointed if we weren't gaining a little share. That's certainly the expectation.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. Okay. That's interesting. And just a couple of quick ones. Rick, why would the second half tax rates be higher? I mean, that's obviously what's embedded in guidance. And then maybe just call out the impact of the warranty true-up this quarter in Vehicle.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","The tax rate is, largely this year, a function of the mix, and so as we start seeing seasonally higher growth and also seasonally higher earnings in the U.S., that typically is what pushes the rate up a bit, as well as in Brazil. We expect that economy to improve as we go across the year. So that's the major impact. If you're asking about the \u2013 are you asking?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Warranty.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","On the warranty in truck, the Vehicle impact in the first quarter was about $8 million \u2013 let me get you the exact number. $6 million. That was the impact in the first quarter.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. Thanks.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just one little follow-up on lighting. Was there a distinction in your growth rate between non-res and resi, or between large projects and smaller projects on the non-res side?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, Jeff. I don't really have the data. I don't believe there was, but we can certainly take that as a follow-up, and Don can follow up with you after the call. But I don't believe that we saw any significant difference in our performance. I mean, large projects in general are pretty much following the pattern that we've seen, and in general, there's fewer very large industrial projects in general. But I'd say that that's not what drives most of our lighting business. It's more the commercial projects and street lighting and resi, and we've not seen, I don't think, any significant difference in the pattern of sales or orders in those segments.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Great, and just talk to kind of the margin guide not moving. I'm just wondering if there's some headwind. My rough math, 2 points of organic growth at a 30% incremental is kind of 60 bps of margin, and your margin guide range for the year is 60 bps. So it does seem like the better revenue should have knocked you outside of the range. I mean, maybe 30% incrementals at this sales level is not the right number, or there's something else, but how should I think about that?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes. I'm not sure what, the calculus that you're doing, Jeff, but in our own calculus, which is reflected in our guidance, we think we are still within the range, and that's kind of the basis for the guidance that we provided. We don't think that the volume changes and the other assumptions take us outside of the range that we've indicated.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you. I'll follow up.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Curious about your thinking now that Hydraulics looks like it's clearly bottoming and getting better, how do we think about what sort of more normalized margins in that segment might look like given all the cost saves that you've done there?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","What we said, Steve, about Hydraulics is that if you think about this business, we said that we established a range of profitability of 13% to 16%, and we said that even at the bottom of the economic cycle post restructuring \u2013 and I will point out that we're not done with restructuring yet; we still have the balance of 2017 to get through \u2013 is at the very minimum that you could expect this business to deliver at any point in the economic cycle 13%. And we're still very much convinced that that's the case, and then we said from that point forward, you could expect obviously margins to ramp from that point, and you could expect probably pretty good incrementals on that. So at this point, we're not prepared to go outside of those ranges that we've established. We have to, first of all, get into those ranges and demonstrate and prove that we can sustain that, but that's still where we're parked on the business. We think it's 13% to 16% through the cycle.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. And then I think, Craig, you mentioned in the outset that the cadence of the quarter was positive and that March was a big month for you. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I'm curious as you look at that, it sounds to me sort of across the board that North America was kind of the weaker of all the geographic markets. And I'm curious if you're seeing signs that North America is actually sort of starting to participate in the green shoots that we're seeing here.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I think it's accurate, first, to say that we definitely saw an acceleration in the rate of growth in the month of March, and that really was pretty much across the board in all regions and in all businesses. But I will say to the point around the U.S. market, the Americas market versus rest of world, I'd say that we continue to see more robust growth outside of the U.S., and that pattern is really I think largely continuing.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. A follow up on tax rate, I think your long-term outlook is roughly for 1 point of increase a year. If the mix progression that you have into the second half outlook holds, would we be looking at a little bit greater magnitude of tax rate increase for 2018?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Wow that's, yeah, I haven't looked at that specifically. I mean clearly, the biggest mover on our rate is the mix, the geographic mix, the two biggest factors being the U.S. and Brazil, which are the countries that currently have the highest tax rate. I don't know what the tax rate is likely to end up with after the administration finishes its work in the States. And so really, that's how I'd have you think about it. To the extent that Europe and Asia continue to grow faster than the U.S., then no, you wouldn't have a negative mix impact on the rate. But if that flips around and the U.S. does start to accelerate, perhaps because of infrastructure programs or a tax cut that causes an increase in business investment, then yes. You might see the rate edge up a little faster.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Andrew Krill with RBC.","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","On the lower restructuring in the quarter, and I guess just specifically, which segments saw less than planned?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Andrew, we didn't catch the first part of your question.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Caught that in the middle. Can you repeat it?","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Sorry. On the, back to the restructuring. Could you give some more specifics on I guess which segments saw less than expected, and if this kind of had anything to do with maybe trying to avoid interrupting any orders on the verge of a possible recovery?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, it's a $6 million delta from the original plan, Andrew. And I'd say that probably most of that delta was in the Electrical side of the house.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Systems and Services.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Systems and Services.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","And really, it had to do with projects that we thought could get done but got moved into Q2.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Right. So really, it had nothing do with us interrupting orders. It was simply our ability to kind of get everything done and booked in the quarter.","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Got it. And then just kind of with demand seemingly on the verge of a recovery broadly speaking, is there any chance that you may not need to do all the restructuring you currently have planned? Or could that be tamped down?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","What I'd say, a lot of what we're doing, Andrew, as we talked about in the past, is that we're making structural changes to the businesses, things that will fundamentally lower our structural costs inside the company. That doesn't in any way prevent us from flexing our businesses and growing as volumes go up over time. And so, no, we think that this restructuring plan independent of volume is the right plan and really does position our businesses and the company to deliver just higher margins through the cycle and at all points of the cycle.","Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Rob McCarthy here. I guess the first question is just an update on kind of your outlook for M&A as a whole, because I think Craig, when we spoke in the February timeframe, I think you cited expensive valuations across the board. That's continued, and you can see that in kind of the slow rate of global M&A overall. And then I think, Rick, when we sat down, I think there was some ambient concern around, well let's just say, achieving cost synergies, particularly in an environment where it seems globally people are a lot more zealous about protecting the raw material of cost synergies often, which is workers, unfortunately. So could you just talk about how you look at the M&A environment right now? Is it just incrementally worse? And does this kind of push you to really think about doing other things with your cash right now?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes. I'll take that, Rob. Clearly, valuations are still high. But of course, earnings growth is accelerating and that is definitely improving over time how you look at these valuations. Secondly, we have seen just in the last several months, we have seen more and more situations where it appears that a sale could be possible. And so we have become more active at looking at opportunities. Hard to know at the end of the day what, if anything, we end up getting done. But as you know, we have had a long history of completing a significant number of acquisitions and we think we're pretty good at it, and so we are now devoting more time to looking at opportunities.","To the comment about synergies, it's very hard to tell to what extent there will be any institutional constraints on achieving cost synergies. It does appear that the commentary around that has subsided quite a bit and so we'll just have to look at each situation on its own merits to decide whether we're comfortable with the synergy possibilities.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just any kind of, and I might have missed. This might have already been covered in the context of the call, but any update from your perspective on the JV with Eaton Cummins and kind of the messaging there because I think there was an update today. Anything incrementally you want to add on this call?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, and I'd say not really. I think we, in the call that we had, we laid out the strategic rationale for the joint venture and we're excited about the prospects that it will add and what it'll do to accelerate the growth rate in our automated transmission businesses. And at this point we do expect that the transaction will close in Q3. There's actually seven antitrust filings that we have to make and that's really the long lead time item that we're working through right now. But we remain optimistic that Q3 is the right timing and we think it really does strategically advantage our transmission business going forward.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Okay. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good morning.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, just a question on the Hydraulics business, just a version of normalized margin question. A, do you think you can continue to post positive order growth through the end of the year? And B, if you look at the normalized volume for this business, where are we relative to normalized volume, 80%, 70%, 60%?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, Andrew, I think that's the $64,000 question regarding the future and whether or not we're at kind of this key turning point in Hydraulics markets. I can just tell you, based upon history, for those of us who have been around this industry for a long time, you typically go through pretty long upcycles. And all indications are we're at the front end of an upcycle in Hydraulics. And so our expectation would be that orders continue to be positive throughout the balance of the year. But at this point, we think well, let's see how Q2 unfolds. But at this point, we are certainly optimistic that that will be the case. The other half of your question had to do with?","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, I think it was sort of where we are relative to normalized volume.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes. Sure.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just \u2013 yeah, sorry.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","No, I think on that question, I'd say relative to normalized volume, I'd say we're probably still some 25% percent below what we'd call the normalized volume for those markets. And so I think we have a long way to run before we get back to what we'd say would be kind of a normal level of market activity.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just to follow up on Hydraulics, historically you've had very strong exposure to agriculture. Can you provide some color, what you're seeing in those markets and how much is contributing to the order strength? Because I think on the construction, it's more apparent.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, we had strong orders in agriculture as well in the quarter, Andrew. But one other comment I might make just to talk about the order pattern across the year, that there is a question of the extent to which the very strong orders in China continue. You probably saw the data. Excavator sales, for example, are up very dramatically and so that is one factor that certainly you could see coming down a little bit. The growth still being very positive, but perhaps not quite as positive as it was in the first quarter. So that's one thing that we're looking out for as the year progresses.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning, Andy.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Near term question, and you may have just answered it, Rick, but the Q2 revenue guidance implies, well it includes 1% to 2% organic versus 2% in Q1. Clearly it's slight, but it implies a deceleration. I'm trying to understand the drivers behind that. Is it end market, like the China comment that you just made? Or is it something else, like fewer business days?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, I guess the way I would characterize it, Andy, is that the first quarter rounded up to 2%, but it was between 1.5% and 2%. And so our guidance for Q2 really implies, essentially, very similar kind of organic growth in Q2 to Q1.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","The other thing I would add, Andy, that part of perhaps the hesitancy that you're seeing from us and others is that March was a very strong month, and so that's a real question, to what extent did what we experience in March, was it a function of the fact that Easter fell in April this year versus March, and is there a normalization of what happened in the month of March? And so, at this point, we're a little bit hesitant to make a more robust call, because March was such a big piece of the quarter.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, Craig. I'm going to take the bait within that response. It's kind of somewhat related. Eaton has a very diverse view of the U.S. market, and per your comments, March being very strong globally, we've seen some deceleration in PMIs in the U.S. in April. I'm just wondering if the company has seen any similar deceleration in April relative to March?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","No, actually we haven't at this point. I mean the month of April is unfolded largely as we anticipated, but once again, as you can see from our guidance, what we anticipated was a Q2 that would largely look like Q1.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then squeeze one last in. Just a clarification on ESS. Understand large project activity in oil and gas, you called out as remaining weak. Just wondering, within that segment, did any end market demand actually get worse? Or is what we're seeing in that commentary more a function of comparisons?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","I would say it's largely a function of comparisons. The three-phase power quality market had had some very large orders in the prior year. And so that, with ESS, you didn't see orders that totally replaced those strong three-phase orders. But other than that, there really wasn't anything that got worse.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Other than perhaps the Middle East was.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Well, okay. Fair.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","We saw some weakness in the Middle East as well.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, which is not a giant part of the business. But clearly in Saudi Arabia, for example, there is some softness.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Just one more on 2Q guidance. It looks like you're calling for about segment margins to be flat, and you had a good lift in 1Q and your guide has a nice lift. So anything within the 2Q guide, whether it be restructuring, timing, or savings timing, that would support more flattish margins versus the lift?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","The only thing I would say, Jeff, we talked about this issue of commodity prices versus price realization in the marketplace versus other cost out initiatives, and I'd say that's probably the one issue that we continue to work through, that is holding back margins being stronger in Q2. We have a plan. As we mentioned to you, that issue essentially mitigates and solves itself by the time we get to the second half of the year. But that continues to be a pressure point in Q2.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And if I could slip one more in, in ESS, you cited the strength in Asia. What's driving that, particularly?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I'd say we're seeing broad strength across the board in the Asia market. And whether it's the stimulus spending that the Chinese government is pumping into the economy, whether it's the monetary policy, we are generally seeing across the board strength in the Asia market, and tough to tell exactly what's driving it, but it's pretty broad based.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Hey, Craig, the $80 million of raws headwinds, is there any \u2013 or (54:21) \u2013 is there any way to parse out how much was in the first quarter, and maybe a little bit of color by segment? Or was it more weighted?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","And I would really \u2013 I'd say, rather not parse it. We're seeing it across the board in each of our businesses. The front end of the pressures were probably more electrical-centric. Of late, they're more industrial-centric, but I think we're really seeing it across the board in each of our businesses. And I'd, at this point, as we talked about the absolute size of the number, we said essentially it was about offsetting the restructuring benefits, and so it was certainly a material number.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And the reason, Craig, we're not raising prices in response is because we expect these costs basically to be transitory, is that how the market thinks? Or is there some other reason?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","No, the way I'd say, the way you should think about it is that we are in fact raising prices, but it takes time, number one. And secondly, one of the big challenges was, as we talked about in the last earnings call and guidance for the year, commodity prices were highly volatile, and up and down from one day to the next, and so you have to get to a period of stability where you actually understand exactly where the commodities are going to settle before you can really have an intelligent conversation with customers around taking prices up. So we had to get to a point of stability before we could actually implement price increases. But, so we're going to, between price increases and other cost-out measures, we'd expect this commodity inflation issue to go away in the second half of the year","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, no. That makes sense. By the way, how did within Vehicle, how did auto do? And can you remind us what your auto build assumptions are for the year?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes. Auto did well by the way and largely on the back of continued strength in China and in surprising strength quite frankly in what we saw in Europe, where the, I read card registrations were up quite nicely in the European market. So I'd say by and large, the market's doing fine. The overall build assumption, we said it would be flat to up slightly.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Flat to up slightly.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","And that encompassed the U.S. being down just modestly. And so things are playing out, if anything, maybe a little better than we thought because of the non-U.S. production.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","And principally, Europe with more than anything. That's really the market that surprised on the upside in Q1.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, no, that makes sense. And maybe then just lastly, there's a lot of attention focused on these oil and gas projects, and you've called out ESS for more than one quarter, right. The question I have is, do you think these, Craig or Rick, do you think these projects can actually come back with oil prices at these levels? In other words, is it a question of just the timing? So oil holds at $50, do the projects actually come back? Or do you need a little bit more of other things to sort of stimulate the activity? And maybe with the answer to that is, the discussions your folks may be having with people in the field, that sort of thing.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Let me take a stab at that. I mean, you have seen over the last couple of months several companies announce fairly significant downstream-type plans, and so I do think some of those projects are likely to move forward. On the upstream side, I think particularly for the very large offshore oil projects, I think that's the area that is not clear. Because unless an oil company really believes that prices are going to sustainably be at least at these levels if not a little bit higher, question, can some of those offshore, which are very big projects, can some of those make economic sense.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No, that's a fair answer. Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate it.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thank you all for joining us today. With that, I think we're going to wrap up our call. As always, we'll be available to take questions and follow up for the next couple days. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Yan Jin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Yan Jin","Good morning. I'm Yan Jin, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us today for Eaton's First Quarter 2019 Earning Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO, and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer.","Our agenda today includes the opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the Company's performance in the first quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we will be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we will go through today, have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com.","Please note that both press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is available on our website and will be available for replay.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the Company and are therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risk and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation, that are also outlined in our related 8-K filing.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Craig.","Craig Arnold","Thanks, Jin. Appreciate it. Yes, I'll begin with Page 3 and the highlights of our Q1 results, and I begin by saying, we had a good start to the year with another strong quarter of performance. Earnings per share were $1.23 on a GAAP basis and $1.26 excluding the impact of the divestiture costs related to the announced spin-off of our Lighting business.","At $1.26, our results were 15% above last year and toward the higher end of our guidance range, which as you will recall was $1.18 to $1.28. Our sales were $5.3 billion, up 4% organically and in line with our guidance, excluding the negative 3% impact from currency. And we continue to be pleased with our strong margin performance. Segment margins were 16% above the high end of our guidance range and 80 basis points over prior year.","We also generated very strong operating cash flows of $551 million in the quarter, and this is up 63% from Q1 2018 and a first quarter record. And lastly, we repurchased $150 million of shares in the quarter as part of our plan to buy back $400 million of shares in 2019. So, a very good start to the year.","Page 4 summarizes our income statement versus prior year. And I've covered most of these items in the summary comments and so I'll only point out once again, the 3% currency impact was driven primarily by the important currencies for us which are the euro, renminbi and real.","We are very pleased with our 32% incremental rate that we delivered on organic growth. And so, that number was, once again, very strong and above our expectations. And we incurred as we mentioned, the $0.03 per share from the after-tax cost primarily related to the spin of our Lighting business. And as you can see adjusted earnings per share increased from 9%.","Next, we summarize the quarterly results of our Electrical Products segment. Revenue here increased 2%, which includes 5% organic growth, partially offset by 3% currency. And we see particularly strength here in commercial and in residential construction with global growth rates in the mid-to-high single-digits and even stronger in the U.S. markets.","Our orders increased 4% led by continued stroke, strength and growth in the Americas and our backlog grew double-digits, up 13% in the quarter. Segment operating profits grew 8% and operating margins were 120 basis points increase to 18.9% and this was a record for Q1. And we are actually pleased with how well the segment is performing and the consistency of results that we continue to see in this part of the Company.","Moving to Page 6, we cover our Electrical Systems & Services results. Revenues here increased 6% with organic growth of 8%, partially offset by 2% currency and we saw especially strong double-digit revenue growth in commercial construction and in data centers.","We continued to have solid momentum in this business and the year had started on a high note for sure. You will recall that our original guidance is for sales to be up 5% to 6% organically for the year, and so we are certainly running above that rate.","As we indicated at our Investor Conference in March, we have moved to a rolling 12-month basis for reporting our orders in this long-cycle business, as well as in our Aerospace business that I'll cover soon. On a rolling 12-month basis, ES&S orders actually increased 8% with strength in all major end markets and regions.","And maybe, I'll just pause for a moment on the orders here in the Electrical Systems & Services because I know it's a particular point of question that many of you have and I will tell you that our ES&S activity level is absolutely performing in line and perhaps maybe even a little bit better than what we anticipated.","And we talked about this idea of moving to the rolling 12 months, because we do in fact see a lot of, let's say, call it lumpiness in the orders that we get in Electrical Systems & Services driven primarily by what we are seeing in hyper scale data centers.","And the other indicator that we have that gives us a lot of confidence in the strength of this business is, is what we call negotiations. And our negotiations in this business in Q1 were an all-time record and up some 56% from prior year.","And so despite what we are seeing actually in the orders and what some of you have reported to be a little bit of weakness versus what we saw in Q4, the overall underlying activity in this business continues to be very, very strong.","Our backlog continued to grow, it was up 11% in the quarter. We generated strong operating leverage with operating profits increasing 15%, only 8% volume growth and margins increasing a 100 basis points to 13.1%.","You will also recall that we announced the acquisition of the Ulusoy Electric business in January. We are pleased to have closed the purchase on April 15th and then this acquisition will certainly provide a strong platform for us as we serve our customers in EMEA and the Asia-Pacific markets. So once again, a really strong performance in our Electrical Systems & Services business and we continue to be quite bullish on the - for the outlook for that business as we go forward.","On the next Page, we summarize our Hydraulics results for Q1. Revenues were down 3%, with 1% organic growth more than offset by a 4% currency. I'll certainly note that we had some tough comps in this business at 6% organic growth in Q1 2018, but revenue did slow slightly more than we expected, but I would probably note here only slightly more than what we had in our original plans for the year.","Organic growth of 1% reflected continued growth in construction equipment, but some declines in Ag and in industrial equipment. Our orders stepped down 11%, driven principally by weakness in global mobile equipment markets and we also had tough comps here as well from last year, where orders were up some 14%.","Backlog declined 6% in the quarter as well. And as we detailed at our Investor Conference, we continue to work through some inefficiencies in the business, but do expect to see strong margin performance in this business in the second half of the year as we work off some of the efficiency issues that we experienced in the second half of last year. And segment margins were 11.7%, down 100 basis points versus last year.","And on Page 8, we summarize our Q1 results for the Aerospace business. And as you can see, this business just continues to perform at a very high level, delivering record performance across almost every single metric. Our revenues increased 10%, a 11% organic growth and 1% negative currency.","Like ES&S, we moved to a rolling 12-month basis for reporting orders. And on this basis, orders increased 18% with particular strength in commercial transport, military fighters, military transport and both commercial and military aftermarket. So really strength across the board in this segment.","Our backlog also increased significantly, up some 21% in the quarter. And lastly, we demonstrated very strong incremental margins with labor to add to a 30% increase and operating profits and a 300 basis point margin improvement in the quarter. Operating margins of 23.1%, another all-time high for the business. So in addition to the volume growth, we also experienced some favorable product mix in the quarter, but really strong execution by the team overall.","Next, I'll move to a summary of our Vehicle segment. Our revenues were down 9%, which includes 6% reduction in organic growth and a negative 3% from currency. The organic sales decline was driven by a combination of declines in like global vehicle markets, which were down 45% and the ongoing impact of revenue transfers to the Eaton Cummins joint venture.","And I will note that the joint venture actually saw revenue increases of 27% in the quarter and continues to perform very well. We also had tough comps in this business with organic growth, which increased 13% last year. But overall, this business is really performing as we have expected, but with a little bit of weakness in global automotive markets.","For the year, we continue to expect NAFTA Class 8 production to be at 324,000 units, flat with 2018. But we have lowered our outlook for light vehicle markets for the year. And lastly, despite the lower volumes, operating margins increased 30 basis points to 15.1% and a decrement of margin on the organic of less than 20%. So really strong execution by the team, once again, in our Vehicle business.","And wrapping up our segment summaries, we will cover our eMobility segment on Page 10. Revenues were up 8%, which includes 9% organic growth, partially offset by 1% currency. And as planned, we continue to accelerate our R&D spending, which increased by some 130% in the quarter. So we continue to invest heavily in this segment to participate in what we think is really an exciting growth opportunity as we move forward.","We are certainly optimistic about the opportunities in this rapidly developing market, and our pursuit pipeline for new programs has actually now grown to $1.1 billion. At our Investor Conference in March, we did announce a new program win of a $100 million mature year revenue for traction inverters with a major global OEM customer and actually in mid-April, we announced that PSA is the customer for this program.","This was our first significant event, since creating the segment about one year ago, and we are certainly ahead of our original schedule for growth in this segment and well on our way to accreting what we think is going to be a new $2 billion to $4 billion segment for the Company overall.","At this point, I'll turn to our outlook for 2019, which is on Page 11. We now expect organic revenues for all of Eaton to grow approximately 4%, down slightly from our prior midpoint of 4.5% and this is largely the result of us increasing our guidance for our long-cycle businesses by reducing guidance for our short-cycle businesses.","Specifically, we increased organic growth rates by 1% for both ES&S and Aerospace. And for Hydraulics, we lowered organic growth by 2% at the midpoint to 3% to 4% based upon some slow growth expectations in global mobile equipment markets.","And for Vehicle coming off, what I would say really was a weak Q1 in light vehicle markets, we lowered our organic growth rate by three points at the midpoint, and now we expect organic growth to be down some 4% to 5%, and once again, due to primarily the automotive side of the business itself. And we have not changed electrical products or eMobility.","And our margin expectations are noted on Page 12. We are modestly raising our guidance from 17.1% to 17.5% or 17.3% at the midpoint. We are lowering the margin expectations for Hydraulics by 60 basis points to 13.4% to 14% and for Vehicle by 90 basis points to 16.5% to 17.1% due to lower organic growth primarily. But this is more than offset by increases in Electrical Products and in Aerospace margins.","Our new expectation for Electrical Products is for margins to be between 19% and 19.6%, a 50 basis point increase at the midpoint and the new expectation for Aerospace is for margins to be 21.8% to 22.4%, also a 40 basis point increase at the midpoint. And the other two segments remain unchanged. So at the midpoint, 17.3% and this would naturally be another record level of performance for Eaton overall.","And lastly on Page 13, we summarize our guidance for Q2 and for the year. For Q2, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.45 and $1.55 and at the midpoint, this represents an 8% increase over last year. Other assumptions in our guidance include, we are expecting 4% organic growth, foreign exchange impact of roughly $100 million. Our margin expectation for the quarter is that have margins between 17.2% and 17.6%. We would expect our corporate cost to be flat with Q2 of 2018 and we would expect the tax rate of between 13.5% and 14.5%.","For the full-year 2019, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.72 to $6.02 for the midpoint of $5.87, which includes essentially a $0.02 impact from the full-year impact of the acquisition of Ulusoy overall. At the midpoint, this continues to represent a 9% increase over 2018.","Other full-year guidance assumptions include organic revenue growth of 4%. We would expect $100 million of revenue from the Ulusoy acquisition. We expect foreign exchange impact to be $300 million and this is a $50 million increase from prior guidance. We would expect, as I mentioned, segment margin of 17.3% and really no change to the other items in our forecast.","So in summary, I would say another strong start for the year in Q1. We are well positioned to deliver another year of record results and we are absolutely thrilled with the way that the Company is performing overall.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Yan for Q&A.","Yan Jin","Okay. Thanks, Craig. Before we begin the Q&A session of our call today, I do see we have members of individuals peers that in the queue is present. So given our time constraint over to be an hour today and our desire to get to as many of these questions as possible, please limit your opportunity to just one question and a follow-up.","So with that, I will turn it over to our operator to give you guys the guidance.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Yan Jin","Okay. We will take our first question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Craig, could you maybe expand on your comments on commercial and data centers being up double-digits in ES&S this quarter? We heard some conflicting news, especially in the data center side, out of the supply chain. And so any other further color you can provide there would be helpful.","Craig Arnold","Yes, now the only thing I would tell you that, overall the data center market for us continues to perform very well. We are still running as I mentioned, our revenue is up double-digit for data center sales. Activity levels continue to be quite strong. I think the piece that I - that we are trying to clarify for the sake of all of you who follow the Company, that data center orders, especially when it comes to the hyper scale, they tend to be quite lumpy.","So, you will get a big slug of orders in one quarter and they will be lighter the next quarter, and so that is why we made this decision to really move to a rolling 12 months, because we think it more accurately reflects the underlying economic activity that we are seeing in that market. But for us, we still see very good strength and data center activity overall, and we continue to think that is going to be one of our fastest growing segments.","I mentioned once again, we take a look at negotiations, which is the level which for us is a good proxy for the level of economic activity that is taking place in the market. And as I mentioned, we are really experiencing record levels of activity in our Electrical Systems & Services business, but negotiation is up 56% in the quarter to record levels. And so, by and large, we have really seen no let up in activity in Electrical Systems & Services and data centers continues to be a bright spot for us.","Joseph Ritchie","And Craig, within commercial, what are the verticals that are really driving the strength there?","Craig Arnold","Yes, I would say we are really seeing pretty broad-based strengths in the commercial businesses overall. And certainly, oil and gas is - has come back and we mentioned this to strengthen data centers. We...","Richard Fearon","Yes, for example if you look at straight up commercial like office and government, both up just over 10% institutional, just a little bit under that. But we are seeing broad-based strength in the commercial side of things. And if you look at some of the governmental data, C30 reports except for the new Dodge report Europe has seen, numbers that are high-single-digit, even low double-digits. So it, it's all pretty consistent.","Craig Arnold","Right. It's broad too and we are seeing also strength really around the world as well. And in commercial businesses in general. So it's not just in the U.S. market.","Joseph Ritchie","Now, that is helpful. Maybe my follow-on just on the Hydraulics business. You know it's interesting, because it sounded like when we had met intra-quarter, that Hydraulics had maybe gotten off to a better start in January, February. And you have talked about this, this business and all your businesses meeting to kind of earn the right to be part of the portfolio. Yet, we have taken guidance down already to start the year. And so can you just kind of contextualize how the quarter went with Hydraulics? And then also in terms of - like how it fits with the portfolio longer term?","Craig Arnold","First of all I would say, as we have talked about and recovered during our Investor Day in general, that we have some work to do to fix, what I would call some self-inflicted wounds associated with some short move transition, site transition that we are managing internally as an organization. And we always believed that was going to be more of a kind of a second half kind of resolution to some of the internal issues.","I think the new news for us in the Hydraulics business in terms of what really drove the reduction guidance is largely some of the weakness that we are seeing in some of our end markets. And so, I would say operationally as we acknowledge, we still have work to do to fix some of our own inefficiencies and our teams are working that.","And we certainly would expect that stuff to be flushed through the system by the time we hit the second half of the year. But the new piece is really some of the weakness that we are seeing, largely in some of the mobile equipment market.","And I would say that our orders were certainly weak in Q1. If you take a look at some of our customers, all the names that you know well, I would say their sales are holding up better than our orders are. And so there could be a better outlook as we look forward. We are not sure to what extent.","There is some inventory repositioning taking place in this segment. But right now, it's really more a function of weaker volumes. And at this point, I would say as we think about Hydraulics as a part of Eaton overall, today, we have a plan and the plan is a plan that we believe in.","And our team is executing that plan and we fully expect the Hydraulics team to fix their operational issues and turn that into a business that we can all be proud of and would anticipate keeping as a part of the Company. But for Hydraulics, no different to any other part of the Company, we have expectations that we call all of our businesses accountable to.","And we would expect them to meet the criteria that we set and if we can't meet the criteria for Hydraulics or for any part of the Company, we are willing to act when necessary.","Joseph Ritchie","Thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question is coming from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. I was wondering if you could just come back to ES&S one more time anyhow? And just give us some color on what - negotiation is up 36% really means obviously it sounds good. Is that kind of a project value in dollars? Was there some kind of low ebb in Q1 last year that results in that being such a big healthy number and what kind of typical conversion rate would you have on kind of a negotiation?","Craig Arnold","Yes, no. I mean, the first thing I'll just answer is kind of the question around noise. There is absolutely nothing in Q1 of last year that would suggest that we had a low bar to clear. As I mentioned, it not only was higher than Q1 last year, but it was a record all-time level and was significantly higher than any other quarter during the course of 2018. And I think just as you articulate, this is essentially the number of bid and quotations that we are making to our various customers on large projects that we bid on during the course of the period.","And so, it really for us is probably the best proxy for the level of underlying economic activity that we have in that business. So we think it's a really strong indicator of the fact that this business, a long-cycle business that we would expect to be performing very well at this point in the cycle, is actually performing very much like we anticipate.","Richard Fearon","And it will take time for some of these negotiation bids to become final bids, typically 90 days to 180 days, sometimes a little longer for big projects. But yet, it is quite notable just how strong the activity levels are.","Jeffrey Sprague","And just as a follow-up separately on Ulusoy. Is it $0.02 accretive for the year, and therefore the sole reason for the guide or you'd actually more than that and there is maybe a negative offset somewhere else in the equation?","Richard Fearon","No, it's $0.02 accretive and the way to think about it Jeff is, it's really $0.04 accretive, but we have $0.02 of our estimate right now of amortization of intangible costs. And so, that is how it ends up at $0.02.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great. Thank you.","Craig Arnold","But we are in fact holding all the other elements of the guide for the core business, and so no change at all.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question is coming from Scott Davis from Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Right. Good morning, guys. Just to be clear, the reason why you are not raising margin guidance on ES&S, is that because of mix and largely just because of the data center volumes, is that correct?","Craig Arnold","First of all, I would say early in the year. I would say that our forecast for margins in ES&S is certainly today within the range that we set for the year. And a lot of the growth to your point, is coming from projects and so we will have to wait and see how that plays out. But right now, I would not in any way take it as a sign of concern about margins in our ES&S business. Things are going quite well and we are very pleased with our margins in Q1 and there is nothing today that I would say that would suggest that if there is anything to be concerned about.","Scott Davis","Okay. And the -- it's been actually kind of get your take, Craig, on some of the M&A that is out there. I mean you have got a couple of competitors who have announced really big deals. Nothing seems cheap. They all seem to be relatively fully priced. But what is your take on the market out there and the likelihood that Eaton participates? I guess, there is two ways to think about it, you could be a seller of assets into this market of strength as easily as you could be a buyer of assets. So how do you think about that in the current?","Craig Arnold","The first thing with respect to pricing and asset values in as you can see by some of the transactions that have been announced, I mean these properties are going for extraordinary prices. We have prided ourselves on the fact that we said we are going to be disciplined through this cycle, and we think that our cost of capital continues to be 8% to 9% and we want to deliver 300 basis points over our cost of capital. And so we will continue to be a disciplined buyer into a market that looks like assets being priced at extraordinary levels. And so I would say that we today, are looking at probably more deals than we have in a very long time, and so we have a very active pipeline as well. But we will make the commitment as we have in the past. We are not going to chase deals with what I would say are unattractive returns when you look at their cash on cash set of financial metrics. So that is kind of the way we look at it.","Scott Davis","But the other side of that, obviously Craig, as you could sell something, I mean if people are willing to pay for a price and maybe now is the time to think about partnering with some of maybe a more cyclical stocks, is that a possibility?","Craig Arnold","Yes. First of all, I would say we took a look at our businesses strategically through the cycle. And so as we think about the portfolio itself and how we hold to a seller, we are really trying to look at them over the long-term period and whether or not we think this is going to be a good strategic hole based upon the criteria that we established through the cycle.","Now having said that to your point, if you have come to a decision that you want to exit as asset, now would be a great time to do it. But we generally take a longer term, let's say, more strategic view of the portfolio in terms of things that we want to - businesses that we want to be in versus businesses that we would choose to exit.","Scott Davis","That is fair. Thank you and good luck to you guys.","Craig Arnold","Alright, thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes, thanks. Good morning guys. So I just want to focus a little bit on Hydraulics. I know organic growth was 1% this quarter. Looks like in your full-year guidance you have brought it down a little bit, but you are still basically implying some improvement organic growth throughout the year. So I guess, I'm curious what is driving that conviction and maybe just frame that with how demand progressed throughout the quarter, if there was any sign of improvement in March or into early April?","Craig Arnold","I would say that maybe to take your first question right out of the gate in terms of, certainly we are implying a little bit stronger growth in the back half of the year than we delivered in Q1. As I mentioned in my opening commentary, that 1% organic growth was actually within 1% of our internal plan.","And so, we are actually not off our internal plan by a measurable amount in Q1. And the comps get easier quite frankly, as the year moves on. And we have very specific programs that we are working on as a company that will also help boost growth as we look into some of the out-quarters, very specific initiatives that we are working on, that have been largely bedded down, that are going to help improve our growth.","And the other thing I would tell you is that, if you take a look at the major end markets that we serve construction equipment, Ag equipment, two of our big important markets in Hydraulics and you look at what our customers are saying, in most cases, they are still forecasting growth for the year. They are forecasting low single-digit kind of growth levels. And so we do believe that there was a little bit of inventory correction that took place in Q1 that probably also held down our relative growth rate.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, got it. Thanks, Craig. And then just shifting to Aerospace, the margin performance was really impressive this quarter. Was there anything special going on there? Is it a mix impact that isn't sustainable throughout the rest of the year just because the full-year guidance implies a little bit less margin expansion than we saw in the first quarter?","Craig Arnold","Yes, I mean it certainly was a record quarter for margins in Aerospace, an all-time record, not just a record for Q1 and I would say that we did have a bit of favorable mix in Q1. Our aftermarket business on a relative basis was a bit stronger than our core OE business, and that certainly was a help for the quarter, but also the growth in the volume as well also helped push things up.","And so I would say, principally, it was more a function of the mix of customers and the mix of OE aftermarket that really led to a really strong Q1 performance, that is probably not sustainable at those levels. But as you can see, we are forecasting margins for Aerospace that are once again at record levels and I would say even in many cases industry-leading levels.","Nicole DeBlase","Got it. Thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan","Hi, guys. Just back to ES&S again, I know you said bidding is up significantly, but traditionally what kind of success rates would you have been, what percent win versus not win have you had?","Craig Arnold","We have pretty strong market share Ann, in our businesses. As you know, I mean, in our Electrical Systems & Services business, a lot of this activity is in the Americas market and we have industry-leading shares in this business. And so our win rate is going to be very much consistent with our underlying market share. So we do believe that this bidding activity will translate ultimately to growth in our business.","Ann Duignan","Okay, that is helpful color. Appreciate it. And then back to Hydraulics also, I have to ask the question about North American agriculture, of course. Maybe you could talk about what your customers are saying there? Is that where the weakness was in the quarter in term of orders? And given how bad farmer sentiment is in the US, would you anticipate that maybe staying weaker than expected for the full-year?","Craig Arnold","Yes, I mean, you are absolutely right that sales were actually quite decent in Ag in Q1. But the order rates in Ag was down. And to your point, it's farm incomes and underlying commodity prices being as weak as they are, that we think are certainly dampening some of the enthusiasm for the outlook in Ag markets. And I think our call on Ag for the year, we felt like it's kind of a low single-digit kind of grower for the year, but we do think that there is at least a cautionary kind of sentiment that is in the market today in and around Ag in general.","Ann Duignan","Yes, I would think we would have a similar view of the Ag market for 2019 and maybe even into 2020. Okay, I'll leave it there just get back in line. Most of my other questions were answered. Thanks.","Craig Arnold","Okay.","Yan Jin","Our next question come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just come back to Hydraulics and the backlog was down, I think 11% and I understand the backup is coming off a very high level. But I'm just wondering to get to your sort of 4% to 5% growth for the remainder of the year in Hydraulics, do have to see orders come back positive or can we still achieve that targets with orders remaining flat to negative?","Craig Arnold","Yes, yes. The backlog Nigel was actually down 6% versus last year, but no problem at all, but I think the spirit of your question is once again very much like the question asked earlier, what gives us confidence that we can deliver the growth and the outlook for the year and I will say that while the backlog is down, it's still running at very, very high levels from a historical perspective.","And so obviously the comparisons in general, the comps in general, get easier as the year wears on. And I think that is really the big message with respect to orders, with respect to sales, is that you have relatively easier comps as the year unwinds.","We have some very specific initiatives that we have put in place as a company that are going to give us some growth that have been very well identified and we think once again that while there is a little bit of caution in the market, we do believe that the two big markets of Ag and construction continue to grow down the year.","Nigel Coe","Okay, great. And then my follow-on question is the three-point delta on the Vehicle outlook. And obviously, we are looking at the light vehicle markets significantly weaker. So that is explainable, because I'm just wondering, given the complexity in the segments, how much of that revenue delta is caused by a shift between your legacy transmission business and the Cummins JV? Was that a factor at all? Any help there would be great.","Craig Arnold","Yes, I mean, think in terms of you say the three point reduction in the growth for the quarter, I would say that was really driven principally by the weakness in global light vehicle markets around the world and you see the same data that we see.","I mean China was down 10%; Europe was down for say, 3% to 4%; the Americas was down a couple of points and so, most of that weakness I would say, is really in the global light vehicle market.","We do have, by the way, as I mentioned in my commentary, as the world moves from mails to automated transmissions, we continue to move more revenue into the joint venture with Cummins and that is a piece of what is going on in that business and the other one by the way, that I'll put it on the table because it becomes a much bigger impact in terms of the legacy business as we move forward.","As the world moves to electrification and the eMobility segment, that also become revenue that comes out of our legacy vehicle business and shows up in eMobility. And so there are a number of factors that are going on that perhaps make the underlying revenue growth and our Vehicle business look worse than it really is.","Nigel Coe","Okay, Craig. We will dig in offline. Thanks very much.","Craig Arnold","Thank you.","Yan Jin","Next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeff Hammond","Hey. Good morning, guys. Just two on EPG, one, can you just talk about what is driving the margin bump without a change in sales? And then two, just as the Lighting spend has been announced, have you gotten any indications of interest that maybe a sale is likely or more likely than it's been? Thanks.","Craig Arnold","Yes, I would say on the margins, largely in EPG, I would say primarily we are getting better execution and better conversion in the business than we originally anticipated when we put the plan together. And so, it really complements to the team for really executing and delivering on some of the cost-out initiatives that we put in the plan. And so things are just going a little better than what we anticipated. And that is kind of what drove the increase in guidance for the year.","As we mentioned in terms of Lighting, first of all I would say that the process is moving along as we anticipated and the prime path continues to be to spin the business and we still expect to be ready to make sure that we can get that done by the end of the year.","To your point specifically around outside interest, yes. As you can imagine, there has been a number of companies who raised an interest in potentially acquiring the business. And it's always good to have an option in of choice and so we will be obviously working through these two alternatives, but once again, the prime path that we are on, is to spin the business.","Jeff Hammond","Okay and then just macro level on Europe, I mean there is been some talk about slowing there, you mentioned the auto. Can you just talk about any areas of resilience or particular weakness in Europe? Thanks.","Craig Arnold","Yes, I think to your point around the macro environment in Europe and we all see the economic data coming out of Germany, would suggest that we are in fact seeing some slowdown in growth in Europe overall. Then, we have seen that as well across many of our businesses certainly seen it specifically in the short-cycle businesses. I would say very much like we are seeing in the US, the long-cycle businesses continue to perform well in Europe.","So Electrical Systems & Services and data centers, specifically in Europe, Aerospace, obviously the global industry is doing well. And so I think, we have seen, I could perhaps on an accentuated basis, more or less the continuation of the same trends that we are seeing globally.","But no question, Europe is a bit weaker. It's a bit weaker when you think about industrial markets and industrial controls and the like. But it's all incorporated in our guidance and we think that Europe essentially is not going to be terribly different than what we assumed when we put our profit plan together.","Yan Jin","Our next questions comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Yes, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Just a question on China. Can you talk about sort of China progression during the quarter? Frankly, I would have expected Mobile China Hydraulics to be a bigger positive. So I was just surprised that they didn't move the needle as much. And if you can give us any color as to how April is developing in China. Thank you.","Craig Arnold","Yes, I will say to your point, I mean China started off the year quite weak in January, and March was a much better month. And we see that and certainly the GDP data and the IP data specifically coming out of China. Even automotive markets were relatively speaking, stronger in the month of March than they were in the first two months of the year.","And so I would say a lot of the economic stimulus that the Chinese government is putting into place are early indicators, but it would suggest that it is having the desired impact. And so we think China probably continues to strengthen from this point forward.","Eaton overall, revenues actually grew in Q1 in China as a company. So it was - despite the fact that we had some weakness in automotive markets, we actually saw strong mid-single-digit growth in China, specifically. And to your point, yes, the Hydraulics, the excavator market was quite strong, up some 24%, I believe in Q1.","It's an important market for us, but it's obviously not big enough to move the needle, given some of the offsets in other regions and other segments that are part of that business. But we do think China improves as we look forward.","Richard Fearon","And Andrew if you look at some of the construction metrics in China, they were pretty positive in Q1 and got more positive as the quarter went on. So offer starts are up I think 18% and residential starts were up 12%. So you are seeing a lot of the stimulus in China start flowing into somebody's construction-related markets.","Andrew Obin","And just the second question, you definitely highlighted strength in oil and gas. Can you give us more color sort of upstream, midstream, downstream and maybe some color, what specifically you are seeing at Crouse-Hinds?","Craig Arnold","Yes. No, I would say we are definitely seeing strength in oil and gas. And we think our business in the oil and gas, that we had a good first quarter of revenue, a good first quarter of orders and we think in the market in 2019 kind of grows mid-to-high single-digits.","And then there as a company, we play more downstream than we do upstream, and so we are more exposed to that piece of the market. But we do think you saw the rig count is up somewhat 9% or so in Q1. And so we do think oil and gas continues to strengthen. And that is what we are seeing in our business as well.","Richard Fearon","And we are benefiting from some of these large downstream projects. For example, some of these LNG facilities that are being configured now and petrochemical, and so we are definitely more slanted toward downstream type applications.","Andrew Obin","And how fast does it hit your backlog that oil price moves? Do you see it immediately or is there a lag?","Craig Arnold","I would say there is generally a lag. I mean I have not studied that question in a lot of detail, Andrew. But there is clearly a lag from the move in oil price to them putting in place, capacity to increase drilling or exploration and certainly given the fact that we are downstream, and the LIBOR probably will even be bigger for us than it would be for companies who are more exposed on the upstream side.","Andrew Obin","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Yan Jin","Next question is from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, maybe just touch on some of the variables in the quarter broadly that the number of the other industrial companies have called out as either a factor or not a factor. So I didn't hear anything particular about weather. Did that come into play? And you talked about the inventory adjustments. Did any of that you see any of your business experience a pull-in out of the first quarter into the fourth quarter last year, and might that have been a factor this quarter?","Craig Arnold","And I would say, Deane, we try to stay away from those kind of tangential elements around weather and the light because it's really difficult to ascertain how that impacted your business. And so at this point, I would say that, was weather an impact in Q1, it could have been; was it big enough to fundamentally change the outlook or kind of the thesis on the year, I would say probably not.","And to the point around pull-ins, we really didn't see over any material pull-ins as well at the end of, let's say Q4, that would have impacted our Q1 business. And so really none of these extraneous variables, I would say would have had a material impact on the results in Q1.","Deane Dray","That is fair. And did you say how April started?","Craig Arnold","No, we didn't. But I would say very much in line with the guidance that we just provided for Q2. We would expect 4% growth and I would say that what you are going to likely continue to see is that our long-cycle businesses Electrical Systems & Services and Aerospace and Electrical Products will continue to perform very well and as we mentioned, part of the reason why we have taken the guidance down in the short cycle business.","So once again, I think the Company's revenue story is really playing out very much like we anticipated, perhaps with more extremes, with more strength in the long-cycle stuff offsetting perhaps a bit of weakness in the short-cycle businesses.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Craig Arnold","Thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew Casey","Thanks, Craig. Good morning everybody. I apologize to beat a dead horse a little bit here. But on the Hydraulics margin decline and the reduced margin outlook, is some of that specifically the Q1 compression, is some of that related to accelerated restructuring?","Craig Arnold","Yes, no, I would say that not really, Andy. I mean we obviously are continuing to do restructuring in our business in Hydraulics and so I would say, the margin compression really is largely a function of volume as we articulated earlier, and not because we are doing significantly more restructuring in the business. Now I won't say, a lot of focus obviously in Hydraulics and we certainly understand why at the end of the day, Hydraulics as a segment, accounts for less than 10% of our profits.","And so, I think we have a really strong story in a lot of our other businesses that are just performing extraordinarily well and more than making up, quite frankly, for the little bit of a shortfall that we are having in Hydraulics business. But no, it's really not restructuring, it's really more volume and decrementals on the change in volume.","Andrew Casey","Okay. Thanks, Craig. And then within Electrical Products, we highlighted some strength in residential, which a little bit surprising given some of the macro data that we have been seeing. Is that share gains or what are you seeing there?","Craig Arnold","Yes, I mean Resi for us, it was really a standout performer, quite frankly, in Q1 where we saw strong revenue growth and strong order growth and largely we do think this is essentially this factor of as you move to higher valued electrical equipment with AFCIs and ground fault and the regulations and the codes that are driving standards, are certainly helping that business.","But by and large, just as you know, housing prices are up. We are seeing a lot of remodels that that don't show up necessarily in the housing start data, but we continue to be quite bullish on Resi and that is certainly played out in Q1.","Richard Fearon","Based on the data, we believe we have taken some care, but the market overall for Resi electrical equipment is pretty strong. That is what the mean data would show. And our belief is that, that is likely to last throughout this year.","Craig Arnold","We think Resi construction is up, our business taking up mid-to-high single-digits for the year. So it's really a source of strength we think for the Company.","Andrew Casey","Okay, thank you very much.","Yan Jin","Our next question come from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning. I guess, maybe a question on the margin. Can you talk a little bit about how the price versus commodity inflation, I guess, tariff bucket performed in the quarter and how you are thinking about that cadence for the balance of the year?","Craig Arnold","Yes. Thank you. Appreciate the question. I mean, certainly as we said in the past and Q1 played out that way and we think the year as well is that we think price versus cost we think will be largely neutral for the Company.","Commodity prices as you have probably all certainly noted have abated a little bit and the copper probably is the one holdout where copper prices are still running at relatively high levels, but most of the other commodities that are important to the Company, we have seen commodity costs reduce, and so obviously, that is a good thing for the Company.","But also as we think about price and cost being kind of natural offsets for each other, less inflation we see, the less price we see though. The less tariff-driven cost increases that we see, we obviously can't pass that price in the marketplace. So we are very comfortable for 2019 that pricing cost will be largely neutral, very much like our guidance has been.","John Walsh","Great. And then maybe one more way to attack the negotiations comment. It doesn't sound like you want to give the absolute number, but is there a way to give it as a multiple of revenue in the business just to kind of frame the size a little bit more?","Craig Arnold","The size of negotiations as a percentage of revenue?","John Walsh","Yes, or the absolute number. I mean a couple of people have attacked it around what the 56% increase means year-on-year. Just...","Craig Arnold","Yes, I would say for us, we would really like not to give you a number, but I would tell you that it is a big enough number to give confidence and to be indicative of what the future of the business looks like. It is a very large, very material number.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, thanks for squeezing me. And maybe just a question around the short-cycle businesses, particularly Vehicle and Hydraulics. Worsening revenue outlook in both versus your prior guide, but you sound intensely relaxed about the cost outlook. I just wondered why maybe there wasn't a bit more urgency around cost reduction in both businesses in the face of the worst top-line outlook. And then on Vehicle, it may just be something smaller or something in the mix, but I think you had a sort of low double-digit decremental margin in Q1. The guide for the year implies maybe a 30% decremental for the year as a whole. So is there something changing in terms of mix or what have you later in the year?","Craig Arnold","Yes, I mean maybe to address your first question first Julian, I mean I don't want to leave the wrong impression for a minute. To the extent that we have revenue shortfalls in any of our businesses, I can promise you that nobody is relaxed. Both our Vehicle business and our Hydraulics business is doing everything that they can.","And in many cases more to flex the variable side of our cost, it's one of the key metrics that we track all of our businesses on, to the extent that they are flexing their cost down with changes and volume, but I would say for us that is table stakes. That is something that we expect of every business that we do every day. So it's not the kind of thing that say, we spent a lot of time talking about.","The changes that we are talking about and revenue are not big enough to drive material changes in our restructuring plans, although in the event that the world changed dramatically, we would have the ability to do that. And so I can promise you nobody is in any way relaxed about ensuring that we are managing costs inside of our business.","And then with respect to the decrementals in vehicle, yes, very strong decremental performance in Q1. For the balance of the year, perhaps a little bigger than that, but still well below what we would call as a normal decremental for our Vehicle business. And so once again, rest assured that our Vehicle team is on their game. They do a great job, always have, are managing costs in the face of a downturn. And so you can count on them continuing to deliver.","Julian Mitchell","That is very helpful. And then my second question would just be around any interesting trends you'd call out in terms of inventory levels at OEMs or channel partners across the businesses? How do you feel about absolute inventory levels as they sit today and has there been any change in recent weeks or months?","Craig Arnold","Yes, if you are maybe taking the channel first, because that is kind of where you typically would see the big changes. And I would say by and large not. Inventory today with our distributor partners are largely in line with where they have been historically and in line with their own outlook for revenue growth. And so we have really not seen any material change there at all. As I mentioned on the call, perhaps where we have seen some adjustments, is on the OEM side and some of the short-cycle businesses. But other than that, really inventories are very well managed.","Julian Mitchell","Very helpful. Thank you.","Yan Jin","At this point of the time, I will take the last question from Mig Dobre with Baird.","Mircea Dobre","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in and I want to go back to a question that is been asked before on Vehicle. So looking at this change in organic growth guidance, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but when you issued this guidance, I think pretty much everybody knew some of the challenges that existed in the light vehicle space in terms of builds for the year. So trying to figure out what changed in your mind that prompted this guidance reduction? Is it really more driven by what is been happening with the JV? Is it shifts to eMobility or how do we think about this move?","Craig Arnold","No, I would say really what we said, it's light vehicle markets around the world as I think is evidenced by Q1, have come in weaker at least than what we anticipated and I think in general, weaker than what most economic forecasters have anticipated. It has absolutely nothing to do with what is going on today inside of the commercial vehicle market. North America Class 8 truck continues to do just fine.","The JV revenues, as I mentioned are growing nicely and certainly we have anticipated at the beginning of the year that there would be some transfer of revenue and that is largely on track. And this change really is a function of what we are seeing today, like global vehicle markets around the world now. We will have to see what the rest of the year brings, but certainly the Q1 weakness really in all three regions of the world is really what influenced largely our changing guidance for the year.","Mircea Dobre","I see. Given the adjustment that you had to make the margin and the fact that margins are now going to be slightly lower year-over-year, as we look toward 2020 and we know the challenges that the commercial vehicle side of the business is going to have, is it fair for all of us to be thinking that margins will once again take a step down in 2020?","Craig Arnold","No, I would say not. I mean, as you know, we have done a lot of work over the last number of years to really build the business inside of our Vehicle business that essentially delivers strong margins through the cycle. And certainly as you know, because we have the joint venture, a lot of that volatility that used to sit inside of our business in our portfolio is no longer there. ","We have done a lot of restructuring and so I would say, you should not expect this business to take a material change at all in profitability even with, let's say, North America Class 8 market that is down significantly from where it is this year.","Mircea Dobre","Alright, thank you.","Yan Jin","Okay, good. Thank you. We have reached the end of our call and we do appreciate everybody\u2019s questions. As always, Craig and I will be available to address all your questions today and do something the following weeks. Thank you all for joining us today.","Craig Arnold","Alright, thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect."],"8087":["Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) Q2 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call July 30, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Yan Jin - VP of Investor Relations","Craig Arnold - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Richard Fearon - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer","Conference Call Participants","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc.","Scott Davis - Melius Research","John Walsh - Credit Suisse","Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Dave Raso - Evercore","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Deane Dray - RBC","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research","Steve Volkmann - Jefferies","Rob McCarthy - Stephens","Andrew Obin - Bank of America","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience and holding.

Just a brief reminder, today\u2019s conference is being conference is being recorded [Operator Instructions]","At this point, I\u2019d be happy to turn it over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Yan Jin.","Yan Jin","Good morning. I'm Yan Jin, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for Eaton's second quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Craig highlighting the Company's performance in the second quarter, and as we have done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at end of Craig's comments.","The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we will go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the price release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures.","A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the Company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. They are also outlined in our related 8-K filing.","With that, I will turn it over to Craig.","Craig Arnold","Okay. Thanks, Yan. Appreciate it. And let's start with Page 3, and a highlight of our Q2 results, and I'd say, overall we delivered solid Q2 financial performance, and on the back of what I'd really call good execution across the company.","Earnings per share of $1.50 on a GAAP basis and $1.53 excluding transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions and divestitures. So at $1.53 per share, our results are 10% above last year and at the high end of our guidance range, which was $1.45 to $1.55.","Our sales of $5.5 billion were up 2.5% organically, partially offset by 1.5% of negative currency, and similar to Q1, we continue to deliver strong margin performance.","Segment margins of 17.9% are an all-time record for Eaton including records for Electrical Products, Electrical Systems & Services, and Aerospace. Our margins were also above the high end of our guidance range and 90 basis points above prior year. We also generated very strong cash flow - operating cash flow of $880 million, up some 76% over Q2 of 2018, and once again, our second quarter record.","And lastly, we repurchased $260 million of our shares in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date purchases to $410 million or 1.2% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of 2019.","Turning to Page 4, we provided summary of our income statement versus prior year, and I'll only highlight a couple of points here. First, we're very pleased with our incremental margins which were about 50% on the organic growth that we delivered in the quarter, so, once again, strong execution.","Second, we incurred about $0.03 per share of after-tax costs, primarily related to the spin-off of our Lighting business. And finally, adjusted earnings increased 7%, and as we noted, adjusted EPS increased some 10%.","Moving to Page 5, we summarized the quarterly results of our Electrical Products segment. Revenues were up 2%, which includes 4% organic growth, partially offset by 2% negative currency. Organic growth was driven by growth in both commercial and residential markets largely in the North American market.","Orders increased 1% led by continued growth in residential and commercial construction in the Americas, partially offset by softness in some of the industrial markets, and our backlog was up 4%.","Segment operating profits grew 8% and operating margins were up 110 basis points to 19.6%, which was once again an all-time record. So we continue to be pleased with how well the segment is performing, both in terms of organic growth and in margin performance.","On the next page, we summarized results for our Electrical Systems & Services segment. Revenues were up 5% with 5% organic growth and 1% growth from Ulusoy acquisition and 1% negative currency impact. Organic growth was driven by strength in the industrial projects as well as in commercial construction markets.","On a rolling 12-month basis, Electrical Systems & Services orders were up 3% with growth really across all regions. And I'd say it's worth noting here that prior year orders included an unusually high level of orders in hyperscale data centers. Excluding hyperscale data center orders, rolling 12-month orders were up some 8%, which is in line with our order growth in Q1.","In addition, our backlog continue to grow and it increased some 2% in the quarter. Electrical Systems & Services also produced all-time record margins of 17.4%, which were up some 240 basis points from prior year. The strong operating performance included solid operating leverage with profits up some 22% on 5% organic growth.","Page 7 has our Hydraulics results for Q2. Revenues were down 3% and that's flat organic growth with 3% negative currency. Similar to Q1, we had tough comps with 13% organic growth in Q2 of '18, but revenue continued to slow.","Flat organic revenues reflect a growth in industrial equipment largely offset by declines in agriculture and construction equipment. Our orders declined 8% from continued weakness in global mobile equipment markets really around the world and our backlog declined some 12%.","Segment operating margins were 11.5%, in line with Q1, but certainly down some 200 basis points from last year. I'd say here, we continue to work through some inefficiencies and costs related to repositioning the business during the quarter, but we made significant progress and we expect a better second half of the year.","On the next page, we show our Q2 results for our Aerospace business. Similar to Q1, the business continued to perform at a very high level, really delivering record performance on almost every metric. Revenues were up 12%, with 13% organic growth, negative 1% currency.","Orders on a rolling 12 month basis increased 15% with particular strength in commercial transport, military fighters and commercial aftermarket. And our backlog continues to remain robust and it increased from 17% in the quarter. Again, we demonstrated really strong incremental margins which led to a 41% increase in operating profits and a 520 basis points improvement in margins.","Operating margins of 24.6% were another all-time high for the business. In addition to volume growth, we also experienced some favorable product mix in the quarter, which certainly helped.","Lastly, we're very excited to have announced in July, Eaton's commitment to acquire Souriau-Sunbank Connection Technologies for $920 million. Souriau is a leader in aerospace connectors and provides us with the capability to more effectively serve more electric aircraft systems, which is certainly a trend in the industry.","But beyond Aerospace, we also have a significant opportunity to expand the distribution of Souriau's products to our large electrical wholesale network, and as the whole world just becomes more electric, we think this technology and capability really becomes a real growth platform for Eaton.","Souriau has grown historically in mid single-digit levels over the last several years and we think we're paying a really attractive multiple of 11.8 times EBITDA before synergies and 7 times to 8 times EBITDA on an after-synergy basis.","Moving to Page 9, we summarized our Vehicle segment. Our revenues were down 11%, which includes a 9% reduction in organic growth and negative 2% from currency. Similar to Q1, organic sales declined 2%, was driven by a combination of decline in light vehicle markets, which we think were off some 7% and the impact of revenues that transferred into the Eaton-Cummins Joint Venture. I will point out that the revenues in the joint venture increased some 11% in the quarter. And also similar to Q1, we had tough comps, organic growth in Q2 of 2018 were some -- up some 11%.","For the year, we continue to expect NAFTA Class 8 production to be roughly flat at 324,000 units, and we also expect global light vehicle markets to remain weak, and as a result, we've lowered our market outlook for the year.","Operating margins were 16.9%, which were down some 160 basis points from prior year, but I would point out, up 180 basis points sequentially despite slightly lower revenues versus Q1. So once again, really strong execution in our Vehicle segment.","Lastly, we summarized our eMobility segment on Page 10. Revenues were up 1%, which includes 2% organic growth, partially offset by 1% negative currency, and I'd say here, the slower organic growth is made up of continued double-digit growth in the EV passenger market, partially offset by slower internal combustion engine markets, and you should note that in this segment today is still some two-thirds of our revenue goes into legacy internal combustion engine and commercial vehicle markets. This will certainly change dramatically as electric vehicle segment continues to grow as electrification continues to grow, but for right now, it is still two-thirds legacy IEC markets.","And as planned, we continue to accelerate R&D spending, which increased some 70% in the quarter, and as a result, segment margins declined to 8%. We're also extremely pleased to announce that we won another large program valued at $160 million of mature year revenue for a high voltage inverter for a new plug-in hybrid platform.","So this was our second significant win since we created the segment just over a year ago and we certainly referenced this in our press release, but this brings our total new wins to $390 million since the segment was formed in 2018.","So we're ahead of our original schedule, and once again, well on our way to creating a $2 billion to $4 billion segment of the company.","Moving to page 11, we turn to our outlook for 2019. We now expect organic revenue for all of Eaton to grow approximately 3%, down from our prior estimate of 4%. This reflects moderating global growth, particularly in Europe and in China, and specific weakness in our short cycle businesses, very much like you've heard from other companies.","We're lowering our organic growth rate by 3% for both Hydraulics and the Vehicle segment, and in the Hydraulics, we continue to see slow growth expectations in global mobile equipment markets and so now we expect roughly flat organic growth for the year, and in Vehicle, after a weak first half, we now expect organic revenues to be down some 7% to 8% due to continued weakness in global automotive markets and please remember once again that we are seeing strong growth in our Eaton Cummins Joint Venture.","We are also lowering our organic growth for our eMobility segment from 11% to 12% down to 5% to 6% due to once again slower growth in legacy internal combustion engine platforms. We've not changed Electrical Products, Electrical Systems & Services or Aerospace as our long cycle businesses continue to perform in line with our guidance.","And on Page 12, we summarized our margin expectations for the year. Our Eaton consolidated segment margin guidance remains unchanged with a range of 17.1% to 17.5% or 17.3% at the midpoint. We've narrowed the range for each of our segments to be plus or minus 20 basis points since we've really delivered the first half of the year and it's behind us at this point.","We do have some puts and takes in margins with a 70-basis point increase in ESS and 90-basis point increase in Aerospace, offsetting a decline in the Hydraulics segment, and the midpoint of our margin for the other segments remain unchanged.","Our full year guidance for Q3 and 2019 are summarized on the last page, Page 13. For Q3, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.50 to $1.60 per share. At the midpoint, this represents an 8% increase over last year, excluding the impact of the arbitration decision in 2018. Other assumptions in Q3 guidance include approximately 3% organic growth, margins of 17.7% to 18.1%, flat corporate expenses, and a tax rate of 16% to 17%.","For the full-year 2019, we're maintaining the midpoint and narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.05 at both the bottom and the high end of the range. Our new range is $5.77 to $5.97 per share, and at the midpoint, $5.87. This once again represents a 9% increase over 2018 excluding once again the impact of the arbitration decisions last year.","Other full year guidance assumptions include organic revenue growth of 3%, a $100 million of revenue from the Ulusoy acquisition, foreign exchange impact of a negative $300 million, unchanged from prior forecast, segment margins of 17.3% at the midpoint, also unchanged, and we've narrowed the guidance range for our full-year tax rate to 14.5% to 15.5%. Once again, no change at the midpoint, but narrowing the range.","However, our strong first half cash flows are allowing us to really increase our operating cash flow and free cash flow guidance for the year by some $200 million. Operating cash flows will now be between $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion, and free cash flow will be between $2.7 billion and $2.9 billion. We're also increasing our share repurchases from $400 million to $800 million for the year.","So, overall, I step back and say, a really strong start to the year, a strong first half, we're well positioned for another year of good results, and our teams are doing a great job of executing in face of the opportunity in front of us.","And so with that , I'll turn it back to Yan and open it up for Q&A.","Yan Jin","Okay. Thanks, Craig. Before we begin the Q&A section of our call today, I do see we have a number of individuals in the queue with questions. Given our time constraint of an hour today, an hour is there to get to as many of these questions as possible. Please limit your opportunity to just one question and a follow-up. Thanks for your cooperation in advance.","With that, I will turn it over to operator to give you guys the guidance.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly [Operator Instructions]","Yan Jin","Okay. We will take our first question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Craig Arnold","Hi, Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Hey, good morning. First, just thinking about Hydraulics and Vehicle, this is obviously the second quarter in a row now we've marked down the top line and marked down the margin outlook a little bit. Would you say, the forecast as you've laid it out here, is kind of a run rate forecast on what you see over the balance of the year? Or are you making some underlying assumption that things pick up? And I was wondering if you could also just, as part of that, just elaborate on how we get comfortable with the Hydraulics margins given kind of the recent trajectory there?","Craig Arnold","I appreciate the question, Jeff. And I'd say, I think you've characterized it the right way. It's really a look at kind of run rate in those two businesses, specifically with respect to growth, certainly in Vehicle markets, global markets around the world have been weak in the first half of the year and \u2013 and we're essentially assuming that we see a similar picture for the balance of the year, perhaps with a little bit of a pickup in the China market, given kind of the depth of the fall that we experienced in the first half of the year. But other than that, it's really largely run rate in both of those businesses, and I'd say specifically in Hydraulics, today what we continue to see in Hydraulics is we can only see inventory correction take place in the channel both in distribution as well as in OEMs and we're also clearly seeing today our lead times have been reduced and so there is a fairly sizable inventory correction taking place across the board, and the economic activity, if you take a look at kind of retail sales, those numbers are much better than what we're seeing certainly in the underlying order intake, and so it's largely kind of a run rate picture.","And then specifically, with respect to margins in Hydraulics, I'd say, Q2 is essentially the last quarter where we really were dealing with a number of inefficiencies and repositioning costs, and so what we're really banking on going forward is that essentially normal kind of incremental decrementals on the business, but without the additional kind of repositioning costs and inefficiencies that we've experienced in the business in the first half of the year. So very comfortable with the second half guidance at this point for Hydraulics.","Jeff Sprague","And maybe then as my follow-up to all that, Craig, thank you, is just on the inventory correction that you are seeing, do you have any way to kind of gauge how far along we are in that process? How much in excess inventory it might be out there? And how many quarters it takes to run its course?","Craig Arnold","I'd say really difficult to estimate, Jeff, as you know, so much of this is a function of kind of the everyone's forward view of where markets are going. And given a lot of the economic uncertainty and trade uncertainty that we've been dealing with, I think everyone is trying to find a way through in terms of figuring out how much real underlying demand do we have versus how much of this is just general nervousness that we're experiencing as a result of these other extraneous factors, and so I'd really -- difficult to judge for certain.","I will say that as we take a look at inventory levels in the channel, we did see really more broadly and also a little bit in our electrical business as well, some inventory correction that took place, but it's really difficult to call in terms of whether or not it's don, is more out in front of us or at the point now where we're comfortable really building some inventory back into the system.","Jeff Sprague","Great. Thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeff Hammond","Hey, good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Hammond","Just a few questions on the electrical side. One, you had talked about the big step-up in ESS margins, congrats there, just no real revenue change, what's really driving the step-up there? And then just any update on the Lighting spin, when do we expect like a Form 10 et cetera? Thanks.","Craig Arnold","Yeah, I'll take the first half, and then I'll let Rick take the second. But in terms of ES&S and the margin step-up, I'd say, in a word, I'd say it's strong execution. Our teams are just doing an outstanding job of converting on the opportunities in front of us and running our facilities better.","As we've talked about in the past, we've done some work around the portfolio and where we're choosing to compete, and those things are paying off in the form of higher margins inside of the business.","And so we're very comfortable with the level of margin guidance that we provided and taken the margins up and our teams are just doing a great job of executing, and we'd expect that to continue.","Richard Fearon","And on the Lighting spin, Jeff, we've had initial comments from the SEC, relatively modest set of comments and so we would expect to get the Form 10 filed towards the end of the third quarter, might just lap into the beginning of October. But that's the time frame.","Jeff Hammond","Okay and then just as a follow-on on the Souriau acquisition, you gave kind of the adjusted valuation with synergies. Can you kind of expand on where you think those opportunities are? I recall the business has a fairly large France footprint, and so I know it's sometimes those costs are onerous to take out. Thanks.","Craig Arnold","Yeah, I appreciate the question, once again, Jeff. And I think today they run a very effective operation today in France by the way, and so we have no intentions of closing any of the French manufacturing facilities, if that is the basis of your question.","Today, as you know, we operate today as Eaton in France and we operate very successful businesses in the country. And so we're very comfortable with their manufacturing operations in France. We're right now and in the period of obviously putting into some of the finishing touches on what our exact integration plans are going to be.","We've not communicated those plans for the organization yet and so clearly before we'd make any public statements, we'll obviously need to work through our own internal announcements.","But specifically as it relates to manufacturing in France, very comfortable with that team, very comfortable with their capabilities and how effectively they've managed that business over a very long period of time.","Jeff Hammond","Okay, great. Thanks, Craig.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold","Good morning.","Scott Davis","I wanted to just follow up a little bit on the questions around visibility, inventories et cetera. I mean, can you give some granularity on what types of projects you're seeing in non-res in your backlog?","Craig Arnold","Yeah, I'd say that when we think about kind of what's going on today in Electrical Systems & Services, I'd say, particular strength certainly in the US, commercial construction continues to be quite strong, orders were up some 6% in Q2. Industrial orders were also up nicely in the quarter.","So, we're seeing pretty broad-based strength in our Electrical Systems & Services business, we had a really strong quarter of orders in the US as well. If we look at kind of around the world in terms of what's going on in other regions of the world where Europe, what we call EMEA, Europe, Middle East, Africa, India, we saw big projects in industrial also in data centers , data centers in Europe were up strongly in Q2, Crouse-Hinds business, oil and gas, had a very strong Q2 as well as our Engineering Services business in Europe as well also strong. And in Asia where we saw the strength primarily was in power quality markets, which were up double-digit in the quarter.","And so I'd say that in Electrical Systems & Services, we're seeing, generally speaking, nice growth in almost all of the end markets other than what we talked about, which was a highly cyclical piece of the segment, which is kind of the hyperscale data centers where those orders just tend to be lumpy and we're really anniversarying some really huge numbers from the Q1 and Q2 of 2018. Other than that, we're seeing pretty good strength across residential, commercial, data centers and industrial buildings.","Scott Davis","Seemingly so, but does it scare you at all, Craig, when you look across just across more broadly across industrials, I mean the quarter has been pretty weak overall, and you guys have had decent numbers of course, but is there a recession playbook that you guys are dusting off? Is there - are you - is there any internal plans to delay hiring or do anything to kind of play a little bit more defense versus offense?","Craig Arnold","Yeah, I mean I think it's fair to say that we too have seen kind of the general slowdown in the macro economy during the course of Q2, and it's obviously caused this -- all of this kind of stop and pause and take stock of what's generally going on in the market and where we think things are headed.","And so I think it would be fair to say that we always have a restructuring playbook ready, at the ready, we always encourage our businesses and our teams to think about what would you do in the event of an industrial recession and I'd say you can be rest assured that our teams are thinking about that, have plans at the ready, but at this point, we're not prepared to declare or pull that trigger because we still are in fact seeing growth in our end markets.","But rest assured, we have plans, we have contingencies built in, and in the event that we ended up experiencing an economic downturn, we think, once again, the company playbook that we laid out, if you recall back to our Investor Day event, we'd essentially use our strong balance sheet, our strong cash flow, we certainly would step up our share repurchases and so we think the company has a playbook that we've already laid out and quite frankly even communicated in terms of what we would do in the event of an economic slowdown or an industrial recession.","Scott Davis","Thank you. Good luck, guys.","Craig Arnold","Thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.","John Walsh","Hi. Good morning.","Craig Arnold","Hi.","John Walsh","Question around the Aerospace margins, obviously another very strong quarter taking the margins higher again, I think last quarter you alluded to some favorable mix, but just wanted to get your kind of thoughts around where the Aerospace margins are going to exit this year and kind of the sustainability of that?","Craig Arnold","Yeah, I'd say that we got a really - got a number of different positive events that are taking place in Aerospace. Number one, I begin with once again our teams and how effectively they are executing, and we are just doing an outstanding job across that business and really converting on the opportunities in front of us and running our facilities very efficiently, and that's obviously giving us a bit of a margin lift.","In addition to that, we're seeing today, quite frankly, as we talked about in prior years there simply are fewer big aerospace programs that we're spending R&D dollars on and that's obviously paying a dividend and I don't anticipate that changing dramatically unless the big OEs and commercial platforms will decide to launch some major new program, that's not currently on the horizon.","And so that's obviously favorable for the business. And then the third element is, aftermarket continues to be quite strong. The aftermarket segment of the business continues to grow nicely and we're converting on margin upgrade opportunities.","And so, we really do think that this business is going to be performing at much higher levels of profitability than it has historically, and if you think about the guidance that we provided for the year, you can expect the business to continue to perform in those levels.","John Walsh","Thank you. And then I guess maybe just some color around the acquisition pipeline. I guess we've had now one deal strengthened on each side of the house, you're going to generate very strong free cash flow, you have a balance sheet, kind of what does the pipeline look like? And what's the appetite continuing to deploy it for M&A?","Richard Fearon","Yes, I think maybe take the first question first. The pipeline, I'd say, the pipeline today is much more robust than it's been historically. Certainly, much more robust than we've seen in the last 3 years to 5 years. And so we are certainly looking. I'd say, at more opportunities than we ever have.","Having said that, I will also point out though, valuations in many cases are still quite elevated, and we're going to continue to be disciplined as we think about how we deploy our capital and what we said and it continues to be the priorities that we'll continue to focus on largely our Electrical business, our Aerospace business and perhaps and certain opportunities around eMobility.","Those continue to be the company's priorities in terms of how we think about deploying our M&A dollars. But, yeah, the pipeline is more robust today than it's been in quite some time.","Craig Arnold","And I could just add - just add one thing. We've actually announced three transactions, Ulusoy and Electrical Intelligent Switchgear, a much smaller transaction, and then, this new Souriau transactions.","And to Craig's point, the first two were at multiples of 7 times to 8 times EBITDA, and Souriau higher, but it will come down to levels close to that after we enact the integration program","Yan Jin","Good. Our next question - our next question come from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.","Nicole DeBlase","Yeah, thanks, good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold","Hi.","Nicole DeBlase","So maybe starting with the short cycle businesses, it's been clearly a pretty common theme this quarter end, we've heard from a lot of companies that things to decelerate a little bit in June and that's kind of continued into July. So just curious about anything you're willing to share on the monthly trends within the short cycle piece of your portfolio?","Craig Arnold","I'd say that the call story is not terribly different than that. I'd say that the month of June really was weaker than what we were originally anticipating, and once again, your question, there's a lot going on in the global environment in the month of June, whether it's around trade and additional tariffs, or whether it's just around the general direction of the overall economy.","And so, to what extent did a lot of our customers and distributors put things on pause in the month of June, we'll have to wait and see. I will say that, so far in the month of July, things are playing out largely as we anticipated and so very much consistent with the guidance that we provided.","And so we don't think necessarily that June kind of is the new standard. But we did in fact see a slowdown in the month of June, very much consistent with what other companies have reported.","Nicole DeBlase","Got it. That makes sense, Craig, thanks. And then for my follow-up just around data centers if you could provide a little bit more of an update of what you're seeing there? We've heard increased concerns about push-outs from the hyperscale players. So would love to hear what Eaton's seeing.","Craig Arnold","Yeah. And I'd say that, for us, we always talk about data centers being kind of a long-term growth market where we think the market will in fact continue to grow within our long-term trend basis , high single-digits.","And so we think it's a great space to be in and Eaton has a great strategic position in data centers both on the equipment side as well as on the power quality side, but there is this fairly large segment of the market called hyperscale that is very lumpy and it's been lumpy historically and probably will continue to be lumpy in the future.","And if you just look back at what happened in our business in, let's say, in the first half of 2018, we got very large multi-year orders from a number of the data center hyperscale players.","And as a result of that, we kind of anniversaried that in the first half of the year and we'll have a better second half comparable for sure, but that business is lumpy today, it will continue to be lumpy , but we think data centers long term, and quite frankly in the near term is a great space to be in and will continue to be a real growth engine for the company.","Nicole DeBlase","Thanks, Craig.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks, good morning.","Craig Arnold","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","So maybe just kind of taking that Aero margin question slightly differently. So obviously, the first half of the year, the margins were incredibly strong. If I take a look at your guidance for the full year, the implied guidance for the second half, would be that second half Aero margins are going to be lower than first half Aero margins.","And so my question is, was there anything specific about the first half that really helped boost margins or anything that's potentially going to impact margins in the second half on the Aero side?","Craig Arnold","Yeah, I think the simple answer to that question, I'd say is, no. I mean, we certainly outperformed our expectations in the first half of the year. We certainly saw very positive aftermarket mix in the first half of the year.","Question, is that going to continue into the second half? At this point, I think it's tough to say. And so - and we have lifted margins overall, I think very much consistent with the business probably going back to historical view of OE aftermarket mix, but other than that, there were absolutely no one-time items or other things that drove the improvement in margins in the business outside of what I'd articulate, which is largely strong execution in our businesses, strong aftermarket, and quite frankly, as I mentioned, lower R&D spending.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That makes sense, and good to hear there, Craig. I guess my follow-on question, and this is something I think I've asked you on prior calls, is really just around Hydraulics and how you're thinking about that business longer term? You've taken down the margin guidance, it's now below the longer-term thresholds for that business.","And I guess just how are you - how are you thinking about the - I guess the trajectory of this business as part of the portfolio, just given the performance that we've seen recently?","Craig Arnold","I appreciate the question. It's clearly - it's a business today that we're not pleased with the way the business is performing. We're not pleased with the way we've converted on the opportunity that's in front of us. The margins are in fact below the overall guidance for the Company.","Yeah, I will say that today, Hydraulics accounts for 8% of our Company. We delivered 17.9% all-time record margins, despite the fact that we have one of our businesses that's not today firing on all cylinders, and I really look at that as saying, wow, what an opportunity for what this company will look like once we get Hydraulics performing at the level that we know that they're capable of.","And so I'd say that as we think about the first half of the year, we were still working through some repositioning costs, we were still working through some inefficiencies, as I mentioned, they will have a better second half of the year. We're very much confident in the plan that the team laid out in front of us, but we have work to do and we have something to prove still in our Hydraulics business.","But I'd say for us at the end of the day, it's in a company as large and as diverse as Eaton, it's unusual to find every single business firing on all cylinders. It's really I think a testament to the strength of company that despite the fact that you can have one of the cylinders not firing completely that the company can still deliver record all-time margins across the board. So I think a real testament to the strength of franchise.","Joe Ritchie","Fair enough. Thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Dave Raso with Evercore.","Dave Raso","There was some concern going into the quarter on ESS orders and the organic for the second half, but obviously your comments about ex-hyperscale that your orders didn't even slow on a year-over-year basis, and the rest of the year, you're implying organic for that business as strong as you saw in the first quarter. So it seems like you're very comfortable with the top line.","Can you help us a bit with the margin in the back half of the year, like what's in the backlog when it comes to mix, any price cost you can help us with, I see the incremental in the back half of the year is about 36%.","It's actually a little lower than the first half. So it doesn't seem that challenging, but can you just help us a bit with what's in the backlog to gain comfort with that in an important business?","Craig Arnold","Yeah, what I would say in general is that our backlog is very much reflective of what we experienced in the first half of the year and clearly the guidance that we provided Incorporated what we have visibility to into our backlog, and so I'd say, once again, in our Electrical Systems & Services business very much like some of the other parts of the company, that the team is just executing well on the opportunity in front of us.","And I'd say, if you think about price versus cost, what we've always said, which is largely kind of still our point of view is that it will be kind of a net neutral to us. Clearly, we're getting price in places where we're dealing with inflation, in places where we're dealing with tariff-derived cost increases, and as a result, our businesses are managing that very effectively.","So we think that's going to be a net neutral, and essentially the margin expansion will really come from our ability to really manage the portfolio in terms of where we choose to compete, it will come from our ability to continue to bring out inefficiencies inside of our businesses.","Dave Raso","So nothing unique in the backlog help or hurt on the margin from what we've seen?","Craig Arnold","No very much consistent with what we've experienced in the first half.","Dave Raso","That's great. Thank you very much.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Craig Arnold","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Duignan","Yeah. A lot of my questions have been answered, but Craig, I think on Hydraulics you commented that you're seeing more broad-based slowdown in agriculture geographically. I think last part, you're saying just North America. Maybe you could just update us on that and what you're seeing more broadly?","Craig Arnold","I think that's fair, and I'd say whether it's in ag markets and quite frankly even in construction equipment markets, I think we've seen a general slowdown really around the world in most of the mobile equipment markets, slowdown certainly in terms of the absolute rate of growth, we see that and some of the big OEMs we've already reported their numbers.","But the other big thing that's taking place clearly across the ","businesses is inventory correction that we're seeing both in OEM channel as well as in the distribution channel and probably largely in anticipation of a slowdown.","And so we were really dealing with both of those factors right now inside of the business, but, so I'd say today, very much factored into our guidance, and one of the reasons why we lowered the revenue outlook for the Hydraulics business this year.","Ann Duignan","Okay, I appreciate that. And then on Vehicle side, your outlook for NAFTA heavy-duty production is flat this year and the OEMs are all still quite upbeat about end market demand and we know where orders are, we know where backlogs are, but what are you hearing, feet on the street, that's making you more cautious than your OEM customers?","Craig Arnold","Yeah, I'd say it's very possible in that the market can be stronger than what we're calling right now is that we know we're calling it flat and we do know there's others out there who are calling for some modest growth in North America Class 8 truck this year.","So we'll have to see how that all plays out, but we just take a look at the general level of the economy overall, the fact that we are in fact seeing slowing, we are in fact seeing inventory levels today that are at elevated levels, and so we'll just have to wait until that one plays out.","But to your point, there are a couple of others out there who have more robust forecast for North America Class 8 truck than we have.","Ann Duignan","Okay. So it's more erring on the side of caution rather than anything you're hearing specifically?","Craig Arnold","Yeah, absolutely. I think it's really more erring on the side of caution recognizing that in the event of a general slowdown in the economy, as you know better than most, and that businesses tend to do move quite quickly and so we think this erring on the side of caution is probably a prudent place to be.","And keep in mind, by the way, for us, just maybe it's a good point to make the point where so much of our revenue today, goes through the joint venture. And so one of the things that we really tried to do as a company is really de-risk Eaton from a standpoint of its exposure to North America Class 8 truck markets and so you'll see that volatility largely in the joint venture. But you'll see very little of that volatility in our own results.","And so I think that's an important point to emphasize, it was a deliberate part of our strategy. And so you'll see that largely in the JV, you'll see very little of that -- you'll see some of it, but you won't see a lot of that show up in Eaton's results.","Ann Duignan","Okay. So the margin reduction in vehicle was primarily auto-related?","Craig Arnold","Yeah. that's where we're seeing the weakening, by the way, we held the margins, by the way, just to be in there - as a point of clarification, we actually held the margin guidance, we narrowed the range.","Ann Duignan","You narrowed that, yeah.","Craig Arnold","But we held them - we held the midpoint in Vehicle and once again we held the midpoint, despite the fact that we're seeing a slowdown in our automotive markets around the world and that is largely the reason why we reduced the revenue guidance, but the fact that we held margins really once again goes back to our teams and our ability to execute in a declining revenue environment.","Ann Duignan","Okay. Third point I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question come from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Craig Arnold","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey, I'd like to go back to the Souriau deal if we could. And Craig, since this is the largest deal you've done since becoming CEO, some color in terms of how did the deal come together? The structure is a bit unusual; maybe you can comment on that. And then whether there is an opportunity in that funnel to do larger deals like this?","Craig Arnold","Yeah, Deane, I am not sure specifically in terms of the structure being unusual. I think it's a pretty straightforward - there are some unique rules with respect to the way deals are announced in France in terms of the unions having to approve transactions and maybe that's what you're referring to in terms\u2026","Deane Dray","Exactly.","Craig Arnold","Okay, in the announcement, but we think that's largely a matter of form over function and we think the deal will close in good stead and we think it will close by the end of the year, no later than, and we don't think there's anything other than that that's unusual about the deal.","And as I said, strategically, we really love this deal, I mean it's a -- if you think about the whole world becoming more electric including aircraft, if you think about Eaton being a big electrical company, we think we have a great opportunity to take their technology and their products into so many different applications in our core electrical business.","And quite frankly in everything that we do as the world becomes more electric, we think the electrical connectors that Souriau manufacturers really gives us a great growth platform inside of the organization.","And so I think what you're going to find from us is that we'll continue to look for opportunities in Aerospace, we like the business for a lot of reasons, and you'll continue to see us do more stuff in Electrical, this just happens to be one that really cuts across two of our big growth platforms, both Aerospace and Electrical and so it's very unique in that respect.","But other than that, I think it's a deal that's really write down Main Street, we think we bought it at a very reasonable multiple for an Aerospace asset and we think it really provides once again a real lever for growth in the future.","Deane Dray","And then just I had also asked whether that's maybe emboldens you to do bigger deals?","Craig Arnold","Yeah, actually bigger deals for us is really a function of where the opportunities lie and whether or not you can acquire them with the right kind of financial returns and so we absolutely would not shy away from nor we ever shied away from strategic acquisition of scale where we feel like we can buy it at the right price and add significant shareholder value.","And so I would say that the deal doesn't embolden us to do bigger deals, but then again, there is nothing that prevents us from taking a bigger swing if the asset is strategically important, and we feel like we can add value.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then just the follow-up question on Lighting, and the extent to which you can comment on this. There was some discussion that you would entertain bids for the company as opposed to a spin. What has been the interest along those lines, and any color there would be appreciated.","Craig Arnold","We are in discussions with multiple parties and we'll see how that plays out, Deane. We'll obviously take the course of action that is value maximizing for Eaton shareholders.","Deane Dray","Terrific. Thank you.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","Thanks guys, good morning. So the channel corrections in Electrical is a bit of a new development. And I think Lighting was an area where we expected to see it and obviously one of your competitors called out commercial as an area where there is a little bit of headwinds.","So maybe just dig into that and maybe just address the extent to which you think this is caused by the price increases and tariffs as opposed to just general end market weakness and the normal kind of the de-stocking activity? Any color there would be very helpful?","Craig Arnold","Yeah, I wish, quite frankly, Nigel, we had clear and more definitive answers for you in terms of what actually caused the slowdown. I think the truth of the matter is we and many others are speculating in terms of what actually caused that. But we clearly -- and there's a lot of geopolitical uncertainty in the world right now.","And I'd say that it probably reached a high point in the month, certainly the early couple of weeks in June around trade disputes between the US and China and Mexico and some of the other just general weakness that we're seeing in some of the macros.","And so I just think that there was enough out there in the month of June for people to pause and just take stock of exactly where we were at, but beyond that, we would really be out on a limb trying to speculate exactly what caused the slowdown. I will say that as we take a look at the back half of the year and we obviously factored in what we saw in the month of June into our outward forecasts for our businesses. And so I think this thing can go either way.","I think we could probably just a higher probability that you're going to see a return to growth -- the normalized growth as you're probably going to see a deceleration, and at the end of the day, we're going to be ready. Our businesses and we're focusing on making sure that we have contingency plans in place.","So in event that we end up in an economic slowdown that's more severe than what we're currently forecasting, our teams will be ready to flex our costs, to flex our spending to take whatever actions that we need to take to ensure that we continue to maximize performance.","Nigel Coe","Thanks, Craig. And then another one on tariffs. As you know, Electrical Products and Lighting, it's one of the biggest categories of imports from China into the US, and obviously, you feel the inflation on some of the componentry but also your competitors who import from there obviously facing some tougher barriers there. So I'm just wondering how the tariffs have impacted the competitive environments in both the Low Voltage, but also in as Lighting as well?","Craig Arnold","Yeah, I\u2019d say on the logo really very minimal today as we talked about it pre-event, we said that tariffs will be order of magnitude about $100 million bill for the company, and that's largely unchanged from what we forecasted the last time, and that doesn't necessarily have a - an outsized impact on our Low Voltage business at all.","It does, to your point, have an outsized impact on Lighting, but I will tell you that, good news is that, we and others in the industry, have passed on tariffs, and at this point, we don't feel like the tariff issue today is in anyway negatively impacting the margins of the business.","And quite frankly, we had a fairly good quarter in Lighting both in growth and in orders. And so we're very comfortable with our Lighting business in the way our team is executing and managing the tariff impacts as it relates to their business.","Nigel Coe","Yeah, thanks for that Craig. The question is more on the competitive impact, but we can take it offline, thanks a lot.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Okay, then we take next one from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.","Steve Volkmann","Great. I'm here.","Craig Arnold","Hi, good.","Steve Volkmann","Just a couple of quick cleanups, I guess if I may. I was curious about the price cost question from a different perspective. We're starting to hear a little bit of signs of people sort of pushing back on price increases due to slower growth, due to lower material costs, and I'm just curious what your view of sort of price cost is over the next couple of quarters?","Craig Arnold","And I think our point of view, Steve, is really largely where we've always been, and so we always think about price cost in the near term as neither being a headwind nor a tailwind for the business and we try to manage it to be neutral. That's kind of been our position as we laid out our thinking for the year and that's really where we're still parked.","In some cases, there is very formulate equations that drive what we're able to pass on to our customers and where prices go up and down as a function of a basket of commodities, and other cases , it's a function of, obviously what's in the backlog and what you've negotiated.","But as we think about the go-forward view you know I'd say today it's still our view is net neutral that pricing cost for 2019 will neither be a positive nor negative for the Company.","Steve Volkmann","Okay, great. Thank you. And then, sorry if I missed this, but any update on the fluid conveyance divestiture.","Richard Fearon","Yeah that's proceeding as well and we are hopeful that it would close towards the end of the third quarter, perhaps the beginning of the fourth quarter.","Steve Volkmann","Great, thank you guys.","Yan Jin","Our next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stephens.","Rob McCarthy","Can you hear me guys?","Craig Arnold","Yes","Rob McCarthy","So I'll -- let me go ahead. The first question I would have is in the context of what you're seeing now, which is kind of a choppy challenging conditions overall, could you just frame how you think about kind of what your trough earnings could be if this is the peak this year? Is there any way you could attempt to answer that qualitatively or otherwise, Craig?","Craig Arnold","Yeah, and we tried to address this one a little bit, Rob, when we called everybody together for our Investor Day earlier this year. And one of the things we talked about is the fact that, as we think about Eaton in our new configuration and -- our new configuration would include obviously once we divest Lighting, once we get rid of FCD [ph] and given the fact that we generate such strong free cash flow.","We said what we're working on doing is standing up a company that even during a typical economic recession defined as two quarters or three quarters of GDP contraction that our company would be able to still maintain flat earnings during that period of time.","And so that's still the path that we're on and that's what our teams are working on doing and I think you see a lot of evidence today in our businesses, using Vehicle an example, despite the fact that clearly revenues are down pretty significantly, we're holding margins.","And so that's really the goal, and then because we do generate so much free cash flow that it will give us the ability in the event of an economic downturn to buy back more stock. And so that's really the formula that we continue to work towards, and what we would intend to do in the event of an economic downturn.","Rob McCarthy","That makes sense. And then, forgive me for this other question, It's a little impolitic. But in terms of your new announcements of the sector heads, obviously, Uday and Heath are very well regarded internally and externally and from all channel checks.","But the one thing I do get in terms of the feedback anonymously was the fact that as good as Heath is, he's never run anything explicitly from -- at a segment level, I mean, do you think is up to this, I mean obviously you think he is up to the challenge. But how do you think about that going forward or is that a risk to management or execution for Eaton?","Craig Arnold","Sure. I certainly appreciate the question. I will tell you the first thing I'd say is that Heath is an outstanding leader who has been around for a long time inside of Eaton and inside Cooper before that, and just an outstanding leader with outstanding judgment, outstanding decision making. And if you think about today the way we're organized, Rob, today, we have really three businesses, right? And inside of these businesses, we have presidents who really run the day-to-day who are great operators, who know how to execute.","And what we're really looking for in this sector job is really strategic thought leadership and Heath, by the way, has had [indiscernible] as does Uday, And so I would tell you that he is exactly what we need for the business at this point in time, the business is going through in all three cases a fair amount of the strategic repositioning with a lot of moving parts and pieces in all three businesses as we talked about and what really our businesses need is a partner somebody can work with them on, how do you think about the future of these businesses and what strategic moves should we be making to maximize our results and our performance and with really three strong operating guys, it made no sense to put four in the box and put somebody else with exactly the same background into those businesses and Heath will bring exactly what we need for those businesses, which is really strategic thought leadership.","Rob McCarthy","Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Good. [indiscernible] question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a question on, first on China, could you describe in more details what the trend has been through the quarter because it appears that something happened in June and I wonder if you've seen a slowdown in June? And if you could just describe the intra-quarter trend in China? Thank you.","Craig Arnold","Yeah, I can't say that we saw anything specific at all. Andrew, in the month of June, I think what we've generally reported, is that in the -- certainly in the short cycle businesses, specifically in automotive in Vehicle markets, we clearly saw a weak quarter.","We saw a little bit of a weaker quarter in Hydraulics for sure in China. The long cycle businesses, non-res construction, residential construction continue to be strong during the quarter.","And so I'd say this kind of bifurcation of these two different markets depending upon where you sit, that's kind of been a pattern that we've seen out of China for most of this year and in Q2, and the month of June wasn't really much different than that.","We are optimistic that with some of the infrastructure-related spending, that's -- and the stimulus initiatives that have been put into the China market, we could have a better second half of the year, but at this point, we really didn't see anything significantly different in China that was unlike the pattern that we've really experienced all year.","Andrew Obin","And I apologize if I missed the question. Could you just comment on the growth rate within ES&S? What's the growth rate for Services, what was that in the quarter? And what are the big trends there?","Craig Arnold","Yeah. As I mentioned, as I was walking through the businesses, we really had a really strong quarter of orders in our Electrical Systems & Services business, up strongly in the US some 15%, Europe was up also close to 15%.","So, Services really was one of the standout performers for orders during the course of the second quarter and so we continue to be optimistic about the outlook for Services overall.","Andrew Obin","Terrific, thanks for fitting me in.","Yan Jin","Good. Thank you all. We have reached the end of our call, and we appreciate everybody's questions. As always, Craig and I will be available to address any follow-up questions. Thank you for joining us today.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the presentation for this morning. Again, we thank you very much for all your participation and using our Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect."],"7942":["Eaton Corp.

At this time, all telephone participants will be in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","And I'll now turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Don Bullock. Please go ahead, sir.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you to all of you for joining us for Eaton's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO, and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","Our agenda today, as normal, will typically include opening comments by Craig highlighting the company's performance in the quarter and an outlook for the remainder of 2016. As we've done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments.","A couple of quick items before I turn it over to Craig. The press release for today's earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation do contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of today's call is accessible on our website and it'll be available for replay.","Before we get started, I do want to remind you that our comments today do include statements that are related to expected future results. As a result, those are considered as forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ from those for a wide range of uncertainties and risks. All of those are described in the 8-K.","With all that, I'll turn it over to Craig.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thanks, Don. I know that most of you have worked through the earnings release and the details of our earnings already as I've seen a number of your reports already. So what I'll try to do this morning is hit the highlights and then maybe add some color commentary in and around the results. First of all, you noted that EPS did comment at the midpoint of our guidance of $1.15 and we're actually pleased with these results despite revenue coming in weaker than what we expected. We actually delivered strong operating margins at 16% and 16.5% excluding restructuring, largely as a result of better restructuring benefits and good cost control across the company.","We had another strong cash quarter. Cash flows were $798 million in the quarter. Our cash conversion ratios in the quarter were 130%, driven by strong margins and the benefits of amortization. Year-to-date, our cash conversion ratio is 110%.","We took advantage of our strong cash position and we repurchased 3.7 million shares, $243 million in the quarter, and this brings our full-year repurchases to 9.2 million shares or $560 million versus our target of $700 million for the year.","Turning to page 4, the financial summary, as we've said, total revenues in the quarter came in weaker than we expected. If you recall from our earlier guidance, we expected Q3 revenues would be flat with Q2; and organic revenues actually came in down 1%, with less seasonal growth in both of our Electrical segments as well as weaker sales in Aerospace and Vehicle. Revenue is 4% lower than prior year with 3% of that coming from lower organic revenues.","We did have strong operating performance, as I mentioned, in the quarter. A couple of points of reference for you. In comparison with Q2, we delivered $20 million more of additional segment operating profits on $93 million of lower revenue and, excluding restructuring costs, the improvement in profit was $7 million on, once again, $93 million of lower revenue.","And one more comparison point for you. When you compare with Q3 of 2015, excluding restructuring costs we delivered strong decremental performance. Profits were actually down some $27 million on $216 million of lower revenue, a 12.5% decremental rate. So we continue to think that the businesses are executing extraordinarily well in a tough revenue environment.","And as a result, we were able to deliver a small improvement in segment margins despite the decline in revenues. In turning our attention to the segments, we'll begin with Electrical Products. Here our revenues were flat year-on-year but down 1% versus Q2, largely on currency and continued weakness in our industrial markets.","Areas of strength included LED lighting, up mid-double digits with LED sales now accounting for 68% of our total lighting revenue. Residential Construction was up mid-single digits year on year as well. And a key area of weakness here really continues to be industrial controls and the components that we make in our Electrical Products business and actually sell to the assembly side of our house. So really a continuation of the trends that we've seen all year.","Margins continue to be strong at 18.8%. And if you take a look at bookings, bookings were down 1% in the quarter, a little better than last quarter where we were down 2%, but certainly not up to the expectation that we had, with strength in Lighting in residential markets, strength in the Middle East, Western Europe and continued weakness, as I noted, in Industrial Controls.","In Electrical Systems and Services, revenues in the quarter were down 3%, 2% organically versus Q3 of 2015 and essentially flat sequentially from Q2.","You will recall that in Q2 our bookings were down 2%, so we've clearly seen a bit of deterioration in this segment as bookings were down 5% in Q3, driven by once again a continuation of the pattern that we've seen all year, continued weakness in industrial projects in oil and gas offset by some strength in U.S. light commercial markets, Asia-Pacific, Northern Europe. But clearly these areas of strength were not large enough to offset the declines in the other markets. Margins were 14.2% excluding restructuring costs, and up from both prior year and Q2, really reflecting the benefits of the restructuring work that's going on across the company and in this segment.","In the Hydraulics segment revenues were down 6% from prior year and down 5% from Q2. This Q2 to Q3 change is seasonality and is really consistent with prior years, so not at all unexpected. Q3 revenue shows about equal weakness in both OEM and distribution. And within the OEM channels, stationary was down more than the mobile side of the business, largely as a result of the ongoing weakness in the oil and gas market.","Bookings declined 3% in the quarter, very similar to the levels that we've seen in Q2, which were down 2%. But here we do see some differences between OEM and distribution, with OEM orders up 2% and distribution orders down 8%. We're once again very pleased with our margins, which came in at 10.9% and 12.6% excluding restructuring.","In Aerospace, revenues were flat organically and down 3% excluding FX. And the FX impact was entirely the result of the lower British pound. Revenues were down 2% from Q2 and down 1% organically from Q2. Encouragingly, we once again saw very strong margins, which were 20% in our Aerospace segment, and also strong quarterly bookings. Bookings were up some 15% in the quarter with continued strength in both Commercial and Military OEM, partially offset by continued weakness in business and regional jet activity. Aftermarket bookings were also up 5% in the quarter, with particular strength on the commercial side.","And in the Vehicle segment, revenues were down 12% year on year, driven principally by the large decline that we're seeing in the NAFTA heavy-duty truck market. Production was down some 35% in Q3. Revenues were also down 5% versus Q2. So we now expect the NAFTA heavy-duty truck production to be approximately 225,000 units this year versus our prior thinking of 230,000 units.","Passenger vehicle sales in the quarter remained strong with particular strength in China and modest strength in Europe. And margins, while certainly below prior year, remain at attractive levels at 15.5% and 16.2% excluding restructuring.","If we take a look at the balance of the year, what we're really seeing here is industrial weakness, and industrial weakness that is continuing. And so we now have updated our overall revenue forecast to be down 4% for the year, and so we're really thinking that the year now comes in at the lower end of our guidance. And as you'll note from the chart on page 10, we did in fact make a number of meaningful adjustments to our full-year outlook. And I'll walk you through some of the detail here and some of the drivers.","First, in Electrical Products, we took the midpoint of our guidance down 1.5 points. And this is really principally due to additional weakness in industrial components and industrial products such as fuses and structural support products, and as well as some softness in some particular geographies, notably in the Middle East and Canada.","In Electrical Systems and Services, some tuning here, we took our guidance down 0.5 basis points and this is principally a result of continued weakness in the oil and gas projects, including the Middle East; and then large industrial project activity slowed even more than what we anticipated in the quarter.","In Hydraulics, the one segment where we're actually taking our revenue guidance up for the year, up 1.5 points. And this is largely as a result of what we're seeing as stabilization in China and what we think is a bit of an inventory correction that's taking place in some of our customers in some of our markets.","In Aerospace, we took the guidance down 1.5 points, and this is largely as a result of ongoing weakness in business and regional jets and lower military spending.","And then lastly, in Vehicle, a couple of point reduction in our guidance for the year, and this is 100% a result of the ongoing weakness that we're seeing in the heavy-duty truck market and the reduction in the market from 230,000 to 225,000 units. And that'll cascades through to the company's revenue being down some 1% from prior guidance.","If we turn our attention to page 11, restructuring, we're pleased to report that restructuring plan is going well. Costs are essentially coming in at planned levels at $145 million. We spent some $23 million in Q3 versus our original expectation of spending $27 million. And this is largely due to some timing. And we think at this point Q4 will be $24 million versus our previous guidance of $20 million, so a little bit of a flip between the quarters.","We are, in fact, seeing benefits coming in slightly better than what we anticipated at $200 million for the year versus our previous guide of $190 million, and we saw these benefits largely come through in Q3. And a result of that is, clearly, we're updating our segment margin expectations for the year as well. And as a result of lower revenue and the decremental on that and a slightly different mix of restructuring in some of the businesses, we're also updating our full year forecast for segment margins.","For Eaton overall, as you can see on this chart, it results in a 40 basis point reduction in operating margins versus our prior guidance. And then, if you just look at the different businesses, quickly I'll walk through them, Electrical Products, up slightly, basically on expectation, and Electrical Systems and Services, a 30 basis point reduction. And that's essentially decremental on the change in revenue.","In Hydraulics, two things going on here, actually. One is higher restructuring costs in our Hydraulics business than we originally planned. And then, secondly, a little bit of a mix issue in terms of the mix between the OEM channel and the distribution channel that's playing through. And as I think most of you're aware, margins tend to be higher in the distribution channel than in the OEM channel.","And in Aerospace, we're taking our margins up for the year, a 90 basis point increase, and two things really driving this change. One is timing on program spending. Program costs, as you know, tend to be lumpy over time, and then a little bit lower restructuring costs in Aerospace.","And then lastly, in Vehicle, it's principally a function of lower volume and mix as most of the volume reduction is coming in the North America heavy-duty Class 8 market, which tends to be a little bit more profitable than the rest of the business overall. And so, once again, that'll cascade through to a 40 basis point reduction.","If we take a look at our guidance and the outlook for Q4, as we reported, we now expect revenues to be down 1.5 points from Q3. We expect margins will be between 15.4% and 15.8%, driven largely by, once again, lower volumes and unfavorable mix, growth in lighting and some weakness in industrial controls and large industrial projects, and continued weakness in oil and gas.","And we're reducing our Q4 guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint, with a range of $1.05 to $1.15. We expect our tax rates will be between 9% and 10% in Q4. And as we said earlier, for the full year, the updated revenue forecast is that organic growth will now be down 4%. And this $0.10 reduction in Q4 EPS amounts to about a 2% reduction in our EPS for the year and drives the change in the midpoint of our guidance, as reported.","So in summary, the chart that we always provide is a summary of kind of the key assumptions for the year laid out on the chart on page 14. You can see the assumption on the revenue change. Corporate costs are now forecasted to come in at $90 million below 2015 levels versus the previous guidance of $80 million, so a little bit better cost control and a little bit better benefits in restructuring.","And our full year tax rate is now expected to be between 9% and 10% versus the previous guidance of between 9% and 11%. And you can see the EPS forecast we talked about. And cash flow guidance unchanged. So while we're seeing a little bit lower profits, this is offset by better working capital management.","So just stepping back from the year and a summary of Q3, we see this period of general weakness in industrial markets continuing. Despite this weakness we think that our team delivered solid results in Q3. This order weakness, however, that we saw in Q3 is reflected in our Q4 forecast, where we see EPS will be $0.05 below Q3 and $0.10 below our full-year guidance. These changes are obviously cascading through, but we do expect to maintain our guidance on cash flow and share repurchase for the year.","Our initial thoughts and a look at 2017, I'd say while it's difficult to make a call on 2017, we do think this period of market uncertainty and caution on capital spending will extend into 2017. We're clearly dealing with a bit of a two-speed economy where the consumer side of the markets continue to do well, but industrial markets continue to be weak and uncertain at best.","So in response, as you noted in our earnings release, we're expanding our restructuring program by $50 million in 2017 to $180 million total. Other areas where we're likely to face a bit of a headwind for 2017, our pension plan discount rate will likely be lower by 25 to 40 basis points. The 2016 discount rate was 4.25%. And the way to think about this is for every 25 basis points decline in the discount rate, it results in a $20 million increase in annual pension expense.","We're likely to see slightly higher interest expense in 2017. LIBOR has risen, and as a result, changes in money market regulations, and this increases the cost of our floating-rate debt. We'll also potentially have some transitional interest expense related to refinancing some debt in 2017. And then we do expect a slightly higher tax rate as well next year.","We certainly remain on track to generate very strong cash flow, and we expect cash conversion in 2017 to continue to be above 100%. And this will certainly allow us to stay on track with the share repurchase program that we've announced and to deliver the targets that we've laid out.","This concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn it back to Don at this point.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our operator will give you instructions for those of you who are going to be posing questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. So just as a quick clarification on some of the 2017 commentary, Craig, the $120 million of incremental profit, I'm assuming that's segment profits inclusive of restructuring, so inclusive of that increase in the restructuring. Is that correct?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","That is correct, Nigel, so we're obviously increasing our restructuring expenses by $50 million, but we expect to see benefits in the year that will offset that additional spending.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And I'm assuming that there's some underlying sales assumption that's forming the basis of that $120 million. Maybe you could share that with us as well, Craig?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I think at this point, Nigel, all we'd really say about 2017 is that Q3 was certainly a bit of a disappointment when we took a look at a lot of our end markets and our order intake, and we expect that to continue into Q4. And we're in such a period of uncertainty right now, with so much volatility in many of our end markets that it really is difficult to make a call on 2017. And so we made the decision to increase our restructuring, because we think this period of uncertainty will continue. But we do think it's too early to make a call on what our revenues will be next year. I think once we get past the elections and a little bit of the uncertainty works its way through, we'll be in a better position to make a call on revenue next year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I have just a quick follow on that. So the $120 million, I'm just wondering what are the boundaries on sales that you feel comfortable with that range, because obviously there's a point by which you can't get that number. So I'm just wondering what the boundaries are around that connection to protect that range.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I think the restructuring benefits are largely a function of taking out fixed costs, support costs, and really are not in any way a function of revenue. And so those benefits are essentially independent of revenue.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you talk a little bit about your Aerospace outlook and the margins for 2016? Should we think about that as just the deferral of spending that will come back in 2017 so we don't take Q4 margins as a run rate into 2017?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, and I think that's absolutely the right way to think about it. As you know this business especially well, that the program spending tends to be quite lumpy, and you can have periods where your spending go up, periods where your programs are deferred and it comes down. And so I do think \u2013 great performance by our team operationally so we don't want to take anything away from the strong performance but, certainly, a piece of this is a function of lower program spending that will come back next year.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I appreciate that. And then could you just comment on the Q4 guidance? Where did you get the biggest surprise across the businesses?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, what I'd say, Ann, really throughout the summer months, we principally saw a weakness across most of our Electrical end markets. If you think about the markets that have been weak all along whether it's oil and gas or whether it's large industrial projects, industrial controls, we saw each of those markets essentially weaken up a little bit throughout the summer months, and that certainly cascaded through to the order input that we saw in our Electrical Systems and Services business, which, as we reported, was down 5%.","And so we saw clearly weakness there. We saw additional weakness in the North America Class 8 truck market, and that's what resulted in us reducing our forecast for that market to 225,000 units, but those are the places where we principally saw the reductions. It was really pretty broad across many of the Electrical end markets, as well as the North America Class 8 truck business.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just quickly as a clarification on the weakness in the large industrial controls, is that related to the slowdown in investment in manufacturing, you know, LNG petrochemicals?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","You're absolutely right, and you see the C30 data just as well as we do in terms of the government data, the put in place numbers, and almost every category with the exception of health care and commercial went negative in Q3. And so you're absolutely right that across all of those end markets we saw weakening this summer. Question \u2013 is that a function of all the uncertainty in the current environment? In manufacturing capital equipment, everybody's taking a pause until the air clears a little bit here around which way the U.S. is headed, but it was principally in the U.S. that we saw the weakness and really across most of those markets.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll get back in queue, and then I'll root for the Indians.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks a lot. Craig, I guess I just wanted to follow up on something that you mentioned at the end of your prepared remarks about confidence in hitting targets. So if you look at 2017 overall, does that mean that you're still reasonably confident of that 8% to 9% EPS CAGR target that you laid out in February? Or you are referring to something else?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I mean, the 8% to 9% EPS CAGR was really over a five-year period, and so there's nothing that we've seen in this kind of temporary pause that we're seeing a lot of our end markets at in any way takes away from our confidence in delivering the longer-term EPS improvement that we laid out. I think there really is a question around 2017 with respect to where some of these end markets are headed, and, quite frankly, we were surprised and disappointed with our bookings and the way a lot of the end markets kind of played out in Q3. Question \u2013 is that a temporary pause or does that play through more thoroughly into 2017? We just think it's too early to make a call.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood. And then on Electrical Systems and Service, profits in dollars and also the margin percentage, it's on track to fall for the third year in a row. Orders are soft, so the revenue line probably can't turn around until mid next year at the earliest. How should we think about the approach in that business aside from just cost-cutting? Is there anything more proactive you can do in terms of project selectivity, change the end market focus, exit certain business lines or something?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I'd say in Electrical Systems and Services specifically, as you're aware, we are in fact undertaking a fairly significant amount of restructuring in that business. And so if you take a look at our margins in Q3, without restructuring, at 14.2%, we do see improvement in the underlying margins of that business. To your point around growth, in terms of this, certainly this is the business that is most closely tied to infrastructure spending, large projects, and so it is very difficult in the near-term to fundamentally delink this business or really any of our businesses from the secular trends that are taking place in these large end markets.","Having said that, we have lots of growth initiatives that we're focused on in every one of our businesses, and Electrical Systems and Services included. So today, I'd say that in the short term it's going to be very difficult to fundamentally perform significantly different than the end markets that that business serves.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very helpful. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning, all. Let's get a little more detail around the restructuring actions. First, just the 3Q to 4Q shift, maybe just a little color on what was driving the shift?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","We had a $4 million shift between the quarters, as you'll note and as we talked about. In Q3 we actually delivered $10 million more benefits than what we forecasted. So the program is very much on track, and we're very happy and pleased with the way our teams are executing. But as you think about restructuring programs of this magnitude, there can always be timing associated with a number of the decisions that you make, negotiations that have to take place in some cases with work councils and unions around the world. So I would just say it's a small adjustment of timing of spending between the quarters but nothing to be concerned about.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And while there's always pro-restructuring programs to find across a large, complex organization, these are some big step-ups. What kinds of programs are you tapping into now when you do things like all of a sudden put another $50 million on the table for next year?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","And the way we would think about it, by the way, is it's really not all of a sudden, because as we've talked about in prior calls, our businesses today have a healthy backlog of opportunities to restructure. And so we are always working on a pipeline of opportunities that our businesses are advocating for, that make sense, and it's really a matter of metering these programs in, given the organization's capability of digesting all of the restructuring that's undergoing.","And so today, the programs themselves, it's really more of the same. And we talked about looking at structural costs inside of our businesses, looking at management layers, span of control, taking out fixed costs, looking at the manufacturing footprint that we have around the world. So it's very much in line with the type of restructuring programs that we've done historically, which is why, quite frankly, you see a very strong payback on the program that we've announced. And so it's very much consistent with what we've done in the past.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Is the footprint a big \u2013 a very large part of this one?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I'd say it's a mix. It's always a mixture of some footprint-related changes as well as some structural support cost-related changes, but I will tell you in all cases, it is structural costs, the type of costs that don't come back as volumes change.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And just one other one, on the tax. The quote or the comment around the slight tax rate increase for 2017, any color there as you sort of think about the longer-term tax rate also?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I'll handle that, Steve. We think the rate between 2016 and 2017 is likely to go up probably a point. Now, that's a very early estimate because it obviously depends on the precise mix, so I don't have a profit plan to look at. So I'm operating with some high-level assumptions. Going forward, it probably continues to go up on the neighborhood of perhaps a point a year, not more than that. And we'll have a further, more fulsome description of the medium-term outlook when we give our formal guidance for 2017.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks, Rick. Thanks, Craig.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Morning, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Hey, Craig, can I pick up please on the whole restructuring context? And I look back and it seems like Eaton has been doing, at least in this cycle, outsized restructuring since the second quarter of 2014. I realize that was before you became CEO, but now that you are CEO, help us understand why is there all of this sort of runway and restructuring? Like why don't you start \u2013 like why do you have so much to do? Why don't you start cutting into bone versus sort of the fat? I guess that's \u2013 help us just understand why this continues?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I'd say, John, one of the principal issues is if you take a look at the size of the company today versus what we had forecasted, let's say, going back in the last strategic planning period, Eaton is a smaller company. A lot of our end markets over this period of time did not perform anywhere close to what our expectations were. So there's a piece of what we're doing that's essentially rightsizing our company, given the current revenue and the certain size of commercial and economic activity across our enterprise.","And having said that, as you're well aware as well, we built this company for the most part through a series of acquisitions. And when you acquire companies, you always acquire excess capacity in manufacturing. And if you'd said, do you have the ideal footprint, if you could start from a clean sheet of paper and redraw it, you never end up in that place if you grow a company through acquisition. And so we're really taking some steps back and saying, what can we do, what would we do if we could start with a clean sheet of paper? How would we draw it up? And from that are coming new ideas and opportunities to do it smarter, to do it better, to do it more efficiently.","And so we think we're encouraged by the fact that our businesses have a lot of ideas and a lot of recommendations around things that we can do to continue to improve our margins, despite the fact that we're working in really tough operating conditions.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Is the nature of this stuff, kind of going forward, is it still a people question, or is it more of kind of like a tooling, efficiency, productive ops argument?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Really, it's about at some point in terms of kind of the support cost infrastructure around our business, we'll run out of runway there. Today, we haven't, but at some point we will. But I'd say if you look at, let's say, the manufacturing footprint around the company around the world, I think we'll have opportunities for the foreseeable future to continue to fine-tune the footprint, to fine-tune the way we serve the market. And so I think that it'll be a base level of restructuring. And what we said historically, it's a number that's order of magnitude around $60 million that will always be resident inside of our company. And so we're not even close to running out of ideas at this point around things that we can do to improve the efficiency of the organization.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And actually, it's appreciated that you actually include it in your results. Could we shift gears just for a second, you guys \u2013 you have sort of on the front line of a lot of construction markets. I know you get access to the NEMA data and so forth. What do you make of \u2013 and then, Craig, you called out light commercial markets in the U.S., I guess, or at least your results doing better, right? What do you make of this choppy non-resi data? And some people have asserted that maybe non-resi markets have peaked or passed the peak. How do you think about that in the context of the markets you serve and your own runway?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I think it's been tough to get a clear read. And that's why perhaps you're seeing so many conflicting data points and so many companies commenting on different signals. And today, as I mentioned, the C30 report is a good proxy, the NEMA data is a good proxy. And the NEMA data was pretty much consistent with what we saw in the C30 report. We saw weakening in many of the non-resi end markets in Q3. And that's really what's played into a lot of our thinking around Q4 and perhaps playing into 2017.","So we still see, if you think about a walkthrough markets, we think the industrial piece, the manufacturing sector, things that have to do with capital spending, continue to be weak. And we see those markets to be down kind of low to mid single-digit this year. Now, oil and gas continues to be weak? Yep, the rig count has increased, but we've not yet seen any of that play through to any strength in oil and gas. In fact, the data was a little bit weaker in Q3 than it had been year-to-date.","And so we continue to see weakness on the industrial side of the house, but, having said that, we're seeing strength on the consumer side. Residential housing, the lighting market continues to do well, the Vehicle markets around the world continue to perform well, the light end of non-resi construction, things that are really the small strip malls and really that are, I'd say, almost attached to household formations.","So it really depends upon what part of the economy you're serving, and there's pockets of strength and then there's pockets of weakness, and unfortunately today, the weakness is slightly outweighing the positives. But it really is two different pictures depending upon which part of the economy you're sitting on and I know your question is, where is it headed? Which direction is it pointed towards? And at this point I'd say it's a very confusing picture.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What about, lastly, China? I mean, you're seeing some stability. Other companies have called this out as well. Do you think this is a function of their prior stimulus or do you actually think that there is more sort of enduring demand that may start to kind of go on here despite the fact that you've got all this overbuilding in these property markets?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Sure. Yeah, we too have seen the strength that other companies have talked about in China. We had a pretty strong Q3 overall in terms of our order bookings in China and we saw that in our Hydraulics business. We saw that in our Electrical business as well. So certainly, the government stimulus programs are helping. Their monetary policy is helping. Whether or not these structural improvements will continue into the future, I think it's once again another one of these points of uncertainty. And they put the stimulus programs in effect for a reason. So they had some underlying concerns. But at this point we think China has certainly stabilized. I think the risk associated with China today is less than what it was probably the last time we had a conversation about China last quarter. So we're feeling better about China but longer-term I think it remains a question mark.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thanks very much.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Appreciate it.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBank.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Howdy.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. So just as I kind of go through the math of what you laid out on \u2013 you called out the decrementals and they were very good, but if you kind of back out the restructuring, both Cooper and the savings you got, the, I guess, underlying decrementals are pretty heavy, and specifically within Vehicle, I think that was an area you called out where you'd be more resilient. So maybe just speak, when you look at just the normal underlying decrementals, are you seeing \u2013 is it just the magnitude of the decline? Is it pricing pressure? What's contributing to some of that headwind?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I think, Jeff, overall we are that pleased with the decrementals that we're seeing in all of our businesses. And I think what we've laid out externally is that we say 35% decremental is typically what we would run across the company, and obviously that will vary slightly or in some cases widely depending upon which part of the company you're referring to. And so we're very comfortable with the decrementals that we're seeing in our businesses and we're not particularly seeing any net negative pressure between cost and price, so there aren't any particular unusual pressures there that weren't part of our plan and that we're not dealing with. Specifically in Vehicle, and as I mentioned, we're seeing a reduction in the North America heavy duty Class 8 market, which tends to be the more profitable piece of our Vehicle business.","But having said that, our margins in Q3 were 15.5% in an environment where the markets are down some 35% in North America Class 8. Excluding restructuring, margins were 16.2%. So we think that's, quite frankly, very strong performance in a period of time when markets are off as much as they are.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then can you give us a little more color on what you're seeing currently and prospectively in power quality and utility? I don't think you called either of those out within. And then I'm also going to be rooting for the Indians tonight.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","We all are. In fact, we'll be there. So in power quality overall, I'd say we're seeing markets that are essentially flat to up low single digit for the most part. The data center market, the three-phase market we think is performing largely flat for the year, so no big differences there in terms of what we originally anticipated for the year. It varies slightly depending upon what region of the world that you're in, but for the most part we're seeing those markets to be anywhere from flat to up low single digits.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","And I'd say the same for utility, too.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, and utilities. Yes.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","I think that's part of your question, flat to up low single digits.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Right. And our prior guidance was essentially to be up 0% to 2%, and essentially we're running right at those levels.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Craig, in passing, you just mentioned no significant price cost disconnects but can you give us a little bit of a forward look on what you see developing there? It would seem there are some cost pressures on the horizon. Are you able to take some price actions to counteract that? And what should we expect going forward?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I think the way we have approached the whole price versus input cost historically is that we see it for the company as being kind of a net neutral. In periods where we're seeing inflation, we're able to pass price on to the marketplace; and in periods where commodity prices are coming down we tend to shed a little price consistent with the deflation that we're experiencing in the company. As we've said in prior calls, we have a little bit of pressure in Electrical Systems and Services in pricing, but I'd say that's kind of built into the run rate of the business at this point. And so as we think about on a go-forward basis, we don't think anything has changed and the way I would encourage you to think about price versus cost is that it's a net neutral for the company.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks. And then just on thinking about cash and cash flow looking forward, maybe a question for Rick, but the cash conversion very strong this year, clearly some inventory liquidations and the like. But I'm just wondering if you kind of roll it up into next year, perhaps you had pension funding, cash taxes move around. Any early read you can give us on any of those big levers or a high-level view of what cash conversion should look like next year?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","We have not done our detailed cash planning, of course, for next year given that we don't even have a profit plan in place but I would tell you that given just the size of our depreciation and amortization, and we would not anticipate any significant pension contributions at this point. We should be solidly above 100%. I don't know exactly how much above 100%, but that would be my anticipation right now.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, and just quickly, you mentioned, Craig, that inventory correction in Hydraulics. I take that to mean an inventory correction going the other way, a rebuild or a restock? Is that what you were implying?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, exactly. A number of our customers had really drawn down inventory pretty significantly. So we think there was some restocking that took place in Q3 and it certainly helped with our total outlook for the year.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Just one clarification on all the restructuring and it's a very simple clarification. Is the bulk of this thing a permanent stepdown of cost, or is there a portion that if volume starts to come back you'd have to add back? I mean, very often it's a 40% permanent and 60% addback or so. Can we assume that this is much higher than that or ...?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, and I'd be hesitant, Eli, to call it 100% but it's close to 100% permanent stepdown. This is really taking out structural costs that we do not anticipate coming back as volume changes.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Can we talk about typically two markets. One, Aerospace is still positive but it's been disappointing in volume for across the board. Aerospace, you should have some visibility into 2017, so are we looking for this flat to slightly upmarket to continue or does the pushback from this should get pushed into next year? And can you do the same thing in the Hydraulics markets, should it improve with this restocking, does that continue, which means you can get to some positive gains in Hydraulics next year? Or is the general forecast basically a flattish kind of market year over year? Is that sort of what you're looking at as you look to 2017 based on the restocking that we're looking at?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, Eli, I appreciate the question. It's kind of the piece that we're working through right now with respect to what the 2017 outlook is going to look like for the company and for our individual businesses. And I'd say at this juncture we would prefer to defer that question given a number of mixed signals that we saw coming through the dataset in Q3. I will say that the general trends around strength in commercial side of Aerospace and the backlog that Boeing and Airbus has, there's nothing that would suggest that that doesn't continue to be a strength, and consumers continue to get on planes and fly, and revenue passenger miles were, quite frankly, quite strong throughout Q3, growing at 4% in both Europe in the U.S. and almost 8% in Asia. So that piece of the business feels like it's holding up pretty well.","We continue to see weakness on the military side. So we'd really prefer to defer that in terms of our thinking on how all those pieces are going to come together, but it's pretty much playing out as expected, other than, as we've noted in Aerospace, we saw much greater weakness in business-jet and regional jet than we anticipated. We and others in the industry, quite frankly. And so that's the piece that a little bit fell out of bed on us this year in the Aerospace market.","In Hydraulics, I'd say once again a lot of mixed data. You follow all the same customer sets that we follow, and you see some of the big construction equipment guys, and it doesn't look like things are getting better. They too are serving a lot of the industrial markets that are a function of capital spending. And those markets throughout Q3 look like perhaps maybe we're bouncing along a bottom here, but tough to call a turn in Hydraulics markets at this point as well. And so we hope to learn more as we come through Q4, but at this point I think in Hydraulics for certain it's tough to say that we've see the turn in the market and that we can begin to count on the markets turning positive.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","One final question, there was a whole flurry of data center orders in the third quarter reported over the next couple of years. Is that figured into your thinking or being figured? Is that sort of supporting as the market as we begin to look out into 2017 and 2018?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I think the world continues to consume and generate more and more data. And that's certainly very positive for datacenter markets. And we're seeing that strength play through our business as well. So I do think that's more of a 2017 tailwind as we think about the datacenter market overall and specifically, the three-phase part of datacenters.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","And that was particularly strong in the hyperscale centers, very large centers that the web services type folks are putting in. And I think to Craig's point, that will continue simply because of the strong growth in data traffic.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to go back to 4Q guidance if we could, and maybe it's hard to get too precise here, but can you share your assumptions of what sort of seasonal lift you're expecting in the fourth quarter? We've heard from a number of companies this earnings season saying they're not factoring in any sequential seasonal lift, and maybe some \u2013 would be helpful to hear your thoughts there?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I think we would be very much and solidly in that camp. And in fact what we've said is that we think that our Q4 revenues will actually be down 1.5%, a point and a half from Q3. So in fact, given the order data that we saw coming out of Q3, we're actually taking our Q4 revenues down slightly from Q3 levels. And that's pretty much across the board.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, any commentary on what you're seeing in lighting? And is there a mix between the two-speed economy, residential-related and commercial-industrial?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Lighting continues to perform well. Our business \u2013 and we think the market is up mid single-digit this year. And we continue to see a real positive performance in the LED piece of lighting, which as I mentioned, is continues to grow at double-digits, now accounts for 68% of the total business. And so lighting continues to be a bright spot. It's certainly a bright spot on the residential side of the house as well as in light commercial. And overall, they too are experiencing some of this weakness on the industrial part of lighting, but that's being overcome and offset by strength in other parts of the business. So lighting continues to be, we think, a positive growth factor as we go forward.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. I'll let you get away with that bright spot pun.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So just looking at the $180 million restructuring budget for next year, I would assume that it'd be kind of first half-weighted and maybe ESS heavy, but could you kind of help me compartmentalize those thoughts a little bit?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. We haven't laid out that level of precision yet exactly where all the dollars will flow, but I think it would be fair to say that those businesses that are struggling with weak markets will get more than their fair share of that restructuring dollars. And as you noted, we tend to do these things where it is Q1 heavy, so you could and should expect a big portion of that spending to come early in the year.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","But we should be in a position, perhaps with Q4 guidance call, to give you more color on exactly the way to calendarize the spending.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. That's helpful. I was just looking for a way to do better than prorating, really. And then the linearity question might be moot, because you've repeatedly talked about volatility and almost chaotic trends out there. But did August show particularly weak by any chance?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","What I would say that as we think about Q3 overall, we saw weakness in Q3, not necessarily big discernible patterns across the quarter. So it was a weak quarter of order input, as you can see in our total order intake. And I would not say that we saw significantly different patterns between the months.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Back on that last question, if I can do a follow-up, the no discernible pattern by month, we're a month into the fourth quarter. Is there any color you can give? Is it just the same that you saw in the third quarter?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","I'd say that we just concluded October, so we don't have all the details for the month of October yet, Andy, but I will say that, in general, the early indication would suggest that what we saw in October is very much consistent with what our expectations were for Q4.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Craig. And then if we could go back to the U.S. non-resi construction question and ask it a little bit differently, your Electrical business multichannel sales approach should give you a pretty broad view on concept through project completion. I'm just wondering based on the feedback that you've heard from primarily the Electrical businesses, are you seeing any pullback in the planning pipeline? Or is the overall weakness that you discussed mainly a project start deferral issue?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. I think it's much more the latter in terms of project start deferral issue that more than there is negotiations and things that are in the planning stages. It's companies finding the courage to make the commitment in this volatile and uncertain environment to actually go forward with some of these larger projects.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Craig. And then one last one on the Vehicle, you called out the weakness in Class 8. I'm wondering if you're seeing what we're seeing from like Ford or other OEMs some cutback on the light vehicle side.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I'd say so far the light vehicle markets have held up extraordinarily well. North America running flat at very high levels; China continuing to run very strongly at high-single-digit numbers; Europe doing better than what we imagined. So I'd say at this juncture, the light vehicle markets around the world, speaking about it globally, are actually holding up quite well. The one piece of caution in North America, we do see the incentives are increasing. And if you take a look at the incentives in Q3, they were up over Q2, and that always gives you a moment of pause or caution, but overall we think light vehicle markets globally are doing just fine.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","The next question comes Mig Dobre with Baird.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for squeezing me in. Just kind of a low-level question for me, I guess. I'm wondering if you can comment at all on any incentive comp changes that happened this year given the adjustment in guidance? And how those might be reset as a potential headwind into 2017?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, I'd say that our year is not done yet, so we've not made the final call on what our incentive comp will be. Our incentive comp plan does flex to the extent that the management team doesn't deliver the committed EPS guidance and commitments, our plans naturally flex. And so it would be reasonable to assume that it will be less than 100% year consistent with the results that we're seeing in the business. And so that, too, will be a little bit of a headwind as we look at 2017; but at this point, we've not made the final call on the incentive comp plan for 2016.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, and then maybe going back to the Vehicle business and a question on auto. Is it fair to assume that your restructuring thus far has really not impacted the light vehicle portion of your segment? And is this something that might be on the table for next year?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, we're just not in the position at this point to make any specific announcements around the restructuring plans until we work those plans through internally and communicate them fully with our employees, we're just not in a position to comment on that.","Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thanks.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hi.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just to follow up on some of the earlier questions on non-res and specifically the industrial side of the air pocket that you've seen most recently. Craig, can you give any more color on what fresh observations your customers are making that want to defer? I mean we've been in a very slow CapEx environment for, call it, two plus years now. Oil and gas, I think, has shouldered a good amount of the blame for the past year at least, and I get that that's a longer cycle business in some cases so maybe there are still backlogged projects that are bleeding off, but it does seem like the tone from yourselves and a lot of your peers out there is that 3Q took another step down but the drivers seem to be unchanged versus what we've seen from past quarters. So just maybe some calibration on what's really new here, and is this an election hiccup or anything else that they would point to that would be fresh?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","And I'd say once again, we're struggling with the data feeds very much like others, but we do think the thematic message that cuts through all these conversations is uncertainty, and if you think about any person running a business today and making a long-term capital commitment in the face of an economic environment and a presidential election that's been as noisy as this one with as much uncertainty around the environment that we're going to be dealing in, it's, while disappointing, a little bit understandable that companies are basically pausing and waiting to see how things play out before they make a decision around major capital multi-year commitments.","And so we think that's probably what's going on. But once again, we're not 100% certain either. What we do here pretty consistently is that it's a pretty uncertain period of time that we're dealing in and most companies or many companies are cutting their capital budgets and are putting decisions on hold with respect to multi-year commitments.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Maybe I'll ask the question a little differently. Would you characterize CapEx then as pent up? So whenever this uncertainty is lifted, do you have some idea of what could come back to the market? Or do you think some of this is just lost over a longer period of time?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","What gives us hope and optimism is that typically in the face of expansion on the consumer side of the economy, that that expansion in consumer consumption at some point translates to an increase in investment in manufacturing equipment and manufacturing assets so on the industrial side of the house.","In historical expansion periods, it's been about a 12-month delay and we're well into that already where the consumer side of the economy has continued to grow, yet we've not seen the investment in manufacturing in the industrial side of the economy. And that would suggest perhaps there is some pent-up demand out there, but, once again, we have to wait and see whether or not it actually plays through the way it has historically.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks for the color.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","At this point we're going to wrap up our call for this morning. As always, we'll be available to take follow-up questions for you immediately after today and for the rest of the week.

Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a remainder, the conference is being recorded.","And I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to our host Eaton\u2019s Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead.","Don Bullock","Good morning. I\u2019m Don Bullock. Welcome to Eaton\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Sandy Cutler, our Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and CFO. As has been our practice, we will begin today\u2019s call with comments from Sandy, followed by the question-and-answer as the host alluded to you earlier.","Before we move into the call, I\u2019ll take a moment to draw your attention to the statement on page 2 of the presentation. It contains certain; our presentation today contains certain forward-looking statements. The comments on page 2 outline those factors that could cause actual results to differ from what\u2019s outlined in the presentation. These factors are noted in today\u2019s release and also the 8-K. In addition, the presentation contains certain non-GAAP measures as defined by the SEC. A reconciliation of all of those measures and the most directly comparable GAAP equivalent is provided on the Investor Relations page of eaton.com.","With those opening comments, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sandy.","Sandy Cutler","Great, thanks Don. And thanks everyone for joining us this morning. I\u2019m going to work off of the earnings presentation which was posted earlier, and hopefully you\u2019ve all got that in front of you, I\u2019m going to start on page 3 that\u2019s titled highlights of the Q3 results.","Just a couple of comments here, we had a \u2013 we think a very strong and balanced quarter in the third quarter as you\u2019ve already read our operating EPS it was above the midpoint of our guidance it came under the $1.29 versus the $1.25 that had been the midpoint. Significantly that operating EPS is up 15% from a year ago in markets that are I would describe as in overall as a less than robust.","Our sales were up some 2%; core revenue was up 3% and then obviously reflects the impact of ForEx of the negative about 1 point. As you\u2019ll hear us talk as we go through each of our businesses and the total corporate results, revenues really as for the tail of two cities strong conditions here in the U.S. as the U.S. continues to strengthen and then weaker conditions as we get outside the U.S. and just as one indication of that when you look within our core revenue being up 3%.","The U.S. was up almost 7%, so we\u2019re doing quite well in our businesses here in the U.S. Our record segment profits which were really pleased to see here we call the first quarter segment profits were 14.5%, second quarter they were 14.6%, but I think you remember that we had taken some restructuring expenses on our industrial businesses during that quarter, without those restructuring expense the margins would have been about 15.2%, now obviously the all-time record 16%.","All of that drove a record operating cash flow of $943 million that excludes the legal settlements that were settled in the second quarter and we paid out as we\u2019ve mentioned to you in numerous forms paid out that cash early in July. On the free cash flow was that a very robust 14% of sales, really pleased with that performance.","Strong bookings in electrical again 4% overall, aerospace some 12% and we\u2019re really pleased that all the work we\u2019re doing to integrate the Cooper acquisition remains very much on track.","If we turn to page 4, just a very quick and pretty simple reconciliation to our guidance you recall as I mentioned our guidance the midpoint was $1.25. Our record margins which came in about $0.04 stronger than we thought that was really in the electrical systems and services segment. I\u2019ll speak more about that.","But very pleased with the very full recovery we made in the third quarter frankly a little faster, we had said that we thought we would get an average of about 14% margins in the third and fourth quarter. We obviously came in above that in the third quarter, then aerospace came in slightly higher powered by some of the strength of our aftermarket shipments sales. I\u2019ll speak more about that in a moment.","With volumes coming in just a tad lighter than we had indicated, when we were looking for about a $150 million of incremental revenue when we gave our guidance for the third quarter. We worked very hard on productivity and expense control across the company. Our corporate expense came in as you saw it about $64 million versus the mid 80s guidance that we had provided.","Taxes were about 2 points lower and that offset the lower than expected volume compared to our guidance and that was just about a $120 million lower expected physical volume and then a negative 65 impact, $65 million impact from ForEx. Again compared to consensus our volume was about $14 million difference in consensus out there. So, overall up some from $0.04, we think a very solid quarter of execution.","If we move to page 5, just the corporate numbers that you\u2019ve already seen with the overall sales 2%, 3% core growth that adds back to 1.4 for ForEx. I think the recent number speak very much for the prelim itself no impact of acquisitions or divestitures at the total corporate level.","So, topic right into the business segment, if we turn to page 6, another very strong quarter performance in electrical product segment, our biggest segment in the company. As you can see sales up some 3% from last year, core growth up 4%. We think really solid when we look, whether we look against peers or look against market here. Margins expanded to 18%, bookings raised significantly up 5%.","And when you look within those bookings, once again the story is very much the same as I\u2019ve already mentioned twice about strength in the U.S. bookings over 8% in the U.S, really strong numbers here again. And Asia-Pacific was stronger, as you might expect Europe being the area of still looking for stabilization in those markets and that\u2019s the area of weakness.","As we look within those bookings lighting continues to be an area of continued strength, volume up from 19% our LED participation or percentage of \u2013 percent of our total lighting revenue at 45% really leading the industry. I\u2019m very pleased with that. If we look around the world, we\u2019re pleased on the U.S. our demand for industrial products, our industrial control products up some 15% in the quarter as well.","Strength in the Middle East, and we\u2019re pleased that they were seeing some pretty strong activity, compounded activity in Asia now well not as true on the system and services side, but I\u2019ll come to that in just a moment. So, we think a really solid quarter, very much hitting our targets for performance here in terms of volume and margins.","If we move to electrical systems and services segment, perhaps I think the highlights of the quarter in terms of really converting upon our improvement plans here, come back and talk about those three areas that work particularly on here in the quarter. But obviously volumes up 1%, 2% of course, so again a negative 1 point from ForEx, up 2% from the second quarter as well. Probably the big highlight is the margin of 14.6% up from the 12.7% disappointing performance in the second quarter.","Bookings up 3% again over 5% here in the Americas region, so very much that same outlook and a number of you would recall when we talked about volume increases in the second half of 2014 that one of the portions of the systems and services businesses where we are counting on with strong services increase. Our bookings were up over 20% in the quarter, and services it was very much converting and we had thought, we\u2019re seeing a little better tone on utilities where we actually we\u2019re up about plus 6 in that particular area and doing well on the power distribution gear side.","The weakness continues in the large UPS markets, whether it\u2019s here or in Asia, and as we spoke to you we thought that it would be the condition that we continue for this year. Just a quick comment, following the second quarter and during our second quarter call we talked about initiatives to get our margins back in line with our own expectations that were around freight and logistics that are around capacity rightsizing and prior quality business and about continuing strong bookings momentum and getting a better price tone.","If you recall the time I told you that, there we needed improvement in all three of those areas that they were about equally weighted, frankly we had hopefully we would get to as I mentioned second half margins of 14%, which would have had us a slower in the third quarter than 14%, a little above 14% in the fourth quarter clearly. We got back to 14.6% for one quarter really good progress on all three of these, there was not a significant change in material cost. So that\u2019s not what drove these increased margins, increased margins came for getting the progress we targeted in those three areas. And we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter as well.","If we move to hydraulics, another challenging quarter in hydraulics and I think we gave you some indication of what our thoughts were in terms of what was happening in the market, at the end of the second quarter, we\u2019ve talked about it all through the third quarter that, while we\u2019ve talked about China construction equipment weakness over the last year or two, the big change in this market has been what\u2019s been happening in the global ag market and particularly in the U.S. and in Europe.","You\u2019ve all seen the announcements from the major OEMs, a very significant turn in their outlook in terms of what they are doing with anticipated sales and production announced the production as an impact on us. Let me turn first to the issue of bookings which are down 6%, very significantly our distributor orders were flat; they are actually up in the U.S.","But the real story to understand what\u2019s happening in the bookings level here is that, our OEM bookings were down 19% and if you took the ag market out of that total of OEM bookings. All our other OEMs are up some 6% and that includes the global construction market.","The real weakness is in ag due to significant cancellations in the Americas, in EMEA, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s probably a surprise and if you are following the ag market just going through preparation for quite a down cycle. We\u2019ve tried to be quite transparent that we think that next year will be a down year in ag equipment as well. And so, this quarter where our sales were down from last year 1% and again when you get under the 1% down in volume of shipments, and now switching shipments.","Distributor settlement is quite good up 7% OEM down 6% really driven by the ag side again. So our large exposure to ag is obviously showing up in this quarter, the 11.7% margins are influenced by the lower margin and the fact that we\u2019ve taken our inventories down in responses as well.","We think that this is a condition that\u2019s likely to carry into the fourth quarter; we\u2019ll see some small improvement in margins, but this kind of level in volume in the typical fourth quarter being slightly less than the third quarter in terms of volume as I think how this will play out in the fourth quarter as well.","I\u2019m going to switch to aerospace, really a terrific quarter in aerospace. If you move this is page 9, if you move to the slightly green colored box in the left hand lower side of this chart, you\u2019ll see the core growth was 6%, you see right the divestiture is 6%. These are the two smaller units that we divested in the second quarter that we now have a full quarter of the lack of those sales.","So, the actual organic growth in the business was really quite good, in fact very good, 6% we\u2019re very pleased with the bookings up some 12% and had both positive bookings on both the commercial and the military side of the business.","Significantly, we call out on the yellow box that aftermarket shipments accelerated during the third quarter that obviously is a help on the margins and I think you saw the very strong margins of 15.9%, you recall we\u2019ve had a number of quarters now, these past several quarters, we\u2019ve had significant acceleration on the aftermarket spares and repairs activity. And we\u2019re starting to see that come through in the shipments here as well.","We move to the Vehicle business, another strong quarter of performance, volume up 5% again core growth up 6% margins up 17.4%. We obviously raised our guidance for the NAFTA heavy-duty Class 8 build to 295,000 units for the year. We can see that finish line pretty clearly here as we said at the end of the third quarter really fourth quarter in terms of what this year looks like.","And I think in addition, to the strong September NAFTA heavy-duty orders of almost 25,000 units that we\u2019ve seen in the marketplace. We\u2019re hearing pretty good news about what October is going to look like as well. So, I think continued good news. The weakness in this particular market is the same as we spoken to you about and it has not turned around from production point of view, South America, Brazil in particular continues to be very weak in its vehicle markets.","And so we\u2019ve got again a little bit of a story of two different worlds here, the very strong North American activity, the very weak Brazilian operation and remember that Brazil is a pretty big percentage of our business that\u2019s outside \u2013 of the U.S. in this particular segment.","So, if we turn to 11 sort of wrapping up 2014. Full year segment margins, we still think to be above 15.2%, I\u2019m sure there will be individual differences by decimal point in these five different segments as we get to the close of the year and wait all the quarters. But overall we\u2019re pretty comfortable with 15.2% that\u2019s we shared in the \u2013 in our earnings announcement.","We think the full year market growth is, likely to be around 2% where the U.S. market is growing at an attractive 3% level and the rest of the world growing at more like 1%. ForEx obviously has been a big change vis-\u00e0-vis what we first saw at the middle of the year, and you saw we had about $65 million year-to-year of negative ForEx in the third quarter.","We think the full year is now likely to be on the order of some $220 million, for those of you who are doing the quick detection of that means more in the fourth quarter that was in the third quarter that is correct, because most of that currency change occurred in September. So, if they stay at these levels, we would get three months so that impact in the fourth quarter instead of largely one month of impact in the third quarter.","And we\u2019re really pleased that with all the complexity of all the different programs that our teams are working, they are doing a great job and the Cooper synergies remain on track for this $210 million in 2014, which to remind is about $95 million of incremental synergies and profits in 2014 compared to 2013.","We turn to page 12, operating earnings per share same numbers that we showed you full year at the end of last quarter, so we\u2019re holding that guidance that\u2019s up 11% from the previous year. The fourth quarter midpoint in terms of operating earnings per share were $1.20 that\u2019s also up 11% from last year. So, in markets that, we think are growing on the order of roughly 2%, we think very attractive leverage in terms of the profits dropping through.","If we move to chart 13, its titled comparison of Q3 to Q4 for 2014, that was the starts for the $29 which we reported for the third quarter. We will again get about another penny I think from Cooper synergies. Margins in our fourth quarter for those of you who following our company for sometime, normally are about half a point lower in the fourth and they are in the third quarter, a portion that has to do with their regions of the world of our large parts of December are not business days.","And that would account for about $0.06 drop from the third quarter to the fourth quarter that is inline well with our expectations were for the fourth quarter when we put our second half guidance together at the middle of the year as well.","ForEx we think, as I mentioned it will be on the order of about negative $100 million comparing the third quarter to the fourth quarter that can drive about $0.02 and then the normal lower core volume that we see with the fourth quarter being slightly less than the seasonal peaks in the second and third quarter. That will be in the order of about $50 million, and so that\u2019s how we get to our $1.20 obviously putting that together with our first three quarters, puts us at our full year midpoint that I covered on the previous stage.","Chart 14, is provided just for quick summary of the key elements that we try to provide in our guidance and discussion about results. A couple of changes that I have already mentioned, but I would just highlight them for your record keeping ease on this chart. Market growth it was at 3%, we\u2019ve lowered at the 2% as I mentioned before that changes all the occurring outside of the U.S.","ForEx you may recall, we started the year thinking it would be about a negative 200, we got to the middle of the year and it didn\u2019t look like it was going to be at that level 1 to 0. We now think it\u2019s a negative 220, I think further confirmation that we know-how particular does a great job of forecasting ForEx.","And then if you drop down to free cash flow, it\u2019s up $50 million, so it was $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion, as we\u2019ve gotten through the year this year and I\u2019ve looked kind of the pace of all of the programs and the programs we prioritize, we think we\u2019ll be spending about $50 million less than we thought when we enter the year. I would call that tuning, it\u2019s not a reflection of any programs being behind, it\u2019s really just our ability to get it spent this year.","If we turn to page 15, a summary of the quarter and the year, as I mentioned, we think it\u2019s a very solid quarter of performance clearly ForEx surprises a little bit, but I think it probably surprised almost everyone. Record margins really reflect all the work on productivity and effective cost control. Record free cash flow, we think really good look into 2015, I\u2019ll talk a little bit more about that in the next chart, running at 14% of sales.","We think the market conditions in the fourth quarter likely to be similar to Q3, the only modification of that I would say is just as a seasonal difference in the first quarter. And that we think a very solid attractive year this year with 11% operating EPS growth coming off the year with relatively modest worldwide market growth in terms of our markets.","I know very much on your mind at this point is, what is 2015 start to look like, its \u2013 we\u2019re in the midst of our operating planning. So, we can provide you only with a couple of kind of broad-based indications and obviously we\u2019ll address this in far more detail in January in our call at that time. But maybe a couple of comments to reflect, we think market growth is likely to be similar to 2014, I think the big trends there are continuing growth in the U.S. and lower growth outside of the U.S.","As you break that down kind of into our individual businesses, I think this our general feeling is that aerospace is likely to be a little higher growth than the average, hydraulics is going to be a little lower growth than the average. And the other franchises are going fall sort of somewhere in between.","As we\u2019ve mentioned in our last call and I would reemphasize again today, we\u2019ve got two very big drivers and sort of self-help here in terms of another incremental $50 million of Cooper synergies, another incremental $35 million of benefits that come from the restructuring we did in the second quarter of this year in our industrial sector.","And then the negatives that we spoke to you about earlier that we do expect that our tax rate will move from this roughly 6% this year to something and that 9% to 11% range next year.","And then finally an issue that many of you have asked us about and we\u2019ve discussed in quite some detail over the last year and a half. It has been our expectation ever since we announced the acquisition of Cooper by the middle of 2015; we would have the vast majority of our acquisition integration activities completed. We would have been paying off the major portion of the debt that we had indicated, we will repay back that we took on this part of the acquisition. And that the company will have the opportunity at that point to really be thinking through what is as around the very significant cash flow that we are driving at this point.","And that\u2019s likely to include either getting back into the M&A markets and\/or share repurchases. We\u2019ve not taken our finger off that chest piece at this point, you saw that we did purchase about $225 million of stock that was roughly 3.4 million shares in the third quarter. We\u2019ve had the capacity we believe that, if we decide it makes sense to continue us purchases in the fourth quarter, but that\u2019s frankly a decision we\u2019ve not reached yet.","And as we get into 2015, I think it\u2019s just to open without some very attractive alternatives for us as we get back to the point where our balance sheet is considerably strengthened and we would have completed most of this integration, which really gives us the confidence than to think about new initiatives, as I said that either around the M&A side or on the side of purchasing back shares.","So once again, we think a very strong quarter one that we really hit on upon the key elements that we felt that we need to improve upon it, if we came on a second quarter I think it sets up the fourth quarter entering next year on a strong basis.","So with that, Don, I\u2019ll turn things back to you and look forward to people\u2019s questions.","Don Bullock","Very good. Our moderator will give you some instructions for the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks, good morning. Sandy, I just want to pick up on your comments, your last comment on the share repurchase and\/or M&A. And I think most of the thing of 2016 is as really when, the balance optionality opens up. So, mid 2015 is a bit earlier, so I\u2019m just wondering if anything is changed with the competition of the agencies et cetera. And in terms of, the pan limit REPOs this is M&A, I\u2019ve got to think that the common share price REPOs would be where you are thinking more so? So just any comments on that would be helpful.","Sandy Cutler","Thanks Nigel. And you\u2019re right, we do feel that we have the mature year of our synergies in 2016, but we have been pretty clear that most of the actions and decisions will have been completed by the middle of 2015. And what we\u2019ve been indicating over the last six months is that, we think that it opens some opportunities, we continue to kind of hit the cash flow numbers that we are that we can begin planning those activities in the middle 2015.","Obviously, if it was M&A it\u2019s likely to be something that we would think might not close to later in 2015, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t get the work done earlier in the lab. I \u2013 we tend to agree with you at the kind of share levels that we\u2019ve seen more recently, it has to be a pretty special acquisition to be one that would outpace the REPO.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then just switching to ESS margins, you indicated that your plan was for 14% margins in 3Q, you came in at full obviously ahead of that 14.6%. So, what was, what drove that outside of this year plan and should we then think about 4Q being sequentially higher than the 3Q, given your initial setup?","Sandy Cutler","And you stated what I said correctly is that, we did think that the second half would average 14% with the language that had used and really proud of the job our team did in terms of really addressing all three of the improvement areas that we said we had to work upon. So it\u2019s not our expectation, we would give that back. So that it\u2019s our expectation we ought to be operating at petty similar levels as we go into the fourth quarter.","This is a business unlike some of the other sectors where seasonally the volume goes down on a number, normally in the systems and services business the volume stays a little more constant going into the fourth quarter, because there is an awful lot of large installation to do repair and service work over the various different holidays that are sprinkled to the fourth quarter. So, our expectation is that, that would stay at these types of levels in terms of profitability.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just quickly, the ESS orders today reflect therefore pricing discipline on some of the larger project opportunities?","Sandy Cutler","I would say that the biggest issue there is still Nigel is the weakness in the very large power quality markets. And I think you\u2019ve seen that from a couple of our peers who have announced this well. That\u2019s the piece that is not as robust, the power distribution side is, I recall fairly robust as we go forward this time.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks Sandy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","Good morning guys. I just want to follow up a little bit on Nigel\u2019s question on UPS, I mean, I think some of us are trying to figure out how much of this weakness is cyclical and how much of it\u2019s circular, I mean did you see changes there and power quality eligibly that this is something it\u2019s probably going to stay weaker or longer than what you, usual cycle would be?","Sandy Cutler","I think what we\u2019ve been trying to share with people Scott and then first good morning. Yes, we do think there are some important changes going on from the point of view that there has been a period of over build and then under build and we think will come back to a period of time when people will be building in more, but the topology of the technologies are changing as well. And that so the total electrical package that is sold in many of these large datacenters that isn\u2019t changing much, but the mix between the power quality of UPS and the power distribution side is changing. And that\u2019s not in all of the datacenters, but it is in what we call some of the web 2.0 or hyperscale type of datacenters. And we spoke to that at several conferences this year.","So, I do think part of what we\u2019re going through right now, is that we got some areas where people have pulled back on spending all of these drivers of capacity continue to happen. So, I think we\u2019ll step back into that, but it does mean that companies got to have these new topology to really be able to deal with the change in the mix of product.","We do, we sell obviously both the power distribution and the power quality. So, on a net-net basis that doesn\u2019t make us softer, but it does made us a little slower on the product quality side.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","Fair enough. And I just want to get a sense of where your thought process is Sandy on, your stock price has been a little disappointing, I think it had a tough year and you\u2019ve lost that, for a while you\u2019re trading more like a multi-industry company now you\u2019re back to trading more like a machinery company. And does it make you start to wonder whether you\u2019re ever going to get credit for moving towards being an electrical equipment peer play that maybe some of the more cyclical businesses are always going to have an outsized influenced on where you trade?","Sandy Cutler","I think for us Scott, it\u2019s really all-around performance. And, I think that we\u2019ve built a company that has balance, it has balanced from a geographic point of view. It\u2019s got balance from how it participates to the cycle that is balanced in terms of its different businesses. And I think what we\u2019re trying to deliver for its shareholders and owners is a stream of income and revenues that continues to grow right through the cycle regardless of what\u2019s happening around the world.","There will be individual quarters where an individual business or region in the world won\u2019t be a strong as others that\u2019s part of being a global company as part of being a diversified company. So, we still think we can deliver on that strategy and that promise. But we have to deliver it each quarter and that\u2019s what we\u2019re really focused on.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","Okay, fair enough, excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein Research.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research","Thanks and good morning guys.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning.","Rick Fearon","Hi.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research","Maybe just start off with that 2015 guidance, any preliminary thoughts and how you was thinking about the corporate line items in pension and some of those other, can be large swing factors?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, maybe just on the pension issue, you may recall at the end of the second quarter, we had opined that, if rates had stated similar rates that we might see a tailwind, a positive tailwind in terms of pension cost. I think about as quickly as we said that, we saw interest rates and discount rates continue to move in confounding directions. And so, I think our guidance at this point is that, we just don\u2019t know and we\u2019ll see when we get those rates at the end of the year. So, that\u2019s why you don\u2019t see that on our summary list at this point.","I think in terms of the corporate expenses, I mean obviously you see that we have really worked hard on productivity and cost, all through the company as markets have grown a little less quickly than we all might have hoped at the beginning of the year. I think you got to assume that\u2019s going to continue as we go forward. We think this worldwide economic outlook that we have is one that basically says that U.S. is going to continue to be the strongest part of the neighborhood.","But you\u2019re going to see Europe struggle through challenging times on a continuing basis and that what\u2019s going on in the emerging nations will be quite inconsistent from country-to-country. And that\u2019s what sets our belief that, you have to be ready to run your company successfully with this growth rate of that what we\u2019re experiencing around 2%.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research","Okay, well on the \u2013 maybe on the segment margin commentary, ex-cost synergies in that implied in that guidance as well. So, and if you get the $185 million between cost synergies and restructuring benefit, but normally even if you didn\u2019t have that and you\u2019re steering at 3% plus core growth in the business, you should see some positive fall through on the margin side. Maybe how are you thinking about that?","Sandy Cutler","I think what we\u2019ve indicated there Steve, as we think for this 20% to 25% is probably the right way to be thinking about that going into 2015. And obviously as we get to our operating planning, we\u2019ll share far more detail on that and kind of margin targets for each of our businesses as we start the year next year in January.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research","Okay, all right. Maybe I\u2019ll be have a little more luck here, on the Cooper synergy discussion then. How is the, last time you gave us the, I think with slide 16 in Q2 and look through the annual pretax synergies, I assume there is no change to that thinking. But are you really seeing these revenue synergies come through, because you\u2019ve got slower market growth, you\u2019ve got the even the outgrowth that you\u2019ve talked about it\u2019s a little hard for me to tell whether you\u2019re really getting some of these sales synergies?","Sandy Cutler","No definitely, we\u2019re really quite excited about it, and I think you see that and the comparison when you go to our electrical product segment, you look back over bookings just as your first quarter 6%, second quarter 6%, third quarter 5%, good on the peer numbers, the electrical industry and we obviously look at those pretty hard in terms of the core numbers. And you clearly see what we\u2019re gaining, I think for those who are out there in the channel and have been at the major customer conferences. It\u2019s pretty clear for those who are closely and they know we\u2019re gaining and these synergies are coming through. There is no question about it.","Steve Winoker \u2013 Bernstein Research","Okay, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks Sandy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi good morning guys.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning.","Rick Fearon","Good morning.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Sandy, can you just talk about as you look across your different businesses and you talk to your new chief economist, what does lower in oil prices do to each of your businesses, obviously there may be some upside to vehicles perhaps and maybe downside just some other business, just conceptually how are you thinking about that?","Sandy Cutler","Ann, obviously there have been some forecast put out this last week and 10 days, which obviously people I think spending a little bit, we personally are not bought into the $75 oil forecast. But, having said that, with lower prices there are obviously oil prices there are couple of businesses that again, it takes some time for these changes to come through. But, obviously the vehicle markets that are enhanced by that lower cost, obviously will help the aerospace industry as well, because it\u2019s lower cost there as well.","We think it helps residential construction, because the consumer has more money. It helps utilities, because the utility cost go down, their cost of operation go down as well. I think within oil and gas, because the \u2013 I think the question in everyone\u2019s mind is, how severely does this push back investment in oil and gas and awful lot of the activity is going on in oil and gas is actually downstream not upstream and the type of work that has to be done there and we\u2019re really quite excited about our revenue potential in 2015 and 2016 in that particular area.","And when you do go upstream you\u2019ve probably seen some of those stuff that\u2019s been published recently in terms of the number of rigs that have to be extensively we work as over 30 years old. I don\u2019t think a relatively short-term change is going to have, and a short-term six to nine month is going to have a significant impact. So, I deal to your question, I think there are number of businesses that get a plus out of lower prices and we\u2019re not a big consumer industry, we\u2019re reading the same thing everyone else is reading. That people anticipating on lower Eaton costs that the consumer may do well both at the pump well there would be a close lower Eaton cost. That would be our general thinking.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, on net-net more of a positive than the negative is that, if you\u2019re going to 50\u2026","Sandy Cutler","I think for many of our businesses and I think on the issue as you know how long does it stay down, because obviously if it stays down for a couple of years. I think then you\u2019re likely to have an impact on spending patterns by the major oil and gas and service companies.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay and then, thank you that\u2019s good color. And then following up, your lighting strength, just a point of clarification, you said volumes was up 19% was that unit volume or is that revenues?","Sandy Cutler","That\u2019s revenues.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll get back in line.","Sandy Cutler","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc","Hey good morning guys.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc","Just one last one on 2015, and I think maybe Rick touched on this at a conference, but how are you thinking about restructuring cost the $40 million you spent this year kind of going away versus, finding other restructuring to do?","Rick Fearon","I think we\u2019ve been consistent on this Jeff, since we spoke last spring and announced our attempt to do that is, the $39 million that we\u2019ve expanded, we said it was going to be 40 it turned out to be 39 in the second quarter, was a pull forward as some activities that we had not anticipated doing during 2015 when we started 2014, when we started our plan. Having said that, we\u2019re doing restructuring all the time in our company and we would expect that we would continue to be doing that in 2014 and 2015, I think is just a normal part of doing business. We encourage people to think about the $35 million of benefit, but that the 39 would not go away i.e. that is part of the overall restructuring we do year-to-year. The only reason we call that out this year that was the change to our plan and once we had started the plan and we saw markets start to weaken.","So, you should not take 39 plus 35 and assume that a source of profits next year. It would be the 35 on top of this year\u2019s profits.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay perfect. And then just on free cash momentum, can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about pension contribution, cash restructuring and working capital in 2015 versus kind of how it played out in 2014?","Sandy Cutler","Yes, I think in terms of the pension Jeff, it\u2019s a little early for us to be able to say per se, because the interest rates are, and discount rates are proving to be a little bit more volatile than we might have thought they would be. It would be less than we did this last year, but we\u2019re not yet comfortable we know how much less. Rick, you want to add anything to that.","Rick Fearon","Well the other factor Jeff that you will know is Congress passed a bill that reduced the minimum required contributions for 2015. So it gives a little more lead way, but nonetheless still heavily impacted by the discount rate.","Sandy Cutler","On the question of cash restructuring, our restructuring tends to be pretty close cash and profit impact and I think you may recall that we didn\u2019t include the chart simply, because it haven\u2019t changed. But that the anticipated acquisition integration cost in 2015 were 35 million and that\u2019s our best thinking still at this point. So, no change in that regard, then you had a third element Jeff.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc","Just working capital?","Sandy Cutler","Working capital. Working capital as generally run above 16%, 17% of sales and so I think whatever your assumption would be of incremental volume next year that\u2019s a pretty good number to assume in that regard.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Aylwin with BofA Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Aylwin \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Yes, hi guys how are you?","Sandy Cutler","Good morning.","Andrew Aylwin \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Just a question Sandy, you sort of described the world where U.S. is out growing to rest of the world and it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s going to change in 2015. And as you guys put your business plan, I would guess long-term business plan several years ago, where the world looked very differently and it was the international growth emerging markets on the industrial side that drove the growth. Are you guys giving any thought to long-term changes in your capital allocation i.e. shifting investment more to the U.S. changes to M&A strategy? What are your thinking about that?","Sandy Cutler","And I think Andrew, you\u2019re right whether your memory in terms of our view, and that was sort of pre-2008 and that once we came out of the recession, our view was that Europe was going to come back more slowly, because we really thought the amount of restructuring that have been undertaken, in the countries wasn\u2019t sufficient to really put them on a growth rate. We thought that the growth in the emerging countries, because you recall that inflation took off so quickly they had to reintroduce much higher interest rates would be inconsistent.","So, I would say on the run, we\u2019ve been making that adjustment all during this time period. I think China will continue to be attractive it\u2019s not going to grow the rates we saw before, but if it does grow it, it\u2019s a 6% over this time period. That\u2019s still going to be attractive, clearly geopolitical it has made Russia a whole lot less attractive. Middle East continues to be attractive to us, particular the oil and gas driven portions of it. Frankly, we had hoped India would be better, we think it will become better under Mr. Modi\u2019s leadership at this point. I think there is some early indications that will begin to change at this point.","And then I think the one that has been perhaps the bigger surprise in terms of how long it\u2019s going on as Brazil and you\u2019ve heard us speak about our own caution about Brazil in terms of what\u2019s been happening in the economy and obviously with election not having resulted in a change. I think one have to assume that economy stays a slower grower than it had been pre-2008. But I would say, we\u2019ve made those changes on the run, so I would say it\u2019s not so much conclusion where reaching you at the end of 2014 and yes it does, it does impact both where we can grow, where we will grow and where we\u2019ll put incremental capital.","Andrew Aylwin \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","And just a follow up question on ag. It seems like the order book is being built right now for the spring selling season that doesn\u2019t seem to be very strong. How long do you think until we hit the bottom, do we need to go through the full combined order season to really see where it ends up or do you think the spring selling season could be the bottom?","Sandy Cutler","I think, we can\u2019t give you a decimal point on this, but our best estimate is this takes more than one growing cycle to work its way through. When we spoke to this at the end of the second quarter, we thought it could take two or three growing cycles that\u2019s not two or three years that can be 18 to 20 months. But and we don\u2019t have any indication that of any newer data than that, I think what we\u2019re seeing is that, as people become have gotten closer to their actual built schedule, we\u2019ve seen them just not only here but, also in Europe. This is primarily a U.S. and European and to a lesser extent South America kind of impact, but big ag is cut back fairly significantly and coming off the peaks. We got to start to see those crop prices move back and you all know the crop price numbers they are a long way of the peak at this point. That\u2019s going to take some time to get them back.","Andrew Aylwin \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you, good morning everyone.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning John.","Rick Fearon","Good morning.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey guys, hi Sandy just to trying make sure I\u2019m understanding exactly what you are saying with respect to restructuring in the second quarter you took a sense of restructuring understand the context of pull forward. Just as we\u2019re sort of building out models right I mean, are you planning to also take another 39 million in the second quarter, or is it kind of TBD in terms of spreading it around. So, it\u2019s a question of is it still another 39 million, I think that\u2019s kind of what you said and what we expect in the second quarter or spread sort of throughout the year?","Sandy Cutler","I would say it\u2019s a TBD, because just as if we were sitting in the fall of 2013, we would have been working through our planning of when we were going to do different actions. So, I can\u2019t give you a specific quarter, but I think the way to \u2013 the way I would encourage you to think about it as we like I think most other large organizations are always working on areas and trying to improve the productivity and address issues that either on growing quickly or producing the kind of profit potential what we think are necessary. That\u2019s all I would think about that number, and it will be during the year, next year, it don\u2019t have a good enough feel right now we\u2019ll be able to share with you, what quarter.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Based on the strength of the U.S. would it be fair to say that if you were to pursue these actions, you probably are looking at your international operations or is it again that\u2019s sort of too soon to tell us well?","Sandy Cutler","I think a little too soon John, just because there is, we\u2019re going to $22 billion plus company there are always areas we can work to get better. And so it could be, it will be outside the U.S. there could be some things we do in the U.S. as well. I just don\u2019t have a good handle on our final prioritization yet.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And just to this is a clarification, you mentioned Russia, the Russian economy looks like it\u2019s falling apart, your exposure there is pretty de minimis is that correct even with the oil and gas side?","Sandy Cutler","We don\u2019t have, we have a exposure there in both our electrical business. So, that\u2019s probably our biggest exposure there, but it\u2019s not a big one, no.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And then, the thing on the tax rate, I guess I realized there is a little bit of a black box element to this, but Rick you\u2019ve alluded to and you guys reiterated this morning a 10% sort of tax rate placeholder into next year. I thought tax rates, number one, were going to be little higher this quarter. So, I\u2019m just curious why they weren\u2019t and secondly, just to understand why the tax rates, why would they hockey stick, why would they go from 6% to say 5 points higher in 2011 to get to the high end of your range?","Rick Fearon","Well you have a couple of things going on John and I mentioned this on an earlier call. In any given year you do have some one-off times that that enter into the tax picture and we have to expect it some of those this year and indeed they largely have occurred. Secondly, you have higher U.S. income and because, the U.S. is the fastest growing part of the world it does have the highest tax rate of virtually any country in the world. And so, it\u2019s the lack of those one-time discrete items plus the higher U.S. income that is really pushing the rate up. Now mind you 9 to 11 is an overly high rate compared to most others.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, so but the so you\u2019re saying Rick all of this is really just the impact of higher U.S. or is there?","Rick Fearon","That\u2019s a big part of it.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just the U.S. is up 7%, what got better in the quarter versus your expectations, obviously the performance was commendable, it\u2019s consistent with what other companies are saying, I mean what kind of got better and do you think it\u2019s sustainable as we roll into the next year?","Rick Fearon","To think from a geographic perspective it\u2019s not that anything really got better or worse from, how we saw thought the world markets were, kind of it always felt like Asia, excuse me like outside of the United States was weaker than the U.S. I would say that the thing that is continued to be weaker that really reinforced our lowering the full year market growth from 3 to 2 is that South America has continued to be weak, no question. Europe I think we\u2019ve all read the indication of \u2013 is it teetering on the edge of something a little worse than it\u2019s been over the last couple of years. And clearly, it\u2019s taken kind of a step back from one. I think the first quarter many people felt that maybe we are starting to trying to go up. I\u2019d say those are the big two that had changed.","China, the situation hasn\u2019t changed much our sales have increased there, but you hear a lot discussion around whether it\u2019s real 7% or 7.5% as well. I would say those are the two geographic areas. And I would say from what improved for us as I mentioned earlier was margins came in ahead of our expectations both in the electrical systems and services and in aerospace. And I think we have very attractive margins obviously in our vehicle market and our electrical product sector.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi. Thanks. You\u2019ve mentioned many times that the U.S is better than all the rest of it. But, I guess it sounds like electrical globally, the market grows at a similar rate in 2015 as in 2014, and the U.S. or North America is over half of that business. And presumably in that region you are seeing better trends and utility you talked about, you have been pretty vocal about non-res getting slightly better. So I wonder, you factoring in that for an electrical that you get a steeper downturn in LatAm next year or a bigger slump in China or Europe?","Sandy Cutler","I would say at this point Julian; we\u2019ve not tuned next year\u2019s forecast down into micro segments, the work that we have started doing right now. We just try to approach this kind of early view in the next year as I said. We don\u2019t see drivers of significant change at this point from the way markets are behaving this year.","And, so I don\u2019t have detail, I can\u2019t really provide you to tell \u2013 this one is sub-elements is going to move to another. Frankly, we were a little bit positively surprised that the utility business had a better tone to it here in the U.S. in the third quarter than we have thought. But I say, the rest of it has been pretty much as we had expected. And we have more obviously, as we get our operating plans; we are right in the middle of going through all those reviews with our teams right now.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks. And then on the outgrowth is something you used to talk about more \u2013 the sort of 150 bps of outgrowth you have delved in for this year. Any reason that changes much or any reason why you might change the way you kind of present the outgrowth?","Sandy Cutler","No, no that would be our expectation next year as well.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks. And then hydraulics, as you said EBIT was down more than revenue I think year-on-year in Q3 because of destocking measures sounds like that drags them into Q4. I guess how far through that destocking are you now and you sort of \u2013 are you taking measures to ensure that really in the second half of this year the destocking is ring fenced?","Sandy Cutler","Yes. And again it\u2019s just \u2013 no one wants to interpret to your question, it\u2019s not distributor destocking, which \u2013 this is our getting our own Eaton inventories down because we have seen the ag demand drop off. I think it really does depend upon how much more we see in terms of drop in the market. It\u2019s a drop of that demand. They have obviously cancelled very significant portions of the forward orders that we have in our backlog. But, our hope is that we have seen the worst at this point. We will have to see as we work through the fourth quarter.","As I mentioned our anticipation is seasonally, we anticipate slightly less volume in the fourth quarter than we had in the third quarter in our hydraulics business. This year we\u2019ve had pretty modest growth in the overall market that\u2019s our assumption for next year. So my hope is Julian that we have got a lot of that inventory correction done in the third quarter. I would guess, we would do a little more here in the fourth quarter.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso with ISI.","David Raso \u2013 ISI","Hi. Good morning. I\u2019m trying to size your comment significant cash to deploy. I can calculate by the middle of next year, your net debt to trailing EBITDA is probably back at 2 maybe a little bit below 2. So to help it size them, just trying to think through your comfort level with leverage. So it\u2019s the end of June next year, your leverage is down at 2 or less. What kind of capacity are we talking about, what kind of leverage are you comfortable running the company at?","Rick Fearon","As we said, Dave by consistently we believe the long-term positioning of the company should be straight A, but we realized, we first got to get A minus before you get there. And so the reality if to get to straight A, if you really ultimately think about that target you\u2019d have to be about 1.5. But we aren\u2019t saying we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re not going to do anything until we get to that 1.5 it\u2019s a balance of course of rebuilding the balance sheet, paying down the debt, we\u2019ve already committed to.","And just to remind, the last installment of that $2.1 billion that we committed to the agency to pay down occurs in January 2016. And so if you think about the cash on the balance sheet at September 30th, we\u2019re very close to $1 billion of cash and you think about cash generation in Q4 and then the cash generation next year is to relatively easy to see that and you also consider the pay down schedule that we\u2019ve committed to is relatively easy to see that cash does accumulate and that\u2019s what creates the optionality once you get to the middle of next.","David Raso \u2013 ISI","Well, just to be clear, I\u2019m just trying to make sure you all manage expectations on a significant comment. Again, the net debt to cap \u2013 the EBITDA being down 1.5 by mid next year, it doesn\u2019t look likely just given the seasonality of the cash flow. So just to be clear, are we saying we can be down near that 1.5 by the middle of next year?","Rick Fearon","No, no we also have to factor in the pay down schedule of the debt which is about $400 million in the first half $600 million in the second half of next year. What we are saying though is that even factoring in the pay down schedule we will begin to accumulate more and more cash on the balance sheet and that gives the comment about optionality.","And of course, we generate the largest part of our cash flow each year on the second half. And so we\u2019ll start to accumulate as you get to the end of the first half and then we\u2019ll accumulate much more during the second half of next year and so absent taking any actions acquisitions through purchases you would expect to see at the end of next year with the relatively better cash balance.","David Raso \u2013 ISI","Okay. Just to quantify\u2026","Rick Fearon","I would just add to comment Dave that and I recognize that how you\u2019re trying to calibrate this and I\u2019ll go back to what I said earlier is that by the middle of next year, we will be in the position to make decisions about deployment, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean what we do it at the middle of the next year. But, I think we\u2019ll be in a position them having seen what the cash flow is and what the rate of improvement is that we can start to make decisions whether it\u2019s M&A and\/or are simply share buyback. You see now is that we have been in the market in the second quarter we were in the market in the third quarter. I think that reflects the fact that we do have some optionality around the edge, it gets bigger as we go forward.","David Raso \u2013 ISI","Again, just trying to manage your expectations here. I\u2019m just running these numbers. It sounds like it\u2019s more of \u2013 we generate roughly $2 billion of free a $1 billion goes to dividends that extra billion now we\u2019re thinking being a little more aggressive with it then necessarily leveraging the company up so just unclear on that.","Rick Fearon","That is correct.","David Raso \u2013 ISI","That\u2019s all I just wanted to clarify. All right. Thank you very much.","Rick Fearon","Yes, certainly.","Operator","Our question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research.","Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research","Hi, good morning guys.","Rick Fearon","Good morning.","Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research","Rick, just go back on your comment, I understand you might be new on the 20% to 25% kind of base incremental as we think about the framework for next year before we came to discussions about restructuring or throughput synergies. It seems like with the easy comp that you have on the ESS side and I think you\u2019re signaling that you largely fixed the issues there. It seems like there might be another $40 million to $60 million of just easy comp there on margins, should we think of that as not being a component or being something outside of it or is that 20% to 25% really more like 20% because five points to that is just easy comp. Sorry, a lot of questions there, I think you see where I\u2019m getting at.","Rick Fearon","Again, I would say that we will be in a fair better position to tune this guidance as we get into early next year. But I think for this purpose, I will go back to the markets similar to this year, the outgrowth that was asked earlier, yes we do expect that to happen and I would just \u2013 20% to 25% plus there is two sources of additional profitability and we talked about being the additional cooper synergies and then the additional profitability that comes from the restructuring action we took this year in industrial. That\u2019s about us as far as we can go at this point until we have our operating plans put together.","Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay, that\u2019s fair. And I guess just to follow-up on that, now thinking about 2015, but with the assessing the quarter and the progress you made, could you rank order kind of the things that went your way between pricing, productivity, synergies, raw mats, just kind of the rank order of that then, how that necessarily shakes out, kind of one our 4Q, what\u2019s sustainable, what\u2019s little bit more one-off?","Sandy Cutler","Yes I think you recall there were three items that we had indicated that had led to the short fall in our targeted margins in the second quarter in our electrical systems and services segment. Those were freight and logistics there were some capacity resizing that we needed to do in the 3Q business, and there was bookings momentum, because we have had several quarters of weak momentum before that and price.","They were about equal, we\u2019ve said at that time, they are about a third, third, third in terms of how they contributed to the challenges that we have in the second quarter. And I\u2019m really pleased, we made progress on all of them. So, we essentially got our fixed programs initiatives in place faster than we thought with greater effective, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s any one of the three that is outsized versus the other.","And as I mentioned earlier, we think they are absolutely sustainable going into the fourth quarter here at this point.","Josh Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research","Got you, all right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mig Dobre with Robert Baird.","Mig Dobre \u2013 Robert Baird","Hey thanks for squeezing me in, sticking with ESS Sandy, I recall you saying that the bookings on the services side of the business were up something like 20%. Can you please confirm that and maybe talk a little bit about the drivers here, because I recall services sort of being core to the revenue synergy that you are talking about on a Cooper deal?","Sandy Cutler","The \u2013 you are right on both elections. So let me do with the Cooper deal first, one of the four sources of revenue synergies in the Cooper transaction was that we felt that particularly for the power systems that was the business that we\u2019re serving primarily utilities with, Cooper had not had an internal service organization. So, we\u2019ve been in the process of beginning to service those customers with the existing Eaton service group that we have obviously in large to handle more demand. And we\u2019re very pleased that momentum is becoming to pick up. I would emphasize again that was one of the sources of synergy, wasn\u2019t the biggest one on the sales synergy, but that\u2019s beginning to go quite well and you may recall that Tom Gross spoke to that little bit at the New York Meeting, this past February, early March.","And things haven\u2019t picked up as quickly than they have picked up now. So, thanks for bringing that point up. Secondly, on when we provided our guidance for the second half this year at the end of the second quarter, we had talked about that, one of the reasons we were pretty bullish on the opportunity to have a significant increase in second half over first half, electrical business was that in the last two years, we\u2019ve had some budget in our option happened on our Washington, which is tend to shut down federal spending.","It was our anticipation that would not happen this year, because of the mid-year election and then indeed it has not and as a result we\u2019re seeing more of this business like services, significant federal installations continuing through this fall. So, that\u2019s indeed laid out pretty much as we thought and we\u2019re seeing the bookings and the orders for doing that.","Mig Dobre \u2013 Robert Baird","That was great. And I guess my last question would be on aerospace, aftermarket starting to pick up a little bit is this a one-off or may be the start of a trend here?","Sandy Cutler","And thanks for the question, it is we think the start of a trend, but what we cautioned at the end of the second quarter, I would say now as well as that it took three years for the percentage of aftermarket as a percentage of the total business to decline 5 to 8 points. I think it will take a couple of years for to go up a couple of points. We did have a very nice quarter in terms of shipments of aftermarket accelerating. But I don\u2019t think that talks us right back for the kind of 17% margins that we experienced when the overall aftermarket was at higher level in within a year or so. I think this takes a couple of years to come back, but I think it is the start of a more positive trend in that regard.","Mig Dobre \u2013 Robert Baird","Wish you provide you with some tailwind hopefully into 2015.","Rick Fearon","Well I think probably, even bigger as you get into 2016, because it takes sometime for this, the kind of work that\u2019s way through.","Mig Dobre \u2013 Robert Baird","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks a lot, good morning everybody.","Rick Fearon","Good morning Andy.","Sandy Cutler","Good morning.","Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","A lot of question has been asked, so I wanted to bring it back up to 30,000 feet type thing for you Sandy and ask a fairly broad question about the U.S. economy. Your first look suggest growth is going to be better in that region than the rest of the world, but really not to expect, the signal is not to expect I think growth acceleration in 2015 despite some of the early cycle U.S. markets acting pretty well, but overall growth really not gaining momentum. So, I wanted really to get your view on why we are likely going to continue to be in relatively steady growth environment as it, is it a function of capital restrict, because of lingering lesson learned during 2009, do you think it\u2019s related to export market driven business uncertainty dragging on the overall growth or is there some other factor we should consider?","Sandy Cutler","I think you said on a number them, and clearly one was roughly a quarter the economy tied to export the, our biggest trading partners are doing particularly well right now. And so I would say that, that is one element. I think the second element is that, obviously the countries has not yet come to grids with its deficit, well we\u2019re laying it on in terms of the debt at a lower rate than we were, we\u2019re still running a significant deficit. And that tends to anchor economic growth to a certain degree, so that each time we start to run all faster we start to running those budget issues if you will.","A number of the markets that had done quite well over the last couple of years and certainly a number of the retail oriented places, it\u2019s hard to see them grow quite as quickly as they had. And so, I think that\u2019s part of the reason when you put it all together and we\u2019ve not done the final tune up on this. We think it\u2019s more likely it grows at the current level or slightly better here in the U.S. that we\u2019re not back at kind of 4% to 5% growth in the U.S, where we\u2019re more of a 3% number.","Each of the last four years the fed is had to revise down their growth rate and we\u2019re aware that there is, there is sort of, as I mentioned this anchor on the economy. Hopefully we\u2019re wrong with that Andy and we can scramble up, but that\u2019s our best thinking at this point.","Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, thanks. And then just really two quick questions, within ESS, you mentioned pricing improved sequentially from Q2 does that imply the price pressure that you saw in Q2 is gone or is it just lesser factor?","Rick Fearon","I would say, the pricing and the bookings backlog were coupled in my comment, you may recall that the second half of 2013 and the first quarter of 2013 were very weak quarters of booking for us and that the booking, the quarter before as a big influence on the next quarter in this business, because it is a backlog business. So the fact that we had weak loads which meant, that we didn\u2019t have as much utilization in our factories coupled with competitive pricing that really led into that second quarter challenges we had.","We now had a couple of very good quarters of booking, I think the pricing tone feels a little better than it did in last winter and early part of the spring time, so the two together are what we are hoping to have really happened and we got that put in place.","Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay thanks. And then lastly on Europe outside of farm equipment and auto, can you discuss any view about incoming orders related to European industrial demand, is it flat, down or up?","Rick Fearon","Little different by country, and I would say that the disappointment I think in this early fall into late fall has been Germany where early in the year things look a little better and they clearly flattened France there has never been start on this regard. Some people are speaking about Italy being a little stronger, we\u2019ve not seen too much of that not much of a change in order in the UK at this point.","Andy Casey \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow","Good morning, thanks for letting me in. One quick clarification there were drop in corporate expense we saw in the third quarter, is that a new ongoing rate or one-time?","Rick Fearon","So I think for this year, we\u2019re assuming, because we didn\u2019t show an increase in that fourth quarter that it\u2019s the rate for the remainder of the year.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow","Okay, and your outlook you said it would be plus minus you put electrical basically in not much difference. The U.S. market people had to product you up 8% we feel a lot of strengthening in North America and then in the U.S. in particularly in electrical products going forward in the non-res spending component, your reason that nothing much changes and that\u2019s where to be a lot weaker or is there a chance that we can get a lot better results in electrical next year, than you sort of indicating?","Sandy Cutler","Well, I think it\u2019s really going to depend upon as we tune up our economy view what these other regions of the world look like, because Europe obviously is weaker and that\u2019s not contributing the growth at this point. But, we do expect, we continue to get the strong out growth as we\u2019ve indicated and but, I think that base kind of you for the U.S. is kind of a 3% growth rate.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow","And hydraulics with the big drop in ag is going on, we continue to see the pressure out to next year. Is it 12% operating margin sort of stabilization point we\u2019re looking for in hydraulics as we go forward, this point you indicated fourth quarter be little better, so it seems to be at that point that we can manage with ag that weak?","Rick Fearon","Yes. In ag and those of you who follow their business for sometime, it should be hydraulics know that profits are always stronger in the first half or in the second half it\u2019s a bit of a seasonal in that business for us. And this year, we\u2019re saying we think profits coming around 13% this year. And we think that likely that we can get to margins that are kind of in that range next year or little bit stronger, but it\u2019s, we\u2019ll have a better feel for once we complete our profit planning work.","Eli Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Then our last question today comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks for squeezing me in guys. And I only have one question. I may have missed this earlier Sandy, but have you talked a little bit about your October trends and kind of the cadence as you went through Q2, Q3 and into this quarter? And then I know that you\u2019ve said that truck seems like pretty good news today, I\u2019d be just curious to hear it across your different businesses.","Sandy Cutler","We don\u2019t have October numbers yet and Joe, so it\u2019s more of what I would call anecdotal discussions under these facts, but and that\u2019s how I would treat the truck information as well too. There is a lot of buzz out in the marketplace that October is going to be a very strong month of order bookings. Generally, what we\u2019re hearing in our electrical businesses is a very much continuation of the strength we saw in September as well, not much has changed on the side of the ag side as it\u2019s still pretty much working through this, there are lower anticipated shipments next year which means lower production for us right now. So and aerospace tends to be, recall a longer cycle business so not much change there.","So, I would say we feel pretty about the overall feel as to where we are in our electrical business. We work our way through hydraulics which again remember that\u2019s about 12% or 13% of the company. And the vehicle sides whether you\u2019re about the truck or retail sales of cars and I think people respond to the lower gas prices there really quite good so, strongest again in the U.S., weaker outside the U.S.","Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. See you guys in a couple of weeks.","Sandy Cutler","Thank you very much for joining us today on our call. As always, we\u2019ll be available for follow up questions for the remainder of the week. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our teleconference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference service.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead.","Donald H. Bullock","Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Welcome to Eaton's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me this morning are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and CFO. As has been our practice, we'll begin today's call with comments from Sandy, followed by a question-and-answer session.","The information provided on our conference call today will include forward-looking statements concerning the first quarter 2012, full year 2012 net income per share and operating earnings per share; full year 2012 revenues; our worldwide markets; our growth in relation to end markets; and our growth from acquisitions. Those statements should be used with caution and are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the company's control.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are set forth in today's press release and related Form 8-K filing.","As a reminder, we've included a presentation on the fourth quarter results, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations page. We've placed our earnings presentation and released the materials out early this morning, earlier than normal, since many of you have a number of calls today. We want to be mindful of that, and we will conduct the call concluding at 11 p.m. Additional information is available today in today's press release, which is located on Eaton's homepage, www.eaton.com.","At this point, I'll turn it over to Sandy.","Alexander M. Cutler","Great. Thanks, Don, and welcome, everybody. Thanks for joining us. I'm going to work from the document that Don mentioned, and I'm on Page 3 to start, labeled Highlights of Fourth Quarter Results. And we had a very strong quarter filled with a number of records, although we did fall just short of the midpoint of our guidance.","Just to highlight a couple of the points that are on the chart that you see, our sales were up some 10%. Our operating profits, $1.08, per share. We're up 27% from last year. Net income per share, $1.07, was up 30% from last year. So I'm really delighted with that performance.","Emerging markets were about 26% of our sales. And as you saw in our press release, they were about 27% for the full year. That really reflects -- a theme we'll talk about a little later when we talk about end markets that we saw, emerging markets continued to weaken through the fourth quarter.","You put all that together, and we had a record year in 2011, our 100th year. It was our first time we had revenues over $16 billion. Our sales were actually up 17% from 2010. Our earnings per share were up 44% from 2010 and 19% above our all-time previous record, which was in 2007. And importantly, our segment operating margins at 14.2% were up 1.5 points, and obviously great progress toward that goal we've discussed with you of 16%.","All of this sets the foundation for, we believe, another record year in 2012. And that gave us the confidence to increase our dividend by 12%. You saw as part of our press release this morning, from $0.34 per share to $0.38 per share.","Moving to Chart 4. This is a reconciliation to the midpoint of our guidance for the fourth quarter. You'll recall that, that midpoint guidance was $1.11, which was a 31% increase over last year. We actually ended up achieving $1.08 at the bottom of the chart, which was 27%.","We did encounter lower market growth than we had anticipated in the fourth quarter. It's approximately $200 million of volume. We outlined in the press release, so I won't spend time on it right now. Where it occurred was primarily in our Electrical business.","We had higher corporate expenses in the quarter. We indicated that they came in about $0.05 higher than we thought. If you recall the quarterly progression of our corporate expenses were about $45 million in the first quarter, $54 million in the second quarter, $56 million in the third quarter, and we had provided full year guidance that we thought we'd be close to about $260 million when we started the year.","We had anticipated it would be on the order of about $80 million from the fourth quarter. As you saw, it came in at $102 million. And really, that's primarily the result of the fact that as shipments were a little lower than we anticipated, our inventories ended up being a little higher. And that incremental $20-plus million dollars of expense was primarily driven by the higher LIFO expense, as I mentioned with our inventories remaining a little higher than we had estimated.","The lack of the commodity hedge recovery that we note on this chart, you'll recall in the third quarter, we had taken mark-to-market adjustments for our commodity hedges of approximately $22 million. And that had been about $0.06. And if you recall in that reconciliation, we said we would not repeat -- or we did not expect that we would have another mark-to-market in the fourth quarter. We did not. But we had expected that we might get about $0.02 of recovery. And with commodity prices not really changing fundamentally from where they were at the end of the third quarter, we did not realize that additional income. So that was about a negative $0.02.","We had a lower tax rate, about 7.2% versus the 19% we'd used in our guidance for the quarter. That accounts for a positive $0.14. And then a very good news that I mentioned on the first page about our operating segments, margins came in at record levels, 15.1% all-time record for a quarter for us. Really great balance performance. And that contributed about a plus 7. So all in all, $1.08, up 27% versus a year ago. A very solid quarter.","If we move to Page 5, this is simply the financial summary at the corporate level. I think most of this is pretty self-explanatory, so I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this chart except to note that the sales were, as is normally true in the fourth quarter, off just slightly from where they are in the third quarter.","As we move to the individual segments, perhaps a little bit more color is helpful here. If we move to Chart 6, which is labeled Electrical Americas Segment, a really terrific quarter performance here in our Electrical Americas business. That sales level is actually a record for the quarter, quite pleased about it.","And as we noted in our press release, we'd hoped it might be even a little bit better because our bookings have been very, very strong, up again 11%. This has been a great year of bookings, and that's why that backlog continues to be so strong. We did experience some lower sales than we had hoped we might have in the quarter, really due to push-outs from a number of customers that -- right at the end of the month, frankly, were just hoping to delay shipment of some fairly large projects. I expect we'll recover that in the next weeks and months. So we don't really see this as any fundamental issue. It's much more of a timing issue, and that large backlog is really what gives us that confidence.","Underlying all of this is the continued rebound now in the non-residential markets. And you'll recall that we had made the call that we would see this turn by the middle of 2011. We saw it turn actually in the second quarter 2011. The fourth quarter posted some pretty attractive numbers, and we think we will see continued recovery into 2012.","Residential construction is starting to show a heartbeat. Numbers are still kind of low, but at least they're positive. And then we were very pleased to complete the acquisition of the switchgear manufacturer, Pedersen, which puts us with increased content into the utility marketplace, which is really an important marketplace for the utilization of much of our medium voltage switchgears.","So a really great quarter. Back to over 15% margins, 15.5% margins. So this business is performing really well.","If we move to Chart 7, Electrical Rest of World segment. We noted in our press release that we saw continued weakness in China, and that really has to do with the credit tightening that has affected really all portions of the marketplace. We'll talk about it again a little bit in the hydraulics marketplace as well. But we saw tightening affect both power quality and power distribution projects in China.","And then as you can well appreciate, Europe has been on a slow weakening pace really through the back half of the year, and that continued in the fourth quarter. So as you can see, numbers down about 7% from the third quarter in the fourth quarter, if you look at our third quarter shipments of $755 million compared to the $699 million that occurred in the fourth quarter.","Bookings, also down. And as we talk a little bit about guidance for 2012, you'll see that we're anticipating, not only in this segment but in other segments that have business participation in Europe and Asia, that the beginning of the year, we'll start slower. And then we think that recovery, if and when it really starts to manifest itself, is more likely to happen later in the year.","If we turn to Chart 8, the Hydraulics segment, another outstanding quarter. Sales, up 23%; margins, 15%; overall bookings, up 5%. Again, really reflecting our strength in the mobile segment. And as we've shared with you, we continue to see the mobile side of this marketplace leading in strength.","Our bookings were up far more than the 5% in the Americas. The weakness really continues over in Asia-Pacific at this point. And then Europe has really flattened out at this time.","We do expect the China mobile hydraulics marketplace, which is an important one for us, to expect to begin to recover in the second half. But we're not forecasting that in the first or the second quarter of this year.","If we move to Chart 9, the Aerospace segment. We had told you that we would see margins rebound significantly during the second half. You saw in the third quarter, they were at 16.9%, 18.1% now in the fourth quarter. Really pleased with the performance here.","The market outlook is really the tale of 2 cities that you all well appreciate, with commercial markets very strong and defense markets softening quickly. And you'll hear that again as we talk about our guidance for 2012.","Our aftermarket bookings, same sort of profile, much stronger on the commercial side than on the defense side, but we're very pleased obviously with performance and the margin performance in this segment during the quarter.","Turning to the Truck segment. It came in pretty much as we expected, with the exception of South America. And many of you had questions about what could the pre-buy look like in South America. Actually, a little weaker than we had thought, and we think that some of that carryover of the inventory that piled up in South America will affect the early part of 2012 as well. Nonetheless, a really great quarter. Sales, up 31%. 20.1% operating margins.","We saw the fourth quarter in NAFTA come in, pretty much in line with our expectation. We're leaving the year at sort of the 75,000-unit production level, which obviously, if you annualize it, you're going to come right to what our view is of what the market will be in 2012.","Moving to Chart 11, the Automotive segment. A very strong quarter again. You'll notice on the acquisition line, that's in the green box on the lower left-hand corner of this slide, there's a negative number, and that is indeed the divestiture of a small, small business we divested this year. It was involved in blow molding. It was something we didn't feel was a good place to keep our investment. We'll redeploy those dollars elsewhere. That's the negative, if you will. It also affected, obviously, the shipment volumes this quarter.","But a solid quarter. The margins a little lower than what we described in the third quarter, the 14% margin. You recall in the third quarter, we described as having the moon and the stars and the sun all aligned, everything went perfectly well. We're very pleased with this 10.6%. It does reflect a slightly lower margin because we are bringing up additional capacity in China right now for a very good reason, that we've had a number of very exciting new program wins in China. We've got to increase our capacity there.","If we move to Slide 12, now kind of transferring over to our guidance for 2012. I think the overall context I would set these specific numbers is that we're expecting a year of slow global growth, on the order of 2% GDP. If you'd ask us how we're feeling now versus how we felt 3 months ago, we would tell you the U.S. looks a little better than we thought it was going to look, that Europe looks a little weaker than perhaps we thought it would be, and that developing nations are a little weaker at this point than we had thought they might be 3 months ago.","And so as you think about how the year might layout, we think it's starts a little slower, and it recovers toward the end of the year. And that is really the impact of how long it takes for Europe to start to cure itself, as well as the time for some of the easing policies in the emerging nations to get traction and orders to be created in our marketplaces.","So that is the background -- if you simply look at our overall weighted average growth for our end markets. We think it will grow at about 5%. About 6% in the U.S., about 4% outside of the U.S. And as I just step through these quickly, in the Americas business, Electrical Americas, we think the non-residential market be up about 5%. Residential will be stronger than that, but it's not that big an item. And the Power Quality will be slightly less than that. And overall, that averages about 5%.","In Rest of World, if you look at -- for Electrical, we think Europe will be negative 1 to 0, and Asia-Pacific about 3. And that's how we come to the 1% forecast. In Hydraulics, continued strength is in the U.S. A big strong year again, this next year is 6%. And as we look outside the U.S., we think Europe is probably flat. Asia-Pacific, about 3%.","Aerospace, again a big year in terms of commercial in the U.S. We think up on the order of 15%, with defense down on the order of 6% to 7%. And our number outside the U.S. is primarily a commercial number.","In the Truck market, a 16% increase here in the U.S. And that's really anchored by our forecast of 300,000 production for heavy-duty truck. Outside of the U.S., it's really a mixed picture with Asia-Pacific being up about 6%. We think Brazil will be down about 5%, and we think Europe's up about 8%. And of course, that's a little smaller factor for us in Europe.","Automotive, a strong year in the U.S. This is anchored by expectations of just over 14 million retail sales in the U.S. in terms of our forecast. In terms of North America -- excuse me, non-U.S. growth, we think Europe is basically flat, and Asia-Pacific up about 11%. That's the background that I hope will give you some context for our thinking about the likely economic scenario.","If you move to Chart 13, this is labeled Margin Expectation. The very good news here is after a record year in 2011, as I mentioned earlier, the 14.2% segment margins, 2012 we believe will be another year of further margin expansion on our way to the 16% goal that we articulated last year in February at our New York Analyst Meeting.","You'll see here that we're expecting margin expansion in virtually every one of our segments here, although Automotive stays the same. And you put that together and it's somewhere between 14.5% and 15%. We think handsome margins, particularly in this period of some economic volatility.","If we move to Chart 14, it gives you just a quick look at our EPS guidance. Let me just address the column operating earnings here for a moment, the $4.15 to $4.55 guidance with a midpoint of $4.33. So we're talking of 5% to 15% low end of the range to the high end of the range in terms of year-over-year improvement, with the midpoint being approximately a 10% increase.","Now to give that a little bit more of a dimension, if you'll turn to Chart 15, we'll give you a quick look at the bridge between 2011 and 2012. Overall, this is revenue up 4%. Operating EPS midpoint would be up 10%. As I mentioned earlier, when we talk about the markets, we expect our market improvement of about 5% at a 28% margin, because that margin's a little over this next year than it has been the last year. Consistent with what we've said is that as you go through the cycle, the incremental margin tends to get a little lower.","Market outgrowth of about $320 million. A decrease in the number of shares outstanding. You remember that we made some repurchases in the third quarter. So on a weighted average basis, you're going to have slightly lower shares next year.","Net acquisitions and divestitures. These are the net of the acquisitions we completed during 2011 minus the divestiture I mentioned of the one automotive business, about $0.02. Net other corporate expenses, and a portion of this is lower intangibles as we had some assets roll off, of about $0.02. So about $0.90 of pluses, offset by the higher tax rate.","You saw in our notes that it averaged 12.9% for the full year 2011. Our guidance is between 17% and 19%, so 18% is what we've used here.","ForEx, a very significant item for us, and one we suspect that not everyone has had the opportunity to really fully value at this point. We think it will deduct about 3.5% from sales this year, about $550 million. And that's a negative $0.14. Obviously, we've seen quite a change since the mid to early part of last year to where these valuations are now.","And then increased pension expense. We had told you at the end of the third quarter, we thought it would be on the order of $40 million, with the even lower discount rates at the end of the year. It's on the order of $45 million. So negative $0.51, and that's what gets you to the $4.35 reconciliation.","If I can ask you then to quickly turn to Page 16 labeled Q1 2011 to Q1 2012 Reconciliation. You will recall that first quarter is always our seasonally weakest quarter. In 2012, it will not be any different in that regard. And so if we look a year ago, we were $0.84 operating earnings per share. We expect we will have higher volumes in 2012 than we had in 2011 in the first quarter by $200 million to $300 million.","We'll have lower shares, slightly lower shares, the reason I mentioned before. That contributes about $0.02. We'll have a higher tax rate. That again is at 18% versus the average of last year of being -- or excuse me, the first quarter number being about 14.5%.","We'll have higher corporate expenses than we had last year when we were $45 million. And so this is anticipating about a $65 million corporate expense in the first quarter. We'll have higher pension expense. This is about $15 million of that $45 million I talked about occurs in the first quarter.  And then about $150 million of this $550 million impact that we think will occur in negative ForEx, and that throws off a negative $0.04. That's how we get to $0.85. So obviously higher volumes, better operating performance, higher tax, with ForEx offsetting it.","So if you move to the last chart in the packet, Chart 17, just a quick recap of some of the key elements for underpinning our 2012 guidance. I mentioned the market growth of 5%; the market outgrowth of 2%; the net acquisition revenue, which is about 0.5%, and the sales decrease from ForEx of $550 million is a negative 3.5. So that's how you get the 4%. 5 plus 2 plus 1\/2 minus 3.5, that's the 4% growth.","Incremental margin, I mentioned 27% -- 28%. Tax rate, 17% to 19%. I already talked about the operating and fully diluted EPS projections.","Let me just spend a moment on operating cash flow and free cash flow. We didn't put a box on this chart but obviously, the difference between the 2 is a $600 million plan for CapEx. And I think that completes the key elements of our guidance for this year. So with that, Don, we'd be delighted to address questions.","Donald H. Bullock","If you would please instruct the participants on the question process, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Donald H. Bullock","Our first question is from Andy Kaplowitz from Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sandy, you talked about Electrical Rest of the World, but your orders were down 10% in 4Q and maybe down a couple of quarters in a row, and your guide to 1% growth in 2012. So I guess I'm just wondering, what's your conviction that you'd be able to get there given your weak solar inverter market? Maybe if you could just give us more color on how we're going to get to that up 1%?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. And again, I think it's a very good question because I think maybe one of the hardest calls from an economic perspective right now is how long does the European weakness go on? And then how long does it take for the response for the easing that we're seeing in China, seeing in Brazil and people are talking about in India. How long will that take to actually have an impact? And generally, what we've seen in our markets is these are sort of 6- to 9-month lags between when you see easing and when it materializes. That's what we've tried to use in this respect. So these forecasts for stabilization of these markets. We think that we've been seeing a weak third quarter. We saw a weaker fourth quarter. We don't think Europe gets any better till you get into the second half of next year. And that's our view also on a number of these emerging nations. So that is the underpinning at this point. What we're pleased about is that from a bookings point of view in Asia in the Electrical business, we actually saw it improve in the last month of the quarter versus the earlier month of the quarters. I would note, however, that's one month, and I'd love to see it for 3 or 4 months to declare a trend. But those are the assumptions we're using at this point. We do think in China there will be an attempt to accelerate the economy. We feel fairly confident about that. It's just a question what that lead lag is going to be. What we're describing in Europe is a more mild recession, not a dramatic deep adjustment. And that indeed seems to be what's coming out of some of the data that's more recent in the last month. It's still down though.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, Sandy, that's helpful. So one thing I didn't really understand is you talked about Eaton production shutdowns in the U.S. and Europe in Auto. And so I'm just trying to figure out, usually, we have some holiday shutdowns I would assume. Was this more than usual and why? And then also, maybe is it possible to quantify the start-up cost with the Chinese capacity expansion in Auto?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, let me address the first part of that question. Initially here is that what we saw were really 2 different issues happen. In Europe, there were some part shortages from other vendors, not ourselves, that didn't allow people to complete their production schedules and affected some of our important products that are involved there. That will come back because the demand is there and they're backordered for us. So we don't think that's a permanent. Here in the U.S., you may be aware there were a couple of light truck plants that took some time off in mid-December. That turned out to be maybe the wrong direction because their inventories got stripped down even lower, and that's part of why you're seeing the production build up again here in the first quarter. So that's why we thought those were really timing issues -- non-Eaton specific. The demand is there for the product, and we think we'll be fine in that regard. On the issue of start-up costs, it's on the order of 0.5 to 1 point, is kind of what we were encountering. And we're comfortable that -- we're really pleased to have the opportunity to put in the capacity, and so we'll be ramping that up as we get through '12.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two quick questions. One, Sandy, could you just comment, when we look at the Hydraulics business and in light of what Parker reported last week, I mean, if we look at your bookings, they were up in the fourth quarter 5%. But it's finally hitting the single-digit range relative to where we've been. So I'm just trying to get a feel for what areas have weakened, what's still staying strong, and how did the orders look throughout the quarter? Did it get worse throughout the quarter and improve? My second question is just a follow-up on the Electrical Rest of World. Revenue again up a modest 1%, but you're suggesting margin should improve in 2012. So I'm just trying to get comfort around that or how I should think about, is it more of a second half improvement? If you could just provide color there.","Alexander M. Cutler","On the first question in terms of the Hydraulics bookings, globally, you're exactly right. We're up some 5%. What we saw is a multiple of that in the Americas, continuing to have extremely strong bookings here, really delighted. And that hasn't backed off much. Where the weakness is, is Asia-Pacific. It's the same issue that we described in our Electrical business is that with the China construction market down, we've seen many of those firms -- we started talking about this really at the end of the second quarter, that we've seen a pretty full pullback. That has not gotten better at this point. And we again anticipate that we are not likely to see their demand come back till the second half. There's still a fair amount of inventory around, and some of you have traveled those regions and seen them all on the roads. Europe has gotten weaker but is still a positive in the quarter. But it's not quite the boomer that it was earlier this year. And so that's the sort of Hydraulics feel.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up on Europe, did it get worse each quarter, or was October the best? And can you just talk about in Europe how you saw things?","Alexander M. Cutler","No, it didn't substantially change month-to-month for us in the fourth quarter. It's been weaker, but it wasn't falling off. I know people's concern is this falling off the table. It actually was not. And that is also true in our Electrical business in Europe. It was relatively flat through the quarter. It didn't fall off. I think Asia has been the area where you've seeing a little higher beta, if you will, in terms of the degree of change.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then sorry, last, just a follow-up on the margins in Electrical Rest of World?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, the margins in Electrical Rest of World is -- we've obviously been -- while the volumes have been coming down, we've been working on adjusting our cost structure, and that is an element of us being able to obviously deliver better margins at a slightly lower volume. And so that's the benefit. In fact, we've been adjusting down for a period of time, and that's how we got a good level of confidence on this profitability projection.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question is from David Raso with ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Quick question. The way the guidance is playing out the first quarter relative to the full year, it's representing a little bit lower than normal, like the last 10 years or so, if you get rid of '09 which was an anomaly. The first quarter is usually, say, 23% of the full year. The guidance is saying first quarter is only 20%. So it's a little back half-loaded. What I'm trying to think through is let's say I want to take a more conservative tact on the EM's reaccelerating. Let's say the European weakness is a little bit beyond just a shallow couple of quarters of weakness. What are the offsets that you see that could make up for that? Because even just run the numbers on Electrical Rest of World and let's say instead of up 1% for revs, it's down 5 and your margins are flattish, not up. It trims about $0.10 to $0.15 from the guidance. What are the areas we could offset that? I mean, I see maybe Electrical Americas, the mix. So what kind of mix do you have? Is there some maybe top line upside to give some maybe comfort around that as an offset? Or the Truck business, you said domestic up 16. Now how would you bogey that? Is that something where, given the orders trends lately, maybe there's a little upside there. I'm just trying to see the buffer we'd have if you just...","Alexander M. Cutler","Sure, I understand the question. Yes. And all of these, I'd like to tell you are to a third decimal place of precision, but they're not quite that way in this kind of a volume. I'd say a couple of issues to think about though. Our view -- let me just start on ForEx. Our view on ForEx is that we've built in here $550 million, roughly 3.5%. That gets anchored by an expectation that we could see the euro in the $1.25 to $1.27 on average this year. Some people are more pessimistic on that. Some people are more optimistic. That's our view at this point. We've obviously seen a large adjustment in terms of the value of the Brazilian currency versus the early part of last year. That is where it is right now, and we think it's likely to stay in this range. Others have different views on that, and we're trying to be kind of explicit here about what our assumptions are. I'd say the third is one of the ones you just mentioned, and that's the issue of the North American heavy-duty truck build. We came out of the fourth quarter at 75,000 unit production. We're forecasting 300,000. You saw one of the single largest monthly freight increases just reported in the month of December that's in recent years history -- 5.9% if I recall. So I think some people are looking at it and saying wow, \"That trade issue is even stronger than we thought it might be.\" Then I'd say the fourth one is probably in and around the non-residential construction market, where I think the mood is changing now. And if you listen to many people who are forecasting the market, whereas the middle of last year they thought they'd never see another building built, now there seems to be a feeling where people are starting to move forecasts up toward high-single digits. That's not where our forecast is, but there are some people who believe there. So I'd say those are just a couple of examples. And I would state just one more, David, which is the Hydraulics business has sort of been defying gravity to some degree over the last 1.5 years. And as I've shared with a number of you, we were looking at this very hard in the first half of last year. Because typically, these cycles don't go as long as they have been, and we think there's been a fundamental shift in the global hydraulics market toward the mobile side being a little larger portion than the stationary side through the cycle, as a result of the fact that there's been great strength in emerging nations. And here in the U.S., you've been seeing a lot of this replacement demand that's been going on. The U.S. is still booming in this marketplace. And so those are some of the factors we're trying to weigh that I think perhaps help offset it if we're incorrect on a couple of the others.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. So you'd throw domestic hydraulic on top of my domestic truck?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And last thing you didn't address, my comment about Electrical Americas, the mix. When you think of non-resi up, I think you mentioned maybe EPS not as strong relatively, residential obviously not as big a piece, what's the mix of your backlog in Electrical America when I try to think through that 15.5% margin guidance?","Alexander M. Cutler","Generally, when we have backlog, David, if you think about our business, there's an assemblies business you tend to book and then it is shipped within a month or out to maybe 6 to 9 months. Then there's the flow business, which is pretty much in and out same day or same week. So our backlog are these project activities. And what's in the backlog is very much, what I would call, it's not a plus or a minus to the overall margin. So it's very representative. So that very big backlog we're carrying into the year is part of what gives us a lot of confidence in terms of our volume capability.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ingrid Aja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Ingrid Aja standing in for Ann. Can you talk a little bit about your outlook for Brazil truck demand versus Brazil agricultural equipment?","Alexander M. Cutler","Sure. One of the big speculations I think that we've all been -- we're trying to observe in the fourth quarter was the degree to which the pre-buy, which is occasioned by the emissions change after the first of the year of 2012, what kind of big pre-buy would there be? And there was a fair amount of inventory built in Brazil. The actual pre-buy turned out to not be as big as we and many others thought. And so you're carrying some inventory over, I'm talking at the OEM level, into the first quarter next year. As a result, our expectation for Brazilian truck and bus is that it'll be down about 5% from the 2011 number. And on the agricultural side, we think it'll be up about 5%.","Ingrid Aja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then can you talk about input cost, what's built into your guidance? Input costs obviously are not what they were last year. Aluminum is down, copper is down, steel is up. So on average, can you talk about what's you've built into your expectations?","Alexander M. Cutler","We believe the commodity cost -- and of course this is always a very challenging one to estimate, 12 months out ahead of you, but our thinking is they're likely to be more stable than they were in 2011. And of course that's a pretty low bar in terms of comparison with all the volatility we dealt with last year. But we've assumed that the cost will be about the same as they were in the average prices in the fourth quarter of 2011. So if you then kind of transfer that to our margin guidance where we're saying we're going to expand margins, that's primarily the result of all the productivity and cost work we've been doing, as well as the significant new product launches we have, which is always a source of potential margin improvement for us.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wonder, Sandy, if you could just give us a little more sort of comfort I guess on some of these projects that you were talking about being pushed out past the end of the year? I mean, we're kind of through January now. Are they happening now? Or what do you think your visibility is on those? And...","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, I've been around this business for over 30 years, Steve, and the classic issue that occurs in December of the year is that if you have a large project that's going to be shipped, normally what's required is that an inspector from the customer has to come to your plant and sign off after the full electrical test. And if they just don't get there the last week for one reason or another, it obviously slops over into the next month. And that's not the full reason that we didn't have some of these things shipped. Some people gave us a little bit more notice than that, but we had a number of projects that we had scheduled and we're working to produce in the fourth quarter. That's why our inventories went up a little bit, and people ask us to hold them for a period of time. This isn't hold them for 6 months, this isn't hold them for 3 months. So I'm pretty confident we see this during the first quarter kind of wash out.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then I wonder if, as we think about your margin guidance for 2012, if we can kind of go back and if you change your view about sort of what the margin potential for each of these businesses is, it seems like a couple of them are kind of getting pretty close to where we've talked historically about the upside of where they can go. And I guess I'm just curious if you have any comments in that regard.","Alexander M. Cutler","I think it's a theme, Steve, we'll revisit in our February meeting in New York. But you're right, because when we've talked about historically where we thought these were -- so we talked about Electrical Americas is having the potential to kind of get to that 17% range and Rest of World a 14%; Hydraulics, 16%; Aerospace, 17%; Truck, 20%; Automotive, 12%; that's what supported the 16% targets that we have. We are ahead of schedule as we noted earlier this year in terms of getting to that 2015 goal. I think that's very good news. On the other side though, I would be candid in saying that none of us anticipated a 4.7% discount rate used for U.S. qualified pension plans. And so you recall, our game plan was that we were going to get 4.5 points of EBIT improvement by 2015. 3 points were going to come from the segment margins, and we're well on our way there. And 1.5 was going to come out of our corporate expenses through 2 items, one was that as we continued to contribute money, and that's kind of been on the order of $300 million the last couple of years to our U.S.-qualified pension plan. And we saw hopefully the recovery of these discount rates to something that makes a little bit more sense to all of us with a calculator, that we would then see our plan no longer be underfunded and then obviously reduces expense for us. That's looking like that's pushed out probably a year, I would guess. And anybody's guess is probably the right guess on the discount rate at this point. So a little bit of trade-off between the 2. But you're exactly right, the good news is we're getting there faster on the margin improvement.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess what I'm thinking about, and maybe I'm just jumping the gun here, but Truck is almost there and yet you have some volume built-in, some significant volume built-in going forward. And Hydraulics seem to be relatively strong based on your comments here today, and yet we've already kind of achieved the goal there. Is there an opportunity that even though some of this corporate stuff might be a little headwind, that there's actually some ceiling room on some of these other numbers?","Alexander M. Cutler","Well, I think you may be right. What we're going to try to do is just get obviously a month under our belt here and have the advantage of being able to chat a little bit more about those with you in the February meeting. Clearly, I think there is a mix issue that is one that's worth just chatting about here for a moment that's beneficial, is that we've been increasing our Filtration business obviously, and that is part of our Hydraulics segment. We're delighted with the 2 acquisitions we made in that business that have significantly enlarged our business there. And that's really allowing us to continue to help move those margins up in addition to all the operating improvements we've had in that business as well. So we're very pleased with our margin. I think you're on the right track.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Sandy, I was wondering if you could also address capital deployment, maybe to David Raso's question about possible offsets. Kind of what the plan is for 2012 between M&A and share repurchase, if there's a placeholder on share repurchase? And if you can also tell us how you ended the year in '11 on cash?","Alexander M. Cutler","Okay. Maybe a couple of broad comments, and then I'll ask Rick to add to them. Looking at our balance sheet, you probably noticed we ended the year with a fair sum of marketable securities and cash. And I think a reasonable question is exactly the one you're asking, what are you planning to do with it. We contributed about $304 million to the U.S.-qualified pension plan early in January. That was pretty much per our plan that we'd communicated last year that we would be on that order. You saw that we just increased your dividend by 12% from $0.34 to $0.38, effective in February of this year. And so that will be a full year increase of that. And that's on the order of roughly $50 million increase there. We talked about a $600 million CapEx plan. And as we talked at the end of the second and third quarter, we've raised our activity in the acquisition investigation market again. You saw us, we closed 9 deals during 2011, albeit that they were relatively small. And we are hopeful that we will have some good opportunities to deploy some of that cash into additional value-creating activities for the company. And so we're returning to, what I would call, a more normal level of acquisition levels for our company. I do want to assure you though that the fact that we think end market -- excuse me, that our total growth this year of revenues will be on the order of 4%, because it's being decreased or depressed by the 3.5% negative ForEx, is not a reason that Eaton then goes out and does a bunch of acquisitions. We are looking at the acquisition strategy the same way we have in terms of the areas we want to do it and the type of return over our cost of capital that we intend to make. We're pleased that we were making very good progress on whatever version of this statistic you would like, our net debt-to-capital ratio. However, if you look at our balance sheet, you obviously see that by the pension, using a discount rate of only 4.7% versus about 5.5% last year, that our pension liability has gone up about $600 million on the balance sheet. So we're aware of that as well. And, Rick, you want to add any other comments to that?","Richard H. Fearon","I would just add, Jeff, that we're right in the middle of our capital ratios because of that increase in debt, or at least the pension liability going up. We have not billed repurchases into the plan other than small amounts to offset option exercises. But to the extent that we don't end up doing as much in the acquisition arena, it's certainly something we will revisit. We've said that we do not intend to remain over capitalized for any sustained period of time. But it happens right now, we do have a lot of activities underway in the acquisition arena. It's just hard to know what gets done ultimately.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Right. And, Sandy, can you just give us a little more granularity on what you're seeing in U.S. non-resi? And is it moving into kind of commercial non-resi? Or is it still industrially focused? And yes, I mean, just any change in tone there over the last 3 or 4 months?","Alexander M. Cutler","I think the very good news is in the fourth quarter, if you've had a chance to look at some of the private non-resi put in place statistics, you saw a number of statistics that the other commercial segment went positive. You're seeing office was down to a very low single-digit negative, which is one of the ones people have been concerned about. We are seeing new office and new apartment activity. You've been seeing leases that have obviously been going up in many of the major urban areas. For this whole time, we've seen mining. We've seen the power side. We've seen areas in and around manufacturing structures being very strong. And interestingly, the last 2 quarters: amusement and recreation sectors have gone positive as well. So you're starting to see a much more broad-based kind of deployment happening in this area, and we're seeing that in our orders as well. And again, we're doing quite well in the fourth quarter again that allow these large projects.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sandy, wondering if you could maybe give us a view on what's going in the Power Quality business, both kind of how 2011 ended up? And then in your assumptions within the Electrical segments for next year, how you're seeing growth there?","Alexander M. Cutler","Our view, Terry, is that in this -- often what happens when you're in a period of a little bit more uncertainty about economic growth rates, we've seen the power quality market go into weaker years. So our assumption is that we will see it -- here only speak to the U.S. first, grow more on the order of 4%. So it's a little bit below the average of our Electrical businesses this year. Through the cycle, we think that business is sort of a 6% to 7% grower. So a little different if you go to the different elements of it, and if I could split it into 3 pieces. And all of this, remember, is really dealing with what we call power quality. I'm not addressing the telecommunications market, I'm not addressing embedded computing when I make these comments. So if you go to the low end of the market, the single-phase market, we've all been seeing server sales being fairly weak. And that parallels what happens in terms of the single phase. The mid-flow, which is the flow or midsize, which is more of what would go into the smaller data centers, quite busy. And that has continued to be a strong area. The very large data centers has been slower, and we've commented on that a couple of times, and we think it will be slower this year for a variety of kind of technical considerations where people are trying to figure out where they stand and whether they want to do things in-house or whether they want to move things toward the cloud. We don't think this is a fundamental change. We think this is more a reflection of the, \"Can I push something off right now.\" You may recall a statistic that we quoted when we had everyone together at our data centers, that 38% of all the data centers in the U.S. are going to run out of power here within 18 months. And so you can't put this off too long. And so we think it will come back, but we've built in a little slower growth this year.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a couple of follow-ups on the margins. First on the Electrical Americas margin guidance implies incremental, substantially better than 2011. Is that just you're expecting price cost to be more benign for you? Or what else would be driving your view for better incrementals there?","Alexander M. Cutler","The incrementals. You may recall that in the first quarter of 2011, we had about $50 million of uncovered commodity cost. Really our pricing versus commodities was really in line by the time we got to the third and fourth quarters. So we think the results look more like the third and fourth quarter than they did the first and second. So you're exactly on point of that.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I mean incrementals in the fourth quarter were much below the range as well, right? So what kind of flipped the switch here?","Alexander M. Cutler","Well, part of what affected the fourth quarter -- and you are correct. Part of what affected the fourth quarter were some orders in the backlog that were taken back to the time when the pricing and commodities were not in alignment. We're washing most of that out at this point.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the Electrical Rest of World margins for next year. Sandy, I just wonder if you can clarify how much cost you've taken out there? And presumably, the FX impact on the revenue line is much greater than those 3.5 points for the company overall. Are you -- or should we expect total revenues off of this 1% end market growth outlook -- should we expect all in Eaton Rest of World Electrical revenues to be down as a result of currency? Or do you think you got enough outgrowth to offset that?","Alexander M. Cutler","We'll have to look that one up. Give us a moment. It's a good question.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If you want to then just talk about the amount of cost out that you have right now, calibrate it for us?","Alexander M. Cutler","We're not going to put a specific number on the cost, Terry, for competitive reasons. But that is an area we control, and we're quite comfortable that the cost work we've done during these last 3 quarters puts us in a position where we can get the margin expansion. And of course, this is both our EMEA and our Asia-Pacific regions when we do this. So I think sometimes, there's kind of over concentration on the Asia-Pacific region in that regard. But we're comfortable the cost price situation is in good shape, because again, cost price was affected also in the first and second quarter by the same issues we just talked about in North America.","Richard H. Fearon","And Terry, I would just add to your earlier question, our current thinking is that when you factor in FX and growth and outgrowth, that you'll end up with a bit of revenue growth in that sector -- in that segment in 2012.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you just talk about any restructuring that you're contemplating or you're taking? Is that impacting any of the slower first half earnings? And maybe just talk about the benefits on the back end.","Alexander M. Cutler","Jeff, we don't break anything out because we think it's part of running the business, if you will. And so there typically are actions that we'll get going early in the year, because we want to be able to realize some of the benefits towards the back end, but I'd say there's nothing material here really to break out.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just real quick on the corporate. I mean, it doesn't look like a huge jump versus last year, but you had a big tax settlement. So I'm just trying to understand a little bit better what the moving pieces were in the corporate line, maybe year-over-year? You explained some of the LIFO dynamic.","Alexander M. Cutler","Maybe if I heard, you had 2 questions. One question was on taxes, one was on corporate expense? Is that right?","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","No, just on the corporate expense, I mean...","Alexander M. Cutler","Okay. Again, in terms of -- as you mentioned, we ran below -- when we started the year, we said we thought it would be about 260. It ended up being 257. And really what we've got is sort of a misbalance between quarters, if you will, and that we started off with 45 then went to 54 then to 56 then to 102. We actually thought the fourth quarter would be in the range of about 80, and that was the result of truing up -- what we expected would be the result of truing up a number year end reserves and what we had originally anticipated in terms of LIFO expense. On top of that, as I mentioned then, when our sales came in a little lower, our shipments came in a little lower than we thought, we had higher inventories. And as a result of that then we had an additional $22 million of expense beyond what we had anticipated, primarily caused by the LIFO adjustment. So those are really the kind of comparisons. I think as you think about 2012, we again think corporate expense will be about $260 million. And we think we will start the first quarter closer to about $65 million. So our best view at this point is we're going to see these quarters be a little flatter as we go through the year end corporate expense than they were here in 2011.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question is from Andy Casey.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First, just a clarification, and I've got a question again on Electrical Rest of World, and I apologize for the second one. The first, on the capital allocation, when you say you're looking at increasing acquisition activity, is it more like what you experienced in 2011 bolt-ons or their properties that are coming available for larger inorganic growth opportunities?","Alexander M. Cutler","I think, Andy, you know our history in this regard is most of what we end up doing are singles and doubles. And I think that's always the best bet, is that that's sort of -- we'll play baseball, if you will. The opportunities for the triples and home runs are fewer. We do a lot fewer of them, and they're just not as likely. So I think you can anticipate we're going to stay more in that singles and doubles, and hopefully we won't have to slide.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And that's somewhat implied by your dividend increase as well. Then on Electrical Rest of World, and I may have missed this, I apologize, how truncated is your view to back half growth versus first, given the regional comments about China and then some of the easing comparisons for, albeit a small revenue contributor, the solar markets as the year progresses?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. I think that from a -- as I tried to mention upfront, Andy, and it's a good question, is we think the hardest economic calls right now are trying to approximate when these easing actions that are being taken by very different governments by governments, when they will be finalized, when they'll reach the market and how quickly they'll start to loosen the market. And so we've tried to use this sort of 6- to 9-month guideline as a way to think about that. That's generally been helpful in the past. We can't certify to you that that's exactly going to be right, but that's been our planning scenario. So we're seeing those actions being taken -- they were being taken in the fourth quarter, they're being taken now in the first quarter, and that's why we believe we will start to see effect in the second quarter. But we can't tell you right now. That's for sure. I mean, that's our economic scenario we're trying to plan against at this point. Equally true for Europe as well is that I think last fall, many people felt the recession in Europe might be a fourth quarter, first quarter -- fourth quarter 2011, first quarter 2012 phenomena. I think most people are thinking now it's fourth, first and second. And you can debate whether it includes a third quarter. And our view is that this thing will start to stabilize, and we'll start to see things not grow quickly, but stabilize by the second quarter -- second half, excuse me.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so not much out of Europe supporting it. It would be more other regions. Is that the correct...","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. And generally, our order patterns, they don't go out that far in these businesses. So we're having to plan against an economic scenario versus saying that we've got hard orders in hand. We do not in that regard, and nor will we expect to at this time.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from MKM Partners.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Sandy, just maybe to help understand, going back to an earlier question on kind of the commercial side versus your more traditional non-res electrical markets in North America, what are you really baking in on more commercial construction markets in the guidance? And I guess, maybe thinking about non-res since that has been up nicely for you in 2011, how much more room do we have to run on that? And I guess, given the relative importance of retrofit versus maybe new construction, is that a market that is more mature in its cycle than it is on the front end as people get more excited about non-res momentum in '12?","Alexander M. Cutler","We think there's quite a ways to go here, Josh. So you think about it, we're in probably the 2.5 year of recovery here in North America. I'm talking broad geographic recovery across all the different market segments, not just this area. And we're just beginning to see commercial construction coming back. So you've got almost a 4-year down before you're starting to get up. And normally, we think these up cycles go several years. So we think '12 is the first of several years of build, if you will, on the commercial side. And when you look through -- and someone asked the question earlier, when you look through all those different segments of office, healthcare, power, communication, petroleum, mining, education, vocational, amusement, recreation, they're not all in at this point growing, and they will begin to as we come back. So we have a 5% overall non-residential construction increase in our number at this point. Could be low, could be high, but we think this thing is going to grow during '12. And we think it'll grow again, and as we get into '13. And the reason that that's important for Eaton is it does drive a very significant portion of our Electrical Americas segment. And I know you've all noticed this, but even when this market was coming down, we were growing. So we've been growing our share, and we think that just sets up an even bigger opportunity as the market now starts to grow. We think our growth can accelerate further.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the shipment delays in the fourth quarter, does that set up some sort of destock that's implied in first quarter guidance? Or is that kind of a smaller non-event?","Alexander M. Cutler","No, it's not a destock because these delays are -- we have standard product, which goes into distributors that stock. These project businesses don't go into stock. They tend to be shipped to a job site per se. So not a distributor or stocking or destocking comment.","Donald H. Bullock","And our last question for the day comes from Eli Lustgarten.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Just a couple of clarifications quickly. One, what's your order forecast in the U.S. and Europe for '12?","Alexander M. Cutler","In the U.S., we're talking about -- it's based on retail sales that are just over 14 million units. And we know we're seeing forecasts out there between 13.9 million and 14.5 million, and we're sort of in the low 14 million.","Richard H. Fearon","In Europe, we're really plus 1. Relatively flat. Whereas in APAC, Eli, we're about 10% positive. 10%, 11% positive.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And you made [ph] acquisitions about $320 million I think. How much revenue carry over is there in '12 versus '11?","Alexander M. Cutler","The net number is the $90 million, and that deletes the -- excuse me, the divestiture that we made in the Automotive segment. A net of 90.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And you talked about inventories. Are you planning inventory liquidations in any of the divisions as you go through the year and how that will affect margins?","Richard H. Fearon","We are expecting, Eli, that we should be able to take DOH down 1 to 2 days this coming year, particularly given where we ended up the year. And so we expect inventory efficiency to improve. But of course, the business is going to grow as well. And so those 2 factors will cause probably just a very small increase in the absolute amount of inventory.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","So there is a bit of margin impact going on from the restraint of production and that's across most divisions at this point?","Richard H. Fearon","Can you repeat that? I'm not sure I heard you.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Well, inventories are going to be taken down, of course. You had some margin impact. The question is...","Richard H. Fearon","Not material. A day or two isn't enough to really cause substantial burden changes one way or the other.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Well, it's pretty well spread out across the company as opposed to any one division at this point.","Richard H. Fearon","Correct. Yes, correct.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And your truck number, you said it had -- 16%, about 295. Are you using 300 this year domestically?","Richard H. Fearon","We're using 300, yes, for NAFTA. Yes.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","You're expecting that you'll be able to sustain production pretty closely for the rest of the year at this point?","Richard H. Fearon","Yes. Basically, almost flatlines for the 75 per quarter. So it's really, at this date, more a question of demand than production. The industry is already producing at a run rate of 300,000. And recent orders have been supportive of this 300,000 outlook.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And are you having -- still having extended lead time problems in some of the divisions? Particularly, Hydraulics is one we keep hearing.","Alexander M. Cutler","I'd say that the -- I don't know that we're having problems per se. We're glad to see that distributors are really starting to stock at this point now. And I think that's what you would hope would happen as you get through this part of the cycle. But we think we've made real progress on some of the areas where there were supply disruptions back really in the first quarter of this year.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","So at this point, the lead times are holding at this point and they're still extended?","Alexander M. Cutler","I'd say they are consistent lead times at this point.","Donald H. Bullock","Well, thank you all for participating in today's call. As always, I will be available to speak with you and answer any questions as follow-up. We did want to be mindful of the earnings calls that are going on after this, so we will close here at 11:00.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Don Bullock. Please go ahead.","Donald H. Bullock","Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Welcome to Eaton's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO; and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and CFO. As has been our practice, we'll begin today's call with comments from Sandy, followed by a question-and-answer session.","As you all are aware, we're in the midst of the acquisition of Cooper Industries, which is under the jurisdiction of both U.S. and Irish Takeover Rules. As a result, I'll draw your attention to a rather wholesome Safe Harbor statement that's outlined in our presentation, and I'll cover portions of that this morning.","This presentation contains certain forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements, including those set forth in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2012, and in the unanticipated delay or failure to close the Cooper acquisition. This presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures as defined by SEC rules. A reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP equivalent is provided in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.eaton.com.","In addition, the earnings guidance contained in this presentation constitutes a profit forecast for the purposes of the Irish takeover rules. In accordance with the Rule 28.4 of the Irish Takeover Rules, this profit forecast shall be repeated in the S-4 Registration Statement and the reports required by Rule 28.3 shall be mailed to the Cooper shareholders with the S-4 Registration Statement.","With that, I'll turn it over to Sandy.","Alexander M. Cutler","Great. Thanks, Don. I'm going to be working from the presentation, which is out on our website, and I'm starting with Page 3 in that presentation.","Just a couple of highlights of our second quarter results. We had a number of records in our second quarter. The first 2 referred to on this page are our operating earnings per share of $1.15, which was up 19%, and our net income per share of $1.12, up 15%, were both all-time records and reflect that we think our strategy and our balance is really working quite well.","The second 2 that are referred to here, the segment operating margins of 14.7% and the operating cash flow of $469 million, are second quarter records. Really, really very pleased with the margin performance, as you've seen both in the first quarter and the second quarter are stronger than a year ago. Then the operating cash flow, I think, reflects again that our model is working well and our businesses are executing very well.","On the sales of $4.1 billion, I think, as you saw in our press release, that came from core growth of 3%, acquisitions of 1%. And then the large item, a negative 5% from ForEx, higher than we had expected coming into this quarter, and I think reflects the currency volatility that we've all been witnessing as we've gone through this quarter.","Then the final point on this page is that emerging markets constituted for about 24% of our sales. You'll recall that this was a higher number last fall. And what we've been seeing is that as the emerging nations have been weaker this year, our sales into those countries have been weaker as well.","Now turning to Page 4. Just a quick reconciliation to the guidance we provided at the beginning of this quarter. We provided in our first quarter conference call the midpoint of our guidance for operating earnings per share was $1.10. Then really 4 items leading to our $1.15 achievement here in the second quarter. Markets were lower again about 3%, as I mentioned, was of our market growth that we saw in our marketplace. That accounted for about a negative $0.06 from the guidance we provided at the beginning of the quarter. Currency, as I mentioned, almost twice as much negative as we had thought coming into this particular quarter. And those 2 together, I think, led to what many people have referred to already this morning as the slight volume shortfall that we had in the quarter.","Offsetting those $0.08 of dilution from our original guidance or drag from our original guidance were $0.08 from a lower tax rate. And then we think really the big news of the quarter, because it continues to reflect our performance in terms of each of our operating segments, was that $0.05 of improved performance and really record second quarter margins. All that led to our $1.15 here in this quarter.","If we turn to Page 5, a quick summary of the corporate-wide numbers. Volume down 1%. Again, remember 5 points of that differential there were caused by the negative ForEx. You can see it in the lower left-hand corner, the green box, 3% for the market, 1% from acquisition. Volumes were up sequentially from the first quarter, up just under 3% from the first quarter. You remember that segment operating margins were 13.8% in the first quarter. They had moved up to 14.7%, and we're very pleased with that here in the second quarter.","If we turn to Page 6, now moving to the individual business segments. Electrical Americas had really an outstanding second quarter following what we felt was an outstanding first quarter. Sales were up from the first quarter, just over 4%. Margins expanded from 15% in the first quarter to 16.9% in the second quarter, up from 14% last year. Had record quarterly sales and profits.","And perhaps even more significantly, our bookings continued to be strong not only with a 4% increase in the quarter but our forward quotations looked very good as well. Markets were up 8%. And we're seeing really broad strength within the residential and nonresidential construction segments. And we'd be pleased to talk more about that during the Q&A section.","Moving to Electrical Rest of World. Sales of $683 million, up about 5% from the first quarter, was good news. Margins pretty much on a par with where we were in the first quarter, down from 9.9% last year. As you can see, an 8 point negative due to ForEx, as we're seeing the large impact up there. In this business, it's primarily the European currencies that are hitting us here.","Some additional revenue due to acquisitions. Bookings came down by about 4%, very much in line with what we're seeing with the market contraction of 3%. Note here that we did complete a small acquisition in the Nordic region that we had released news on earlier in the month.","Moving to our Hydraulics segment. Another really strong quarter performance, record quarterly sales and profits. Sales up of some 6% from last year, up just under 5% from the first quarter. Margins was last year up from 15% in the first quarter. U.S. markets continued to be strong, although here is one of the areas where we're seeing really our outlook for the market for the remainder of the year weakening outside the U.S. Bookings declined by 9%. So I think as we commented in the first quarter, it's worth keeping in mind that the first and second quarter of 2011 were really almost out-of-pattern quarters, where we had very, very large levels of bookings. China was still operating at very strong levels. And here in the U.S., we were seeing OEMs continue to rebound or rebuild their backlogs. So the business continues, they have an attractive level of bookings.","And we were very pleased to have completed the acquisition of SEL in early June, and then in early July, the Korean manufacturer of hydraulics, Jeil Hydraulics. So we told you in our last quarterly conference call, those 2 businesses would have a run rate of over $500 million of additional revenue, and we're pleased that they're both in the company at this point.","Turning to Chart 9. That's the Aerospace segment. Sales up 7% from last year, up just about 1.5% from the first quarter. Margins of 13.5%, up solidly from last year. The commercial OEM side of the business remains very strong, tempered by the weak military OEM activity. And then the bookings up some 2%. You'll recall they were up 7% in the first quarter. And the aftermarket bookings up 4%, they were up 9% in the first quarter. And I would say if there's a piece of news within this overall market outlook in Aerospace, it's that the commercial aftermarket business has been weaker than we were seeing it at the end of last year.","Moving to the Truck segment. Obviously, a very strong quarter performance. Although sales were down 7% from a year ago, and we'll come back and talk about that theme, operating margins of 19.2%, up 140 basis points from last year, up from 18.4% in the first quarter even though volumes were off about 1% from the first quarter. Here, we're seeing U.S. markets up some 20%, very much in line with what we had anticipated when we spoke at the end of the first quarter. The second half is a slightly different story. I'll come back and talk about that when we talk about our market outlook.","The Brazilian truck and bus markets were down 33%. You'll recall they were down 31% in the first quarter, so we did not see a rebound in the second quarter in the Brazilian truck and bus markets. And then we revised our own forecast for the 2012 NAFTA heavy-duty truck forecast, down from our previous 300,000 units to 285,000 units. And basically, that entire change occurs in the second -- we believe will occur in the second half. As you can see again, ForEx was a very difficult headwind in this business with 8% impact in terms of the top line.","Turning to Chart 11, which are our Automotive segment. A solid quarter performance, $422 million. Again, you can see ForEx impacting that top line about 8%. So this was actually off about 1% from the first quarter of this year as well. Very solid performance in terms of the bottom line, in terms of the 11.4%. And as I mentioned in the first quarter, at that time, we'd had about 1 point impact from the start-up expenses of our new facility in China. That came down to be about 0.5 point in this particular month, so really pleased that, that facility is coming on board. Strong North American markets, strong Asian markets. But as you might expect, both Europe and South America, considerably weaker.","Moving to Chart 12. And really this becomes the heart of why we changed our guidance, and I want to spend a little bit more time on this chart than we might ordinarily because I think the context for understanding, it's important to understand as we look at the breadth of our businesses around the world.","We'll start with the top line, Electrical Americas index actually strengthening our growth expectations here in North America. And really what you see here -- or this is all the Americas, excuse me. And what you're really seeing here is the great continued strength in the nonresidential market continuing to strengthen quarter-over-quarter and somewhat of an uptick beginning in the residential markets. They're not back at the levels they were a number of years ago, but they're stronger than we expected. So overall, we expect growth this year, up some 2% from where we had it.","Electrical Rest of World, continued weakness in Europe, China, Brazil, Australia. And really, I think that the view here is that we don't believe that there will be any uptick in Europe or China in the fourth quarter. And when we shared our forecast with you at the end of the first quarter, we had felt there was a pretty good opportunity for the beginning of a rebound in the fourth quarter. We see that now pushing into next year. You'll hear that same theme in terms of those 2 basic geographic markets, any recovery pushing into 2013, affect a number of our businesses.","In Hydraulics business, I would describe the change here in North America of 1 point down as more tuning than anything else. We do sell into the truck and bus market that we have weakened up in terms of our expectation. And there's some concerns about the ag market in light of what's been going on with the drought across the country. More fundamental, however, in Hydraulics is what's happening in China, where clearly we're not seeing the rebound in the construction equipment marketplace there. You've seen a lot of announcements out of China for major customers that are public at this point. And we don't see Europe coming back in the fourth quarter as we mentioned. So overall, down 2 points for our Hydraulics expectations this year.","In the Aerospace market, here in the U.S., it really ties back to the comment I made about commercial aftermarket being weaker than we had originally expected. And when you go outside the U.S., and I would say the down 1 point is more of a tuning than anything else. And it relates to some weaker deliveries here in the second quarter outside of the U.S.","On the Truck side, here in North America, that 5 point down from the previous 16% growth to 11% growth really ties into the heavy-duty forecast again that we've -- and you'll recall we said at the end of the first quarter, we needed to see bookings that would be in the 20,000- to 25,000-unit level. Yes, we entered the summer, as all of you know, we've been seeing orders more in the level of 16,000 to 17,000 in the last 3 months. And that's the reason for taking the forecast out for the balance of this year. Outside of the U.S., Brazil and Asia, the 2 big issues. And here that lead us to taking that now to a negative 4%. So as you can see, we've reduced our growth for the worldwide Trucks index from about 7% to 2% this year. On the Automotive side, still very robust here in North America. I'm really pleased with that. The reduction of 1 point outside the U.S. really ties into most fundamentally Europe, and secondarily, Brazil. And so we now think that, that market grows at about 3%.","So when you step back from all this, strengthening markets in the Electrical Americas segment, continued great strength in the Automotive index, I'd say tuning in the other items in the U.S. So the big theme here is U.S. market stays strong, non-U.S. markets, not much of a recovery expected this year. I don't think there's surprise in any of those comments. And we end up with about 8% growth in our end markets in the U.S. and about a negative 1% outside the U.S. but overall 3% to 4% or this midpoint of 3.5% in terms of our expectations versus the previous 5% growth for this year. Now while we're on this chart, and I think it's worth mentioning that obviously our pending acquisition of Cooper plays right into this North American electrical theme that you see really jump out on this particular page.","Moving to Chart 13. Just 2 changes that we're making in terms of our guidance for the balance of this year, both related to market growth expectations for the Electrical Americas being a little stronger. We've taken it up by 0.5 point. With the Electrical Rest of World markets, now we believe that having weakened, we've taken that down by a point. But overall, margin guidance for the company still in the same range that we had shared with you at the end of the first quarter.","Turning to Page 14. We know there are a lot of moving pieces here, and we've tried to provide you some reconciliation of how we got from last year's operating EPS of $3.96 to the midpoint of our revised guidance of $4.35. These are operating earnings per share. Just to tick down these quickly. The market improvement of 3% to 4% that used to be 5% and it used to be at a 28% margin, it's now at a 29% margin as we are performing better than we had expected to in terms of our segment margins. That line item changed by a negative $0.16.","The market outgrowth of $225 million at a 29% margin. Again, a higher margin, is down $0.07 from what we shared with you at the end of the first quarter. And then if you dropped down to the other corporate line, which is in the green box there, that is $0.01 better than it was. And that's really due to a lot of cost control we've been working hard on. So that top segment of $0.72 is changed by $0.22 from what you saw at the end of the first quarter.","ForEx, as we mentioned, a bigger number now. We think now $500 million of drag for the company this year. That's a negative $0.05. And the higher tax rate versus last year is $0.12 less negative than it was when we shared it with you at the end of the first quarter. So that revised total of $0.33 is $0.07 better than we showed you in April. All that nets -- the $0.22 above, the $0.07 below -- nets you your $0.15 negative in terms of moving us from the midpoint of our previous guidance of $4.50 to now the midpoint of our guidance for operating earnings per share of 2012 of $4.35.","If you move to Chart 15, this chart, I think, you had each of the pieces. We really tried to provide you this for your convenience to kind of keep track of what has changed as we move through our guidance. As I already mentioned, the market outgrowth has come down -- or excuse me, the market growth expectation's come down from 5% to 3%, 3% to 4%. The ForEx impact has changed from a negative $300 million to a negative $500 million. The incremental margins have improved from 28% to 29%. The tax rate has been reduced by 2 points. And all that leads to the $0.15 lowering in the midpoint.","As you look at this, and we have not included a chart for specific third quarter guidance because our process is now one through upfront. Under the Irish Takeover Laws, we're providing full year guidance only at this point. But deductively, I think what you can get from the fact that where our first half earnings are and what our full year earnings are is that we're expecting our second half operating earnings per share to be pretty darn close to these second quarter record levels that we just had this past quarter. So continuing to operate at very attractive levels in spite of the markets being a little lower.","As we move to Chart 16, just by way of summary, our outlook in terms of our guidance for the full year really constitutes a recalibration of global growth prospects. I don't think there's any surprise in any of what we've just shared with you. We've all been looking at the same series of economic data that's been emerging over the last 3 months. Global growth has clearly slowed. And the European and Chinese recovery, we think, get pushed out of 2012.","The truck markets in the U.S. and Brazil are likely to be weaker than we previously anticipated when we thought we might see some upturn in the second quarter that's not materializing. Currency volatility has accelerated with particular weakness in the euro and the Brazilian real. And all of that, which gets all the headlines, I think, sometimes has overshadowed, we think, real continued strength in Electrical Americas, our Hydraulics Americas, our Automotive Americas and commercial Aerospace.","And what this says really to all of us is that our business breadth, both defined in terms of geography and cycle, is really working because in the midst of all this turmoil, we would still expect to have all-time record sales and profits this year. And we have lowered our full year guidance by $0.15 in recognition of all the items I just talked about. And when you think about record sales and profits for Eaton this year, I think it's important to think about while we're projecting sales to be up 4% this year, that would be 9% before the negative 5 points of ForEx. And within that 9% are 2 points of acquisition. So that our core growth in the midst of all this turmoil would be 7%. And I think it's important to focus on that number, that this balance of businesses performing as they are with the technologies we have, addressing this continued important issue in our customers' minds of power management is delivering really impressive core growth in this environment.","Our acquisition of Cooper, just a quick mention of that, remains very much on track. We're in the process of having the S-4 reviewed. And in discussions with the SEC, we did receive -- the Hart-Scott-Rodino review was completed in July. And we're very pleased to have that important step now behind us. And we put in place revolving financial facilities that we'd mentioned in other press releases. They've been upsized to $2 billion and $600 million of term debt issued. And so we're continuing to move forward, and we still expect that very important transformation deal to close in the second half of this year.","And last, I would mention because in among all of the discussion of the Cooper's businesses, that we tend to lose track that the Hydraulics acquisitions that we've completed will add about $500 million of full year revenues as well. So we're really quite pleased with the balance of activities we've got going on, on the M&A side.","With that, we'll stop and we'll be glad to answer questions. Don?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Donald H. Bullock","Our first question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sandy, just on Electrical Americas, it remained strong despite the fact that it likely has exposure to nat gas frac-ing, either directly or indirectly. We thought that might weigh on the segment. Can you talk a little bit more about where you are seeing the strength both on the nonresi and the resi side of that business?","Alexander M. Cutler","Sure. Well, Ann, on the nonres side, again, I would reference everybody right back to the same detail we tend to look at, which is looking at the private put-in-place information and up some just under 4% in the quarter, following a very strong quarter in the first quarter. And when you go through all the segments there, it's interestingly the only segments that really jump out to have negatives were in the communications area, where there's been a lot of discussion around telecom. And then the second is surprisingly is in mining and petrochem and natural gas. And a little lower than a year ago. But virtually, the vast majority of all the other segments are positive. And so at a time when people are talking about office and other commercial, they actually grew. And we're seeing quotation activity continuing to be quite strong as well. So really pleased with the breadth in that area, really continuing on the theme we've talked about before. Frac-ing for us, Ann, has been a little bit more of an issue actually over on our Hydraulics business than it has been on the Electrical side, and they're clearly after a boom in 2011 when we started to look at the impact of some of the discussions in and around regulations, it had slowed down this year. So it's not quite the boom that we saw a year ago. But we remain really quite positive on what we're seeing, not only on what we have booked but more importantly the depth of our quotation logs on the nonresidential side. On the residential side, again, I would say we're not in a booming takeaway. But these numbers are up over 20% when you look at all the public data versus a year ago. So we're beginning to see a recovery there, which is welcome off of the very low levels we've been in for a couple of years.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, Sandy. And a follow-up on the Hydraulics business. You noted potential slowdown in the ag space. Is that something you're already hearing from OEMs? Or is that just you gauging the environment and recognizing that the drought is likely to have an impact on farmer sentiment?","Alexander M. Cutler","I'd say it's more of the latter, Ann, at this point. And of course, there are very different theories on what may happen at this point. But we think it's just prudent planning at this point.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just a couple kind of high-level guidance questions. First, obviously, you've lost a really wide range, and we all get kind of the volatility going on out there. But could you characterize to any degree your comfort with the range? And I guess, in particular, although you brought down Rest of the World Electrical, it implies kind of an improvement in the back half, I'd like to understand why that happens. And you got Truck kind of flattish to up slightly in the back half on what looks like should be lower volumes. Why does that happen?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. A couple of comments, Jeff. We narrowed our range from $0.40 to $0.30, so we've got about a 7% range at this point. So we actually don't think that's that big a range for a 6-month time period with the kind of volatility that's been out there. But we thought it was prudent to bring it down by $0.10. On the Electrical Rest of World, it's obviously been a hard one to call. Basically, what we're seeing is that Europe has flattened. It hasn't gotten worse, it's flattened. We've actually seen -- in Asia, we've seen our business up from the first quarter, but we don't -- and part of that is the timing of obviously Chinese New Year's as well. But we aren't forecasting massive increases as we go through the back half, so we're assuming that what we see today is pretty much what we're going to get upfront. That's our best call at this point. A quarter ago, you may recall we were talking about that we were hopeful we would see particularly in China, we'd see more of a recovery in the fourth quarter. And we're just not seeing the evidence of that. Having said that, we've all been fooled before and have seen the Chinese economy, in particular, change more quickly. But that's not our expectation at this time. On the truck markets, just a last piece. I think you posed a question on there. Really, it's due to the order rates. And we have not seen the order rates come in during the second quarter that we were hopeful we would see. And that's the reason for the direct bringing it down to the 285,000 number.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","But you're defending the margins and I was more on the margin side, it looks like you're pretty confident on defending the margins despite what looks like a kind of a production fix in the third quarter especially.","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. In terms of trucks specifically, are we talking about?","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Yes, Sandy, on trucks specifically.","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, it's -- we're operating obviously at very attractive levels. And I think for a number of people who've followed us for some time, we've built a pretty flexible model in our truck market in terms of being able to ramp ourselves up and down so that we do believe we can hold, as we say, the full year margins we've got in that business. We've been operating very well, both in the first and the second quarter. And while the volumes are going to be coming off, we think, a little bit with the market coming down here, we're convinced we can meet these long term -- or excuse me, full year margin goals in truck.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And just finally and I'll jump off, can you actually tell us what dollar-euro rate and dollar-real rate you're using in the guidance, so we can all kind of reset it as the things play out here?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. No, we sure can. You may remember we started this year thinking that we would see currency negative headwind hit us for about $550 million. We revised down to $300 million at the end of the second quarter in a fit of happiness when we saw things were not quite as bad at the end of the first quarter. And now we're pretty well back to where we were at negative $500 million. What we're assuming is that for the balance of the year we'd be in this $1.20 to $1.22 range for the euro. And we'd be around $2 for the real. I think it's helpful when you think about how dramatic these changes have been in the second quarter this year. The average versus the second quarter of last year for the euro is down about 12%. But interestingly and not everybody tracks the Brazilian currency as carefully, it's down 20%. So these are big impacts. And that's what's driving this 5% negative impact on our top line in the quarter.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question, I guess, on the guidance front again, I guess, I was surprised that you were able to keep your Hydraulic margins at the 16% on the lower growth rates. So can you just help talk about your assumptions behind that? And then in total, what was price material cost in the quarter? And what are the expectations for the back half of the year?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. On the guidance, Jamie, remember, we've got a couple of things going on within our Hydraulics business. One, we've completed a couple of additional acquisitions in our filtration space. And as we've commented to you, we were very pleased with those businesses. They're being integrated and that's giving us the benefit of those synergies, which is playing into that margin as well. We think at this level of activity, which is an attractive level we're at, so we're not talk about coming off from where we are at this point, is that we can maintain very attractive margins in the business. Very pleased with the way the business has been executing. So that's really the piece behind Hydraulics at this point, as we've had a very, very nice first quarter -- or excuse me, first 2 quarters this year, getting started in the business. I'm sorry, I forgot the second part of your question, Jamie.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sorry, just the second point on price cost in the quarter and then what the expectations -- I'm wondering if you get a benefit in the back half of the year.","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. It's hard to know again. We said a couple of times here that the piece that's always hard to predict is the difference between futures and spot pricing because the future prices tend to move with more volatility than do the spot prices, which is more of where we end up actually purchasing. And we have seen, I think, commodities have weakened up as we've come into this year. We're not seeing that pressure to the degree we were. And our expectation for this year was that, that net between price and cost for the full year would be approximately 0 by the time we worked through everything of the year. That's pretty much where we're planning it still at this point. If it turns out to be better than that, we'd be very pleased. But we're not assuming a big plus there.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And did you get a benefit in the quarter?","Alexander M. Cutler","I would say it's fairly immaterial at this point.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Sandy, in Electrical Americas, you started nonresidential construction as a market showing strength for you. Can you comment on the recent trends in the ABI, which tend to suggest that the growth you're seeing now may not be sustainable over the next year or so and talk about what you're expecting in those end markets for Eaton sort of more 9 to 12 months out?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. ABI, we find, is of interest in terms of our -- it's an insight in terms of looking at about 1\/2 of the nonresidential space. ABI really deals with what we would call commercial construction. It doesn't tend to deal with the big portions of mining shafts, wells, manufacturing, which make up about 50% of what's out there in the marketplace. So early on in this recovery, the big strength was really in the areas that I just mentioned. And you were not showing ABI move up at all, and we were talking about the nonres market was going to really bottom and start to increase solidly by the middle of last year and in fact did. So we don't find ABI to be as helpful in this regard as really watching our quote log. So looking at our quote log at this point, we're continuing to see a really nice balance of projects that we can see in this next 6 to 9 months. So our expectation is that we're still in the midst of a several-year recovery in the nonresidential market. It took about 3.5 years for it to trough down. We think it's reasonable you're going to see a similar length of opportunities here on the upside. And we're looking out now at projects that are 6 to 9 months out, so that we think we've got a pretty good view out ahead of us at this point. We've not put out a number for 2013. We really won't do so until we get later in this year, but we're very much encouraged with what we're seeing in terms of the quote log for that period of time.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just jump to Electrical ROW. The last 5 quarters in a row, you've had negative market outgrowth. Can you talk about where it is you think you might be losing share and what you're doing to address that?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. The big issue that we've referenced over the last year was that we had a very outsized position in residential solar, and really that's for the last 4 quarters, that's really been the burn-off of that particular activity. I'd say that the second issue is if you go to countries like Australia, where we've got a very strong position in the commercial construction side of the business, that economy is struggling right now and that's not where the activity is there. So we don't really think it's a share activity. We think it was primarily solar. And that's pretty well behind us because we've burned off the year-to-year adjustments in that regard. I would say the second issue is that our data isn't -- or third issue, our data isn't as precise in some of the emerging nations as we would yet like it to be. I think it's getting better, but I have a little less confidence in our ability to call those markets precisely than they do in the developed nations, where we've spent years trying to perfect these economic models.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering, Sandy, if things have deteriorated a little bit here. I guess, we'd probably agree there's not a ton of visibility from a macro perspective. Can you just talk a little bit about what sort of contingency plans you guys have available if things do take another leg down? And sort of how much restructuring could you do? Or what types of levers could you pull on? And how do you do that planning?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. I'd start, Steve, by saying -- and I think it's on everyone's mind. And I would start by saying at this point, on a relatively low growth activity right now, you're already seeing us with core growth over 7%. And I think that speaks to the first issue. We have, I think, evidenced our ability to outgrow these markets even during very difficult time periods and that's because the applications we're in. And so whether you start [indiscernible] any one of these businesses, there's an awful lot of regulation that's driving the adoption of our technologies. And I don't think that will change. I think customers will have to make some tradeoffs as to what they spend on. But those tend not to be items that you can trade off. And so I think that it starts right there in terms of the strength and positioning of the portfolio. Secondly, I'd say in this relatively volatile and unstable economic growth time period, you're seeing our margins continue to expand. And I think that speaks already to the types of steps that we're taking in terms of how we're positioning our products, how we're able to then price them in a way that creates real value for our customers as well as for our shareholders. And the third is, I think, if we found ourselves in a period of real economic weakness like the 2008 time period, you saw us move very quickly at that point to take costs out. Frankly, we've not let a lot of those costs creep back into Eaton. And we've shared that in our New York analyst meeting the last 2 years. And that's part of the reason we're opening up these margins. But if necessary and we don't see that necessity today because our margins are, we think, are at all-time record levels, we can take steps to cut things back. And of course, we will be in the process of integrating a large acquisition here at some point as well. And that always provides additional opportunities.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. But I guess, just to take that to the bottom line, you're not yet at the point where you feel like you need to take any of those actions?","Alexander M. Cutler","No, we're not. We're still seeing -- x ForEx, we are seeing positive growth and we're being able to capitalize on that. And the ForEx is an issue that we all watch through the cycle. And that doesn't cause us to run our business differently.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And just because you brought it up, maybe this falls under the category of tweaking. But I see your outperformance is a little lower than it was. Is there anything happening there?","Alexander M. Cutler","No, I don't -- I'd go back to the comment that I made to Nathan is that we're candidly a little bit challenged with trying to come up with good economic models for some of these emerging nations, particularly as they've reversed their fortunes and they're not growing like they were. And so my hope is that the longer we spend time on these areas, we're going to get better and better at it at this point. But I'd say no, nothing fundamental.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First, and if you did, I apologize, could you give a little more color behind the very strong Electrical Americas margin improvement? Was it all volume and mix? Or is there something else going on there?","Alexander M. Cutler","I'd say, Andy, a big piece. And no, we hadn't commented on it before. A big piece remember, too, is that the first quarter tends to be the weaker quarter for our Electrical Americas segment from a seasonal point of view and typically from a margin point of view. So you do get that quarter-to-quarter jump. If you look back to the previous year, I think what we are seeing is very solid volume growth. And we're also seeing that a number of what I'm going to call these high-spec products, products where we've come out with really unusual technology, they are enjoying a little fuller margin, and we're seeing the benefit of that as well. So that's the investment in the business. And then I just think our team is doing a terrific job of running that business. So I'd say those are probably your 3 sources. And as you can tell from our full year guidance, we think it's quite sustainable and we raised the guidance by another 0.5 point in that segment. So I think you're really seeing the benefit of a business of real scale hitting on multiple cylinders with a lot of new products.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And on -- just quickly on -- another question on that. Have you seen a reversal in the data center weakness that you talked about in Q1?","Alexander M. Cutler","I would say, generally, I would say that the power quality market was weaker in the second quarter. And so our bigger strength was on the power distribution side of the business. And I'd say almost each of the 3 areas that we typically talk about in power quality, whether that be the single-phase business, whether that be the 3-phase flow business or whether it be the 3-phase large data center business, it was a weaker quarter than we had seen in the fourth and first.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then one clarification and a broader-picture question. The clarification on the outlook for the Aerospace margin 2012, 15%, first half, by my math, comes in at about 13.7%. What are you factoring in to drive the second half margin improvement?","Alexander M. Cutler","We typically -- Andy, if you take a look at us, we've been a little stronger seasonally in the second half in that business. And we're counting on that as one of the items that will drive that stronger margin. I'd say that's the biggest plus. You'll remember overall for the year, the big change year-to-year is occasioned by the change in the much stronger commercial OEM production and then not as much aftermarket. And we saw that aftermarket frankly even a little weaker than we thought it might be here earlier in the year. And then really no change at this point from our perspective as the military market would be a mid-single digit decline this year in terms of activity. And that's pretty well manifesting itself already this year.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, Sandy. And then lastly, bigger picture for North America. You're encountering mixed market conditions, clearly seeing weaker truck and then strong auto and construction markets. I mean, you guys have a very broad view on NAFTA truck. Can you share your perspective on what really is behind the hesitant customer order placement and then why that hesitation would remain kind of isolated to truck?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. And I think in some ways, Andy, you're right that the things that are causing the weakness in the truck market may be on people's minds in multiple markets. Number one, there were price increases for the new trucks. And I think many customers are saying, \"Gee, I'm concerned about the magnitude of that price increase and maybe I'll wait or maybe I'll negotiate a little longer.\" And we've heard a fair amount of that chatter. I would say, secondly, is that freight's been good, fleets have been getting price increases. All that's a positive. There's been quite a bit of buying of new trucks end of last year and first half of this year. In our talking with dealers and key fleets, they're looking at the fiscal cliff at year end and they're saying, \"I'll wait and I want to see how that's going to sort out.\" So I think the issue that we're all reading about every day and that many of us are worried about, the fiscal cliff has very relevant and potential impacts on what's going to happen for capital goods and personal purchases as we get out to the end of the year. And we hear it back from a number of customers in a number of markets. And so the closer we get to that, I think the more people will be concerned. And it's not hard for someone to take 6 months off, and then start up again.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from David Raso with ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The question's about the second half revenue guidance. I'm just trying to understand the moving parts. Basically, the first half, the revenue growth was about 1.7%. So the second half has to grow about 6.2% to get to the full year. And the acceleration there, obviously, the Turkish acquisition, that alone probably gets you 1\/3 or so of that 6.2%. But the other 2 key pieces, what is accelerating in growth rate second half year-over-year versus the first half year-over-year? I would think the currency at a minimum, all else equal, is going to be as much a drag as it was in the first half, if not a little more. So what's accelerated? Is it just the Rest of the World difficulties in Electrical and every other business just being less of a drag? Or is something actually accelerating on a positive growth rate?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. From the growth rate because we're not talking 3% to 4%, the market growth rates are pretty flat compared to the first half this year. Your currency was, because we told you in the first quarter, it was about a negative $50 million, it's about negative $250 million in the first half, it's about negative $250 million in the second half. Now that's larger than we had thought it was going to be for the second half and that's the difference between us having a negative $300 million in our previous guidance and a negative $500 million now. But as you think about growth for the year, you end up with this 3% to 4% base growth minus negative 3.1%, I think, is the percentage if I recall for the $500 million. And then you end up with a couple of points of acquisition growth. And then the outgrowth is a little higher than it was in the first half. And I think those are your pieces in terms of trying to figure out that overall growth.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Well, I'm not sure if somebody can -- maybe, Sandy, could take me through a little more detail. Just the pure math of up 1.7% in the first half total revenues to get to up 4% for the year. Again, you need the growth rate to accelerate to 6.2% in the back half. The Turkish acquisition probably adds $180 million in the second half. It added very little to the first half. So of the acceleration of 6.2%, I can see right there the Turkish acquisition adds say 2.2%. But the rest to accelerate on, I'm just try to figure out what's accelerating especially again if currency is maybe even a bigger drag year-over-year.","Richard H. Fearon","David, it's Rick. I think that you're actually understating the acquisition sum. It's not just the Turkish, it's Jeil, the Hydraulics acquisition. And as Sandy said, the FX should be, in absolute numbers, the same in the second half versus the first half. But it's hard to do these kinds of reconciliations online. So why don't I ask you to have Don walk you through it on a later call?","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then lastly, when I think about the margins in Auto, in a way having the international business down as much as it is and the total business down, I would say the decremental margins of only 18% in the quarter were actually pretty impressive. When you think about the next few quarters where again, it's probably domestic auto, healthy, and international, weak, is that a reflection of the international margins in auto or just not nearly as high as North America? So that mix is actually a net positive, and I should expect some pretty modest decrementals. Or are you already taking some costs out of those international auto businesses? Because again I thought that margin was pretty healthy for total auto sales down 8% and the decremental wasn't too bad.","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. Dave, we commented in the fourth quarter, and then in the first quarter that we've been starting up a new facility in China that we're really excited about because frankly the volume opportunities have been quite substantial in that marketplace. And as we look at this full year guidance of 12% in terms of the margin revenue -- or excuse me, the revenues -- the margins, excuse me, in that segment, we've been -- in the first quarter, we were down about a point due to excess costs of starting up the facility in the second half of about a -- in the second quarter, about 0.5 point. And those international margins would actually be even a little better without that. We expect that to be largely behind us now as we go into the second half.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And that's the confidence the margins are up in the second half sequentially in auto...","Alexander M. Cutler","Correct.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Can we just go over some points? You talked about power quality being weaker in the second quarter. Can you talk about what's your expectation there for the rest of the year?","Alexander M. Cutler","The market has actually been growing a little less quickly than the power distribution market. And so that we think with pressure on individuals buying computers, server sales not being outstanding, that we don't see quite the strength there that we were seeing in the fourth and the first quarter. So our market within that overall forecast for both Electrical Rest of World and Electrical Americas is a little weaker now than it was on power quality.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And you expect, effectively, no change for the rest of the year from the second quarter for the...","Alexander M. Cutler","We don't see a reason to assume there's a big rebound, Eli. That's very fair.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Right. And you talked about no expectation for Europe and China to get better. Brazil has been a mess that surprised everybody, the way it's been in the first half. Do you see anything happening in Brazil at this point? Or do we continue to see...","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. We don't think -- we think third quarter is likely to look a lot like the second quarter there. A little harder to call because the fourth quarter wasn't anything real special down there last year. So that no, we think this year you're going to see Brazil be a kind of a disappointing economy versus people's expectations. And that's pretty much our view for the rest of the year.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then when you talk about truck market, I mean, you cut your forecast at 285,000 and you're holding margins. And the industry is showed to be producing about 310,000 first half. And the problem is the order rate, the 6-month trailing order rate is 232,000, down from 262,000 if you move it back a few months. How much sensitivity do you have if you have to bring that truck production down a little bit more to being able to hold that margin? And is there a risk of that happening?","Alexander M. Cutler","Well, I think what you've seen from -- you're seeing from us kind of zones of profitability as we've been in kind of different -- whether it was the 200,000 or the 225,000 or the 250,000, I mean, all using NAFTA numbers here. And we clearly, at this point, are thinking we're in this 285,000 range. If you start dropping down to 250,000 or 240,000 or 225,000, all of which I think are highly probable, but yes, you do see us come down by points. And I think your best view there is probably, Eli, just to take a look at those years where we were operating at 250,000. And that will get you a pretty good view as to what our margin activity's likely to be.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just as you talked to your sales guys or people on the street in China, I mean, what are the silver linings or what kind of gives you confidence that we're seeing any kind of improvement or that give you confidence in recovery into '13?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. I think it's probably -- it's not as much I would say on the street discussions at this point because you'll get people who are at both ends of the spectrum that the recovery is a day away and that the recovery isn't going to happen for some time period. It's more about the actions that the government has been taking. And they've been beginning to cut interest rates. But we think that doesn't take a month. We think that's a 5- to 6-month impact in terms of that happening. You have a change in government coming. And frankly, we thought more would be done by now to try to get the economy up to a higher level ahead of seating a new government. It does look like they're beginning to move in that area. And then I would say selectively in some of the areas we do business, we've seen inventories pared significantly. And that's a very necessary precondition to try to get your production to ramp up to actually -- excuse me, orders to ramp back up to meet with actual production rates. So having said all of that, that's why we pushed it out of the fourth quarter because we think the actions had needed to be a little earlier and a little bigger to assure we would have seen a fourth quarter recovery. Having said all that, it is a very big economy. There are still very large projects to be done and need to be done, particularly on the energy side of the economy. And so we remain bullish long-term in terms of the opportunity in the Chinese economy.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as you jump through the various hoops to getting the Cooper deal closed, anything more definitive on timing? Or how you think financing shakes out relative to original expectations?","Alexander M. Cutler","No. We still think, Jeff, it's a second half transaction. What we're very pleased about though is that if you think about those couple of comments I mentioned in terms of we're in that process of the S-4 review, we've had the Hart-Scott-Rodino approvals here in the U.S. and we have been able to get our finance facilities upsized, so I look at each of those steps saying, \"Hey, we're very much on plan, and it's our expectation to close here in the second half.\"","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I had a question about Hydraulics. Just wondering how do you think about how much you've improved the scope of your participation on platforms globally versus before the great recession. And really, trying to get an eye on how much of your growth there has been cyclical and how much has been strategic.","Alexander M. Cutler","Boy, I don't know I can give you a decimal point on that one, Chris. We're obviously, number one, we're participating in the fact that there has been a big recovery in the market. And we do think there's a very significant change that's taking place in the market that it's the mobile side of the market that led the recovery. And we're continuing to see very strong activity there. If you simply just take these last 2 acquisitions that we've announced, they greatly expand our capabilities. And really delighted with Jeil in terms of what it brings to us for a number of mobile applications, particularly in the construction marketplace, really widens our capability there. We're also, prior to doing these acquisitions, whether it be SEL or whether it be Jeil, we've introduced a number of new products that have really broadened our capabilities there as well. I'm quite enthused with some of the LifeSense hose capabilities we've talked about. We can take you through a whole list of products. So I think what you have in our Hydraulics business is not only a business that has more technology and more product, but it has done a really terrific job, the team has, of improving the mix of what I would call fixed and variable costs. And you've seen the margins improve quite substantially in the business. So we're really very pleased with the performance of the business, and then have added on top of that the 2 additional filtration acquisitions we did last year. And that business has now become a business within Hydraulics of real scale as well.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on Electrical Americas, would you say you're less weighted to public than the index?","Alexander M. Cutler","Less weighted to, excuse me, Chris?","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","To public construction on the nonres side than the index?","Alexander M. Cutler","No. I think because of our position, I think when you look at the whole nonres market for the Americas, that looks pretty much like -- or we look pretty much like it.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners. Okay. Moving on, Rob McCarthy with Baird, Robert Baird.","Robert F. McCarthy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the second half growth outlook from a little bit different perspective and recognizing that these numbers are rounded. For the second quarter, second quarter in a row, you've reported no outgrowth. Your guidance for the full year assumes about a 1.4% growth contribution from outgrowth, the implication then being for the second half of the year, it would add something like 2.5% to growth or maybe even a little more. Could you maybe rank order for us the top 2 or 3 contributors to that improved outgrowth performance that you're looking for in the second half, Sandy?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. And we don't give specific guidance, Rob, on individual elements. And so let me maybe give you a little bit more general reply on the subject. If you look at our larger businesses, in Electrical Americas, for example, we've got pretty good visibility into what we've got in our backlog versus what the shipments are going to be. And so that's probably what gives us quite a bit of confidence when we look at the businesses where we've got backlogs. So we've got fairly substantial backlog in our Aerospace business. We've got fairly substantial backlog in our Electrical business. And we've got some backlog, obviously, in our Hydraulics business. And with the benefit of knowing what we've got kind of in-house, that's what gives us a little bit more confidence around these numbers.","Robert F. McCarthy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. But there's an implication that something is improving in the year-on-year comparisons. And I thought maybe that you mentioned, for example, that the comparisons in the Truck business in Brazil in the fourth quarter, probably at least on the face of it, would seem to be a lot easier than they were last year yet you mentioned solar. Are there a couple of other important moving pieces that would have a similar impact?","Alexander M. Cutler","Well, I think you've seen pretty consistently in our Electrical Americas business a record of outgrowth there. And it's a whole variety of products that are within there and important market segments that we're doing quite well in, so it's a little bit of all the fleas in the flea market because we're dealing with so many different products here. I get the gist of your question, but it's more like a 2-hour answer, not like a 2-minute answer.","Robert F. McCarthy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Fair enough. The other question I wanted to ask was -- surrounded your comments about price cost and really looking for a roughly neutral impact through the year. And with -- I would expect at least some -- and you mentioned it yourself, seeing some improvement on the cost side. I wondered if we could talk about where you see the most, I guess, pressure would be the right word, on the price side where you've got the greatest resistance there. And I assume maybe that, that would be Electrical Rest of World.","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. I would say the issue -- and generally, let's go back a year when you had commodities increasing fairly dramatically. Lots of company, not just our own, were trying to both find ways to cost-reduce product substitute materials, and then, yes, selectively increase prices where necessary. I think it's clearly a different market today. I don't think there are a lot of price increases out there at this point, and particularly with the uncertainty that's going on in the end markets. And so we're continuing to work really hard right now to continue to find material substitution where necessary but also to continue to introduce the products that are really creating a real value for our customers. And that's the way we think about it is that energy costs are starting to go up again right now. We've all been watching that again in the last 3 weeks, and that's starting to put pressure on issues where people want to invest. And we think we've got the high-value products that can really make that difference.","Robert F. McCarthy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So my takeaway, Sandy, is, I mean, if I've got this wrong, is that the elements are both about neutral as well. In other words, not much change on cost side for the full year, not much change in price realization.","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. And we've not given -- Rob, I appreciate your question. We've not given specific guidance on either because it's pretty much competitive information. But the net of no impact is correct.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sandy, you've talked in the past this year about building scale in the Rest of the World business to help that business, to help it outgrow and to help it with margin performance. How have you been doing this year? How is the build out going? And then is it possible to talk about how Cooper can help that business over the next year assuming the deal closes?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. Let me speak to the Cooper piece first. And then I'll say just what we said when we announced the transaction is that if you recall going back into February of 2011, one of the items that we talked about in our conference in New York was that we were looking to increase our EBIT by about 4.5 points over a 5-year time period. 3 points would come from increase of segment margins. That was from the 13% to the 16%, and we've since increased that a little bit higher. The other 1.5 point would come in terms of corporate costs, with the largest portion coming from lower cost coming from the pension plan. We've not been particularly good predictors of the discount rate, so let me move right by that one and talk about the balance, which was about 0.5 point that was going to come through better absorption of corporate expenses. And part of those higher corporate expenses had come that we had invested in infrastructure ahead of growing our businesses in Rest of the World. And those are all our businesses, not simply the Electrical business. What we commented when we announced the Cooper acquisition is that it gave us additional volume into a number of emerging nations, where we had already built the infrastructure and should allow us then to reach our goals of absorbing those higher costs more quickly. So that we do believe will happen is something we talked about in our announcement at that time. And beyond that, I can't really say too much more about the Cooper acquisition. But I'd say that assuming all our assumptions were upfront in terms of what we announced, we still think that, that would be true. What are we building out in terms of our own kind of Rest of World activity, not only in Electrical but in businesses like Hydraulics, in Truck and Automotive? We've been continuing to invest in these areas because we really do believe long-term that those markets will grow more quickly than the developed nations. And so while the markets are weaker right now, we think the right strategic path for our shareholders is to continue to drive strong participation in those regions.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Just shifting gears to Hydraulics. Obviously, your U.S. Hydraulics business has been quite strong for you. I mean, you mentioned ag, construction markets have been pretty strong. What's the visibility like in that segment? How long can you see out based on your backlog in that segment that it looks relatively healthy still?","Alexander M. Cutler","We're back to -- our backlogs aren't as long as they were in 2007 and '08 because I think at that point, people were feeling the world might never change and people had a little dose of reality, you've got to watch these cycles. But we've been operating at pretty similar levels in the business really since the third quarter 2011 through now. And so I would describe it more as a period of stability. You're seeing these negative booking comparisons for the first quarter and the second quarter of 2011 because those were just big booming year -- quarters, excuse me, both in China and in the rebuilding of the backlog by major OEMs. So generally, we're seeing out 3 to 6 months, but our forecast is as good as our OEMs' forecast is because they're the ones that are really providing us with the order commitments.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. And then at least for 3 to 6 months, things still look pretty good in both of those segments.","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, they do and we're operating it at quite good levels. And I think the difference really in our forecast, just so everybody gets the tonality correctly, is that what we're saying is that China doesn't recover in the fourth quarter and that Europe stays more or less like it is. It isn't that Europe is getting much, much worse and it's not that we think there will never be a recovery in China.","Donald H. Bullock","So our last question of the day comes from Jason Feldman with UBS.","Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On Hydraulics, you've talked about the mobile side. Could you give us a little bit more color on what's happening with stationary, any particular areas of strength or weakness relative to what you saw last quarter?","Alexander M. Cutler","I'd say fairly consistent. And we're not talking about big percentage changes here. And I think clearly, you're seeing U.S. exporters having a little different situation on their hands than they had 6 months ago with the change in the currency. But I would say that outside of the frac-ing market, which was really, really hot, as you came out of the end of last year, not dramatic changes at this point.","Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, the tax rate was cut with guidance. And I'm just kind of curious because it sounds like if the U.S. market just seems to be holding up better relative to your expectations than some of the foreign markets, which presumably are lower tax jurisdictions, what are the dynamics there, given what's going on with the U.S. versus international end markets but the tax rate being lower, your expectations for the year?","Richard H. Fearon","Jason, it's Rick. Let me handle that. Not all non-U.S. markets are low tax markets. Brazil, for example, is a very high tax rate country. And so you have mix changes going on that are a little bit different than we thought about at the start of the year. And as we referenced in our earnings early, we also had some actions taken in Europe that resulted in a lowering of some deferred tax liabilities. And so there were multiple factors that resulted in the rate being a little bit lower than we had thought. For the full year, we now think the rate will be about 2 percentage points lower than we had previously thought.","Donald H. Bullock","With that, we want to thank you, all, for joining us this morning. As always, I will be available for the remainder of the day and on into the week to answer any follow-up questions you might have. Thank you again.","Operator","So that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"7598":["Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 23, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Donald H. Bullock - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","Alexander M.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Don Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Donald H. Bullock","Good morning, everyone. I'm Don Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Welcome to Eaton's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me this morning are Sandy Cutler, Chairman and CEO; Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and CFO. ","As been our practice, we'll begin today's call with comments from Sandy, followed by a question-and-answer session.","The information provided on our conference call today will include forward-looking statements concerning the second quarter 2012 and full year 2012 net income per share and operating earnings per share; second quarter and full year 2012 revenues; our worldwide markets; our growth in relation to end markets; and our growth from acquisitions. Those statements should be used with caution and are subject to various risk and uncertainties, many of which are outside the company's control. ","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are set forth in today's press release and related Form 8-K filing.","As a reminder, we have included a presentation on the first quarter results, which can be accessed on the Investor Relations page. Additional financial information is available in today's press release, which is located on the Eaton's homepage at www.eaton.com.","At this point in time, I'll turn it over to Sandy. Sandy?","Alexander M. Cutler","Great. Thanks, Don, and welcome, everybody, this morning. I'm going to use the presentation that Don referred to, and so I'm going to start on Chart #3 that's entitled Highlights of Q1 Results. Obviously, as you read in our press release, we had a number of records set in our first quarter, we think a very solid start to this year. Operating per share up some 10% at $0.92; net income per share up 10% at $0.91; our overall sales up some 4%; and significantly, a really nice strong start to the year with our segment operating margins of 13.8%, up from 13% a year ago. ","Emerging market sales were 23% of sales. And this is significant for those of you that recall that in the fourth quarter, it was some 27%, and was even a little stronger than that in the third quarter last year. And this really reflects what is, I think, we're all seeing around the world today with the weakness in China and the Brazilian markets, in particular, versus a year ago. And that's having an impact on a number of our segments, and I'll talk a little bit about that as we go on this morning. ","We're raising our full year operating earnings per share guidance for the second time this year. Recall that we raised it by $0.05 back in February when we announced our acquisition of SEL and we're now increasing it an additional $0.10. And I think the easiest way to think about this $0.10 increase is about $0.06 of that $0.10 comes from less negative ForEx than we originally anticipated this year. You'll recall our original guidance was for a negative impact of $550 million in terms of our full year sales. We now think it's more likely to be on the order of $300 million. ","About a $0.05 positive from tax where, based upon our starting a little lower this year and our mix being a little bit different than we had anticipated it might be this year, it's more likely to be about 1 point lower than we had guided to. I'll come back to that little later. ","And then our number of shares, we think, will be about a point -- excuse me, about $0.01 impact higher than we had originally thought. So a plus $0.06, a plus $0.05, a negative $0.01, that gets you to $0.10. ","If we move on to Chart 4. Just a couple comments here in terms of providing you some color around the difference from the midpoint of our guidance for the first quarter. Obviously, the midpoint was $0.85. I mentioned that the currency was less negative in terms of the impact than we had thought. We had originally anticipated we'd see about $150 million negative impact. We saw about $50 million and so that drives about $0.03. ","Lower tax rate. It was at 15.6%, as you saw in the notes to our statements. We'd anticipated that while the full year was going to be around 18%, we thought the first quarter would start about 17%. So it's 15.6% versus 17.0%. And I think good news in terms of the improved performance. For those of you who had the chance to look through the incrementals of our business, we came in at about a 32% incremental versus the 28% we provided for our full year guidance, so all that gets you to the $0.92. ","And our corporate expenses at $65 million came in at exactly the quarterly average of our full year guidance for this year. ","If we turn to Chart 5 of the financial summary. I think these numbers are pretty well thought out in terms of the overall earnings release. So I'm going to spend more time going into the individual segments. I think significant here though is market growth of about 4%, so just a little bit below the overall 5% goal we had for this year. I'll talk a little bit more about what our anticipation is in the second half of this year for growth rates. ","We move to Chart 6, which is the Electrical Americas segment. Terrific quarter. Obviously, as you saw, sales up some 13%, a nice strong start in terms of a 15% segment margin. I think encouraging, we've talked quite a bit over the couple years about what might be the curve of recovery in the nonresidential construction market. Really pleased to see it up some -- almost 10% on a broadening recovery. And interesting enough, when you look through the statistics here of U.S. private put in place nonresidential construction. What you'll see is that 9 of the 11 sectors that are reported are all positive. And that includes offices where I know there's been a lot of discussion, is there any office construction going on. Well, the actual detail shows it's positive as well. So what we're pleased about is not only the strength, but we're starting to see it play out into virtually all of the segments that are reported here. ","Also seeing great strength as you might imagine on oil and gas. Our service business is strong. And unlike what we were seeing a year ago, we're actually starting to see a positive in the residential market, albeit not back to the levels it was at the peak. All that driving very strong bookings, as you saw, 6% in the quarter and so we're feeling quite good about the segment. ","We're also, as you're going to see, we're going to raise the full year guidance in terms of segment margin for this business from 15.5%, which was our previous guidance, to 16.0%. So market stronger, segment stronger, bookings stronger. Really, really great performance for the quarter. ","Electrical Rest of World segment. Obviously, we are feeling the impacts here of a weaker Europe that we've been talking about for some time and a weaker Asia, driven primarily by the slowness in China. European markets, we think, down some 7%. Pretty broad regional weakness. And as you go through the PMI numbers that have come out last week and then early this morning, I think you get further confirmation of the fact that we're seeing this in even countries such as Germany, which had held up a little bit better early in this time period. ","Asia Pacific markets down. This is the last quarter we should see the big quarter-to-quarter difference in the solar market. You recall we really saw the solar market come off in the second quarter of last year, so by the time we get to the second quarter, the second quarter comparisons, this shouldn't be of this magnitude. ","But we have seen this broad China market weakness continue. And as we'll comment on later, we believe that the European and the Chinese markets are more likely to not recover in the third quarter. You remember our guidance for the full year was that we expect to begin to see recovery in these 2 regions in the third and fourth quarter. We think it's prudent now to anticipate it's more likely to be a fourth quarter recovery than a third quarter recovery. We'll be glad to answer questions on that. ","Bookings down some 6% in this overall market. And again, this is both a European and an Asia Pacific story in this segment. And what you would find underneath the geographic breakout of many of our other segments, you'll find these same comparisons, that Europe and Asia are weak and the Americas are strong, and that's a trend I'll come back to in the conclusion. ","If we think about the margins in this particular business, the 8.3% that we reported this quarter, maybe one quick note there. We did take some actions in early in the first quarter to resize our Chinese production capacity and we also incurred a small loss on the sale of a Chinese small joint venture. All that amounted to about 1 point. And so without that, it would have been about 9.3%. ","If we move to Hydraulics. Again, we think a very strong quarter. 15% operating margins. Volumes up some 7% from last year. Here again, the story is strength in the U.S. markets. You go outside of the U.S., not so strong. And in fact, seeing Asia down quite significantly, as you can see here, and that's primarily being driven by the weakness in China. First time we've seen the bookings flatten out and -- on a year-to-year basis here, while we've gone through this very strong recovery in the Hydraulics business. That really is the result, when you cut underneath it, is looking at the OEM versus distributor side of the business. ","The large mobile, we have, as you can recall, over the couple of -- last couple of years have been rebuilding their backlog not only -- these are not only kind of 30- to 90-day shipments, but they were laying out commitments for longer time periods. That really has leveled off now, and so the way we try to express that here is that little backlogs have been rebuilt. We're seeing more production or orders that fill current production. We're still comfortable with our margin forecast through the business. The business is doing well. The distributor business was more flattish in the quarter, but the real year-to-year weakness came off at the boom year -- or boom quarter that we saw in the first quarter as the market started to recover last year. ","We're continuing to make investments in emerging markets and that did depress our margins in this quarter, about 0.5 point. We still think that's the right decision to make as we're continuing to grow this business and we're really fairly pleased. You saw our announcement last Friday to announce the -- our agreement to acquire Jeil Hydraulics, which is in Korea, which goes along with the exciting acquisition we announced at the end of February to acquire the Turkish hose company that we conveniently call SEL. Those 2 really give us the annualized revenues. They won't be realized this year, but on a full year, of additional $525 million. ","If we move to the Aerospace segment. Performance was very much in line with our expectations in terms of a top line and bottom line performance. You can see that the market growth of about 6% really being driven by the U.S. commercial aircraft market. They're up some 9%. Bookings quite solid. Again, it's the commercial side, both the aftermarket and the OEM business, that are driving that. But as we have told you in our guidance for the full year this year, we expected that margins would be impacted by the fact that we were going to see this real surge, which we are indeed seeing, on commercial OEM production and we would not see the aftermarket keep up with that in the short term, so that you would get a little bit of a negative drag in terms of margins. But again, this quarter very much as we anticipated in terms of top line and bottom line. ","Now moving to the Truck segment. The volumes up, a very solid 10%. Very attractive segment margin performance of 18.4%. A couple of different themes running in here that are similar to what I talked about both in Hydraulics and in our Electrical businesses, seeing great strength in North America. Obviously, the NAFTA heavy-duty production up some 50%. We continue to believe we're going to see at least a 300,000-unit production level this year. I know there's been a lot of reports and speculation during the last couple weeks about the very strong first quarter on the order of 78,000 units of production. What might happen in the second quarter, there've been a couple of indications of production cutbacks by various OEMs. We still think the build schedules are strong. They're in excess of these numbers. Please remember cancellations are always strongest in March and April every year because it's right before that current year's new production -- or excuse me, new model year offers. And so we continue to think there's good strength in this marketplace, and we're seeing production forecasts that support our forecast. ","Now on the other side of things. In Brazil, the truck and bus market was down 31% in the first quarter versus a year ago. Many of you recall that there were emissions regulations that went into effect as of year-end 2011 and we think we're seeing the kind of understandable post pre-buy inventory build and then dramatic production reductions there in the first quarter. ","The ag equipment held up a little bit better. But again, this is a story of strength in the Americas, weakness outside of the Americas. ","In the Automotive segment, very much in line with how we thought things would lay out for this quarter as well. Volumes down about 4%, but if you look over at the little green box, I'm on Chart 11, in the green box on the lower left-hand corner, this is the business where negative ForEx hit us to the largest degree. You can see a negative 3 points. And then you recall the divestiture that we made last year was about a negative 4 points. So when you look at that 4-point reduction of overall volume, 7 points came from divestitures and ForEx. ","Again, interesting theme, U.S. market up 16%, non-U.S. markets flat. And as we had commented in the fourth quarter -- for the fourth quarter, in our conference call in January, we've been adding capacity in China and that impacted our margins by about 1 point in the fourth quarter. It did so again in the first quarter and we would expect that, that will carry until about the second quarter before we begin to fully absorb those costs. ","Moving next to the segments to Chart 12 to take a look at the overall market. I think you get -- you obviously get the feel from all these comments is that the U.S. is where the strength is. The markets outside of the U.S. is not where the strength is this year. So a reversal of what we've seen of the trends in the last 4 to 5 years. ","You recall that in the first quarter conference call, we had indicated that overall growth, 5%, that's still our view in terms of global growth for our weighted end markets. But if you look on the consolidated market index line, which is the second from the bottom, you'll see a pretty significant change here that we'd originally thought the U.S. markets would grow about 6%. We now think that'll be 9%. And instead of 4% outside the U.S., we now think that'll be 2%. ","So while this is sort of a tuning as you go through all the individual markets in terms of growth rates, I think the really significant issue here is that we're seeing a fundamental change in terms of where the economic strength is. But because of Eaton's diversity and our strategy of really having a balanced portfolio, we're in a position still to increase our guidance for this year for the second time, in fact, in spite of this fairly fundamental change in regional distribution. ","So if we jump to Chart 13, you'll see really not many changes to terms of our full year margin expectations for our 6 segments, just up 0.5 point in Electrical Americas, down 0.5 point in Electrical Rest of World from our initial guidance this year. And that's really the result of the change in market growth rates as we've dropped the growth rate for market growth by 2 points in the Electrical Rest of World and have taken it up in Electrical Americas. ","Moving to Chart 14. Simply a layout of both our operating earnings per share, our fully diluted earnings per share for the full year. The midpoint, obviously, our first guidance for the second quarter. Key issue here, obviously, we're raising guidance for the full year by $0.10 in both operating earnings per share and in our fully diluted earnings per share. ","The reconciliation for that is on Chart 15. And if you flip to Chart 15, again, I guess I would say the headline of all this is revenues up 7.5%, operating EPS up 14%. We think great leverage in these somewhat uncertain economic times. And the changes on this reconciliation from the last time you saw it at our February New York City Analyst Meeting was that the decrease in number of shares, that's down -- this is the income that would come from having a lower number of shares, it's down from $0.06 to $0.05, so a negative $0.01 on that line. If you go to the higher tax rate line, that is now lower by $0.05, so that's a positive. And in the ForEx impact that I mentioned is a positive by $0.06. So negative $0.01, a plus $0.05, a plus $0.06 gets you the $0.10 difference. ","If we jump to Chart 16, probably one of the simpler quarter-to-quarter reconciliations we've had in some time. This is the first quarter 2012 to second quarter 2012 starting with the $0.92 that we reported today. We're expecting incremental volumes of $200 million to $300 million of additional volume for the second quarter versus the first quarter this year. That what drives the $0.18 of incremental volume, really no other changes in anticipation here. And that's what gets us to the midpoint of our range, $1.10. ","Chart 17 is the summary chart. You've seen this format a number of times. I'll simply annotate a couple lines on it to be sure that we're all on the same page. If you go back to the February guidance, you'll recall that $0.05 increase in guidance that we made for the midpoint at that time really was driven by the net acquisition\/divestiture revenue line where we moved from $90 million to $315 million, and we had announced at that point we expected the full year incremental sales from the acquisition of SEL would be approximately $225 million. If we now jump to April, you'll see that, that net acquisition revenue moves to about $365 million. That's roughly $80 million from the new acquisition we just announced of Jeil and it's about $190 million from SEL. That's slightly slower -- slightly lower, excuse me, than the $225 million we announced because we think it's going to take one more month to close that acquisition than we originally thought. ","If you drop to the sales decrease, the line right underneath it, on ForEx, you'll see, we moved down from a negative $550 million to a negative $300 million. And the way we see that laying out that I mentioned before was that we saw about $50 million of that in the first quarter. We think we'll see about $100 million in the second quarter and about $150 million in the second half. Then you'll see the tax rate change where we've brought it down by 1 point. And then I think the rest of the changes on that page is self-explanatory in terms of the $0.10 increase in earnings. ","That brings us to Chart 18. Just a couple comments on Chart 18. Again, a record first quarter, very pleased to have our earnings per share up 10% on a 4-year -- 4% revenue growth, I think again demonstrating very strong earnings leverage. We expect another full year record in 2012. And here, I think it's just worth standing back through all the noise of the ups and downs of Europe and Asia and currency and all the rest. We think we'll have sales of about 7.5% and operating per share growth of 14%. We think quite strong this year. ","We remain confident in our overall global growth expectations of 5%, but as I mentioned, the real significance is this change of mix as detailed in those 2 points in terms of U.S. stronger, Rest of World weaker. We're pleased in terms of use of cash this year that we both increased our dividend earlier this year and we've already announced 2 acquisitions with total annualized revenue of about $525 million this year. ","And then as we raise our guidance by $0.10 for the second time this year, and obviously that range now is $4.30 to $4.70, I think it's further demonstration of the fact that our business perhaps is really paying off in what, I think, most would characterize somewhat uncertain global economic environment and it's allowing us to go ahead and increase our guidance at this point. So strong quarter. I think a balanced outlook for the remainder of the year. ","And Don, with that, we'll open things up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Donald H. Bullock","Our first question this morning comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Sandy, I'm interested in your comments on what you described as a fairly significant mix shift, I guess, toward the U.S. and away from non-U.S. growth. And I was surprised that given that, a couple of things happened. I would have expected margin maybe to go up a little bit on a blended basis. Just my feeling is that margins are a little better in the U.S., that maybe that's no longer the case. But also the tax rate, I guess I'm surprised the tax rate would actually go down on a higher mix of U.S. business. So I'm wondering if you could just sort of flesh those things out.","Alexander M. Cutler","Sure. Let me take the tax one first. I understand your point precisely. However, I would tell you that when we try to estimate tax rate for a year, it is exactly that. And until we start to really see how the mix lays out for a year, we try to be as accurate as we can, but it's a pretty tough art. So I'd say, I think more significant now, Steve, would be kind of comparison to watch first, second, third and fourth because we've got a better view as to how the mix is really laying out this year. So if you want to call that forecast there, I guess I'd put it more in that category. On the issue of regional markets, I think it remains to be seen kind of how the year plays out. I think you're right historically, we've had slightly higher margins here in the U.S. But what's happened really as we begin to mature our margins around the world, that's not as true as it would have been if you went back, say, 4 or 5 years ago. But little early in the year still. We're pleased with those 32% incrementals in the first quarter. But as I tried to highlight in my comments, there seems to be a little bit more uncertainty in kind of global growth rates this year than there was, say, a year ago, and we'll try to kind of have that in hand as we think about these forecasts as well.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Understood, okay. And a quick follow-up on the Electrical business. It looks good outgrowth in Electrical North America, not so much in Electrical Rest of World. Maybe just flesh that out a little bit, and I'll pass it on.","Alexander M. Cutler","Sure. And here in North America, I think what you're -- or in the Americas, what I think what you're continuing to see is our very strong position here in these markets. I think it gave us the ability going back almost 2 years ago to predict when we'd see the non-res turn. We also had a very good quarter in terms of the large data center business in both on a booking and a shipment basis, so we're very pleased with that. Our service business, quite strong as well. In the Rest of World, that number is exactly the same number as you saw in the fourth quarter. And remember, a piece of that, this year-to-year, is still the solar piece so we would look for that to significantly reduce in terms of undergrowth as we move into the second quarter.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Sandy, can you just flesh out a little more on what you're seeing in the data center market? In the past, you've given us some granularity around kind of different sizes of product. Any color there would be helpful.","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, it's always a couple different elements that are flowing through there in terms of it's never as simple as one top line item. But I would say that for those of you who've been watching server sales in the first quarter, it was a little slower and so the IT channel pretty flat really through this first quarter versus a year ago. If you start to look into some of the bigger data centers, of course it always depends upon what an individual competitor wins. We had quite a good quarter, so our orders were up very significantly in that area based upon a number of really good wins. I'd say the middle part of the market, which deals with sort of small to medium business, not as robust as one might think, but I think that's a reflection of kind of this caution that's out there in some areas of the marketplace at this point. So we were very pleased with, again, our continued strong share performance in there. But I would say low end of the market, a little flatter; high end of the market, some good opportunities, but you got to win them. And then for those of you who had the chance to attend our session where we talked specifically about data centers last year, you saw some of the capabilities we've got and some of the thermal management capabilities and that's beginning to come on quite well as well.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And then just shifting to Aero. Looking at your commercial business collectively, so excluding defense, is your OE aftermarket mix in Q1 indicative of what we're going to see over the balance of the year or is it going to shift more towards OE as the year progresses?","Alexander M. Cutler","No, I think this is relatively indicative of what you're going to see this year because some of these ramps have occurred at this point, and we're very pleased that, some of you saw the tornado damage that occurred to a primary feeder in the U.S. commercial aerospace a week or 2 ago and they seem to have come through that a whole lot better. So we're not hearing any kind of changes at this point in terms of production rates. But again, I'd say this quarter was very much in line, top line and margin-wise to our expectations this year.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And then just finally for Rick, and I'll pass it on. Maybe it's my forecasting error, to use your term, but pension OPEB was lower than I was dialing in. Is Q1 indicative of the run rate for the year?","Richard H. Fearon","We still, Jeff, believe that our estimate of pension increase this year that we gave in January is accurate. The pension number bounces around slightly quarter-to-quarter mainly because of changes in lump sum settlement. But for the year, we continue to believe our estimate.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions. One, I'd be interested to hear your comments on -- you talked about the push out in overseas markets getting better now. You don't expect it happening in Q3 and more Q4. What gives you that confidence? And are there any markets that are better or worse than you thought? And then my last question, did you get any -- one of the big themes for the first quarter everyone's talking about is potentially the benefit from warmer weather than usual. Did you see that in any of your businesses? And I guess with raising the North America forecast, I just wonder if Q1 was a little better than we thought for that reason. And I'll get back in queue after that.","Alexander M. Cutler","Sure. Let me take the second one first here, Jamie. Generally, the warmer weather would be an impact, I would guess, in 2 areas: number one, it would affect construction activity, which would fall most heavily into our Electrical Americas business. We really didn't see dramatically different pull-forwards, and I'm guessing it'll be a couple of quarters before we've got enough look-back data to really understand that. We have heard a number of people say in earnings conference calls over the last couple weeks that they saw their bookings slow down as they went through the quarter and some have referenced that to the fact that January and February were unusually strong because of good weather, so March wasn't as much. We did not see a slowdown as we went through the quarter, so that's not our experience. I would say secondly, some people have said that the warmer weather put more people in retail showrooms, and in our case that would have an impact in terms of Automotive. We saw pretty good activity through the quarter. And while I think some estimates got a little over-baked for March in terms of how high retail sales might be, it was still a very, very good month. So for us, we don't think that was a big item, but I would have to tell you I think we probably have to get away from this for a couple of quarters to be able to give you a good perspective. In terms of the Rest of the World markets, we had originally thought that some of the easing activity that was going to go on, let me speak first to China, would have a little stronger -- or a little quicker, let me say, impact. You did see some PMI numbers this morning that some are interpreting to be less negative, I guess I'd put it that way, versus more positive and that they feel that, that's beginning of a floor developing. We're hopeful that, that is right. It just appears that with the change in leadership, with a bunch of other issues that are going on with China, perhaps this focus hasn't been as laser-like on turning things and that's why we've moved it out a quarter. We don't think it's getting weaker. We just don't see -- have not seen the kind of legs to say, boy, we really feel comfortable it's going to be there by the very beginning of the third quarter. Similarly, in Europe, I think just, again, we listened this weekend and we all here have heard the issues about the challenge in the Netherlands. This is a tough problem, and we had been forecasting for some time that we thought this would be a recession that was 3 quarters long. Many others said 2 quarters. We're now saying we think it could be as much as a year so that it would be fourth quarter of last year and first, second and third of this year before we start to see it rebuilt. We can't put any decimal point precision on these forecasts. I mean these are 2 weak areas, 2 big complex environments. And I think the good news from an investor point of view for Eaton is that we can raise our guidance by having assumed there's another quarter of weakness in those 2 big regions and I think that gives you a feel for how strong our U.S. businesses are.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from David Raso with the ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","On your international outlook, I'm just interested that you took down Electrical Rest of World, Truck and Automotive, but you kept Hydraulics the same. What's distinguishing the Hydraulic international outlook from the other businesses?","Alexander M. Cutler","It's held up a little bit better in Europe and part of that -- part of what's been going on within there is it's the machine build side has seemed to hold up a little bit better there whereas it does not serve the residential, commercial construction business to that degree. So again, I wouldn't put high decimal points behind this. It is hard to forecast in these markets that are going through kind of what I call fundamental economic weakness. But that's our best estimate, David.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly on Truck, and if you said it, I apologize, I missed it. Your full year outlooks, how they were adjusted, say, for Brazil Truck and China Truck. And particularly, with the Euro 5 truck now being built in Brazil, what's your feel from down there right now on the emission changeover? What do we think?","Alexander M. Cutler","Well, I think it was interesting. I was in Brazil, David, and I can't remember whether it was January or February. And at that point, people were fairly bullish. I've been talking to truck manufacturers about how fast they would burn their inventory. What became clear is that the -- or clearer is that their optimism was perhaps a little bit more than was -- proved itself out because what we saw happen was while people were being optimistic, their production rates were dropping, as we said, by some 31%. We think it takes them well through the second quarter to start to get this to come back up. So we've dropped our forecast of the truck and bus production in South America. And I don't know, Rick, if you got that difference there.","Richard H. Fearon","Dave, we're, right now, looking at full year truck and bus production in Brazil to be down about 10%, so much less than the first quarter. But yes, previously, we were expecting it to be flat to just down a small amount.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And I know you're not huge in China, but do you have a China thought process from what it was and what it is?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, it hasn't changed dramatically for us because as we had forecasted China. Last year was a weaker year after they had, had the boom year the previous year and we were not predicting a big, big snapback for this year.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sandy, maybe you can give a little bit more color on Hydraulics in a different way. I mean, you talked about the bookings declining 15% and that the OEMs are just sort of filling their backlogs. What kind of visibility do you have into the hydraulics market as you go throughout the year? I mean you did raise your Hydraulics forecast a little bit even with the decline in bookings.","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, we get -- and of course the question is always the visibility versus what's the likelihood of a change. And so the visibility, we get very good forecasts from our major OEMs and they go out 6 months-plus. I think the bigger issue, as we learned in 2008, is that those forecasts can change. That is not what we're seeing right now. What we've seen and that's why we started a little bit to express this concisely is that a year ago we were still seeing the over 2-month out time period being filled in as OEMs were rebuilding their backlog, their commitments. They were trying to forecast material requirements to us. And it had gotten quite short if you went back into the 2008 and early 2009 time period. That's changed and so now what we're seeing is handsome growth as you're seeing on our top line, but it's not the double-digit growth that we were seeing of last year. And we saw some big fill-ins in the first quarter last year to get that backlog filled out. So we think that the bookings are very adequate to be able to meet our kind of volume expectations this year, but we're not seeing that big year-over-year issue. Conversely, on the other side, I'd say the distributor area, although stronger from that point of view, is that they never built what you'd call distant backlogs and so they are not experience year-over-year weakness.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, Sandy. And maybe if I could ask you about the acquisition landscape. I mean we've seen a couple larger acquisitions from you recently in Hydraulics. What about the other markets then within Hydraulics? Are buyers and sellers getting closer together this year? Is that what we're seeing?","Alexander M. Cutler","No, and you may recall the comment that I made last year in our third quarter conference calls where I said that after world GDP kind of crashed in terms of people's forecasts in that late July, early August time period, that we felt what probably was occurring in many acquisition negotiations around the world is buyers and sellers had come apart because the buyers immediately recalibrated forward value and the sellers were holding on to what they thought was there beforehand. I do think that's come back together. We've had a period of time now of 6, almost 9 months for people to recalibrate where they think growth is and it's not just Eaton. I think you're seeing a number of companies that are starting to get more transactions now. We're really pleased with these 2. Our strategy remains the same. We're trying to add acquisitions in our Aerospace, our Hydraulics and our Electrical business and we remain focused upon that and our cash flow's been allowing us to do. So and these 2 really add some terrific capabilities to put us into markets that will, we think, be advantageous for Eaton.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question is from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sandy, just a kind of philosophical question, I guess. You changed your outlook -- revenue outlook for 5 of the 6 businesses, 3 down, 2 up versus a year ago you were taking up your outlook for 3 of the businesses. I'm just curious, on the flip side, you remain confident in your market growth. Are we at a point in the cycle where there can be less -- there can only be less confidence in market growth going forward because things are changing so quickly?","Alexander M. Cutler","No, I don't think so, Ann. I think we remain convinced that a lot of the drivers that are the primary sources of growth in our markets remain exactly the same. That energy costs are getting more expensive, that regulations are really also helping to drive that speed of technology adoption and it doesn't matter whether it's an emerging nation or a developed nation. So that basic theme for investing in Eaton, that energy costs are going to continue to drive technology, innovation and adoption and that we're well positioned, I think, is very much intact. I think what you are seeing is that in response to 2 different issues: One, I think the government spending crunch in Europe and how they work their way through that process, that has meant that Europe has been more challenging during this time period. And I think in China, I think you're going through a fundamental change as they're trying to move themselves to an economy that's got more balance in the -- from the consumer side or the consumption side and not strictly in investment-based economy, which has obviously served them well for 20 years. Having said that, you've all traveled to China. You know where the construction and the additional electrical capacity, the roads, agriculture is going on, and there are huge parts of China that still need to have that type of investment made and that's generally true in most of these emerging nations. What we're intrigued by, in addition, is that the U.S. market where people would have traditionally said, gee, that's going to be one of the slower growing markets right now, it actually is growing pretty darn well in a number of our markets as you can see by our forecast. So no, we continue to think there's very strong growth. Nothing has changed our view of the fact that we can grow at the top line 12% to 14% per year. I think you're seeing a demonstration of our ability to acquire advantageously during these time periods as well as to grow our sales organically.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then a more tactical question. I noticed that Eaton was present at the automotive suppliers group meeting last week to address the potential lack of resin for both automotive and truck. Can you talk about what you're seeing there and what's happening, what's developing in terms of explosion in the German resin factory?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. Ann, we're aware of the issues. We've not seen any changes at this point from our customers. But I guess I would point to 2 other kind of parallel issues that have happened over the last couple years just to kind of put it in perspective. When the really tragic, tragic disaster happened in Japan, I think there was an overreaction to what was going to happen to global automotive production SOA. What we found is the supply chain scrambled. There's a lot of global capacity that was put in place or utilized in a different way. And that turned out to be way overblown. And I think in terms of Thailand, while it did hit certain parts of the electronics industries, it didn't hit the whole industry. And so I don't mean to be Pollyannish about this, but we've not seen changes from our customers at this point and there are alternatives in this area. And I think we'll see how this works through by the time we get to the end of the second quarter.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So stay tuned, I guess, is the...","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, I think that's appropriate.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","One clarification, and you talked about the second quarter versus the first quarter. You said it's all explained by incremental volume. The implication is that we're going to see a similar tax rate in pension and ForEx for the first quarter, is that what you're telling us at this point?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. Eli, it's right. The tax rate should be broadly the same. There may be very small differences. But overall, we think that those items you cited will be about the same.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And again, for the year...","Alexander M. Cutler","ForEx. The issue, Eli, so we don't confuse you on the ForEx because the $100 million number that I mentioned for ForEx in the second quarter is a year-to-year, so that's second quarter 2011 to 2012. The $200 million to $300 million of volume with almost no ForEx involved is a Q2 2012 to Q1 2012.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And can we talk a little bit about the sensitivity of the numbers because I'm sure it's going to come up. We went from the emerging markets turning in the midyear, now the third and fourth quarter. What would be the impact or can you just broadly summarize if the emerging markets really don't turn much and Europe doesn't turn much in the fourth quarter because those are the 2 -- it sounds like 2 assumptions and the probability that they could not turn, so we're still -- what kind of sensitivity that might be for the year?","Alexander M. Cutler","Well, I think maybe a way to think about that, Eli, is that our sales in the first quarter were approximately 23% from emerging nations. And so if you made the assumption that 23% of the company's sales didn't get 1% or 2% recovery in them, I think that might give you a sense for it.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And one final question. You've kept your truck number at 300,000 for the year in North America. And the orders have been a little bit softer from that annual rate for the last 3 to 6 months. And more importantly with 78,000 from the first quarter and probably 81,000 on the schedule in the second quarter, you're overproducing even at 300,000 rate. Can you talk about -- I mean, there's got to be some production cuts coming just to bring the rate down even to 300,000. Do you have some idea where do we see the decision points and what kind of outlook, some color of what's going on in the marketplace because it looks like the 300,000 could be a little bit in jeopardy by 10,000 and 20,000 units.","Alexander M. Cutler","Well, and clearly, what was out there in terms of the production schedules were numbers that were well above 300,000. And I think that's the piece that perhaps has been missing a little bit in people's analysis is that the production cuts, in our mind, are bringing it down closer to the 300,000. There's still over 300,000. And a number of the announcements that have gotten a lot of publicity for the second quarter were necessary to get production numbers down from sort of mid-80,000 numbers down to numbers that made a little bit more sense in light of where we are in the first quarter and where bookings have been. So I think perhaps, again, the original production schedules were maybe a little bit more bullish. They were more bullish than our forecasts, and they're coming into line with our forecasts.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess somewhat back on Eli's emerging market question, on the Electrical Rest of World initiatives, if my math is right, you incurred approximately $0.02 hit in the first quarter. Is there an all-in impact for 2012 that you could share? In other words, do you expect the benefit to offset the cost?","Alexander M. Cutler","It's in our margin guidance for the year, Andy. We'd said we took those actions early in the first quarter and those were intended to be able to set up our margins for this year.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, because I'm just -- like Eli, I guess I'm wondering what impact the push out of the non-U.S. recovery has given that you kind of kept unchanged the 2012 operational performance.","Alexander M. Cutler","Well, we dropped the margin expectation full year for 0.5 point in our Electrical Rest of World based upon the fact that we saw a whole quarter move out. And so we've not calculated precisely what if the fourth quarter didn't occur. But we think this represents our best thinking at this point in terms of -- but we recognize people can have different opinions of when they think Europe will begin to stabilize or when Asia might stabilize. I think the numbers this morning, it's interesting to listen to people's reactions to the PMI numbers that came out this morning because they're still not great numbers, but you got about half the world that's looking at them saying not great numbers and about half the world seems to be looking and saying, well, gee, they're less bad so that's good. So this is a hard time to call that.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then could you give a little more, like, granularity back on the 2 Electrical segments? In response to an earlier question, you've indicated you did not see any orders deteriorate for Electrical Americas through the quarter. Was it more evenly spread or did you see any acceleration? And then within Electrical Rest of World, that 6% decrease for the bookings, was there any deterioration through the quarter for that one, particularly in Europe?","Alexander M. Cutler","No. Actually, it strengthened slightly as we went through the quarter. And I'd say that the issue, remember again in our Electrical business is that the first quarter is the weakest quarter of the year. That's true whether that is our Americas segment or whether it's Rest of World. And there are 2 reasons for that: one is that construction-weather relationship, which is typically worse in the first quarter; second is that the IT reseller channel tends to be weaker in the first quarter than the other quarters and that laid out as well -- this year as well.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a few housekeeping items. Just can you reconcile lower end-market assumptions for Auto, Truck and keeping the margins? And then just secondly, on the Hydraulics deals, are those neutral to margins overall? And then if you have a free cash flow number for 1Q, that'd be great.","Alexander M. Cutler","In terms of the Hydraulics, nothing material change from that. If you recall, they added about -- we added $0.05 to our guidance this year from SEL, which will be in the numbers for a longer time period. But no, we're not changing our earnings guidance for that segment even with those 2 added in this year. Rick, you want to pick up the...","Richard H. Fearon","Yes, on the free cash flow, because of the large pension contribution, Jeff, that we made in total, we invested about $330 million of pension, $305 million of which was in the U.S. qualified plan. We ended up with a minus $200 million free cash flow number. Now if you'll recall, normally, we're relatively neutral in the first quarter absent pension-type costs. And so if you take out pension, it was a pretty reasonable quarter.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on Auto, Truck margins, why not tweak those down, just given the lower market assumptions?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. And what we saw there is it wasn't enough really to move our margins significantly there, Jeff; not to say that if you didn't get further type of weakness, it might hit them. But the big jump in the U.S. activity here in Automotive, in particular, is it allowed us to really hold those margins. And then in Truck, it just didn't move them enough at this point.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sandy, I wonder if you'd talk about where you see some potential upside in the model at this point? I guess, specifically, I'm interested in your incremental margin at the segment level. You commented on 32% versus 28% guidance for the year. That guidance did not change. Maybe you could comment what you're seeing on price cost in that mix as well.","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. And again, Terry, I guess I would put this in the category of we've finished the first quarter and there's a long time to go obviously in the year. But we're very pleased, as you mentioned, with the margins ran a little higher in the first quarter. A bunch of that gets, unfortunately, eaten up by the slightly higher share count. And of course, that's our best forecast at this point as well. I think as we look at this 5% market and we look at the ForEx issue, these are our best estimates at this point. I still think a 28% full year incremental margin's an appropriate way for us to think about this. We do think there will be pressure on the euro, which is -- continues to be why we have that forecast out there. That's the biggest single currency year-to-year change for us. So that I think this range of earnings we've provided, the full range, is a reasonable way to think about the year at this point. We continue to think the outgrowth assumption makes good sense as well. And obviously, at a 14% overall earnings increase for the company we think we're forecasting a pretty robust year already.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on price costs, what are you seeing there in the first quarter? And how does that spread trend as you look forward?","Alexander M. Cutler","Very much in line with what our guidance was. You'll recall that on the whole price cost issue this year, we thought it would be largely neutral for us. We think that's the way it's playing out. We obviously are trying to be sure that with our customers that we're watching this for their benefit as well, so we're not looking to significantly widen these margins at this point from what our guidance is.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, then just on the outgrowth in Electrical Americas, was that all on the data comp side or did you see some in other areas?","Alexander M. Cutler","No, no. That's a number that covers everything we're involved in. And of course, remember the Americas, that's from Canada all the way down to Argentina. So it's all those countries. But no, we've had a very successful quarter again with major activity in oil and gas, wastewater treatment. These are markets that are continuing to do quite well. Utilities got its head up and moving. And we're pleased -- we've been a very strong player in residential. We've rode that down as that went down. We now are getting to see it finally, it seems like it's been a very long time, starting to come back as well. So no, it's well balanced across the whole power distribution as well as the Power Quality segments.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, maybe a longer-term competitive question. Fair bit of chatter about automated transmissions penetrating markets in Truck on a longer-term basis. Can you give us your updated view there?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. No, our view again is that these markets are very different as you go around the world and has a lot to do with the duty cycle of what the driver is driving. So that our cross-highway applications here in the U.S., very long runs, that our confident [ph] our transmission still gives you the best efficiency, which is the big driver in terms of what's going on in terms of fuel efficiency. If you get into the medium-duty markets and that, for some time, has been a market that has had significant conversion here and obviously elsewhere over to automated transmissions. Very different when you get into an area like Europe where you've got much shorter hauls and that's why the automated transmission is used as the predominant transmission in that arena. Our share is very strong here in the Americas, speaking directly to your question, and we think we've got competitive product that addresses not only the traditional mechanical, but also the automated transmission.","Donald H. Bullock","The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question on Europe. X inverters, what is -- what would you say the European market did in the quarter?","Alexander M. Cutler","And which market are you speaking about?","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just overall for the company. Just trying to get the sense where Europe is for Eaton because I understand there are different dynamics, as I said, particular x the inverter business.","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, very different if you go through our individual segments. I'd say we still think that the European market's down on the order of 7% or 8% kind of broadly on Electrical. I think you see that in terms of a number of peers who are reporting there as well. Again, it's x the Middle East, which some people include and some people don't include. It's pretty much across the construction markets as well as the industrial markets. And Europe held up a little bit better from a hydraulics point of view during this quarter as you saw some mobile activity continuing to hold it up a little bit stronger. And then the truck market, we're really not big players in the European truck market. We did, and back to an earlier question in terms of automotive, we've become a little less positive on the European automotive market this year and that was in our forecast as to why that number turned down as part of the overall Rest of World.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. And just a follow-up, on Auto profitability, you stated -- you highlighted lower profitability on new capacity in China. I apologize if I had missed it, but what is going on there and what is the implication for auto profitability in China going forward?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, Andrew, in the first quarter conference call back in January, we commented that we're adding a facility that ends -- that adds significant additional capacity for engine valves and the whole valve actuation capability. That plant we incurred about a 1 point negative on our profitability for the fourth quarter, normal start-up costs that happened again here in the first quarter and we think will happen in the second quarter. We continue to do quite well in China. The business is growing quickly. That's why we're adding the capacity, so we're very pleased with that and we still think our overall 12% segment margin is the right guidance for the segment full year. So obviously, we pick up from the level that we're at of just over 10% here in the first quarter.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Auto profitability for you in China despite slowdown in volumes remains pretty good?","Alexander M. Cutler","We've still got a very attractive business there.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Robert Baird.","Robert F. McCarthy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on Hydraulics. I was surprised to hear you describe distribution as flat. Wonder if you could talk about that within the context of your expectations for the full year? And is that influenced by having a higher proportion of foreign OE sales that go through distribution?","Alexander M. Cutler","And this was a characterization. You said the foreign OE sales?","Robert F. McCarthy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Well, when you were talking about the Hydraulics segment and bookings being down 15%, et cetera, you mentioned that distribution was flat, then you came back to it again talking about how distribution's holding up better. No growth, though, despite the fact that you got this positive end-market shift going on, more favorable U.S. So that I thought is of interest. And then beyond that, I assume that you do some of your OE business through distribution and I wondered if that could be influencing the overall number?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, there -- I got your question. Thank you, Robert. There is a portion of small OEM business that does go through distribution. And yes, the construction side of that is have -- is pulling it down, so if you were to pull out mobile and look within distribution, yes, it's not flat.","Robert F. McCarthy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And my other question really goes to a different question about conservatism and how you're thinking about the rest of the year. There is, of course, some dependence in the U.S. on deteriorating and weaker in your outlook for economic growth, especially in the EU, but -- in the developing countries. So I mean, can we assume that you could have justified stronger numbers yet for the Americas? And -- but you're being cautious because of the potential for a knock-on effect or is it simply that you're not seeing a knock-on effect so you're not yet worrying about that?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, we've not really seen a huge frictional kind of down from it, if you will. And I think you're still seeing that U.S. exports are holding up pretty darn well. It's been a strength point in the economy and so our best estimate is that these numbers, which are pretty strong numbers when you look at 9% growth for the Americas, are very appropriate outlook at this point.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to touch back on Electrical Rest of World margins if we could. I guess to hold the incrementals at 28% or I guess at a target of 28% for the rest of the year, with Truck hitting tough comps, certainly strong growth and easier comps in Electrical Americas in the first half, help me understand how incrementals look in Rest of the World as we play through the year and kind of get past some of these solar tariffs? Is it an issue of getting some of that systems business that you talked to at the Analyst Day or is there something else at work there that I need to appreciate in terms of the margin trajectory in the back half?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. No, I wouldn't pick out any one product line or any one region. Our overall guidance of 28% for the company for segment margins is after that I think we've got a very good and strong first quarter, we still think is appropriate. The key, really, in Electrical Rest of World segment at this point is to begin to recover a volume levels and that comes from 2 issues: One, we will not have the large year-to-year decline in the solar business because the second quarter last year is the first quarter it really dropped in whereas the first quarter we still have very robust volumes. And then the second piece would be when we start to see Europe and China, in particular, within Asia Pacific, start to stabilize and not have this kind of year-to-year overall volume growth. Our best estimate is that we begin to start to see that occur really in the fourth quarter, so that -- and that's tied to this overall forecast we've discussed in regard to several questions this morning about when does Europe really kind of flatten and start to stabilize and the same true for China.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","I guess what I'm trying to get at is when those markets normalize, stabilize, recover, however you want to term it, do we lever above, at or below kind of that average for the corporation as a whole? In Rest of World?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, I guess we'll have to wait and see, Josh, pretty specific. And our expectation is that the business is going to perform at that 28%. Its actual decrementals were significantly better than that in this quarter. So I think that you get a feel for how effectively expenses are being controlled.","Donald H. Bullock","Our next question comes from Brian Rayle with Northcoast Research.","Brian Michael Rayle - Northcoast Research","Most of my questions have been answered. I guess if we could just look at the North American electrical equipment improvement of guidance of increasing it 1%. How could you kind of look at what was coming from sort of a new construction increase and new orders coming in versus sort of the traditional sort of restructuring, remodeling business?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, most of what you're seeing here, Brian, is I think it's being driven by maybe 3 fundamental issues: the nonresidential put in place construction, that's new construction being up almost 10%. That's a big driver. Secondly would be the new activity going on in the power quality activity and a new data center. That's new construction. Our service business was quite strong in the quarter, but part of that is it's really not remodeling as much as that tends to be keeping people's equipment really safe and electrically efficient during the time period. I'd say the remodeling activity that many people are talking about now really pertains more to the residential segment where you're seeing a lot of kind of the do-it-yourself, fix-up-your-home activity. That's a portion of residential. But remember residential is less than 10% of our business. So I'd say most of what you're seeing driven here is new construction, new economic activity.","Donald H. Bullock","We'll be taking another -- one additional question. And then as always, we'll be available at the end of the day to follow up with any other questions that you might have. Our last question of the day comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Sandy, you've talked about the broadening of demand in nonresidential construction. I'm wondering if you can talk specifically about what you're seeing on the commercial side and what your expectations are for the balance of the year and maybe even into 2013 if you have visibility there.","Alexander M. Cutler","Sure. And let me just share a couple of numbers with you if you haven't had a chance to see these. U.S. private put in place, non-resi construction up, as we said, 10%. The commercial and health care structure segment was up almost 5%. Office was up almost 3%; health care, 5%; other commercial, 6%. That is the segment that has been particularly weak over the last 2.5 years. Manufacture structures, up 29%; power and communications, up 15%; mining structures shaft and wells, up 8%. Now you get into nonresidential structures like amusement and recreation, up 25%. This is a pretty broad recovery. And I've heard characterizations over the last couple of months and people don't think things are being built in the U.S. from a construction point of view. This is put in place and so this is what we saw coming in the bookings last year when we talked about we thought this market would be up because we tend to see the bookings out ahead of when it's actually put in place. Our very solid bookings of 6% in the first quarter are indication to us that we're going to continue to see this kind of build in nonresidential construction. So again, we're not forecasting 15% year-on-year-on-year growth, but we are seeing a broad-based recovery in nonresidential construction in the United States. And that is a very important driver of our Electrical Americas business.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, and that's why I was asking is I know you guys see those orders before they come out in that construction put-in-place data. So I was wondering if you are seeing continued strength on the commercial side?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes, we are. And the good news is that instead of its being in just 1 or 2 of these segments, it is pretty broad-based. And so whether this is petrochem driving it, whether it's wastewater treatment, whether it's health care driving it, whether it's utility driving it or whether it's the more commercial building activity and happening with office construction and if I could take a jump over to non-res -- to res construction for a minute, these rent increases that are beginning to impact rental apartments are obviously starting to drive construction in that segment as well. And so it's been quite some time in coming, but we think it is coming at this point.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And one quick follow-up on Electrical Rest of World. With demand maybe not being as strong as you'd previously thought it was, are you seeing any pressure on the pricing environment; like are you seeing any pressure on margins from competitive pricing from yourself, competitors, et cetera?","Alexander M. Cutler","Yes. I'd say things are always competitive out there and I'd say it's not different than what was reflected in our guidance for this year. And I think we are continuing to look at those opportunities to keep our own cost structure extremely competitive and that's part of the actions we took in the first quarter. And then we talked a little bit about in our New York meeting in terms of taking costs in the first quarter, taking actions in the first quarter, that would really allow us to size the business appropriately and we think we've taken those actions now.","Donald H. Bullock","Thank you, all, for joining us today. And as I said before, we will be available for additional follow-up questions for the remainder of the day and the rest of this week. So thank you very much for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. Also, as a reminder, today's teleconference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Don Bullock. Please go ahead, sir.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Good morning. I'm Don Bullock, for those of you who don't know me. I'm Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. I want to thank you all for joining us for our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call.","With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO, and Rick Fearon, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. As is typical, our agenda today is going to include opening remarks by Craig, highlighting our performance in the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2017. As has also been our previous practice in past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments.","The press release for our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation do include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. And a webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay for those of you who will not be able to listen to the whole call.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments today do include statements related to expected future results and are therefore considered forward-looking statements. The actual results may differ from those and from our forecasted projections due to a number and range of risks and uncertainties that we describe in both our earnings release, the presentation, or are outlined in the 10-K. With all of that, I'll turn it over to Craig.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thanks, Don, appreciate it. Hey, let me begin by saying that we're really pleased with our fourth quarter results. Our net income and operating EPS was $1.12 versus our guidance of $1.05, to $1.15, $1.10 midpoint. Our revenues were down 4%, 3% organically, and our organic growth was slightly better, actually, than our forecast, but it was more than offset by weaker FX. Segment margins were 14.6%, but 16.3% excluding restructuring. So our teams really executed well and did a nice job of controlling costs in the quarter.","As noted, our restructuring costs in the quarter were $90 million, up $66 million from our prior guidance. This represents an acceleration of approximately $70 million of restructuring actions that were previously planned for Q1 2017 into Q4. Now, we made this decision to accelerate our restructuring spending in the quarter after we determined that we'd have $70 million of other income in Q4 from resolving a number of insurance matters. These matters primarily relate to past expenses, where we were able to finally reach an agreement with our insurers. This was a significant accomplishment by our team, as some of these matters go back multiple years.","Operating cash flow was $638 million in the quarter. This includes a $100 million contribution into our U.S. qualified pension plan. And as a result, our operating cash flow was $2.6 billion for the year. In addition, we purchased $163 million of stock in the quarter, bringing our total repurchases to $730 million for the year, or 2.6% of outstanding shares at the beginning of the year.","Turning to page 4, we have a couple of unusual items in the quarter, so we thought it would be helpful to create a bridge reconciling the midpoint of our EPS guidance with our actual results of $1.12 a share. Organic revenues were modestly better, as I noted, than \u2013 up from our expectations. Recall that we guided a sequential organic decline of 1.5% from Q3, and so that added a couple of cents. Negative currency had a $0.01 negative impact on the quarter, largely based upon strength in the U.S. dollar. Our operating performance was better than expected, and that added $0.01.","Next we had two offsetting items: The income from the insurance matters added $70 million or $0.14. And, as I noted, we took this opportunity provided by the insurance income to accelerate restructuring actions of $70 million in the quarter, and that was a $0.14 negative. We'll go through restructuring in more detail later in the presentation, but this acceleration of restructuring costs does reduce what we expect to spend in 2017. So on balance, we think $1.12 represents solid performance during the quarter, a period where we continue to experience weakness in our end markets.","And taking a quick look at the income statement, I'd note that organic revenue decline was driven primarily by continued weakness in industrial projects in the oil and gas market, construction equipment and NAFTA heavy duty truck. And as you'll see later in the presentation, organic revenues in the quarter declined in Vehicle, Hydraulics, and Electrical Systems and Services as a result. Against those conditions, we put up very solid operating performance in the quarter, with segment margins of 16.3%, excluding restructuring costs. And despite a 4% decline in revenue, we were able to increase margins by 30 basis points, excluding restructuring costs in the quarter. So we think once again strong performance. And our overall restructuring spending of $90 million in the quarter, with $83 million of that in the segments, and we'll certainly provide more details in subsequent slides on restructuring.","Let me begin my segment comments with Electrical Products. Revenues were flat year on year, up 1% organically in spite of continued weakness in industrial markets. Areas where we saw notable sales growth included lighting, residential products and fuses. And areas of weakness was really in single-phase UPS and also in industrial controls. Orders were up 3%, a sequential improvement of 1% from Q3. We saw order strength in the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region. And in the Americas, product areas that experienced solid growth were residential products, lightning, and in Asia-Pacific in our power quality business. Operating margins were once again very strong at 18.4%, and excluding restructuring costs, margins were a healthy 19.4%.","Page 7 covers our Electrical Systems and Services businesses, where revenues were down some 3%, and down 2% organically versus Q4 2015. Areas of strength included commercial assemblies, engineering services, and three-phase PQ. And areas of weakness continued to include large industrial assemblies and oil and gas related projects. Orders were down 7% in the quarter, a couple points worse than we experienced in Q3, where orders were down some 5%. Here the pattern of weakness is really unchanged. In the Americas, it's large industrial projects and oil and gas that remain weak, and areas of strength included Asia-Pacific, particularly in power distribution projects, and we too experienced the China surge that other companies have referenced. Operating margins were 12.2%, and excluding restructuring costs, margins were 14.2%, slightly better than last year.","On slide 8, revenue in our Hydraulics businesses was down 6%, 5% organically, and this was a small improvement from Q3, where revenues were down 6% organically. Sales decline in the quarter was led by stationary sales, with particular weakness and oil and gas. Distribution and OEM sales were down about the same amount. We did, however, see order growth in the quarter, up some 8%, with strength in orders in mobile OEMs. And distribution orders were also up modestly in the quarter. Operating margins in the quarter were 7.1% but heavily impacted some 440 basis points by the acceleration of restructuring costs. Excluding restructuring, our margins were 11.5%, and we're pleased with the progress the business is making in general and the level of profitability, given these the historic lows of market activities. So we continue to believe that the business is on track and confident that we'll achieve our near- and long-term margin objectives for the business.","In Aerospace, sales in Q4 were down 3%, and 100% of this decline was the result of foreign exchange strength of the U.S. dollar. And I'd also note that revenues in the quarter were negatively impacted by 3% due to weaker nonrecurring engineering billing. These are the engineering costs that we incur that are subsequently reimbursed by customers. In addition, we continue to see weakness in the bizjet market, as you've heard from others. Orders in the quarter were down 1% on weakness in bizjet and military fighters. Areas of strength continue to be commercial military transports and military rotorcraft. Operating margins were a healthy 19.8%, and excluding restructuring costs, margins were 20%, the same as Q3.","In looking at the Vehicle segment, organic revenues were down 12% on weakness in commercial vehicle production, largely in the U.S. Specifically, NAFTA Class 8 truck production in the quarter was down some 34% versus Q4 of 2015. Retail light vehicle markets were flat in the U.S., with modest growth in Europe and significant strength in China.","On another positive note, we're encouraged to see that we think what was a return to growth in Latin America, with most of our served markets posting year-on-year growth. Operating margins were 13.1%, and excluding restructuring costs, 14.8%. For 2017, we expect NAFTA heavy-duty truck market to be flat with 2016, and we expect modest growth in global light vehicle markets really around the world. We also expect to see growth in the Brazilian vehicle market in 2017.","Turning our attention back to the company's overall results, slide 11 provides a summary of our full-year restructuring costs incurred in 2016. Now, as you recall, our prior guidance for 2016 included $145 million in restructuring costs for the year. And as we've discussed and shown here, we had $70 million of income in Q4 from insurance matters, which was not included in our guidance. As a result, we decided to move forward some of the restructuring actions planned for 2017 into the fourth quarter. This action took our restructuring to $90 million for the quarter, up some $24 million from what we originally had in our guidance. The $90 million was comprised of $20 million of spending from our original actions, down $4 million due to lower costs needed to complete those same actions, plus $70 million from actions we accelerated from 2017 into 2016. And as a result, we incurred, as you can see here, $211 million of restructuring costs in 2016. So, overall, we're pleased with the progress that we've made on these initiatives, and we continue to deliver slightly better benefits on slightly lower costs.","Slide 12 provides a detail summary of the $211 million of restructuring costs by segment, and as you can see, we're undergoing really significant restructuring in all segments, with the exception of Aerospace. The restructuring activities are particularly large in Hydraulics and Electrical Systems and Services, where markets have been weakest. In Vehicle, where we've been preparing for the next cyclical downturn, which is now upon us in truck North America; and in Electrical Products, where despite very strong margins, we simply have opportunities to be more efficient.","So as we close the books on 2016, we think it's worth taking a few moments to note some of the key highlights of the year. First, as we articulated during the year, a number of our end markets were weaker than we expected, and this resulted in organic revenues coming in some $200 million below the midpoint of our guidance. Foreign exchange was somewhat better than we expected and came in $100 million better than expected. We delivered on our sizable restructuring plan, which resulted in strong margin performance. Excluding restructuring, margins were 16%, up 20 basis points from 2015 on 5% lower revenue. Restructuring benefits were $210 million, and restructuring costs were $211 million, keeping this initiative well ahead of schedule.","We were disappointed that we missed our EPS commitment for the year. As you'll recall, our guidance was originally $4.30. Our actual results came in at $4.22 a share, down 2% from the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow in 2016 was strong, with free cash flow over net income at 107%, and our free cash flow over sales was 10.4%.","And we continued to use our strong cash flow to reward shareholders. We increased our dividend in February of 2016 and repurchased $730 million of our shares during the year. In addition, we paid down $240 million of debt in Q1 and contributed $100 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan in December. So on balance, I'd say a solid year of progress that's positioned the company well for 2017 and beyond.","So if we shift our focus to the outlook for 2017, here's a first look at our organic revenue growth expectations for the year. But before the numbers, maybe a little bit of context here. While we're hearing more optimistic commentary about markets and think we will see the introduction of government policies that are more growth-oriented, we're not yet seeing signs of this in our businesses, and so this guidance really reflects what we see today without changes in government policy.","In our Electrical Products business in the U.S., our expectations are that residential lighting will be up mid-single digit. We think single-phase and PQ will be flat, and we think industrial controls will be down low single-digit. In other geographies, we expect Europe and Asia-Pacific to be up low single digit, with Latin America up mid-single digit.","In Electrical Systems and Services, we expect to see another year of decline as a result of weak large-project activity and ongoing reductions in oil and gas. One bright spot is commercial assemblies, where we think it'll be up mid-single digit, but that's offset by industrial products, which we think will be down double digit. Harsh and hazardous down mid-single digit, with three-phase UPS down slightly.","In Hydraulics, we expect to see some modest growth as China improves, as well as other mobile equipment markets. Aerospace markets are expected to see slight growth, driven by commercial transport and aftermarket. And in Vehicle, as noted, we see the NAFTA Class 8 market being essentially flat, with modest growth in Brazil truck and ag equipment, and then slight growth in global vehicle markets around the world.","And with the noted growth expectations, page 15 shows our margin expectations for each of the businesses. And so I'm not going to read through every one of these, but these are the full-year margins including restructuring costs. And, as you can see, the midpoint of our guidance is 15.8% operating margins, up from 15% last year, and despite an assumption of generally flat markets, we continue to see margin improvement in each of our businesses.","Next, if we take a closer look at our restructuring program, you see that we're on track, spending less and projecting to have higher savings than we originally anticipated. This chart is a summary of how our restructuring program will impact earnings over the next couple of years. First, beginning with 2017, costs are expected to be $100 million, reflecting the $70 million of restructuring acceleration into 2016 at the end of the year. We also updated our cost estimates for 2017 actions, and it's coming in about $10 million lower than our prior estimate, and that's good news. And we expect $155 million of incremental benefits in 2017. In total, the program will deliver $266 million of incremental profits when you net off the lower spending and the higher savings.","For 2018, the program will deliver $175 million of incremental profits versus 2017, $75 million of incremental benefits and $100 million of lower spending. So as we wrap up the spending program in 2017, we think it's important to remember that we will have ongoing restructuring in the business in 2018. We expect to spend roughly $60 million a year of ongoing restructuring costs that will be embedded in the business results, and this spending is expected to result in $60 million of benefits, but spread over two years. And we've modeled this expectation, 2018 with $60 million of costs and $30 million of savings impacting that year.","Turning our attention to 2017, we expect operating EPS and net income per share to be between $4.30 and $4.60 a share, a 5% increase in operating EPS on flat revenue, and a 6% increase in net income per share. Our assumptions are as follows, and you can see them laid out here, but organic revenues are expected to be flat with 2016. We expect to see $300 million of negative FX, and we expect to see segment margins between 15.5% and 16.1% as a result of the items laid out and depicted here, $111 million of lower restructuring costs, $155 million of higher benefits, offset somewhat by some commodity headwinds that we're experiencing in the business, some $80 million of commodity headwinds. Now, this is due largely to the recent and rapid increase in commodity prices, and the lag that we will experience or expect to experience in our ability to offset this increase with price and other actions.","Corporate expenses are expected to be flat with 2016. We expect the tax rate to be 9.5% to 10.5%, up from 9.5% in 2016. And we expect another year of strong cash flow, with operating cash flows between $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion, and CapEx of $525 million. And we'll continue our share purchase program and expect to repurchase $750 million of our stock during the year. For Q1 2017, our guidance is we expect revenues to be down 3% versus Q1 of 2016, and about half of that is essentially organic declines, and about half of that is foreign exchange. Margins of 13.6% to 14%, driven by seasonally lower volumes, and as I mentioned, higher commodity prices in the first part of the year. Our tax rate, we think, will be 6% to 7%, lower than full-year expectations, largely due to some legal reorganizations that we expect to occur in Q1.","And finally, page 18 is a summary of our 2017 assumptions and expectations. We've covered each of these in prior pages already, so I'll save some time by not going back through them. Overall we think it's a sound plan that's reflective of the journey that we're on to improve the company while navigating in weak markets and think the company is in very good shape to deliver. So I'll stop here and turn it back to Don Bullock.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","If you have a question at this point, our operator will give you instructions for those of you who have questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Before we jump into the questions, I do want to make a couple of comments. If you would, please, given the time constraints today, if you would hold your questions to a single question and a single follow-up, to be sure we get through the number of people who have questions for us. Our first question today comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. And good morning, all. I wanted to just ask a couple questions, one on the tax side and one on Hydraulics. On the tax front, I think you're a net exporter from a finished goods perspective out of the U.S., but maybe give us a little more color there and then how you kind of still currently see the out-year tax rate coming together. You used to talk about 10%, or so, or maybe a little higher than that. And if you were to run through the current proposals Brady and Ryan have discussed, how are you thinking that might affect you?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Rick, do you want to grab that one?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Steve, let me jump in on that one. It's a very popular topic these days. First of all, let me just make the comment that it is really impossible to know what changes at the end of the day we're going to see in U.S. tax policy. As you well know, there are many different proposals and strong supporters of each proposal, and so how that sorts out, I really don't know.","But let me just say this: Without knowing the exact policy changes, if the policy that came in was something along the lines of a border adjustment tax, we believe the impact on us would not be significant, since we are balanced if you total up our imports. And we've recently been looking in some detail at this just to make sure we fully understand the numbers. But we're balanced when you total up the imports versus our direct and indirect exports. When I say indirect, we make a lot of parts that go into other assemblies, other people's products that are then exported. And so we believe the way it would come out, we would likely be able to get an offset for all of those exports. So we should be neutral.","Beyond that, there are proposals about interest limitations, (25:18) some of which would only have new interest limited. And so it's very hard to figure out what of the other proposals would come about. The one that seems to be getting the most attention is this border adjusted idea.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. Go ahead. Sorry.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","No. That was all I was going to say.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there for now. I mean, I know it is hard to tell, but I guess the only other question on that front is, if in fact just the rate side comes, ignoring the interest deductibility, given where your current rate is but your marginal impact in the U.S., you guys would still benefit from any kind of marginal reduction in the U.S., absent \u2013 all other things being equal; is that true?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes. Yeah, that is true, and so depending on how much the headline U.S. rate comes down, we would see some benefit in our overall rate.","And you did have one other part your question. Let me address that as well. And that is, we're a 9.5% to 10.5% as a guided rate for 2017, and I think you were wondering how that's likely to change into the future. But we continue to think that the rate it's likely to move up slowly, perhaps a point or so each year over the next few years. And so we don't really see any change to our prior guidance. Of course, subject to the rules not changing. As the rules change, it could have some impact. But, as I just said, we can't know exactly what the new rules are.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Craig, just on Hydraulics, after I think 10 quarters of negative year-on-year bookings growth, at least having a plus 8%, even if it's on an easier comp, do you think there's real sustainability here? And why aren't we yet hitting those \u2013 even the bottom end \u2013 of the through-the-cycle margins ex restructuring for next year?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, no, I'd say that, to your point, we too are optimistic and encouraged by the fact that we saw orders grow 8% in the quarter. This is the first quarter of growth in orders that we've seen in a long time, but it is only one data point. And so what we're looking at as we try to forecast what the revenues will be in our Hydraulics business in 2017, is we're obviously looking at lots of data points, including what many of our customers are saying. And so we think \u2013 we're very comfortable saying that we think we'll see very slight growth in Hydraulics during the course of the year. But at this point, we're not forecasting kind of the V-shaped recoveries that we have historically seen in this business. You never know. When these markets turn, they tend to turn hard and fast, but we're not yet in a position to call that turn.","With respect to margins, I would tell you that we're not finished, and we are in the midst of some pretty significant restructuring actions in our Hydraulics business, so still a lot of work to be done during the course of 2017. We still have not \u2013 you're right, we absolutely have reached new bottoms, and quite frankly, we've reached lower bottoms than we ever imagined that we would reach in the business. And so we're comfortable once fully completed that the business will in fact deliver the 13% that we articulated and committed to, but we're not yet finished with all the restructuring.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Morning, guys.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Morning.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","So, Craig, just in terms of the trends in ESS, when you're referring to the industrial projects and the oil and gas projects, I mean, you're referring to them as large projects, and those still being down. I mean, is there no, I guess, offset or any signs of improvement in smaller projects or MRO activity? Could you just maybe fill that out a little bit?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, no. We, in the light commercial piece of the business, we clearly are experiencing and seeing growth in that segment of the business, but it's simply being overwhelmed by the large industrial projects and what's happening in the manufacturing sector. So while we're seeing some signs of strength on that part of the business, it's not anywhere near enough to offset what's going on in large projects and oil and gas.","And we do think, as we take a look at the oil and gas assumption for 2017, yes, rig counts have increased nicely, and that's a good indicator, but we've not yet seen a significant turn in orders. And we think in our harsh and hazardous business that we talked about in Electrical Systems and Services, we think it's another down year. We could be wrong. We hope we're wrong, that a lot of the enthusiasm today that's built into a number of expectations, we hope that translates into orders and sales, but we've just not yet seen it. And I think what we've been pretty consistent about is that we've said that we'll call the turn when we actually see it show up in our orders and not before.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That makes sense. Just maybe also, just on the power, kind of utility business, can you give us an update what you've been seeing there, and if there's any change on that going into 2017? Thanks.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, really no change. I mean, we see that business being \u2013 essentially running slight increases year-over-year, and we don't anticipate to see any material change in the power systems business. We'd expect that it would see very, very slight growth during the course of the year.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Craig, I want to switch back to restructuring, and looks like you got about 80 bps of benefit year-over-year from the payback on the actions. I think you're forecasting about 20 bps clean, ex restructuring, expansion on flat revenues obviously. But maybe just fill us in, in terms of some of the offsets to those cost actions and maybe touch on price\/cost for 2017, and maybe some comp adjustments and maybe mix. Anything to help us bridge those margins would be helpful.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, (32:12) appreciate the question. There's really one bridging item that I would say. I think most of the other items, we don't necessarily expect dramatic changes in mix during the course of the year, although we continue to see the large projects, and large industrial projects do tend to be more profitable than certainly the light commercial stuff. But the big issue for us that we're dealing with during the year of 2017 is really commodity prices. And over the last 10 years we certainly have seen price volatility, and we have always been kind of net neutral. So we've always been able to get price or offset commodity price increases to the point where it's really had no impact on our overall underlying margins.","What we are really dealing with, we think, today is a lot of speculation built into the expectations of global growth, and hence the demand for commodities or the price of commodities have really been fluctuating quite significantly. Just to give you, as a point of quantification, post the U.S. elections, our commodity prices on the basket of commodities that Eaton acquires are up 7%, making this issue obviously a bit more difficult to manage and to pass on quickly in the marketplace. We're seeing also large swings in volatility.","To give you maybe another couple of data points that will maybe be helpful, bar steel prices over the last 12 months have been as low as $185 a ton, and they hit a high at the end of the year of $303 a ton. And today, they're $265 a ton. Copper prices over the last 30 days have been as low as $2.49 a pound. Today they're $2.73 a pound. So a 10% change over a 30-day period. And so this period of volatility is really going to have to work its way through the system before we can really understand exactly where commodity prices are going to settle out and where we can put plans in place to either offset them or pass it on in the marketplace.","And so as a result what's built into our guidance is this $80 million of commodity price increase cost that is not being offset by either price increases or other measures during the course of the year. But that's on an $8 billion to $9 billion direct materials spend, and we do expect to offset it, but we think will probably going to be a quarter or two later than we'd like to be ideally.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Just to clarify that point, Craig, so $80 million is baked in as a hedge to margins, but you think \u2013 you can probably get that, but it's not baked into your guidance?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","No. What I'm saying is, we can get it. But we think the timing that it's going to take us to actually implement the actions will be delayed by essentially a quarter or two, and we actually will see an $80 million of negative impact in our year-over-year margins as a result of commodity price increases.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's clear. Yeah.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","But it will be delayed in the implementation.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. So that's clear. And then my follow-on question is, I think your revenue plan looks very reasonable overall, but a big surprise for us was the single-phase UPS down in the quarter, and then you talked about three-phase being down in 2017. Can you maybe just add some color there in terms of what you're seeing perhaps in the data center markets?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. And I'd say that it's just been another one of these markets that's bounced around quite a bit, and as you may have heard from others, we had a number of large projects by Microsoft and others that were delayed out of 2017 as they look at reconfiguring data centers and the way they protect their centers. And so the market for us, it's been volatile, some of which you'd say is structural, but a lot of it is simply customer-specific issues as they work through their future architecture of the way they'd like to protect their global data centers. But we continue to see the underlying strength in the cloud, and that's going to be a long-term positive for the business. But we have in fact seen some short-term, let's say, volatility in demand in those markets.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the color.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Hi. Good morning. We always spoke the last few years about November of 2007 (sic) [2017] as an interesting time, just given the ability to spin some businesses tax-free. Now that that's upon us, only nine months away, I just wanted to get an update if that's still accurate, and how you're thinking about that event?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. And for us, as we've said pretty clearly in the past -for us there is nothing magical about the end of 2017. We have today a collection of businesses that we like. We fully intend to continue to invest in all of them. We have no intentions to spin any of our businesses, and so for us, we're not spending even a moment thinking about it.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Okay. So I'm just trying to think through. Some people look at the sum of the parts, and if they feel there is a gap between how the company's being valued in aggregate versus maybe how it would be separate, is that something you're averse to? Or just as it goes right now, you're not really thinking of it that way in how you're running the businesses?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","There's lots of different points of view around sum of the parts and how you do the math, and is it pre-tax or post-tax. And so without getting into a large discussion on this issue, today we think from a shareholder value perspective, we spend a lot of time looking at the business. We have, over our history, have acquired and divested many businesses, and so we're not in any way averse to divesting businesses. We've laid out a very specific criteria around businesses in terms of what they need to deliver to continue to be part of our company, and we're comfortable today that all of our businesses are either delivering against that criteria, or well on the way towards delivering it.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","All right. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. My first question is really on the vehicles. In 2016 you missed your initial revenue guide in that segment by 4%, and then if we look at your 2017 it seems to embed a very substantial V-shaped recovery. The NAFTA deliveries are down 30% right now; you're assuming they're flat for 2017. So particularly in light of the experience in 2016, why did you decide a sort of a V shape around the middle of the year was the right guidance?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Again I'd say, first, acknowledging your original point, we and the industry overall missed our North America Class 8 forecast for the year, and as the year unfolded, we and others had multiple downward revisions in the North America Class 8 market, and principally because the industry really came into the year carrying a lot of excess inventory that needed to work its way through the system. So today we think the North America Class 8 market in 2017 is flat with 2016. And based upon our analysis, the age of the fleet, the amount of inventory that's in the system, what we're hearing from fleets and customers, we think that's a prudent forecast. And the shape of the year, as you well know, the truck industry does tend to be lumpy. There's big quarters and there's small quarters, and it's not nearly as linear as we'd all like it to be. And so we think that our teams have put a lot of work into modeling what the year looks like, and we're confident that flat is a reasonable estimate at this point in time. And largely consistent with what we're hearing from our customers.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thank you. And then my follow-up would just be on the phasing of the $100 million or so of restructuring costs that you expect through 2017. How much of that is sort of coming in the first quarter and first half of this fiscal year?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","It's clearly going to be oriented more to the first half of the year, Julian. That's what you would expect. But we did, as Craig mentioned, we did pull some actions forward already. And so it won't be quite as lumpy as it was in 2016, but it'll still be majority oriented to the first half of the year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So we should expect maybe about half of it coming in the first quarter or something?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Well, I don't want to be pinned down by quarter, but it's going to be the majority will likely be in the first half of the year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very helpful. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, guys. So one comment, I guess. I give you some kudos for continuing to be appropriately cautious, because you're not seeing the trends really turn positive in your business, so kudos for being conservative there. But I guess maybe focused on ESS for a second. The organic growth has decelerated now throughout the year. You're forecasting organic growth to be down for the third straight year. I guess my broader question is, is it end-market trends? Do you feel like there are maybe some missed opportunities? And are you configured correctly in that business today? Or do you need to invest or divest any potential businesses within that business today?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Hey, Joe. It's a good question, and I'd say, maybe just hitting your specific point head on, no, we're absolutely convinced that we're not losing share in this business. If you take a look at the peers who report in the same space and the data that we give, it's pretty convincing that it really is a market issue largely tied to what's going on today in industrial markets and manufacturing and large projects. And so we don't in any way feel like we have a market competitiveness issue in that business. And as you'll likely understand as well, is that many of the things that we make in our products business ends up in our systems business as a consume components out of our products business. And so, no, we like the Electrical Systems and Services business. We have some work to do to continue to restructure that business, to deal with the inherent volatility that's inside of that business, so that even at very low levels of economic activity we can deliver attractive margins. And that's the path that the team is on.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, fair enough. And I guess my one follow-up there would be on just cash flow and your guidance for the year. It looks like you made about a $100 million pension contribution in 2016. Are you expecting to make contributions in 2017? Because if I add that back I get closer towards the midpoint of your guidance range, and so just wanted to understand the puts and takes in the cash flow for 2017.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, Joe, you'll see it on the last page of the presentation. We made a $100 million contribution in December of 2016, and we made a $100 million contribution in January of 2017, and so that's already factored into the cash flow guidance we're giving for the year.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. I see that now. Any other puts and takes that we need to be aware of, Rick?","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Not really. I mean, as you see, revenues are relatively flat, absent FX, and so you don't see significant use or cash flow from working capital, because it's typically oriented at the top line, and so nothing else that's unusual.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, thanks, guys.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Just wondering if you could touch on lighting. Craig, you called it out as strong in the quarter. There's been a lot of mixed results out there in this quarter, as you probably know. How did your volumes perform? What's going on with pricing? Any color you can give us on your LED mix would be helpful.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes. Appreciate the question. We did have another what we think is a strong quarter in lighting in Q4. Our actual revenues were up mid-single digit, and our LED sales, as a percentage of overall sales, came in at 72%, and so we continue to feel like our lighting business is performing well. The LED penetration continues to grow. We, like others, continue to see price concessions in that business as the cost of the technology comes down, and we're essentially shedding price in that business. But the price and the costs are essentially largely balanced. And so, from an underlying margin standpoint, we continue to make progress and improvements in our overall lighting business.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. And I was wondering also just back to energy and not seeing any kind of firming up there. Can you just remind us or maybe update us on what your mix is now, upstream versus downstream, after two years of energy down cycle? Has your mix changed materially? In particular, if you could give us some color on U.S. upstream, would be interesting.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. Let me jump in and take that. As you know, before the downturn, we were very heavily \u2013 we had a higher orientation to upstream. We still had very good downstream exposure as well, and not so much in the midstream area. And so with this production downturn over the last couple years, we are definitely more balanced now. And more of an orientation towards downstream than upstream. And I can't give you an exact number because we haven't yet tallied exactly where we are from 2016, but clearly the upstream part has suffered in this downturn. And, as Craig said, it is interesting that the rig count has gone up as much is it has and yet we haven't really seen orders come through as a result of that. Now, whether that's because there will be a delay as some of these rigs that they're now putting back into action don't have aftermarket needs yet, it's hard to know. But it's something we're obviously watching closely.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks for the color.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Eli Lustgarten with Longbow.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Morning.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Can we just get a little more color on two segments? One on vehicles. You talked about a flat Class 8 market. But can you talk about what you're seeing in the automotive sector? I mean, there's a lot of projections of slightly declining sales this year. There's some talk of \u2013 some company talking about maybe a material production cut in the second half of the year versus European auto. Can you give us some idea of what you're seeing in that part of the business?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, Eli. I mean, I'd say today, the global auto markets around the world continue to do extremely well. Even if we got the January numbers for the U.S. market and down from the fourth quarter kind of record levels but still north of 17 million cars and about flat with prior year, which is largely what our forecast is for North America. So we think North America continues to run at flat at very high levels. We think Europe is maybe some modest slight growth, and we think China continues to be kind of a standout performer. I mean, China really posted very large numbers during the course of 2016, and we think it moderates a bit, but we think it's still positive. So our own perspective on global markets around the world is that we think they continue to be slightly positive at very high levels, and there's been really no indication at this point of those markets turning over.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And as you talk about Hydraulic, you sort of have a flat number. It's sort of hard with an 8%, I said we all keep talking we have (50:07) an 8% order step up in the quarter. Is that flatness because you expect a continued weakness in the OEM side or distribution? Or is it across the board? I mean, you had \u2013 the OEM side started to show some signs of life, but it's pretty hard to get just flat with the kind of numbers you're showing unless you expect parts of OEM to be weaker, or something happening in the marketplace.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","No, I'd say for us, Eli, it's largely a function of we have one quarter of data. And so we have one data point where we have strong orders off of relatively weak comparables in the prior year. And at this point you read the same kind of forecasts that we read. We see what our customers are saying about their forecasts for the year. And whether it's \u2013 you know all the big names in those markets. And then they're forecasting largely for another year of modest declines. We are very encouraged by what we're seeing in China. A lot of the government stimulus activities have certainly resulted in growth, and we saw growth in China during the course of 2016. And we think that continues. But at this point we just think it's too early to call bigger term, given the total composite of everything that we're seeing.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","I mean, your basic scenario is an up distribution market being offset by continuing weakness in OEM. Is that the balance of...","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. I'd say even on the OEM side, right, it's different pictures of what's going on in OEM. We actually had a very good quarter of bookings in the OEM side in ag (51:48) and construction equipment in Q4. Question how much of that was inventory rebuild? How much of that was underlying demand in the market? I mean, you see some of the big customers' retail sales data. And so for us ultimately speaking that will be the governing item for what we eventually experience in our business.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And probably to beat some price increases, I suspect. Thank you.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yes, Thanks.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Okay.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. A lot of my questions have been answered. But I'm going to focus on your outlook for Aerospace margins. Very strong, above 19%. Craig, could you talk a little bit about is there any concern that Aerospace is not investing in its own future? We need those engineering R&D dollars so that we win the next platform so we have the aftermarket 20 years from now? If you could just talk a little bit about the high margins versus the R&D spend.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","It's a great question, Ann, and you know this space very well. And so today, as we think about the R&D spend in the Aerospace business or any business, there are the dollars that you're investing in kind of off-line technology development, anticipating that, to your point, 10 or 20 years from now we'll need technology ready to insert in a new platform. And then there's specific customer programs and customer development projects, and that's the piece that we and quite frankly everybody in the industry has seen a significant fall-off in. The industry went through this massive period of refresh, whether that was on the commercial side or on the military side, and R&D spending really went up quite dramatically over the last 10 to 15 years as the industry went through major new program developments. And now they're coming down the other side of it, which is kind of a natural part of the Aerospace cycle.","To your point, we are in fact continuing to invest in what we call off-line technology development, so that we're not sure when the next-generation single-aisle plane will be developed. We think it's 2025 or beyond, but we need to be ready when it does come. And we are making those investments.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful color. I appreciate that, because we don't like to see them too high for too long, either. And then a follow-up on your input costs. You said your basket of commodities that you purchased were up \u2013 or the index was up 7%. Can you just talk a little bit more about your spend? Are you being impacted more by copper or more by steel or a combination of both? Just a little bit more on the commodities (54:43) please.","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah. I'd say for the most part, Ann, most of the commodities, certainly the two that you mentioned, are up, whether it's bar steel or flat steel or hot roller beam. So really it's almost across the board where we've seen commodity inflation creep into the system. And so it's \u2013 I mean, there are a few commodities, like silver and the like, that have perhaps come down slightly. But, for the most part, we've seen most of our commodity input costs go up over the last 90 days or so.","Richard H. Fearon - Eaton Corp. Plc","And, Ann, it's fair to say that amongst our big spend items are clearly steel and copper. I mean, those, for obvious reasons, within the different products that our businesses make. And so those prices, the increases we've seen clearly have a significant impact on them.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just a quick follow-up. Will it be easier or faster to get pricing in places like Electrical Products because you're going direct to end markets versus Hydraulics, Aerospace, Vehicles where you're shipping into OEMs and maybe contracts lag? Is that the right way to think about it? Or how should I think about that?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, no, I'd say in general, that would be an accurate way of thinking about it, Ann. I'd say the bigger issue that we're dealing with right now is really the volatility. We've seen, yes, this upward trend certainly in commodity prices, but we've also seen very high volatility. And as I shared a few examples with you in my opening commentary around \u2013 in the last 30 days, the price of copper has swung 10% over a period of 30 days. And so when you're living in a period of high volatility, it's really difficult to think about sitting across from a customer and saying, here's the price; therefore, we need to increase our prices. Or to really even talk about, how do you look at things that you can do to potentially offset it when you're living in this period of very high volatility.","So we really do believe we need to see a little bit of stabilization in commodity prices, and a lot of the expectations around future growth to settle before we know where these commodities are actually going to land. We do believe that we think we're at higher levels today in commodity prices than it'll eventually settle out at, largely because of the global supply\/demand equation. So we do think there's a lot of speculation today in commodity prices.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. It doesn't help with your forecasting jobs. Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, we've covered a lot of ground here. I wanted to circle back on this decision to do accelerated restructuring. And be curious to know about the timing of this. Which actually came first? Did you have the need to do the restructuring and capacity to do the restructuring in the fourth quarter and then you were able to harvest those insurance settlements? But I'm also hearing a number of companies, facing the administration change, you saw a lot of settlements happening in the fourth quarter because of that uncertainty. So which came first?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Deane, as I think we laid out more than a year ago, we had a very large and comprehensive restructuring plan that our teams had already identified a number of actions that we intended to take. And so in our case, it was simply the fact that we had the plans and the actions already identified. We ended up with \u2013 our team did an outstanding job of negotiating a settlement on these insurance matters. And so we simply pulled forward the actions from early Q1 into Q4.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. And just from our perspective to be able to get that much restructuring done in a fourth quarter is a pretty tough task, and it looked like it happened pretty smoothly. And then maybe just some context about shifting to the pay-as-you-go restructuring in 2018. How do you decide that $60 million is the right run rate?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","And I'd say that it's probably more art than science around the number of $60 million, and I would ask that you not hold us precisely to that number. We think, as a placeholder and looking at what we've spent historically to take on various improvements in underlying efficiency in the organization, that's a good placeholder number to use. But we'll certainly \u2013 we'll likely see some slight variation around that number.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Sure. That's helpful. Thank you.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","As we cross the top of the hour, we're going to have time for one more question here, and that comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. On the Hydraulics, just return to that; I know there's been a lot of questions on it. But the order improvement, was that truncated to December? We've seen some other reports that kind of suggest the end-of-quarter surge, if you will. And then I know it's not really common practice for you, but if it was truncated to the end of the quarter, did you see those trends continue into January?","Craig Arnold - Eaton Corp. Plc","Yeah, in our case, Andy, the simple \u2013 short answer to the question is no, it was not a December surge, as we also have heard others articulate, spending budgets at the end of the year. We really did see the strength largely play out throughout the quarter. And so far in January, I'd say that we're encouraged that some of the strength that we've seen in Q4 has continued.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Donald H. Bullock - Eaton Corp. Plc","Thank you all for joining us today. As always, we'll be available for follow-up questions today, tomorrow, and into next week. Thank you again for joining us for our 2016 fourth quarter earnings call.","Operator","Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and for using AT&T's Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."]}}
