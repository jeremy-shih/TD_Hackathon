Welcome to the MAA Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, October 26, 2017.","I would like now to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA.","Tim Argo","Thank you, Savannah. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Rob DelPriore, General Counsel.","Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the safe harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34 ACT filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.","I'll now turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. FFO results for the third quarter, ignoring the credit associated with the mark-to-market adjustment on the preferred stock derivative, were ahead of our expectation. This result was achieved despite the unexpected expenses incurred during the quarter associated with the 2 hurricanes that affected our operations in Houston and in Florida.","Leasing conditions in the third quarter, particularly in our larger markets, reflect the impact of elevated new supply levels and is more evident at the higher-end priced point and more urban-oriented locations in the portfolio. On a comparative basis, we continue to see better pricing performance across the majority of our secondary markets and more suburban locations.","Most importantly, however, job growth in the resulting demand across the overall portfolio continues to hold up. While it varies somewhat by market, the ratio of job growth to new supply across the overall portfolio is in the range of 5 to 1, representing a generally healthy supply demand scenario, which enables us to capture strong occupancy and low resident turnover while generating solid growth and lease renewal pricing. We remain positive on internal earning growth prospects over the next few quarters for several reasons. First, projections continue to support a pullback in the permitting of new construction. As a result, we expect the current new delivery pressures to show some moderation over the back half of 2018.","Our early projections of job growth to new supply across the total portfolio in 2018 reflect a slight improvement as compared to the trends in 2017. As a result of our balanced portfolio with investments across a wide range of markets and submarkets, we believe that overall market fundamentals as they apply to our markets will remain supportive of good demand, strong occupancy and solid overall pricing opportunities with renewal pricing continuing to outpace new lease pricing.","Secondly, as Tom will outline in his comments, we are [indiscernible] benefits associated with reconciling the Post portfolio operation to MAA's practices, and we're confident this momentum will carry well into next year as a lot of the foundation was laid this year, especially on the revenue management side, and will be more impactful on leasing activity in 2018. We have both the legacy MAA Portfolio and the legacy Post portfolio well positioned for the slower winter leasing season and start to next year.","And thirdly, we see a steady and growing contribution from our development in lease-up pipelines in 2018. One of the real value-add components we captured through our merger with Post was the development pipeline. And while it was at its most dilutive point in 2017, we will see this become a net positive contributor to earnings in 2018.","As we've seen over the last couple of quarters, supply pressures continue to be more evident in the legacy Post portfolio. Despite these pressures, we continue to make progress in reconciling revenue management practices. The performance differences between the legacy Post and MAA Portfolios continue to narrow. During the quarter, within the legacy Post portfolio, we captured average daily occupancy of 95.7%, which was within 15 \u2013 50 basis points of the average daily occupancy generated by the legacy MAA Portfolio. This is the best comparative result since our merger.","In addition, the legacy Post portfolio captured strong growth in lease renewal pricing during the quarter, equaling the results captured from the legacy MAA Portfolio. New lease pricing moderated in August and in September from the trends we saw in July as new supply pressures picked up in several submarkets in the latter part of Q3. We will have to work through new supply challenges in several submarkets before rents on leases written to new move-in residents meaningfully improve. But we're encouraged with the continued strong performance in renewal lease pricing, while at the same time, seeing resident turnover remaining low.","With new construction permitting trending down as well as great progress having been made over the year and repositioning the legacy Post portfolio to our revenue management protocols, we're optimistic that new lease pricing will show improvement in 2018.","Our most persistent challenge continues to be external growth. Despite an increase in new supply and the associated pressure on new lease pricing, cap rates and market pricing on acquisition opportunities remains very robust. We continue to underwrite and actively review a number of opportunities. But absent some combination of attributes that creates a highly motivated seller, it's been a challenge to achieve pricing on acquisitions that we believe meet our disciplined protocols governing capital deployment. We're also analyzing several new development opportunities, but likewise, find that upward pressure on construction labor and material costs is challenging our willingness to commit capital at the moment.","I expect we'll get some activity underway on both the acquisition and development fronts over the coming year, but certainly, the buying bonanza or a rise in cap rates that sometimes accompanies supply induced moderation in leasing conditions hasn't shown up in this cycle, at least not yet. We have the balance sheet in a very strong position with ample capacity support this opportunity when it does appear.","Out team continues to make great progress in working through the many tasks associated with integrating the legacy Post platform with our MAA operating practices. As we've seen over the course of this year, the early wins surrounding reductions in property operating expenses continued in Q3. As noted in the third quarter, growth in same-store expenses was impacted by hurricane-related expenditures, and we fully expect the fourth quarter to reflect the positive trends we saw earlier this year. We remain excited about the additional opportunities remaining to capture in 2018 surrounding revenue management protocols, maintenance operations and a significant unit interior redevelopment opportunity that will carry forward well past next year.","Finally, I want to send my thanks and appreciation to our team for their hard work over the busy summer season and the extra effort that was required from this year's active hurricane season.","MAA has completed a significant amount of growth and change over the past few years, and the platform is in a significantly stronger position.","I hope to see many of you at our upcoming Investor Day on November 13, where we plan to lay out the strengths of the platform and our outlook for the company.","That's all I have in the way of prepared comments, and I'll now turn it over to Tom.","Tom Grimes","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Same-store revenues for the quarter were up 1.7% over the prior year with 96.1% average daily occupancy. Looking at this portfolio, the legacy MAA portfolio revenues were up 2.4% with 96.2% average daily occupancy and effective rent growth of 2.8%. The legacy Post portfolio had revenues of negative 0.5% with 95.7% average daily occupancy and effective rent growth of 0.2%.","The performance gap between the two portfolios is driven by higher new supply in the Post submarkets as well as differences in our operating practices. We have, of course, been focused on achieving full alignment in operating practices between the two portfolios. We have made good progress, and results are starting to show up. This momentum will carry into 2018. We have improved Post occupancy about 50 basis points since the beginning of the year, and we feel we have another 40 basis points to go.","October to date, Post blended rents are up 2% on a lease-over-lease basis. This is 40 basis points better than October of 2016. Said another way, we have increased proposed blended lease rates on a lease-over-lease basis by 310 basis points from the first quarter and have driven average daily occupancy up by 50 basis points. This has occurred as the Post submarkets have faced growing competition from new deliveries. We believe that the data cleanup and resetting of the many variables within the revenue management system will drive enhanced performance as we work through the releasing of the portfolio on the coming year.","While it takes time for the improvement in pricing to show up in portfolio revenue performance, the expense progress has been immediate. Excluding the hurricane-related expenses, total expenses for the quarter were up just 1.4% and year-to-date expense growth for the Post portfolio is down 0.7%. That's driven by improvements in personnel, repair and maintenance as well as property and casualty insurance. As a result, the Post NOI margin is expected to improve 40 basis points this year. We expect this to grow as we see benefits from the completed foundational work of our revenue management systems and continue to harvest opportunities on the expense side of the equation.","Looking forward, we're well positioned for the slower winter months. October occupancy is expected to close at 96% and a 60-day exposure, which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60-day period, is below 7%. The early read on the fourth quarter renewals is encouraging as we are averaging 5.7% increases achieved and January offers went out at 7%.","While elevated supply levels moderated overall revenue growth, we're still seeing good growth in many markets. Fort Worth, Raleigh, Charleston and Richmond all stood out from the group.","Houston has been our market level worry bead, but it appears to be stabilizing. After hurricane Harvey, our occupancy increased from 96.2% to 97%. Our 60-day exposure there is just 4.2%. We have held pricing at prestorm levels, but expect them to climb as normal operations return.","On the supply front, Dallas and Austin are facing the most pressure. Expected deliveries for 2017, our 16,000 for Dallas and 7,000 for Austin. These deliveries represent 3% of inventory in both markets. We are encouraged that job growth has remained strong in both Austin and Dallas. For 2017, Dallas job growth is 2.2% and Austin job growth is 2.1%, which compares favorable to the 2017 national average of just 1.4%. This improves in 2018 with both markets expected to grow at 2.4% versus the national average of 1.5%.","Renter demand remained steady on our current - residents continue to choose to stay with us. Move-outs for the portfolio were down 3.2% for the quarter. Turnover remained low at 50.4% on a rolling 12-month basis. Move-outs to home buying and move-outs to home renting were down 5.5% and 3%, respectively.","As you know, much of the Post product is in inner loop areas that are seeing the most supply. While this puts pressure on our newer product and creates opportunity on the older product in excellent locations. We plan to invest $112 million to redevelop units in the Post communities over the next three to four years. This is our most accretive method to allocate capital. There are 13,000 units that have compelling redevelopment, 13,000 Post units that have compelling redevelopment opportunities. We can make these great locations more competitive by updating the product. We have room to raise the rents and still be well below the rates of the new product coming online.","We're just getting away on the \u2013 getting underway on the Post redevelopment program. Through the quarter, we have completed $9.5 million in renovations on over 1,100 units. On average, we're spending $8,600 and getting a rent increase that's 12% more than a comparable non-redeveloped unit.","On the full MAA Portfolio, year-to-date, we have completed over 6,500 interior unit upgrades. And on legacy MAA, our redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remains robust. On a combined basis, our total redevelopment pipeline is in the neighborhood of 30,000 units. That translates into a total pipeline of $170 million of very accretive capital deployment opportunity.","As you can tell from the release, our lease-up communities are performing well. Leasing is gone better than expected at Charlotte, Midtown and Nashville, and that stabilization date was moved up a quarter \u2013 to the fourth quarter of this year. The Retreat at West Creek 2, Colonial Grand at Randall Lakes 2, Post Parkside at 2 and 1201 Midtown 1, all stabilized on schedule this quarter. We're actively leasing the Denton II, Post South Lamar 2, Post Midtown and Post River North, and they are progressing well.","It's been a busy quarter for our teams, and we're pleased with our progress. The building momentum in the Post portfolio is particularly encouraging. We look forward to continuing to capture value-creation opportunities on both the revenue and expense side of the equation. Al?","Al Campbell","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally, on guidance for the remainder of 2017.","Net income available for common shareholders was $1 per diluted common share for the quarter. FFO for the quarter was $1.50 per share, which was $0.06 above the midpoint of our previous guidance. The third quarter performance included $0.035 per share for noncash income from the valuation of an embedded derivative included with the preferred shares acquired from Post, which I'll discuss a bit more in just a moment.","Before considering a $0.02 per share impact from the hurricane-related costs, total property NOI for the third quarter, including non same-store, was in line with expectations. Favorable G&A, interest and other income produced the majority of the remaining outperformance for the quarter, offsetting the storm costs and producing $0.02 per share with additional favorability.","As briefly discussed in our prior releases, the $0.035 per share of noncash income related to the preferred shares acquired is in short due to accounting rules that require we bifurcate an assumed embedded derivative related to the call option on the shares. The derivative must be recorded as an asset and the mark-to-market each period through earnings.","Volatile trading during the third quarter produced a sizable noncash adjustment, which really bears no real economic benefit and will potentially reverse at some point in the future. Higher supply pressures in many of our urban-oriented locations did pressure our revenue performance more than expected for the third quarter, primarily in the legacy Post portfolio.","Overall blended pricing of 2.6% for the quarter was below our projection of just over 3%. Also, average occupancy performance of 96.1% for the quarter, while strong, did not reach the higher prior level amount of 96.3% as projected, which drove the bulk of the difference from our projections from \u2013 for the third quarter.","However, pricing trends for the Post portfolio continued to improve over the previous quarter, we remain excited about the opportunity to capture stronger performance from operating practices over the next several quarters.","Partially offsetting the revenue moderation was continued strong expense performance during the quarter. Same-store operating expenses for the legacy Post portfolio, excluding real estate taxes, declined almost 5% compared to the prior year, as we continue to capture savings from both operating practices and scale.","During the quarter, four communities within our lease-up portfolio were fully stabilized and one development community, Post Midtown, was completed and moved into the lease-up portfolio. Our current lease-up portfolio now contains three communities, totaling 999 units with an average occupancy of 61.5% at quarter end. One community is expected to stabilize during the fourth quarter with the final two projected to stabilize mid to late 2018.","During the third quarter, we funded an additional $33 million of development costs, bringing our year-to-date funding to $143 million. Our current development pipeline now contains five projects with a total projected cost of $305 million, with only $70 million remaining to be funded. These five projects are expected to produce an average 6.3% stabilized NOI yield once completed and leased-up, with three of the projects projected to be completed by the first quarter of 2018 and the remaining two completed in the back half of 2018.","During the quarter, we sold three wholly-owned communities located in the Lakeland, Florida; Montgomery, Alabama; and Fort Worth, Texas. The total proceeds of $88.4 million represented a strong pricing for 28 year old assets on average and produced a 5.3% economic cap rate.","We also exited two tertiary markets with these sales. We currently have two additional communities located in Atlanta under contract for sale, which are expected to close during the fourth quarter for growth proceeds of approximately $98 million.","Our balance sheet remains in great shape. During the third quarter, we paid off $150 million of senior unsecured notes assumed for Post as well as a $14 million secured mortgage with our unsecured line of credit. At quarter end, our leverage, as defined by our bond covenants, was 33.2%, while our net debt was only 5.3x recurring EBITDA.","At quarter end, 85% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective interest rate of only 3.5%, with well laddered maturities averaging 4.4 years. At quarter end, we had over $795 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility, providing both liquidity and support for our business plans.","Given our current expectations for acquisitions and dispositions over the remainder of year, along with our projection for excess cash approaching $100 million, we did not anticipate new equity needs this year and expect to end the year with our leverage around current levels.","Finally, we updated our earnings guidance for the full year to reflect the third quarter performance and updated expectations for the remainder of the year. We are updating guidance for net income per diluted common share, which is then reconciled to updated FFO and AFFO guidance in the supplement.","Net income per diluted common share is now projected to be $2.76 to $2.86 per share for the full year of 2017. FFO is now projected to be $5.84 to $5.94 per share or $5.89 at the midpoint, which includes $0.15 per share of merger and integration costs for the full year. AFFO is projected to be $5.25 to $5.35 per share or $5.30 at the midpoint.","We adjusted our FFO guidance for the full year by adding $0.02 per share at the midpoint. We expect continued volatility in the noncash earnings related to the embedded option acquired with the Post preferred shares, and we have allowed $0.02 of this of the recent favorability to reverse during the fourth quarter.","We've also extended recent operating trends through the remainder of the year, with projected fourth quarter revenue performance based on an expectation of continued stable occupancy at current levels and blended pricing on move-ins and renewals during the fourth quarter reflecting normal seasonality, averaging 1.5% higher on a lease-over-lease basis, which is in line with prior year. The combination of these factors as well as a more favorable prior year comparison and occupancy is expected to produce fourth quarter revenues above third quarter.","As you saw in our supplement, we are revising our guidance expectations for the combined adjusted same-store Portfolio. We now project revenues to grow 2% to 2.5% for the full year and operating expenses to grow 1.75% to 2.25%. This is expected to produce NOI growth for the year 2% to 2.5% range, including a 30 basis points impact from the storm costs incurred in third quarter.","We also revised guidance for acquisition volume for the remainder of the year to reflect the competitive landscape. The top end of our acquisition range now includes closing one additional deal prior to year-end. We also tightened our range for development investment for the year, reflecting revised timing of funding.","We remain on track to capture the full $20 million of overhead synergies related to the Post merger on a run rate basis by year-end, and we're a little ahead of timing expectations for this as reflected in our revised guidance. As we also \u2013 and we also expect to continue capturing additional NOI opportunities over the next several quarters as the operating practices and platforms become fully integrated.","And that's all we have in the way of prepared comments, Savannah, so now we'll turn the call back over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we can go first to Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. It's been almost a year since you closed on the acquisition of Post. So curious how actual results have compared to underwriting, particularly in terms of operating performance?","Eric Bolton","Nick, this is Eric. We know that at this point in the cycle that the submarkets that largely define the Post portfolio, we're going to be under more stress. I think the \u2013 we also knew that we had some great opportunity to rework some operating practices and capture, we think, better performance than what was being delivered. But the pressure on the supply side, particularly in Dallas and Austin, has noticeably picked up in the last 90 days or so. And that has created some of the pressures that we're talking about here as it relates to outlook for the rest of this year.","But the fact is that we did this merger with a goal of further enhancing our full cycle strategy. We knew that at this point in the cycle, the Post locations would be under more pressure. But that at later parts on the cycle, those locations really service very well and likely would exceed the performance expectations that we get out of the legacy MAA locations.","So ultimately, we continue to feel very positive about the full cycle. Enhancement that comes from putting the portfolio in with the MAA portfolio, none of that has changed as a consequence of anything that we've seen. And so we've explained in the past, the redevelopment opportunity is frankly bigger than we thought it was going to be. And so we've remained very excited, and I will tell you, very confident in the $650 million value-creation opportunity that we've previously laid out that comes from this merger.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Appreciate that. And then just in terms of same-store revenue guidance. Year-to-date, it's been disappointing. You've reduced it to twice. So I'm just curious what gives you the confidence in the fourth quarter that year-over-year growth will accelerate from what you've seen in the third quarter in this year?","Al Campbell","This is Al. I think as we move into the fourth quarter, first, occupancy is a very strong level, it's 96%. Our exposure is low in the portfolio. We've seen pricing as we moved into \u2013 as we talk about \u2013 I'll talk about it, more comments, we're expecting fourth quarter pricing blended to be 1.5%, which is on top of the prior year. And we're seeing that a little better already in October. And so those things provide comment \u2013 I mean, confidence in that as we move through the best rest of the year and what we've put out. And Tom, do you have anything to add to that?","Tom Grimes","Yes, I would just say, Nick, in October, as Al mentioned, we're below 7% on exposure. And on the post assets, the blended new lease pricings about 40 basis points higher than October of last year. And that's \u2013 if that holds through the quarter, that will be the first time we've seen that all in the third quarter. We're encouraged by that.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to understand some of the moving pieces in your FFO guidance if you strip out some of those onetime items and the hurricane costs. So it seems like there was about a $0.03 per share net benefit from onetimers, which is then being offset by the decrease from lower same-store NOI and lower G&A. You mentioned there was a $0.02 reversal, I believe. So net-net, stripping those out, is the $0.02 increase coming from other kind of noncore items that you expect to be recurring, either in interest expense or some other line item? Can you just clarify that, please?","Al Campbell ","Yes. I mean, we've looked at a couple of ways, Nick \u2013 I'm sorry about that, Austin. And I think, the main point we make is whichever way you look at, there's a lot of noise in the quarter and the updated guidance for the year includes that. But whether you look at, including the non-cash benefit from option as well as the storm costs, you have a beat of about $0.02. And whether you exclude the strip out both of those items, you have a beat of about $0.02. So that's kind of how we thought about that, and we can work that through.","The way I would think about the fourth quarter or the full year update for the guidance is, we had a third quarter beat of $0.06. We have allowed about $0.035 of favorability, and third quarter came from an option. We've allowed for about $0.02 of that to turn around, as we do expect to continue volatility in that as interest rates rise probably. And then we've adjusted our guidance, as you said, from same-store to some of the other items in our forecast. And all of that together combines another $0.02. So $0.06 minus those \u2013 that $0.04 is a $0.04 beat \u2013 I mean, excuse me, $0.02 beat. But how are we going to look it up, I think it will shake out to be about $0.02 beat.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks. That's helpful. And then on the redevelopment side, you mentioned you've done about 1,100 units so far with achieving a 12% rent increase. What markets of those redevelopments been in at this point? And given the new lease rates have been stubbornly low across the Post portfolio, I mean, what gives you the confidence you can continue to achieve that as you roll it out across other markets?","Tom Grimes","Yes. So I mean, we\u2019re active in just about every Post market, except for Raleigh, which is brand new. And what we do with that, Austin, I mean, we\u2019re continuing to test renovated units next to non-renovated units, and \u2013 so that you\u2019re making sure that you\u2019re getting that price increase. Our redeveloped or renovated units are leasing about four days faster than our non-redeveloped on those opportunities. And frankly, we believe, long-term, it will work. For some reason, that particular redevelopment doesn\u2019t work. We just stop it, and we wait for the next opportunity. But frankly, we\u2019ve been accelerating at this point and feel pretty good on the returns.","Eric Bolton","And also, I would tell you that, I mean, what we see is even with some of these more competitive submarkets of the Post locations with new supply, even with the effective pricing that these new communities are trying to offer to get leased up. We\u2019re still able to undercut their pricing through this redevelopment effort and still create a very creative use of capital. So while, certainly, I understand the point that the new lease pricing is under more pressure in some of these submarket locations, the redevelopment opportunity is so significant that it is not really creating a meaningful headwind to that effort.","Austin Wurschmidt","That\u2019s a good color. Thank you. And then just last one for me, I want to touch on Dallas. You mentioned that\u2019s been a heavy supply market. Occupancy was down 100 bps year-over-year. Revenue growth was flat. I mean, is Dallas at risk of going negative \u2013 is revenue growth in Dallas at risk of going negative into 2018?","Tom Grimes","Yes. I think, we need to monitor Dallas closely and I think that is a risk. We saw sort of a concession environment in Dallas, I mean, pick up in the latter part of the quarter and we think there\u2019s pressure there.","Al Campbell","What I would...","Austin Wurschmidt","Any particular submarket...","Al Campbell","What I would tell you is, I mean, the uptown submarket is clearly where the most pressure is occurring for our portfolio that we\u2019re seeing a little bit in North Dallas, but the uptown market in particular. What gives us \u2013 what I think happens in Dallas is, I think, it probably is under more pressure over the first two quarters of next year and probably gets a little bit easier over the last two quarters of next year. We think that renewal pricing will continue to hold strong. We\u2019ll continue to capture very \u2013 pretty strong occupancy. The problem will run in \u2013 or the challenge is that the prior year comps are tougher in the first half of the year and they get a little bit easy in the back half of the year.","So I think that, on balance, if I look at Dallas as a whole for the year, I have a hard time getting to a negative result. But I think you may see more pressure in the first half of the year versus the back half of the year. The question for Dallas is, if that job growth holds as well as it is in 2018 \u2013 early look at 2018 is pretty darn strong, frankly, a little bit better than 2017, Dallas will be okay.","Austin Wurschmidt","And what are concessions today in Dallas? You mentioned they have increased.","Tom Grimes","Yes. No, it ranges by submarkets. So we\u2019re seeing one to six weeks free. We\u2019re seeing in the market and like Frisco and McKinney and other parts of North Dallas, uptown, as Eric touched on a little more aggressive. We\u2019ve got several comps that are doing two months free, but normal is about one to two months free in uptown.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Lewis","Thanks. So a lot to talk about Austin and Dallas. As I kind of look down the markets that decelerated the year-over-year growth from quarter-to-quarter, Nashville, Tampa, South Florida, Greensville, Jackson, maybe all storm related. I was just curious if there\u2019s any \u2013 if there\u2019s a trend in any of those worth talking about, and maybe it relates to the storm. I know in Houston, a lot of us start looking at that, thinking, that, that makes the market tighter and market rent might go up. Are there other markets like that maybe in Florida?","Tom Grimes","I would tell you that the storm benefits Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, not to the degree that Orlando \u2013 that Harvey did in Houston. The other thing that goes on is Orlando, particularly gets a ton of immigration from Puerto Rico, and that is a \u2013 that\u2019s a market that may well get tighter as a result of, frankly, the tough times that they\u2019re having down there.","Michael Lewis","Okay. And the deceleration in same-store revenue growth in like Nashville and Tampa, is there anything going on there? Or is that just a...","Tom Grimes","Yes. I mean, Tampa, it really is a split between the Post assets and the MAA assets. But October for Post is now 95% non-average daily. In October, blended rent increases 2.8% there. And then legacy MAA is was 96.2%, but frankly, they were just facing a tougher comp with higher occupancy in prior quarter and last year at 96.5%.","Eric Bolton","Yes. And Nashville is a market that got a fair amount of supply this year. We think it starts to \u2013 I mean, if you look at the early projections for next year, the supply levels moderate in Nashville a good debt, and we think Nashville probably has an easier go of it next year versus this year.","Michael Lewis","Okay, thanks. And then the \u2013 on the development side, realizing that it\u2019s tough to maybe to find new developments, you hope to find some in the next year. But on the stuff that\u2019s underway, is there anything on labor or other costs that\u2019s maybe squeezed in the cost side? And then anything in the markets on the rent side to cause you to maybe adjust your yield assumptions on the stuff that\u2019s underway?","Eric Bolton","No, nothing. We\u2019re far enough for long, frankly, in what we already have underway at this point that any material change in our forecast is highly unlikely. I mean, all those contracts are very well set and not really subject or at risk of any sort of cost escalations. And so everything that we\u2019ve got underway right now, we don\u2019t have any concerns about delivering the stabilized yields that we\u2019ve long believed we\u2019re going to be there.","Michael Lewis","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Drew Babin","Hey, good morning.","Eric Bolton","Hey, Drew.","Drew Babin","Following up on \u2013 just another development question. I noticed the stabilized yield expectation went to 6.3% from 6.5% this quarter. Is that the effect of Post midtown exiting the pipeline? Or is something happening with the rent projections for the pipeline as a whole?","Tim Argo","No. This is Tim, Drew. That was the impact of moving post midtown to the lease-up group. It was about a 7% yield, still expected to base and the other one stayed as it is.","Drew Babin","Okay. And then as far as Post happened at Oaks goes in Houston, I noticed the occupancy went up quite a bit in the third quarter relative to 2Q. Do you think Harvey had a positive impact there? And did you see anything in October sort of post 3Q of this evidence of continued strength there?","Tom Grimes","Yes. I mean, Harvey was a significant benefit there. We jumped from 62% to 80% \u2013 or 64% to 84% in just a few weeks, honestly, Drew, in that helped us a lot there on the lease-up.","Drew Babin","Okay. And lastly on the concession environment, I appreciate the color on what's going on in Dallas. Could we point out any other markets for the concessions or in some cases, two months or that sort of year? And I guess, I mean, given the supply, it was relatively non-quantity going into this year. The concession environment has been a little more competitive. What do you think is behind that? As far as the private developers are concerned, is there worries about interest rates on many term loans? Is it \u2013 there are some other factor that might be causing them to be more aggressive with concessions right now?","Tom Grimes","Austin, I can't speak to developers' motivation. I'd tell you, Austin, is the other market where we're seeing, on average, probably one month. And then in a few pockets, in certain some markets, it might jump to two. But on average, it's one. And I think that has to do with the amount of supply in the market, and folks are very interested in getting their products stabilized.","Eric Bolton","Drew, I would \u2013 this is Eric. I would tell you, yes, I absolutely believe that, as we get later into this cycle in markets like Dallas, particularly in a submarket like uptown where you've got quite a bit of supply coming online, I think with the likelihood of some \u2013 of these rising rates, I think developers are getting most anxious to go ahead and get leased up and get things stabilized, prove out their rent as best they can. And it's the one thing that gives me some belief that there may be more compelling buying opportunities as we get into next year because I think that a lot of these guys are rushing for the door in terms of getting the property stabilized.","They much rather come to market and sell it well into the lease-up where they've got a track record they can point to in terms of rents and leasing velocity. The concession is notwithstanding. They really look at just the stated rents and use that as a basis to try to capture really robust pricing on the sale of the asset. And so I think there is increasing pressure on the developers to get leased up, and I think that's what's leading to some of the more active concession practices that Tom has alluded to.","Drew Babin","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Gaurav Mehta","Thanks, good morning. So I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about new lease moderation in August and September. I was wondering if that were only restricted to Austin and Dallas or you saw that trend into the markets as well?","Tom Grimes","I'm sorry, Gaurav, I didn't hear the first part of the question.","Gaurav Mehta","Starting in the prepared remarks, you said new lease moderated in August and September. I was wondering if that was only in Austin and Dallas or you saw that in other markets as well.","Tom Grimes","It was most pronounced in Dallas and Austin. That is \u2013 that was the heavy concessions coming into play in those markets, nothing dramatically out of the ordinary and the other ones.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. And I'm sorry if I missed this, but can you provide new lease and renewal growth rate for 3Q?","Tom Grimes","Yes. New lease and renewal for the third quarter were \u2013 new lease was 0.357 and 2.6% blended.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay.","Al Campbell","0.3 was new. Renewals were 5.7%...","Tom Grimes","Renewals were up 5.7%. Sorry, I'm...","Al Campbell","And new lease was a negative point.","Tom Grimes","And blended was 2.6%.","Al Campbell","I'm having trouble getting that out to today, Gaurav. New lease, negative 0.3%; renewal, positive 5.7%; blended, 2.6%. Sorry to reiterate on you our rate report.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Great. John Guinee here, thank you. Couple of questions. First, construction cost, up; rent, slower; land, not really moving down yet or landowners not reflecting lower expectations on land. What are the merchant builders targeting on a yield on costs relative to what's your targeting? And then second is, you've got about $57 million of land on your balance sheet, which looks to me like maybe that could support 2,000 to 3,000 units, what's your thinking on that land?","Eric Bolton","So the land that we do own, there is \u2013 you're right, there is some of it that we do believe we will want to move on, and we're particularly looking at sites in Dallas and then Raleigh currently. But as I alluded to in my opening comments based on where we are seeing the current environment cost coming out at, we are \u2013 we have not yet actually pull the trigger to start in these projects. We also have a site in Denver that we're excited to get underway at some point. My guess is these things will start to make more sense next year, and we will likely, I would hope, be underway with some of this next year.","As far as merchant builder, yield on cost, I don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019re looking to do, my guess is they\u2019re not probably, I mean, looking for yields sort of materially different than what we would look to achieve the differences that they\u2019re going to use a lot more leverage in order to sort of finance their investment, buildup and construction and so forth. And there\u2019s a consequence to that, come in with a pretty competitive blended cost to capital. But from our perspective, as we look at underwriting and look at the cost and the current leasing environment, we just \u2013 we\u2019ve elected to hold off on starting anything new just yet. I think, like I said, it make more sense next year.","John Guinee","Okay. And then the second comment is \u2013 it\u2019s look like you\u2019ve got about a $16 billion total enterprise value. And I think you quoted, maybe I got this wrong, about $112 million of redevelopment, kitchens and baths. Can that $112 million really even move the needle in terms of earnings growth or FFO growth?","Al Campbell","Yes. I mean, it clearly can, I think. I mean, you\u2019re talking roughly 30,000 apartments out of 100,000 apartments that we think have significant rent growth opportunities associated with it. It\u2019s not a \u2013 it doesn\u2019t happen in 1 quarter, even in 1 year. I mean, that\u2019s a 2- or 3-year endeavor. So it\u2019s a gradual sort of impact. But certainly, I think the impact, once complete, is pretty meaningful.","Tom Grimes","I\u2019ll just add to that...","Al Campbell","That\u2019s a just the Post portfolio. For the combined portfolio, It\u2019s more like a $170 million. I think Tom mentioned that.","Tom Grimes","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Al Campbell","Just saying, we\u2019ve done that program \u2013 done this program successfully for many years, and it does contribute somewhere 25 to 40 basis points of revenue over time \u2013 each annually as we do \u2013 if we do this program every year at the same pace. And of course, we think we\u2019ll ramp this program up with Post over the next few years given the opportunities.","John Guinee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Market. Please go ahead your line is open.","Neil Malkin","Hey, guys. Thanks. How much \u2013 can you talk about the OpEx opportunities or synergies? You\u2019ve obviously been very clear about the G&A and property management, but it sounds like you have some more levers to pull on the actual OpEx side. Can you just kind of talk about what that looks like heading into \u201818 and how that kind of feeds into what OpEx growth on the same-store basis could look like next year?","Tom Grimes","Sure. I\u2019ll take, certainly, the first part of it. The major driver on the operating expense is a combination of personnel and R&M cost. And we sort of blend those together as a total maintenance cost. And the post communities, we\u2019re running close to 40% higher than the MAA communities on a per unit basis. And really that was the combination of our scale, which is we were able to reduce their contract purchasing cost by 10%. We were able to cut some of their vendor cost like a contract painting about 50%. And during the year, what we\u2019ve been able to do is reduce that by about half, but we feel like Post is still about 20% higher than MAA. And it\u2019s just more of that sort of maturing at the platforms that will have another about 20% to go on that side of things.","Al Campbell","Just add that at all together, as you begin to look at next year, we\u2019re certainly not giving guidance at this point. But just thinking about next year is, you have the opportunity from the Post continue capture, as Tom mentioned. We have general control on all the other expenses for the business. And then if you think about real estate taxes, it\u2019s 1\/3 of that line item, it\u2019s been our biggest pressure over the last few years, and it should begin moderating some. I mean, it will take several years for it to get back down to normal long-term run rate levels. But given the performance in Dallas and Austin and some of the Texas markets, and Texas being the biggest piece of that, we would expect some moderation to begin next year, helping us feel good about expenses for the full year next year.","Neil Malkin","All right, got you. And then on the other revenue side. On a per-unit basis, it seems like it\u2019s been \u2013 it actually has been going negative slightly this year compared to your rental revenue growth. Can you talk about why that\u2019s happening? And do you see that kind of reversing course next year? What kind of get that going or stop slowing like it is currently?","Tom Grimes","It\u2019s primarily occupancy related on volume. And we think is that, that picks up, we will pick up there as well.","Al Campbell","And part of it in third quarter, it was also reimbursements, which is utilities expenses, and utilities expenses was lower in the third quarter than it has been. And so the reimbursement for that a little lower as well. And so over time, that will change as well.","Neil Malkin","I agree. And then last one for me is, if you look at the job markets, your footprint pretty much screens the best out of any of the peers in terms of just strength of jobs and where [indiscernible] are pretty strong as well, particularly in the secondary markets. Just \u2013 could you comment on why you think you haven\u2019t seen that parlay into maybe stronger blended rents or more strength on the newly side rather?","Eric Bolton","Well, I think, I mean, what happened is that the supply trends, I think, have been gradually picking up. I think that, as we talked about earlier, I think as we get later in the cycle, these lease-up projects and the merchant builders who brought them online gets a little bit more aggressive in what they\u2019re prepared to do in terms of pricing to achieve move-ins sooner. And as a consequence to that, I think we just happen to be at an inflection point in this third quarter where those trends really became pretty much more significant than what we\u2019ve seen earlier in the year.","I think this will dissipate over the next 2 or 3 quarters as these projects get leased up. As I alluded to, the permitting is clearly expected to come down. And I think the sort of relationship between demand and supply starts to work more favorably in our direction over the back half of next year. We\u2019ve had consistently steady strong demand as you point out as a consequence to good job growth in these markets that we\u2019re in. It\u2019s just that the supply side of the equation has created this moderation, and developer pricing tactics have become a little more aggressive at this point in the cycle. And so we're just at that point in the process or in the cycle where it's kind of the tough point, and we see it sort of troughing over the next couple of quarters and then starting a climb back.","And I've always believed very much in the merits of deploying capital in a way where the demand is likely to be there and be the strongest over a full cycle. We know we're going to deal with supply pressures from time to time, and that there'll be points in the process where there's \u2013 the pressure gets pretty intense and you just kind of put your head down and grind through it, and that's kind of where we are right now. But I think that we have a lot of confidence in the markets that we're in long term because of what you're alluding to, because we know demand is likely to be there better than what we see in a lot of other markets across the country.","Neil Malkin","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go to next Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Buck, your line is open. Please check your mute function.","Buck Horne","Sorry about that. Good morning, guys. I think you guys have been pretty clear about the supply being the major issue. But just given where we stood at the end of July and kind of the sharpness of the deterioration or just the guidance reduction that occurred relative to where we stood last quarter, I just want to be clear that you think the pressure really is coming from external supply issues. Or was there any issue internally when you rebooted the Post LRO system? Was there any sort of hiccup internally that may have caused any revenue hiccup?","Eric Bolton","Buck, this is Eric. Absolutely not. We have not had any internal hiccup or however you want to define it at all. And we \u2013 the surprise frankly \u2013 and we have a lot of concentration of assets in Dallas in that uptown area. And that, in particular, is where we saw some pretty aggressive pricing practices really kick in. As we said at the end of July, we were matching prior year occupancy. Our blended rent growth across both portfolios was moving in a positive direction. And for the quarter, we candidly had a very difficult prior year occupancy comparison to deal with, particularly on the Post side of all things. They really rent up the occupancy in Q3 last year.","Now it materially fell off right after that, particularly as you get towards the end of the year and into next year. But they had a very full portfolio third quarter of last year, so we had a difficult comp. I mean what's interesting to look at when you just look at sort of where we came in, our revenues relative to our expectation, the vast majority of the miss, if you want to think about it that way, was occupancy. And so 27 basis points difference in terms of this year's occupancy, effective daily occupancy versus last year's effective daily It was really strong this year, but it was really, really strong last year.","So 27 basis points off, and that's what really \u2013 we thought we could get there, but we \u2013 as we start heading into the winter, we thought we better back off a little bit on some of these pricing practices and try to get that occupancy protected as best as we can as we head into the winter months. And as we start to look at sort of what's happening in the market, we thought, I think it's going to be a slugfest to some of these submarkets for the next, call it, two quarters. And then you get on top of that kind of normal seasonal activity. And when you put all of that together, it suggest to us that we ought to sort of adjust as we have.","Buck Horne","Okay, that's very helpful color. And going back to the supply outlook for going into next year. You mentioned you're feeling better, that's about the second half of next year with permitting trends. But maybe just thinking a bit more broadly in terms of your secondary markets and maybe just your suburban locations, whether it's legacy MAA or otherwise, are you starting to see developers push out into the more suburban or secondary markets to \u2013 chasing a little bit more development yield? How does the supply outlook look out there?","Eric Bolton","We haven't really seen any pressure there, Buck. And may the outlook next year is better than this year in that segment of portfolio. I mean, these \u2013 I knew sooner or later these secondary markets would outperform the large markets. And finally, we're here. And it's been that way now, last quarter and this quarter, and probably that way for the next couple of quarters. So they're doing exactly what they're supposed to do for us, and we're not seeing anything change in terms of pressure in those markets. I think they're holding up quite well.","Tom Grimes","And Buck, where we think about an improvement in terms of deliveries for '18, it's actually in large markets. Atlanta drops from 8,600 to 6,500, Charlotte goes down from 5,100 to 3,300, Houston gets a ton better and Orlando actually improves modestly as does Tampa. So those were \u2013 that's really where we think of it, it's improving in those markets.","Buck Horne","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go to next to Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Going back to the guidance, specifically, on same-store revenue. So your prior guidance assume that you would have same-store revenue accelerate in the back half of the year and part of that was because of new lease growth also improving. And so I'm trying to understand your previous thinking of why you thought that was reasonable that would happen, especially when you have 25% exposure in Atlanta and Dallas, where there is a lot of supply. Why are you still optimistic now versus building in some caution?","Eric Bolton","Yes, I'll start and then I'll let Al. Because new lease pricing have been steadily climbing for seven months straight and there had never been a decline until we got to August. And so it was moving at a very steady pace up. And in Dallas, in particular, and somewhat in Austin, we saw pricing practices and the market get considerably more aggressive as we start to get towards the end of leasing season and efforts are made to get stabilized. The four things really slow down when you get into the holiday season. Based on what we saw happening, it suggested to us that we should moderate our thinking a little bit. But until we got to August, new lease pricing across both portfolios was steadily improving and steadily moving up. And we \u2013 July was the best month we'd had. So that's sort of what feels it a little bit. And Al...","Al Campbell","I'll just give you what was in there, and exactly \u2013 Eric's point was exactly what occurred. And so if you remember talking about it, Nick, we said what we were seeing was very good in July. We're seeing blended pricing of 3%. So we felt like that, that the trends are great. We carry that through the year. Say we'll get blended pricing of 3% a little better for the year, we'll get occupancy on top of the prior year levels. And so though occupancy in the third quarter was very good. And 96.1%, it was a very tough comp to the prior year. And that was the biggest piece and then reach the 96.3%. And so blended pricing we dig, it was 2.6%. It's good pricing, but didn't reach the \u2013 we saw the falloff.","And on August and September in primary locations that Tom and Eric talked about. So that's what occurred. It caused us to look at fourth quarter and then roll that through the fourth quarter, put a little bit more seasonality and normal trends in our forecast now. Having said that, we still believe, as we talked about, in the positive attributes to come. And revenue, the next several quarters from the Post in the premise we're doing practices, that is still to come. It's just taking a little bit more time in terms of laying out in the future than what we have before.","Nick Yulico","Right. I guess, it goes back to an issue that's tapping before in the multifamily industry where companies are looking at pricing data realtime and then supply hits and there's an impact, and it's a surprise to negative. And it goes back to, I guess, the question of how you actually forecasting with future supply impact. And so I'm wondering if you've changed your thinking now. As you are still going through some markets like Dallas, Atlanta, others where there's meaningful supply, does that change how you think about ultimately when you get a forecast for 2018 and the supply impact?","Al Campbell","Certainly rolled into fourth quarter, a change. As we talk about, we took our \u2013 you just saw the guidance come down and we moderate to more seasonal norms. And so as we have to look \u2013 we haven't \u2013 we have to look at '18 and consider that. We'll certainly enter 2018 with expectations to continue capturing on the Post side of the business as well as the normal seasonality in the supply trends.","Eric Bolton","Yes, I think where you can get surprise, frankly, Nick, is when you see practices get noticeably more aggressive and given submarkets or markets. And if you happen to have as we do, a fair amount of concentration in a given market or two, it can create a era of conservatism or skepticism about what the future is going to look like versus what you were thinking before. I mean, we think, we're going to \u2013 as I've said, I mean, we think we're going to do great on renewal pricing as we have been, as Tom alluded to. I mean, our January renewal notices went out at 7%. We think that the occupancy comparisons start to get a little bit easier, but the new lease pricing got noticeably weaker in July and September.","And as a consequence of some pretty aggressive actions that we stalk coming into the market, and we happen to have a lot in Dallas and Austin, as you know. And so that's really the story. There was nothing more to it than that. And the occupancy as it relates to Q3, the occupancy being off last year by 27 basis points was the vast majority of, if you will, the miss in terms of revenue expectations. Of course, we also have some pressure on expenses from the hurricane, the both hurricanes. Now as we start to look forward, we think these practices in Dallas and Austin will be there for a while. So we're going to dilute it into our expectations. We think the expenses get better. We will \u2013 we're past hurricane season now, so we'll be back to where we have been running. And that's what caused us to pull our same-store guidance for operating expenses down from what we have before, and it's where we came out.","Nick Yulico","Okay, it's helpful. Just lastly on Atlanta, what is your outlook for that market? I mean, that's one where there's still fair amount of supply delivering numbers having gotten down to the point of Dallas at this point. But how do you think where you are in the supply impact stage for Atlanta and how that market could perform in the coming quarters?","Tom Grimes","I mean, I think, next year, we're encouraged about continued strong growth and job growth and a falloff in \u2013 a falloff there and \u2013 excuse me, continued strong growth and a falloff on job growth and a falloff on deliveries compounded with just steady improvement on the Post side. I think those things will work in our.","Eric Bolton","When you look at Atlanta next year, I mean, the projections that we have today, which will certainly be updating as we approach forecasting for 2018. But the ratio of job growth in that market to supply deliveries is around 7:1. That's a pretty healthy dynamic. And so we think Atlanta will continue to outperform Dallas next year.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Tayo Okusanya","First question, when you start to look at 4Q 2017 trends, specifically October trends, anything you're seeing in their that starts to make you feel a little bit better about the supply issue in some of the markets that you highlight in?","Tom Grimes","I think the markets that we're worried about, primarily Dallas and Austin, will continue to be under pressure in the fourth quarter. We think job growth will continue to be good, and we'll just sort of grind it out next year. One encouraging, it \u2013 really a same-store level, is from September to October, Post blended rates moved up from one point to \u2013 Post blended rates moved up 40 basis points.","Tayo Okusanya","Got you. Okay. And then the second one for Al. Al, I\u2019m still trying to reconcile the kind of guidance, $0.02 increase at the midpoint because the $0.03 benefit from the nonrental \u2013 from the derivative income, you\u2019re reversing that out in 4Q. And so the $0.02 increase, if I\u2019m getting this right, is there\u2019s lower same-store NOI growth, but there\u2019s better G&A and better leasing of development. Is that the way I should be thinking about this that kind of all net out?","Al Campbell","I think that\u2019s exactly right, Tayo. Let me just give you how exactly. So we had $0.06 performance in third quarter that carry, let\u2019s push that forward and coming out of that to the $0.02 revision is preferred. We\u2019ve taken $0.02 that that\u2019s going to turn around. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but certainly going to be volatile. Interest rates go up is likely to come back. And then combined same-store vision plus all the other things going on, do take another $0.02 per share. Adding the $0.04, so it gets down to two impact for the full year. And so you are on point exactly what\u2019s happening.","Tayo Okusanya","Gotcha. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we can take our last question from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Dennis McGill","Hi, thank you guys. First one, just on the fourth quarter guidance, I guess, the question I would have when you go through and revise based how much is on the third quarter, you\u2019re still up for the fairly wide range and especially for a quarter where there\u2019s not a lot of leasing activity, still to be decided. So can you just maybe explain, kind of thoughts playing that and what would drive results to either end of that spectrum?","Al Campbell","Biggest \u2013 I think the biggest thing would be occupancy performance off, that\u2019s \u2013 let me \u2013 if you think about it, you only have 1 quarter to go. I mean, rental pricing takes more time to really build in. So it would be occupancy and then all the things going on with expenses and other. We feel good about where occupancy is today. We feel like that the exposure is low, as Tom mentioned. So we \u2013 our forecast is built on that expectation. It feels like pretty solid, but it can\u2019t change and so we left room for that in 2% to 2.5% in the revenues because things can change. But...","Eric Bolton","One of the challenges with that occupancy variable and forecasting it is that it has a very meaningful impact on a quarter, particularly when you\u2019re talking about 100,000 apartments. A 50 basis point swing or 20 basis point swing on that many units in terms of average data occupancy equates out to a meaningful number. So I think that really rationalizes why we have the range that we do. And it also is the factors that would cause us to be at the upper end or lower end of that range. So a difference on occupancy, no question about it.","Dennis McGill","Okay. Can you just remind me what the percentage of leases that are expiring this quarter would represent?","Tom Grimes","We\u2019re \u2013 we intentionally bring lease expirations down, and they range from 5% to 6% a month. So that would be \u2013","Eric Bolton","It\u2019s 15% to 18%.","Tom Grimes","Yes, 15% to 18%.","Eric Bolton","It\u2019s going to be below 20% of the portfolio.","Dennis McGill","Okay, great. And then last question, just, Eric, you had made a comment about the valuations not seeming to \u2013 certainly maybe in elevated today and you have a very logical argument about why you would likely see deterioration as you move into next year with all that\u2019s going on with lease-ups and development, and so forth. Why do think the market hasn\u2019t gotten in front of that with respect to valuations today? Why are they not adjusting before that were to happen versus simultaneously?","Eric Bolton","I don\u2019t know, Dennis. I think that \u2013 I mean, capital investment capital likes multifamily. I mean, there\u2019s a lot to like there long term, and there\u2019s a lot of good things \u2013 as you well know, a lot of good things on the demographics and lifestyle and all those other kind of factors that suggest that multifamily real estate is going to be good. And if you have any kind of multiyear horizon to how you\u2019re willing to think about deploying capital into that kind of demand dynamic, I think people \u2013 compared to alternatives in the commercial real estate spectrum, it stacks up pretty darn well. And so I think that\u2019s ultimately what is causing, I think, despite some moderation and leasing fundamentals. Compared to alternatives, multifamily still looks pretty darn good.","Dennis McGill","Okay, great. Appreciated the perspectives. Good luck guys. ","Eric Bolton","Thank you, Dennis.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today\u2019s Q&A session. I can turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Eric Bolton","No additional comments from us. And we hope to see everyone, November 13th, at our Investor Day in Dallas. And everyone, take care. Thank you.","Al Campbell","Thank you, Savannah.","Operator","You\u2019re very welcome.

Welcome to the MAA Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the companies will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a remainder this conference is being recorded today January 31, 2019.","I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. Please go ahead, sir.","Timothy Argo","Thank you, Denise and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel.","Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning I would like to point out that as part of the discussion company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website.","During this call we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com.","I'll now turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Tim and good morning. We wrapped up 2018 slightly ahead of where we expected with FFO per share of $6.06 per share excluding the non-cash mark-to-market accounting adjustment related to the preferred shares. We're encouraged with our fourth quarter results as a positive trends and rent growth and high occupancy are clearly evident while the new supply pipeline in several markets will challenge near-term rent growth. We're encouraged with the continued strong demand for apartment housing across our markets.","Our portfolio continues to benefit from strong job growth and overall high demand for apartment housing. We continue to believe that new supply pressure in 2019 will remain elevated but down slightly from 2018. Tom will cover more details concerning our higher concentration markets, but broadly when weighted our market exposures by percentage of NOI and refining the analysis to neighborhood-specific assessments of new supply, our latest update is very similar to the information we shared at NAREIT in November.","In summary, we expect 48% of our portfolios' market exposure will show some level of improvement in 2019 with lower supply as compared to prior year. 44% of our market exposure is expected to see slightly higher levels of new delivery in 2019. And 8% of the portfolio exposure will see current year deliveries in line with prior year new deliveries. Assuming the demand side equation remains strong we expect the positive pricing momentum we've seen over the back half of 2018 to continue through calendar year 2019.","As we continue to work through the later stages of the current cycle we do expect to see developers get a little more aggressive with their lease-up tactics and have dialed that into our expectations for 2019. With the goal of maximizing long-term revenue results we remain focused on continuing to capture the encouraging trends in rent growth.","Given where we are in the cycle, we expect that it might come at the cost of a low current occupancy, but let me be clear about this. As Al, will outline in his comments we do expect to post strong occupancy in 2019 of 95.9% average daily occupancy throughout the year which represents only a slight 20 basis point moderation from the record high 96.1% average daily occupancy throughout 2018.","As commented in our third quarter earnings release our merger integration activities are now complete. We're very pleased with the results over the last couple of years in harvesting the expense synergies we had previously identified surrounding property level operating expenses and G&A overhead costs. We do expect to see year-over-year growth and expenses begin to normalize in 2019.","As expected the opportunities on the revenue side of the equation surrounding various revenue management practices and significant redevelopment opportunities within the legacy Post portfolio have been slower to capture than the expense side given the new supply pressures in a number of markets. However, despite this pressure the improving pricing trends within the legacy Post portfolio over the past couple of quarters are encouraging.","And in addition we will be executing on our higher number of redeveloped opportunities this year within that part of the portfolio. Our four projects in lease-up continue to become increasingly productive and in line with our expectations. We expect to see all four properties stabilize over the course of this year. We expect to see our new development projects in Raleigh and Denver begin initial leasing and occupancy over the back half of this year with our newest project in the Frisco submarket of North Dallas coming online early next year.","We started a new expansion project at our Copper Ridge community in North Fort Worth this month on existing owned land. At this point, we're also working pre-development at new development projects in Phoenix, Denver, Orlando and Houston that were expect to start later this year. In summary, we're encouraged with the continued momentum in pricing that we're capturing despite the new supply headwinds in several of our larger markets.","We believe our portfolio focused on the strong job growth Sunbelt region diversified across markets submarkets and price points appealing to the largest segments of the real markets continue to position MAA for solid performance over the full real estate cycle. Our balance sheet is in a strong position and certainly able to support the external growth opportunities we're currently executing on, in any others that may emerge. After two years of merger activities that are now complete our platform is stable and stronger. We look forward to the performance opportunities in 2019.","I'm going to turn the call over to Tom now.","Thomas Grimes","Thank you, Eric and good morning, everyone. Our operating performance for the fourth quarter came in as expected with building momentum in rent growth, continued strong average daily occupancy and improving trends that set us up well for 2019. The results of the integration work on the operating platform were evident in our leasing momentum during the quarter. We saw blended lease-over-lease performance of the combined portfolio grow by 1.6% in the fourth quarter which is 150 basis points higher than the same time last year.","Average daily occupancy remained strong at 96.1%, as a result of the steady positive trend and blended pricing we saw revenues buck seasonal trends and they accelerated from 2% in the third quarter to 2.3% in the fourth quarter. All elevated supply levels have pressured rent growth in several of our markets particularly Dallas and Austin.","We're still seeing good revenue growth in a number of our other markets. Among our highest concentration markets Phoenix, Richmond, Tampa and Orlando are our strongest revenue growth markets. Expense performance was steady for the fourth quarter at 3%. This includes 5.8% growth in real estate taxes which was partially offset by reductions in building repair and maintenance as well as marketing.","For the year our total expense growth was just 2%, while we've captured the scale and labor opportunities available during this merger, we still expect to continue our disciplined expense practices. Our annual operating expense growth rate since 2012 has been just 2.4% well below the sector average. The favorable trends continued into January. All pricing indicators are trending ahead of last year.","Currently, same-store January blended lease-over-lease rates are up a healthy 3.1% which is 260 basis points better than January of last year. Average daily occupancy for the month is a strong 96%. Our 60-day exposure which represents all vacant units and move-out notices for a 60-day period is a low 7.2%. We are well-positioned for 2019.","Our focus on customer service and retention coupled with social trends supporting steady renter demand continued to drop down resident turnover. Move-outs for the overall same-store portfolio were down 7% for the quarter. Move-outs to homebuying and move-outs to home renting were down 5% and 12%, respectively.","On a rolling 12-month basis, turnover was at historic low of 48.5%. This level of turnover was achieved while increasing renewal rents, at notable 6.1%. On the redevelopment front, in the fourth quarter we completed 1,600 units which brought us to a total of 8,200 unit interior upgrades for the year. For 2019, we again expect to complete close to 8000 unit interior upgrades.","As a reminder, on average we spent $6,100 per unit and charge an additional 11% in rent which generates a year one cash-on-cash return in excess of 20%. Our total redevelopment pipeline now stands in the neighborhood of 17,500 to 20,500 units. Our active lease-up communities, Sync36 and Post River North in Denver, Post Centennial Park in Atlanta and Phase two of 1201 Midtown and Mount Pleasant \u2013 in the Mount Pleasant submarket of Charleston are all leasing up in line with expectations.","Looking forward as Eric mentioned our overall supply in our markets is expected to improve modestly in 2019. We take the third-party data and crosscheck this supply data with our own asset-by-asset information. Performance by market will vary but at this point we believe overall we will see some decline in deliveries.","Our Dallas and Austin assets are expected to remain challenging with supplier levels continuing in the 3% to 4% of inventory range. We expect Charlotte to soften as supply picks up near our assets. We expect the strength in Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa and Phoenix to continue as all currently show supply decreasing.","We're pleased to have the merger integration wrapped up and greatly appreciate the tireless efforts of our associates as we retool the company over the last two years. We are starting 2019 in a much better position than 2018 and we look forward to the coming year. Al?","Albert Campbell","Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's fourth quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally on the key components of our initial guidance for 2019.","FFO for the fourth quarter was $1.55 per share which included $0.02 per share of non-cash expense related to the accounting adjustment of preferred shares acquired during the Post merger. Excluding this adjustment our FFO per share for the fourth quarter was a penny above the midpoint of our prior guidance with majority of this outperformance produced by favorable interest expense during the quarter.","Our overall same-store performance for the fourth quarter is in line with our expectations as continued pricing momentum produced a 2.3% year-over-year growth and total revenues which accelerated as Tom mentioned are from the 2% in the third quarter. Overall blended lease pricing growth combined new and renewal pricing finished the year, the full year of 2.5% which was 80 basis points above the prior year.","Same-store expense growth of 3% for the fourth quarter was primarily driven by a 5.8% growth in real estate tax expense which represents 36% of total same-store operating expenses as pressure late in there from certain municipalities primarily Atlanta and Dallas impacted in fourth quarter. And for the full year real estate tax expense grew 4.2% as compared to our initial guidance of 3.5% to 4.5% for the year.","During the fourth quarter we completed construction of one development community an expansion community a, phase of community in Charleston which leads to three committees undeveloped \u2013 under development at year-end with a total projected cost of $118.5 million of which about $87.5 million remain to be funding as of year-end. We also acquired two land parcels during the fourth quarter, one in Denver and one in Houston both related to planned new development projects expected to begin during 2019.","Given our current pipeline and planned new projects we expect total construction funding to increase in 2019 ranging between $100 million and $150 million. We continue to expect NOI yields of 6% to 6.5% on average from our development portfolio once they're completed and fully stabilized.","During the fourth quarter we had two communities completely leased up and reached stabilization which we measure as 90% occupancy for greater than 90 days. And we saw four communities in lease-up at year-end including the recently completed community we mentioned earlier. Average occupancy for our lease-up portfolio ended the year at 62.4%.","As Tom mentioned, leasing has gone well for the group and we expect growing earnings contribution during 2019 and to the 2020 as two of these communities are projected to stabilize in the first half of the year and the final two stabilizing later in the year.","Our balance sheet remains in great shape at year-end. During the fourth quarter we had a fairly significant amount of financing activity as we paid off the final $80 million of Fannie Mae secured credit facility which matured in December and additional $530 million of secured mortgages maturing in early 2019.","Given the volatility of the credit markets during the fourth quarter we revised our financing plans and entered a 30-year fixed-rate secured mortgage for $172 million and a $300 million variable-rate unsecured six-month term loan which we expect to replace in 2019 with additional fixed-rate financing.","At the end of the year, we had over $490 million of combined cash capacity under our credit facility. Our leverage as defined by our bond covenants was only 32.6%, while our net debt-to-recurring EBITDAre was just below 5x.","Finally, we are providing initial earnings guidance for 2019 with the release which is detailed in our supplemental information package. We're providing guidance for net income per diluted common share which is reconciled to FFO and AFFO per share in supplement. We're also providing guidance and other key business metrics expected to drive performance in 2019.","Also, though we do expect to continue volatility in our NAREIT reported FFO results related to the non-cash accounting adjustment on the preferred shares, we did not include the adjustments in our forecast as these are both non-cash and really impractical to predict.","Net income per diluted common shares projected to be $2.11 to $2.35 for the full-year 2019. FFO is projected to be $6.03 to $6.27, or $6.15 at the midpoint. AFFO is projected to be $5.39 to $5.63 per share, or $5.51 at the midpoint.","The main driver of full-year 2019 performance is our same-store guidance. Revenue growth projected to be 2.3% at the midpoint is based on continued strong average daily occupancy of 95.9% at the midpoint. And projected average blended rent pricing which is new leases and renewals combined of 2.7% for the year, which is a modest improvement over 2018. We expect operating expenses to grow at 3.1% at the midpoint coming off of two years of very low expense growth.","We expect real estate taxes to continue to produce the most pressure increasing $4.25 at the midpoint. And this expected same-store revenue and operating expense performance produces NOI growth of 1.8% at the midpoint. We expect the acquisition environment to remain competitive. We project total acquisition volume for 2019 to range between $125 million and $175 million and to consist primarily of non-stabilized deals.","We also plan to resume our portfolio recycling efforts projected disposition volume of $75 million to $125 million likely closing in the second half of the year. We expect the end of 2019 with our leverage near current levels as a percentage of gross assets producing an average effective interest rate of 3.9% or 4.1%, which is about 20 basis points above the prior year at the midpoint which represents $0.08 per share impact to our earnings.","A portion of this projected increase is related to the continued impact of rising short-term interest rates with the remaining portion primarily due to the declining mark-to-market adjustment related to the debt acquired from Colonial and Post mergers as the favorable fair market value adjustments from both mergers essentially burned off during 2018.","Our guidance also assumes total overhead cost which we included G&A and property management expenses combined will range between $96.5 million and $98.5 million, reflecting more normalized run rate for 2019 which includes a full-year carry of investments we made in our people, facilities, systems and web presence to improve our operating platform capabilities, scalability, our cybersecurity with all of this which was planned as part of the merger integration efforts.","Our total overhead cost for 2018 were actually below our original estimates for the year and actually declined from 2017 primarily due to timing of some of these planned investments and the impact of several non-recurring items during the year, which impacted legal, casualty insurance and medical insurance policies for the year. We expect our total overhead growth for the longer term to be around 5% annually which is in line with the sector average.","That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So operator, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our first question from Trent from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Trent Trujillo","Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions.","Eric Bolton","Hi, Trent.","Trent Trujillo","Good morning. You called out supply pressures in Austin, Charlotte plus Dallas and Atlanta continue to see high levels of permitting new supply. And very much thank you for breaking out your NOIs into higher and lower and similar supply buckets for 2019. But how can you be confident in your ability to assert pricing power and show same-store revenue acceleration at the aggregate level, if these pressures persist in your largest markets? And I guess another way of saying this, can you maybe talk about the magnitude of supply increases versus the magnitude of decline?","Eric Bolton","Let me start. Trent, this is Eric and Tom can give you some more specifics. I mean, our confidence if you will as it pertains to 2019 rent growth despite the supply pressures is really based in what we see as continued very strong demand. And we see no evidence that the demand side of the equation is weakening. We continue to see very low move-out occurring and the job growth numbers continue to be encouraging.","So with that level of demand when we start looking at our particular locations and as Tom mentioned in his call we take the AXIO data and other sort of macro level data and we do a deep dive with it, into specific neighborhoods and so forth where we're located. And ultimately we do see this mix of roughly 48% of the portfolio suggesting slightly lower supply pressure 44% slightly higher and about 8% being pretty consistent, but really the confidence that we have is really driven by the demand side of the equation.","As long as that's there, we think the rent trends that we're seeing are going to continue to hold up. One other thing I'll add, I do believe that as we get later in the cycle that developers may get evermore aggressive with some of their lease-up practices in an effort to get little quicker. And that's what really \u2013 we haven't seen any evidence of that yet, but I think it's the reasonable to expect that it may come in certain areas. And that really led us to introduce the notion that, we'll maintain strong occupancy, but it may not be quite at 96.1% that we did in 2018.","We believe that really to protect long-term revenue growth that \u2013 rent growth really matters and we wanted to continue to capture that rent growth trend that we're seeing. We think we'll do so, and to counter the cost of a little occupancy in 2019, we're, okay with that. We think that's a right long-term play to make.","Thomas Grimes","All right. And then just underlying trend, the confidence on the revenue side, the rent trends I'll touch on for Q4 and January just to put those in perspective for first quarter blended rents increase was 45 basis points better than last year. And second quarter was 100 basis points better, third quarter 60 basis points, fourth quarter 150 basis points. In January, 260 basis points. So we feel good about the underlying results that we're seeing on the pricing trends.","Trent Trujillo","Okay. That's great color. Thank you very much. As it relates to the transaction market on the third quarter call, Eric you mentioned that you're seeing perhaps some early indications that deal flow might come back to you as things were starting to fray a little bit. It may have been very preliminary, but your guidance does call for some lease-up acquisitions and you stated significant capacity on your balance sheet. So can you maybe give us an update on how you're viewing the transaction market, the deal flow? What opportunities are out there? What are you looking at? And how competitive it is to find accretive deal that meets your standards at this time?","Eric Bolton","So, it's still very, very competitive. As you may know, I mean, the market tends to take a little bit of a breather during the very early part of the year. I know our transaction team is out at the Nashville Housing Conference for a broker event. It has become almost annual meeting right now. And they usually come back with a lot of leads if you will, a lot of opportunities. I know they're talking about this week. There continues to be just a high level of interest by private capital in the space. So we fully expect that this next year 2019 will be as competitive as what we saw in 2018.","But having said that, again, we're just getting later in the cycle, and I think that some of the lease-up properties will perhaps run into a little bit more headwind than what they may have experienced in 2018, and as a consequence of that we're hopeful that, that may create a little pressure which create some better buying opportunities for us. We are going to remain disciplined but we continue to have hope that the 2019 is going to deliver a few more opportunities. I mean, the volume is still high, but we're going to continue to remain optimistic about 2019 opportunities.","Trent Trujillo","All right. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it.","Eric Bolton","You bet.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our next question from Nick from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. It's been two years, but now that the integration with the Post is complete, have you seen any difference in same-store growth and margins in 2019 between the two portfolios?","Thomas Grimes","Yes. Hey, Nick. This is Tom. What we're really seeing \u2013 in Mid-America is $2.6 and portfolio to Post is $1.7. What to me is most interesting is the rate of acceleration on the Post side which was second quarter $0.4 and now $0.7 \u2013 $1.7. That's on the revenue growth side.","Eric Bolton","Yes, what I would say Nick is that, we saw incredible opportunities that we harvested in the first two years on the expense side of the equation as we renegotiated contracts and got some very huge benefits of scale that we're able to bring to the Post portfolio on the expense side as well as sort of retooling some of the practices in turn activities and with labor cost, and that's what really fueled some pretty low year-over-year expense growth that we've had for the last two years not only \u2013 and particularly in the Post portfolio, but in aggregate, the overall MAA portfolio had pretty strong expense performance, but what's been slower to come online has been the opportunities on the revenue side, and a lot of that is a function of really three things.","First of all you've got a \u2013 there's some training and then there's some people things that you have to sort of get stabilize and get right and that takes a little time. Two, the market conditions as a function of higher supply levels have been more pressuring the Post locations which is \u2013 we're battling that.","And then, a third we have to just basically get into the revenue management practices. And as you know particularly when the opportunity lies in the area of rent growth it takes time for that momentum to build. You have to go through a full leasing cycle and reprice portfolio and bring all of the training and all of the revenue practices together.","And as what Tom is alluding to there which gives us a lot of encouragement is, the improving pricing trends that we're seeing out of the legacy Post portfolio are far superior than what we're seeing on the MAA portfolio. So it does suggest us that we're going to see continued momentum.","And then as I mentioned in my comments earlier too, next year we'll be redeveloping more of the Post portfolio as a percentage of what we do in terms of overall redevelopment. So, I think we're going to continue to see the momentum and the opportunities on the revenue side come together more so over the next couple of years.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. And then just on the total overhead, obviously up pretty meaningfully over 2018. Can you walk through the main drivers of that? And then is this 2019 guidance a good baseline going forward? Or are there any onetime items in there?","Albert Campbell","Hey, Nick. This is Al. I can walk you through that, and I think 2019 certainly compared to 2018 was a fairly significant increase, but it has a lot to do really with some activity in 2018 and there was a little bit of noise still in the year relates to some of the things going on. So if you look at 2018 it actually declined from 2017 and was a little bit lower than what we had put out initially in our guidance early on in the year, only for couple of reasons.","One, as we're making investments for an integration and for the platform that we knew that we're going to put together we some of those came later, than we expected as we wanted to get deeper into the project into the process and really zero \u2013 on exactly what we wanted, and what we wanted to invest in to make our platform and what we wanted to be in the future.","So 2018 was lower, 2019 you feel the full run rate of that and then we had some onetime items in 2018, some cost that are due and payable, that won't recur in 2019 and some of the insurance and workers' comp and real insurance and medical insurance, since our medical costs were been lower. We're glad to have that \u2013 we don't think that will repeat in 2019. So what I will say is 2019 is a fairly large increase.","We would expect as you move to 2020, we have a more modest increase. We think that 2019 is a full-year run rate of our platform that we expect and I think if you look at our three-year windows, I talked about the decline in 2018, rise in 2019 and a more modest rise in 2020. We expect it to be in line with the long-term sector average of 5% to 6%. That's how we built it.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. It\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","We'll go ahead and take the next question from Austin from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead your line is open.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi, good morning. You guys mentioned you started out the year with blended lease rates of over 3% in January, but the average, I think you're assuming for the full year is 2.7%. So just curious what leads you to believe that lease rates will moderate later into the year?","Eric Bolton","I'll start with that and Tom can jump in. I think one of the things going on is, as you remember we had some pretty favorable comparison on some leasing activity late last year. Fourth quarter last year is when it really got challenging before. Since, I think some of the new leases we're putting on and as we move into January, are really strong comparisons. I think as we move into the year as Tom will say that that may moderate somewhat, but we feel good that we've got\u2026","Thomas Grimes","No. Absolutely that sort of trend that I rattled off a little bit earlier we'll have to start comparing to that. And so we've got \u2013 the comparisons we've got good opportunity first part of the year, but don't expect to keep 3.1 all the way through.","Austin Wurschmidt","Is that a function? I understand that, that from a spread perspective that the spreads become more difficult, but from an absolute level I guess, is it just your, you are cautious to push rent on the same tenant two years in a row at a consistent level or in order to kind of, in order to sustain occupancy or I guess, I don't fully understand the comp discussion in a stable supply environment. I would think maybe you could still push I guess at a similar rate. So can you just dive in a little bit there?","Thomas Grimes","I mean, on the same resident back-to-back that's on the renewal side, and renewals are strengthening, and I feel very comfortable with that in the 6% to 7% range, right now \u2013 right now, the variable is on the new lease rates and we do \u2013 we think we will have good performance there just not the same gap that we had prior.","Eric Bolton","But also adding to that, we certainly intend and expect that our ability to push rents in 2019 will be comparable to what we did in 2018. We don't see any reason to suggest that we're going to have to back off. And the only thing that is different if you will in 2019 versus 2018 is that we think as we continue that same level of push on pricing as we get later in the cycle and we get \u2013 I think most of the information I've seen for AXIO and others suggest that the \u2013 we've got the peak in deliveries in Q2 rather than start of the spring leasing season.","It may come at the cost that, that pushing on pricing may come at the cost of a little bit of a give up on occupancy. And we just think it's important to be willing to make that trade-off right now, in order to sort of protect the long-term revenue goals that we have. So, but to answer your question, no we absolutely don't believe we're going to need to back off on, pushing on the rents. It's just that the prior year comparisons that we're comparing against are just a little harder as we get later in the year.","Austin Wurschmidt","That's helpful. And then as far as the peaking in the second quarter, I mean, what have you seen as far as construction delays in your markets? Are you continuing to see them or have they started to slow a bit?","Eric Bolton","Yes, about \u2013 all I can tell you is I'm sure construction delays will continue. I think there's been no evidence whatsoever that the labor issues have gotten any easier and that typically is what's causing a lot of the delays to occur. The information that I alluded to that we saw from AXIO suggesting that it would peak in Q2. I fully expect that to slide a little bit into Q3. So I don't know at this point, something we're watching very, very closely, but I wouldn't fully expect some of these projects to slip a little bit over the course of the year.","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay. Thanks. And just last one, I'm just curious if you \u2013 in your forecast when do you see supply growth in your submarkets in Dallas begin to moderate?","Thomas Grimes","We're seeing some early signs that it may moderate late in the year, but I think Dallas is going to be challenging for the pretty much for the full-year. Its way too early to call the end on that one and we will be challenging particularly the first two quarters of the year.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thanks guys. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our next question from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","Thank you. On your occupancy guidance for the year, I relate it's only 20 basis points but do you believe as far as the turnover rate will increase during the year? Or it'll take longer to lease-up vacant units or a combination of both?","Eric Bolton","It's hard to know. I would say likely, I would think more likely it's going to come primarily through, just slightly higher average number of days vacancy between turns. I think that for all the reasons, Tom alluded to the retention rate and the lower turnover that we're seeing I suspect is going to continue to be low. I mean, the number one reason people leave us is because of some sort of change in their employment status and absent some sort of slowdown in the job market which we don't anticipate. I don't think we're going to see more pressure on that front.","And then when you look at the number two reason, people leave us is to go buy a house. That seems to not becoming any worse for sure maybe even slightly better. So as a consequence of that I think that I'm optimistic that the turnover component remains fairly static in 2019 relative to 2018. We just think that some of these lease-up projects will get a little bit more aggressive.","We \u2013 as I mentioned are committed to holding as much as we can, the trend and we think we can on rent growth. And we think that it may require a little bit of concession on some of the days vacancy between turns on new move-ins. And, we think that's the right trade-off to make right now in order to protect the strong rent growth improvement that we're seeing take place, and again, looking to capture a very strong average daily occupancy of 95.9%, I mean that's pretty darn strong and we think we'll do that this year.","John Kim","I apologize, if I missed this or if you've already answered this but, where do you think renewals will be this year versus 6% last year?","Thomas Grimes","I won't think we would be between 5.5% and 6.5% for the year trending a little higher than that in January, but I would feel comfortable in the 5.5% to 6.5% range.","John Kim","Okay. On the expense side with tax increases of $4.25, overhead cost going up 5%, I realize some of that in G&A, is 3% same-store expense growth is the new norm \u2013 for the foreseeable future?","Albert Campbell","I mean, I think if you look at the, John, this is Al, if you look at our long-term average, it's close to 2.5%. I think the real estate tax, I think what we have gone in the last couple of years is really good performance for two years, 2% on average last couple of years driven by reductions in repair and maintenance and marketing some of the areas where we're able to capture strong synergies from our deals and we had a tax pressure offsetting that somewhat.","We have about 5% growth in real estate taxes over those two years and still where we put a 2% total expense growth \u2013 forward. So I think going forward what you'll see is personnel \u2013 if those other lines will be under control but more close to normal level of growth. Personnel 2% to 2.5%, repair and maintenance closer to 3%. Modest growth in other lines and taxes being one-third of your cost in the fourth quarter range producing the majority of\u2026","Eric Bolton","One way of looking at it is that, even if you think about real estate taxes comprising the large percentage of our overall tax expense base that growth rate almost by the math implies a lower, less than 3% growth rate on all of the other line items. And so I think that the new norm is my guess is going to be closer to 3%. In any given year a lot of it is going to be up or down as a consequence of real estate taxes.","Albert Campbell","And we will help over time, a couple of years real state in Texas being to moderate, but right now there's a lot of pressure from Texas, Georgia and not surprisingly\u2026","Eric Bolton","The low cap rate environment fueling that.","John Kim","Got it. Okay. And then on your market commentary and as far as where you're seeing the greater supply pressure, back in November NAREIT, you guys are saying Austin, Charlotte and DC were the three major markets. It looks like Dallas has moved up into the bucket. I'm wondering what changed in the last couple of months with Dallas? And also if D.C. is still on market, we see how they will display.","Eric Bolton","Yes, I mean D.C. is still a market in the elevated bucket. And then Dallas, just sort of \u2013 Dallas is very close to even, in some looks it is slightly higher, in others its slightly lower but John I would just expect it to be pressured about the same as next year.","Thomas Grimes","Yes, I think, John we would say Dallas is still kind of at the same bucket, but its still, it's elevated both years but not necessarily getting way better or way worse.","John Kim","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go ahead and take our next question from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Robert Stevenson","Thank you. Tom, which markets have the widest spend of likely same-store revenue outcomes when you did your budgeting for 2019?","Thomas Grimes","Meaning where do I think our strongest markets will be and where do our weakest? Or within the market which has the largest delta between assets?","Robert Stevenson","The largest delta between, basically the up end \u2013 the top end of the range and the bottom end of the range. I assume that Al made to pick the middle or somewhere below the middle or from a conservative basis in most of your markets when you were going through from an earning standpoint. But, like which markets are most likely to have a surprise to the top end or down side in 2019 relative to where you guys set the median expectation?","Thomas Grimes","Yes. And then it's sort of, what I'll tell you is that comes down maybe to the change in the back half of the year, and I would tell you that Charlotte were relatively strong right now. And \u2013 but it is we're expecting some supply there especially later and so that may change over time, and then Nashville, it looks like, it's maybe better later half of the year but it's challenging \u2013 very challenging right now.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then the 8,000 units you expect to renovate this year, are these all going to be on terms? Or are you going to take some units out of service?","Thomas Grimes","They will all be on terms.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then lastly for me, Al what's the known non-cash or non-recurring things impacting FFO in 2019?","Albert Campbell","Non-cash Rob? It's a much cleaner year in 2019. The fair market value of the desk is pretty much burned off. You would probably have the preferred but you know what, we didn't not put that in our forecast, because it's just almost impossible, mostly impossible to predict. But those are the key non-cash items in 2019. I think, as the good news as we've had \u2013 the bad news is we've had a good bit of noise over the last few years for some of those items Rob. But I think as we move forward 2019 - 2020 beyond we're very glad to be in more stable years with less of that noise and should have more consistent growth production.","Eric Bolton","I'll add one point Rob. Absent, anything in the preferred which is non-cash was about $500,000 or so less than that debt mark-to-market non-cash and that's pretty much\u2026","Albert Campbell","Virtually gone.","Eric Bolton","That's pretty much it.","Albert Campbell","Yes.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. So NAREIT, normalized the core FFO should be, at this point in the year you guys think would be fairly consistent but for anything that happens on a preferred and that $500,000 of debt?","Albert Campbell","That's right. Excluding the preferred we think those numbers will be very close.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our next question from Drew Babin from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Drew Babin","Hey, good morning.","Eric Bolton","Hey Drew. Good morning.","Drew Babin","With regard to Dallas Atlanta and Charlotte kind of being your three biggest markets those are the three markets where you had a lot of Post Legacy assets would you say the lease-over-lease blended pricing expectations are above the midpoint of the two to three range for the year for those three markets? I mean, if not, what in the case of Dallas, I would assume they might be lower. How this uptown, stack up versus the Northern suburban assets where I know there's a lot of supply kind of out in Frisco and Plano now?","Thomas Grimes","Yes. No they're lower, and Dallas as you mentioned uptown it's under pressure. But Frisco, Plano and McKinney are all seeing their fair share as well. Atlanta and Charlotte a little bit different. Inside, the perimeter Atlanta, outside the perimeter Atlanta two different markets. We're very strong outside the perimeter end market in Atlanta and the majority of the headwinds that we have on supply are Peachtree Road, Midtown, Downtown and it really inner loop and in Charlotte it's sort of a similar picture where Uptown\/Downtown South Church area seeing a little bit more supply and the suburb is broadly stronger. So Dallas, a little bit wider spread and it's more targeted in the Atlanta and Charlotte markets.","Drew Babin","Okay. And we would say, the Post legacy assets if you kind of broke those out with some of the redevelopments and renovations, would you say that those assets are doing better than kind of the $2.7 at midpoint on that lease-over-lease?","Thomas Grimes","Yes, the number of renovations that we have done thus far on the Post side of things, Drew is not enough to really impact that just yet. It's building and it will come, but those Post Properties are facing a little bit uphill battle on the supply right in their backyard.","Drew Babin","Okay, that's helpful. And one question for Al, just on the line balance, I think we're still over $500 million at the end of the year. And I'm not sure if that includes the turmoil or not, but as you look out to maybe more permanently finance that, what are the options on the table and guidance? If we could start with that, I have a follow-up.","Albert Campbell","Right, actually, no, the term loan is not in our line of credit outstanding balance Drew. It's a good point. Just \u2013 in context we paid off about over $600 million \u2013 just over $600 million of debt in the \u2013 late in the year as we talked about and we had a plan as we talked about a few quarters to do bond, it will active in the bond market late in the year but the market volatility really causes us to be little more patient there and so we talked about doing $600 million maybe some long-term tenure and some normal tenure.","So what we did, we revised our plans a little bit and did a little bit of a secured 30-year behind of $172 million we saw and we put $300 million term loan which is \u2013 it was short-term term loan which we would expect to be active in the bond markets only here to replace that.","So I think in going forward what you should see is \u2013 you should expect in your model is a bond deal in the first part of the year replacing that $300 million and maybe a couple of hundred million more of debt whether it will be opportunistic whether it's bond, whether it's mortgage \u2013 secured mortgage averaging about 4.5% rates what we have in the forecast for us for the year. So, markets will give us what they give us and that's what we've dialed in.","Drew Babin","Okay. And with the 30-year mortgage you did in the fourth quarter what was the rate benefit of doing that versus the 30-year unsecured? And then as you look out to this year, is the 30-year unsecured bond is still on the table?","Albert Campbell","Yes, absolutely. One of the interesting things we saw late in the year was, doing a 30-year bond as markets got volatile, the spreads really widened on that as you'd expect the perceived risk, but on the secured market which is a more of private market, it was much tighter, and so we had 4.4% rate on that all-in which is well below we could've gotten the bond even when things were fairly stable. So I think that was good execution.","We don't \u2013 we obviously don't want to \u2013 we want to protect our balance sheet. We want to get too much secured debt, but you could see use a little bit more because we have about 8% of our assets are encumbered right now, so it's very, very low. So we could do a little bit more. So you may see us next year do a little bit more of that if the rates are good and then have a bond deal in the $300 million to $400 million range.","Drew Babin","Okay, great. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Guinee from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Guinee","Great, thank you. Nice quarter. When I look at your, what I would call a true fab number after subtracting that revenue creating CapEx, it looks like you're going to be in the $4.25 to $4.50 number in 2019. And I think you just increased your dividend about 4% after $3.84. How do you feel over time about being able to sustain a 4% plus dividend increase annually?","Eric Bolton","This is Eric. We feel pretty good about that honestly. We think that we're going to be in a position. I mean, we look at various points-in the cycle obviously. But, we think we're trending back to a normal sort of same-store internal earnings growth rate that's going to be in the kind of 3% range or thereabout on a year-over-year basis. And as we outlined we do believe that the external growth front is going to get better at some point from an acquisitions perspective over the next couple of years.","We are increasing our ability to deploy capital and some pretty accretive yields on new development, and so we think that over the next couple of years the external growth picture gets a little stronger. And so it's going to add another 1% or 2% to that, and then you could leverage on that.","You start to get to a \u2013 and of course, as we continue the recycling effort we'll be selling off older assets and redeploying into newer assets which is going to be beneficial, from us more beneficial from a fab perspective with lower CapEx on a newer asset. So I would tell you we feel pretty uncomfortable about a long-term sustainable growth rate of that dividend in the 4% to 5% range.","John Guinee","Great, thank you very much.","Eric Bolton","You Bet.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go ahead and move onto Omotayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Omotayo Okusanya","Hi, yes, good morning everyone. A question around the redevelopment of the apartment. The cost per unit was a little bit elevated this quarter. Just curious whether that's mix or whether that's the case of construction cost are going up in general? And if that's the case if it has any impact on the return on the yield...","Thomas Grimes","It's mixed Tayo. As we feather in more of the Post portfolio that's $8,000 per unit average roughly and that's pulled by average up over time.","Albert Campbell","And the good news on that Tayo as the rent increases, the economic returns are similar, this is just relative to the large capital you get higher results, higher rent increase.","Thomas L. Grimes","We don't compromise. We don't compromise on returns.","Omotayo Okusanya","Okay that's helpful. And the second thing I want to kind of explore is 2019 guidance the blended rate again 2.2% to 3.2%, so an average about 2.7% or so. I'm just talking about renewals of 5.5% to 6.5% so that means new rates will be kind of a 0-ish basically for the year.","And I'm just curious you made the comment earlier on that given the backdrop for your portfolio you're more likely push price even at the risk of losing some occupancy, but when \u2013 I kind of think about renewals at 6% and new leases at about zero and the risk that you may have, a couple of developers getting aggressive with pricing and your ability \u2013 it sounds like, this full year is going to boil down to the ability of kind of get 6% on renewals? Its like exactly the story this year, and that new leases is going to be \u2013 it is what it is?","Albert Campbell","I'll start with that and Tom can add some color on that Tayo. I think, how we thought about the forecast was, we are very happy with January performance, but as we look for the full year we expect renewals to continue to trend. So we saw the logic from last year, we would kind of assuming 5.5% \u2013 5% to 6% range, 5.5% to 6% most likely for the year and so new lease pricing is going to be the most competitive part.","It has been and as we \u2013 as the supply pressure continues in the market at high levels that will be the point of most competition. So you're right \u2013 doing the Math that is flat to slightly positive, I think is what that general expectation would be. Different market to market some markets will be negative, but under more pressure and some are more positive. So you want to give color on some of that, Tom?","Thomas Grimes","Yes, and we touched on it earlier. New lease rate \u2013 new lease rates will be under pressure in town Atlanta, Charlotte. Later, Dallas and Austin, but that will vary from place to place. We also see I think strong new lease growth from Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, Phoenix. So its hard to generalize.","Omotayo Okusanya","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go ahead and take our next question from Hardik Goel from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.","Hardik Goel","Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering on the land parcels you guys acquired in Houston and Denver how you came up on that opportunity? How long have you been looking at that? And how you're underwriting development today on those? And just a sense for what the yield might be on those?","Eric Bolton","Well, we have been looking at both of these opportunities for quite some time probably anywhere from six months to nine months in advance of actually getting to a point where we're able to put them under contract. The opportunity in Denver is in the areas just a little bit northwest of downtown sort of half between Denver, Downtown Denver and Boulder an area called Westminster that we are well into predevelopment on.","We expect to start later in the year and the kind of the August time frame, but this is something that based on our initial \u2013 we're still finalizing numbers and so forth, but we would expect to stabilize yield out of this investment somewhere in the 6.5% range on the Denver opportunity. The Houston opportunity is just kind of west of downtown sort of halfway between the Galleria area and the energy corridor area just off of I10.","Again it's something \u2013 it's an area going through some sort of regentrification. We are pretty excited about the opportunity and again there, we're looking at start, sometime late this year probably in the November time frame. And our early analysis on stabilized yield puts that about 6.4%.","So both very creative opportunities based on the underwriting we're looking at right now. As we approach these opportunities, I mean we talked with \u2013 we've got a group of developer \u2013 group of contractors that we've done a lot of business with and get preliminary pricing for them, but we worked with them enough to have a lot of confidence that the numbers we get from them are something we feel pretty good about.","And then we assume some escalation factor in that based on what we do in predevelopment before the time we actually lock down the contracts and go to fixed-price contracts. So more to come on all of this but we feel pretty good about the opportunities at this point.","Hardik Goel","And does that \u2013 just as a follow-up is that the same sort of hurdle you would describe to the emerging build acquisitions you're planning on making? Is that 6.5%? Or is it a little lower than that?","Eric Bolton","Yes, it's probably a little bit lower than that. It depends on the situation. If we've got an opportunity that we're working with, right now in Phoenix, with Crescent on essentially a prepurchase or something that they are going to build they will be the developer they will take the majority of that risk. And so we're comfortable taking that down at a slightly lower yield. It's still be low about 6%, but I think that it depends on situation. It depends on just the risk that we underwrite, but all these \u2013 opportunities we're looking right now are going to be well north of 6%.","Hardik Goel","Got it. Thank you. That's all from me.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we can go ahead and take our next question from Jim Sullivan from BTIG.","James Sullivan","Thank you. Guys, I just want to drill down a little bit more of the discussion about expenses for 2019. I think back in NAREIT you were talking about a $7 million number I think of kind of credits and one-off items that benefited the 2018 numbers.","And if we adjust through that in the 2018 totals that your report for both management \u2013 property management and G&A we're still getting an increase in 2019 of about 9% in the overhead line item. And I think there were some comment that there was kind of annualizing some higher expenses that were put in place in 2018 that accounts for that.","And \u2013 but when I look at the individual items property management, for example that's gone up. It went up more than 4% \u2013 went up about 10% in 2018. It's going up about 14% in 2019, and yet this is occurring at a time when same-store revenue growth is not going up that much for all the reasons we have discussed.","What accounts for that dichotomy? When I say dichotomy your operating expenses that you can control that is other than real estate taxes are going up as you've indicated below 3% but management expenses are going up nearly 3 times that. What explains that difference in yearly change?","Albert Campbell","Hey, Jim. This is Al. I think as we about talked a lot it has to do with comparisons to 2018 that you outlined. We certainly \u2013 we actually had a reduction in cost in 2018, but in 2019 we will feel the full run rate of the investments we made in our platform that we talked about are long, and very important to produce the results that we expect from the future in the people, systems, facilities, web presence all those things that we talked about and so when you look at 2019 to 2018 it does look high.","But if you look at 2018 to 2019 and what we expect in '20 and you're going forward and looking at a little bit longer period it will land to more of a 5% to 6% growth rate over time, and I'm talking about both of those together.","We think of it as overhead which is the G&A plus the property management together. We sort of manage it as overhead as a bucket. And so I think over a three-year window we feel that sector average 5% to 6% growth is what we're doing we'll do there, and so \u2013 2020 will be a little more modest because obviously we made meaningful investments and we'll be able to grow more efficiently in the nearby areas. That's how we thought about the next year.","James Sullivan","You do describe the two of those items together as a bucket adding summing it up to overhead, but in 2018 the property management expense rose 10% and G&A was down significantly. Presumably, most of the credits that you have talked about the onetime items benefited the G&A line as opposed to the property management line in 2018. Is that true?","Albert Campbell","No, they're all over the place because a lot of the people could be either one. I mean, so you're talk about people and systems cost typically in the property management so it can be, the things that outline could be easily on either side of that. And so I think that's one of the reasons we really try to look at it together and just as more simple say, look we have overhead structure, this total and we're managing it that way. And so \u2013 I think it's little easier to think about it holistically.","James Sullivan","Okay, then a final question for me kind of a macro. You've kind of made two comments today about growth rates. You've talked about kind of a longer-term kind of normalized same-store NOI growth rate in terms of expectation of something like 3% annually. And yet when you've talked about the overhead expense line you've talked about, I think it's been described two ways a long-term growth rate of 5%, is I think, as you've indicated in some of your presentations before.","And I think today on the call it was somebody mentioned 5% to 6%, and I guess that dichotomy seems inconsistent with a scalable platform. One would have assumed with the Post merger that you were building a scalable platform and part of that conclusion would be that they be the overhead cost would not be increasing at the same rate as the overall revenues. Is that wrong? Am I thinking about that incorrectly?","Albert Campbell","Well, I think what you have to think about is same-store \u2013 is that same-store. It's not assuming growth. It's the same portfolio in this year compared to the production part of the previous year. I think the important thing to think about an overhead in G&A as you talk about growing companies.","For us and the sector, where does the acquisition development or even many ways and so, your G&A over time is going to grow more than your same-store for growing companies. And I think if you look at the sector average over time, that's what we're talking about a NAREIT over the last couple of years and what we mentioned earlier was if you look at the sector average over time for that area it's more like 5% to 6% growth.","Eric Bolton","I think the only things you have to look at Jim is you have to factor in external growth component as well. Because this platform, the overhead platform if you will is supporting not only same-store but supporting external growth as well.","And I think to the extent that we can capture organic internal growth and new external growth on a combined basis at a growth rate that is beyond the 5%, then I think, the margin component there that you're sort of alluding to, I think starts to make more sense.","The other thing to keep in mind is that you're talking about 3% growth organic growth of a big number. You're talking about 5% growth on overhead on a smaller aggregate dollar numbers, so the dollar margin is still growing.","Thomas Grimes","The only comment I would make on that latter point is that as you probably know many of your peers report NOI and same-store NOI after property management expenses rather than before. And if we were in your case to look at the same-store NOI computation you have in the sub and compute it that way the growth in same-store NOI would be lower. It would be closer to about a 1.4% number. So we understand the same-store is total NOI.","NOI, non-same-store NOI tends to be about 7% or so of total NOI so it's a much smaller number. We do understand there's extra cost involved in that effort of course, but still we tend to look at property management expenses as driven by revenue line.","And G&A line \u2013 I don't know \u2013 I would content based on our analysis that over time. The G&A line has not grown as much as the overall revenue line for the company, for most of the companies we cover. So just a thought as you think about the scalability of the platform, and I guess, I can leave it at that.","James Sullivan","I understand your point. I understand your point.","Operator","And we will go ahead and take our next question from Daniel Bernstein from Capital One.","Daniel Bernstein","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to touch a little bit on the comment on the developers become a little bit more aggressive on leasing. Is that just the assumption you're making? Or you're actually seeing some of that more aggressive leasing with the discounting given three months, so I just wanted to understand where that comments coming from a little bit?","Eric Bolton","It's really more of an assumption at this point Daniel. Tom, can give you some perspective on what we're seeing and more specifically with the lease concessions. But it hasn't really changed a whole lot over the last sort of 60, 90 days, but we just think that as you get later in the cycle and particularly some of these projects continue to face later deliveries and we get into the busy summer season we just think that it's entirely possible that you may see a little \u2013 it'll vary by some market but you may see a little bit more aggressive prices. But we have not seen any real evidence of that as of yet.","Daniel Bernstein","Actually one here. Just \u2013 that refers to the apartment developers, have you seen increased concession or competition from single-family residence rentals?","Eric Bolton","No. I mean, I say no we're not tracking them. Move-outs to single-family rentals is such a small percentage. And while there is a company that has reasonable scale they're scattered out and really don't affect our markets. I could not speak to what their pricing is.","Albert Campbell","Our move-outs to single-family rental is only about 6% or 7% of our total move-out. It's been that way forever. It hasn't really changed. So it's not really a pressure point for us.","Daniel Bernstein","Okay, good. That's all I had. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our next question from John Pawlowski from Green Street Advisor.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Eric could you provide some thoughts on how your external growth strategy and your smaller secondary markets might look in a world where liquidity from Fannie and Freddie are declined meaningfully and those are away understanding now we know what's going to happen and we've been waiting for 10 years for something to happen, but would you expect to see more dislocation in pricing in your smaller Southeast metros? And would you act on that?","Eric Bolton","The answer is yes and yes. I would think that if Fannie financing work to \u2013 for whatever reason pull back, I think you're going to see it to have more of an impact on transaction activity in some of the smaller market. So it'll certainly have an impact in places like Dallas and Atlanta as well. But I'm thinking of markets like Greenville and Richmond and Nashville and Savannah and Charleston and I think you could see more of an impact in those markets.","And yes, we absolutely continued to feel very strongly about the merits and the value of having capital deployed in some of these higher-growth more secondary markets believing that the long-term performance profile from an earnings perspective over time out of those markets fits very much with our portfolio strategy and we would certainly jump on opportunities that might come about as a consequence of what you described.","John Pawlowski","Makes sense. I guess, sense for sensitivity again purely hypothetical do you think in your average smaller secondary markets values fall by 5% more than the Atlanta of the world or 10% more? How big do you think it could be if Fannie and Freddie went away overnight.","Eric Bolton","I think to some degree it really depends on just how aggressive institutional capital continues to stay and direct their resources toward multifamily housing. I think that while Dallas or Atlanta may not feel it as much as a secondary market. As you know there's just a ton of capital out there that continues to want to deploy in multifamily.","And despite, if the agencies pulled back for some reason well on the margin it will have an impact on some of these smaller buyers I think we are more well-capitalized, private capital balance sheets would probably not be as impacted.","And so some of these more dynamic secondary markets may still find a fair amount of interest and so \u2013 it's hard to say to what degree a Charleston, South Carolina is impacted versus a Dallas. I don't really know. It just depends on how much interest private capital still has on a Charleston large well-capitalized balance sheet, private balance sheet to have in Charleston.","John Pawlowski","Understood. Last one for me. What job growth assumptions underpin your 2019 revenue growth outlook?","Eric Bolton","Yes. I would tell you basically it's not on an assumption that things continue pretty much like they are right now. I think that our forecast can withstand a little moderation in job growth, but not a lot candidly. And I think that if we saw the employment market and job growth trends severely pull back I think it's a different ballgame.","But, we had as you know and I know you pointed out in a lot of your research that the job growth rates are going to likely moderate at some point, and I think that there's no indication near term that we're headed to that sort of scenario. So our 2019 assumptions are built on a continuation of what we see, but frankly at some level I can't look forward to it happening and while it's going to be depending on where we are in the supply cycle it could be painful two or three quarters as we work through that.","But certainly we think that some of these lease-up projects and some of the supply coming online, will face some pretty severe pressure which is going to create new things and great opportunities to capture some value on an acquisition side. And we've got a balance sheet ready to jump on that shouldn't happen, but anyway \u2013 we think 2019 looks a lot like 2018 on that regard.","John Pawlowski","All right, great. Thanks.","Operator","And we will go ahead to take our final question from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Please go ahead your line is open.","Buck Horne","No, thanks guys. My questions have all been answered. So I will end the call there. Thank you.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Buck.","Eric Bolton","Well, operator I think that's all the questions. And so we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. With that, we'll just terminate the call. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the MAA Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, August 2, 2018.","I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA.","Tim Argo","Thank you, Priscilla, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel.","Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Forward-Looking Statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results.","These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.","I'll now turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Tim, and good morning. Leasing conditions across our markets continue to reflect strong demand for apartment housing. During the second quarter, we captured meaningful improvement in pricing with a blended lease-over-lease growth rate of 3.3%. This is 90 basis points better than Q2 of last year, and the best quarterly lease-over-lease rent growth captured since our merger with Post.","Looking at pricing trends for new move-in residents on a lease-over-lease basis, where new supply and competition generate the highest pressure, we captured a significant 170-basis-point improvement over last year. Resident turnover remains at a historically low level, and rent growth of renewal leases during Q2 was a strong 5.9%. We believe pricing trends have reached an inflection point, and we expect to see positive momentum over the next several quarters. We're encouraged with the positive momentum in rent growth and believe this will support the stronger revenue growth that we expect to capture over the second half of the year. We continue to capture very favorable performance in year-over-year growth and operating expenses. As a result of the improving pricing trends and continued favorable expense performance, we continue to be comfortable with our outlook for same-store NOI performance.","I'm particularly encouraged by the emerging and improving trends in pricing performance across the legacy Post portfolio. As our work over the past year to strengthen and reconcile revenue management practices takes hold through this year's leasing season, we are beginning to capture the positive impact. This is despite the fact that many of the legacy Post submarkets are currently battling some of the more challenging new supply pressures across our portfolio. We're thrilled with the associates we now have in place at our legacy Post locations, and I very much appreciate they're hanging there with us as we work through the merger and reconciliation of on-site operating practices.","Merger-related activities continue to wind down. During July, we successfully wrapped up the final systems conversion work and completed the consolidation of the legacy MAA and legacy Post operations onto one management and reporting platform. This has meant a significant effort by every part of our company. We're excited to have this effort behind us, and to now be in a position to further harvest opportunities associated with being on one operating reporting system.","As outlined in our earnings release, acquisition activity remains fairly quiet for us as aggressive pricing keeps us largely on the sidelines. We did initiate two new development projects during the second quarter, both of which are expansions of existing properties. Each project is located on land parcels adjacent to existing communities that we already owned.","In summary, while we still have a few months of a busy leasing season ahead of us, I'm encouraged with the performance and progress year-to-date. We continue to believe that the back half of the year will play out in line with our expectations. We continue to capture great early benefits from our merger with Post in the area of operating expenses and G&A synergy, and improving pricing trends are now clearly evident. While new supply pressures are currently creating some headwind, our revenue management practices and the improvements made in the legacy Post portfolio operation are beginning to make an impact.","Merger integration activities are essentially complete, and we now look forward to now executing on a fully consolidated platform. We continue to believe that based on permitting data and projected new starts as well as what we are seeing on the ground in our various submarkets that we will see some moderation in new supply pressure in a number of our markets in 2019. With continued strong employment expectations, we're optimistic that leasing conditions across our footprint will continue to see positive momentum.","I want to thank all our MAA associates for their hard work through this busy summer season and their focus in not only serving our residents on a daily basis, but also completing the extra work and effort associated with wrapping up our conversion and consolidation activities associated with our merger.","That concludes my comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Grimes","Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our operating performance for the second quarter came in as expected with building momentum in rent growth, continued strong occupancy and overall trends that support our outlook for the year. The integration work on the operating platform was evident in our leasing during the quarter. We saw blended lease-over-lease performance of the combined portfolio grow 3.3% in the second quarter, which is a 170 basis points higher than the first quarter and 90 basis points higher than the same time last year.","Encouragingly, Post blended lease-over-lease pricing was up 2.5% during the second quarter, which is a strong 210 basis points better performance than this time last year. This steady positive trend in blended price drove down our - drove our sequential average effective rent up 1% from Q1 to Q2. This is the highest sequential increase we have seen since the Post merger. This improving pricing performance is primarily the result of new lease pricing on the Post portfolio. Despite the fact that Post submarkets are experiencing heavy new supply, we saw new lease-over-lease rates improve by a significant 350 basis points in the second quarter from the same time last year.","Expense performance continues to be a bright spot for both portfolios. While improvement in revenue management practices are just now showing up in pricing, our programs to more aggressively operating expenses have shown more immediate results. Overall, expenses within the same-store portfolio were up just 1.1% for the quarter.","Total expenses on the Post portfolio during the quarter were down 1.8%. That was driven by reductions in personnel costs, repair and maintenance expenses as well as property and casualty insurance. As a result, the second quarter operating margin for the Post portfolio improved another 90 basis points. This is on top of the 130-basis-point improvement we made in the second quarter of last year. We're pleased to see the rent growth improvement, which should further drive margin expansion within the Post portfolio.","July results show the continued benefit of our consolidated platform and momentum. Overall same-store July blended lease-over-lease rates were up a strong 3.3%. Average daily occupancy for the month was 95.7%, and we ended the month at 96.1% and we'll start August at 96.1%. Our 60-day exposure, which represents all vacant units and notices for 60-day period is [indiscernible] which sets us up well for the slower winter leasing season.","The supply [indiscernible] documented. Currently, Dallas and Austin are facing the most pressure. In 2018, we expect 22,000 deliveries in Dallas. And in Austin, we expect 8,000 deliveries. We're encouraged by the job growth that has remained strong in both markets. Dallas job growth for the last 12 months was 3.4% and Austin job growth was 3.3%. These growth trends are strong and well ahead of nationwide trends.","Looking forward, deliveries in our market are expected to drop 18% in 2019, and with continued strong demand, we expect the leasing environment to improve next year. While elevated supply levels have pressured rent growth in several of our markets, particularly Dallas and Austin, we're seeing good revenue growth in a number of our markets. Phoenix, Richmond, Orlando and Jacksonville really stood out from the group.","Our focus on customer service and retention coupled with strong renter demand continue to drive down resident turnover. Move-outs by our current residents continue to remain low. Move-outs for the overall same-store portfolio were down 2.7% for the quarter. Move-outs to home buying were down 4%. And move-outs to home renting remain an insignificant cause for turnover and accounts for only 7% of our move-outs. On a rolling 12-month basis, turnover dropped to a historic low of 49.2%. The steady decrease in turnover was achieved by increasing renewal rents by 5.9%.","Momentum is building on the redevelopment program across the legacy Post portfolio. Through the second quarter, we've completed 1,400 units and expect to complete 3,000 this year. On average, we're spending about - we're spending $8,700 and getting a rent increase that is 11% more than compatible - a comparable non-redeveloped unit. As a reminder, we've identified 13,000 Post units that have compelling redevelopment opportunity.","For the total portfolio, in 2018, we expect to complete over 8,000 interior unit upgrades. On the legacy MAA portfolio, we continue to have a robust redevelopment pipeline of 9,000 to 12,000 units. On a combined basis with the legacy Post portfolio, our total redevelopment pipeline now stands in the neighborhood of 22,000 to 25,000 units.","Our active lease-up communities are performing well and in line with our expectations. Our remaining pipeline of leasing - lease-up properties, Acklen West End, The Denton II, Post Midtown, Post River North and Sync36 are all on track to stabilize on schedule. The stabilization date for Post South Lamar II was moved up a quarter to the third quarter of 2018 as it leased up faster than we originally planned.","We're pleased to have the merger integration winding down. I'm proud of the effort and the hard work of our team - our team has put in over the last 18 months. The results are progressing as we expected. We're looking forward to continuing to capture value-creation opportunities on both revenue and expense sides of the equation as we move forward. Al?","Albert Campbell","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional commentary on the company's second quarter earnings performance, the balance sheet activity, and then finally, on our guidance for the remainder of 2018. Net income available for common shareholders was $0.52 per diluted common share for the quarter. FFO for the quarter was $1.55 per share, which was $0.07 per share above the midpoint of our guidance.","Our core or same-store earnings results were in line with our expectations for the quarter. Same-store revenue growth for the second quarter was primarily based on effective rent growth of 1.7%, which was encouragingly 30 basis points above our reported growth in the first quarter. Average occupancy for the second quarter also remained strong at 96%, but was 10 basis points below the prior year, slightly offsetting rent growth.","You may recall our first quarter revenue performance was enhanced by a 30 basis points year-over-year increase in occupancy, primarily built to support pricing during our busiest leasing season. And perhaps most importantly, as mentioned before, our blended lease-over-lease pricing growth for the second quarter, which is new and renewal leases combined, was 3.3%, which provides continued support to the momentum projected over the back half of this year. All this combined with a strong 1.1% expense performance, as Tom mentioned, produce same-store NOI growth of 1.7%, which is in line with our forecast expectation.","Favorable FFO results for the second quarter were primarily produced by an unexpected settlement of a life insurance policy acquired with the Post merger, producing $0.04 per share favorability; favorable G&A and interest expenses for the quarter, another $0.02 per share combined; and finally, favorable timing of some remaining integration expenses, another $0.01 per share. Our total expectation for integration expenses for the full year remains unchanged, but certain lease costs are now being incurred in the third and fourth quarters.","We also had $2.8 million of noncash income during the quarter related to the valuation of the preferred shares, which essentially offset the $2.6 million of noncash expense recorded during the first quarter, making the full year impact insignificant, which is in line with our previous guidance. And as a reminder, due to the uncertainty in forecasting this noncash item, our projections do not include any impact from valuation adjustments in our full year guidance for this item.","During the second quarter, we closed on acquisition of one new high-end community, the 374-unit Sync36 located in Denver, which included the land parcel to develop an additional 79 units. We expect to begin additional units during the third quarter, which will bring the projected total investment in the community to about $128 million. Once the final phase is fully completed and leased, we expect a 5.6% NOI yield on this total project.","We also continued to monetize non-core land parcels acquired with the Colonial merger. We closed on the disposition of 29-acre land parcel located in Las Vegas during the quarter. MAA received total proceeds of $9.5 million for the sale, producing a recorded gain of $2.8 million during the quarter. This brings total non-core land sales for the year from three parcels all acquired from Colonial containing 66 acres for total net proceeds of $15.2 million and recorded gains of $2.9 million for the year.","During the second quarter, we began the construction of two expansion s of existing communities, Post Parkside at Wade Phase III located in Raleigh and Post Sierra at Frisco Bridges Phase II located in Dallas. We now have four communities under construction with a total projected cost of $219.8 million, of which $97 million remains to be funded. Once competed and fully leased, we do expect a stabilize NOI yield of 6.2% for the portfolio.","As Tom mentioned, our lease-up portfolio continues to perform well. At the end of the quarter, we had six communities remaining in lease-up, including Sync36, which was acquired in lease-up during the quarter. Average occupancy for the group was just over 75% at quarter-end, and we expect two other communities to achieve full stabilization during the third quarter, which is 90% occupancy for 90 days. We expect two more to stabilize during the fourth quarter and the remaining two to stabilize in the first half next of year, all of which will provide a growing contribution to our 2019 earnings stream.","Our balance sheet remains in great shape. During the second quarter, we issued $400 million in 10-year secured - excuse me, unsecured senior notes at 4.2% coupon rate. The proceeds from this issuance were used to pay down borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, bringing our combined cash and available borrowing capacity to $920 million at quarter-end. Our leverage defined by our bond covenants was only 33.1% at quarter-end, while our net debt-to-recurring-EBITDA was just over 5x.","Finally, given the strong second quarter performance, we are maintaining and converting our same-store guidance for the full year as both revenue and expense trends continue to be in line with our previous projections. Expectations for the remainder of the year are built on continued strong occupancy, 96% average for the remainder of the year; and blended lease pricing, which is combined new and renewal leases averaging about 2.2% for the remainder of the year, which compares well to recent trends. We are increasing our net income and FFO per share guidance ranges for the full year to reflect the items mentioned earlier. We're also slightly narrowing our earnings guidance ranges to reflect the reduced uncertainty following two quarters of performance for the year.","In summary, net income diluted common share is now projected to be $1.85 to $2.05 for the full year 2018. FFO is projected to be $5.96 to $6.16 per share or $6.06 per share at the midpoint, which includes $0.08 per share of projected final merger and integration costs related to Post merger.","AFFO is now projected to be $5.35 to $5.55 per share and $5.45 at the midpoint. The third quarter FFO is projected to be $1.45 to $1.55 per share or $1.50 at the midpoint. We continue to remain on track to capture the full $20 million of overhead synergies related to the Post merger as well as the other NOI and earnings opportunities outlined with the merger, which are reflected in our current guidance.","So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments, Priscilla, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question today from Nick Joseph with Citi.","Nicholas Joseph","Just on the same-store revenue guidance. The maintained range implies a meaningful ramp in 2H versus year-to-date results, and thank you for the components that you just gave. But you trended towards the midpoint above or below? And then from a quarterly perspective, how do you expect it to trend in 3Q and 4Q?","Albert Campbell","I think we typically, lay our guidance out - Nick, this is Al, I'm sorry, we typically lay our guidance out trending towards the midpoint. And as we talked about, that performance is going to be based on pricing performance for the year, expected stable occupancy of around 96% average. And so our pricing guidance is 2.25% to 2.75% for the full year, which is new and renewals combined of blended leasing. And as we talked about, I think through July, we actually achieved 2.8%. And so that leaves about 2.2% on average for the remainder of the year, and I think it's about achievable.","Nicholas Joseph","And from a quarterly perspective, would you expect it to accelerate from 2Q to 3Q and then into 4Q?","Albert Campbell","I think we would expect - two things there. I think we would expect pricing to follow seasonal trends, which would be strong continued strength in the third quarter, seasonally softening in the fourth quarter. But the continued compounding of strong pricing performance into our portfolio will drive effective rent per unit, which is the average of all of your leases, at one time, that will continue to grow. We expect that to be growing in the third quarter and even more so in the fourth quarter to drive that rent performance - excuse me, the revenue performance close to the midpoint.","Nicholas Joseph","And then you had some 18% drop in delivery is expected next year. Which markets are projected to have the largest decrease? And then which will continue to see pressure?","Thomas Grimes","Nick, it's Tom. The trade-off is really across-the-board with only DC and Atlanta seeing slight increases. But it's really pretty widespread, and it's not being driven by any one market.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital.","Austin Wurschmidt","Just wanted to start off with a clarification. Al, I think you just mentioned 2.8%, which I thought you said was the blended lease rates for July. But in the release, I thought it said you achieved 3.3%. Can you just clarify those two numbers?","Albert Campbell","Yes, Austin, that's a great question. Let me clarify that. I was - 2.8% I was referring to the average for the full year, seven months together. And so we did achieved for the month of July of 3.3%, which shows that trend is growing.","Eric Bolton","2.8%, year-to-date.","Albert Campbell","Yes, 2.8% year-to-date. I'm sorry. But month of July was 3.3%.","Eric Bolton","So the minimum is building.","Austin Wurschmidt","Got it. And can you kind of compare, you mentioned 2.2% needed to achieve the midpoint of guidance with sort of stable occupancy. How does that 2.2% compare? I guess, the first half, you answered the question largely in that 2.8% or just a little below that. But how does that also compare versus last year and the second half of 2017?","Eric Bolton","Nick, I mean, the last blended for 2017 was 1.6%, which is a bit of a fall off for us last year. We're assuming 2.2% going forward and feel pretty good about that. And that's what helps drive that compounding effective rent growth that Al was talking about in the back half of the year.","Albert Campbell","We do expect, and to your point, Austin, we do expect the fourth quarter to moderate seasonally. And so in the last year, our blended pricing portfolio was flat blended. And so we believe we'll exceed that - we project to exceed that this year and have a strong third quarter based on July and continue August [indiscernible] performance. For fourth quarter, we project it to moderate some with seasonality, but be above last year about 60 basis points or so.","Austin Wurschmidt","That's helpful. And then can you just give us a sense in terms of the backdrop of supply in the back half of the year? Do you expect it to ratchet down or ramp-up kind of portfolio-wide in the back half of this year before seeing a year-over-year decrease in '19?","Thomas Grimes","No, it's awfully consistent. Last year, again, we saw a real change in the volume of supply that occurred. This year that has been relatively consistent throughout the quarters and expect it to be pretty consistent the rest of the year.","Eric Bolton","Last year really saw a big ramp-up in the last several months, particularly in Dallas, particularly in the uptown.","Thomas Grimes","Correct, yes. And we don't expect that to occur this year, no.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. And then just one more for me on sort of the investment side. You talked and have repeatedly kind of discussed the challenges in the acquisition market due to competitiveness. But could we see a ramp, I guess, and the development pipeline or even a bigger ramp in the development program as you look to what opportunities you have to reinvest your available cash flow?","Eric Bolton","Austin, this is Eric. We're looking at a couple of other development opportunities, another adjacent land parcel that we own that we're looking at. We've got a couple of other sites and an existing own site in Denver, another site under contract, another site in Orlando under contract, another side in Raleigh under contract. These are all the things that if we do pull the trigger on some of these, it would be next year, frankly, before we would do that. So you're not going to see us create a really significant development pipeline. I think we've sort of laid out a parameter of no more than 3% or 4% of enterprise value, which is going to be in that $400 million to $500 million range for us. But we do continue to feel that, that ought to be part of our external growth story at some level going forward.","What I'm encouraged by, frankly, is just while it's been frustrating on the acquisition front given where pricing is, we haven't been able to put much money to work. I will say though that our deal flow, our deal volume is higher in Q1 and in Q2. Year-to-date, it's higher than we've seen the last five years. So I mean, we are looking at a lot of things right now and continue to have a number of conversations with developers about prepurchase opportunities and sort of funding the development as we go things of that nature.","So I continue to be encouraged [Technical Difficulty] later in the cycle that more opportunities are going to emerge. As I mentioned, the balance sheet's got - is in great shape. We've got a lot of capacity. We're going to stay disciplined. We're going to stay patient. But I continue to believe that the opportunities are going to emerge, which is going to facilitate our ability to pick up the pace of growth a little bit.","Operator","We'll go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.","Richard Anderson","So the pipeline of redevelopment 22,000 to 25,000 units, pretty substantial obviously. But I'm curious, first question is, are they - are there units within a community that are in that and others that are not in the same community? In other words, do you kind of identify a building with X number of units and that's a redevelopment opportunity? Or is there something about some buildings where some are redevelopable and some are not?","Thomas Grimes","Rich, in general, it is a property-by-property assessment. And the way that we figure out whether the market will accept that is through a pretty rigorous testing process that we do. But generally, it works on the property or it does not work on the property. Every now and then, there's a particularly a studio floor plan-type that maybe more sensitive to renovate than others and we might leave that out. But that, honestly, is a rarity. We pick the units, test the units and then roll forward on the property.","Eric Bolton","The only hesitation we ever have, we don't force turnover, so we do it on turns. I think if we start forcing turnover, we start driving up vacancy loss and we start impacting negatively the economics on the renovate program. But as Tom mentioned, it's really a more systematic approach, and it really affects our units at a given community for the most part.","Thomas Grimes","That's correct.","Richard Anderson","So that leads to my next question, you said, you don't force the process, but I guess, why not? I mean, if you have this great rent growth potential in front of you, not that you could force anything, but if you - someone's lease expires and you say, \"Well, I'm going to raise your rent by kind of an above-market rate. And if they take it, great. If they don't, you've got a redevelopment opportunity right there. Is that something that you think about?","Thomas Grimes","Yes, I mean, we have considered that and thought about that. But those - what you mentioned are the pros to it's [Technical Difficulty] is strong now, 6% reprice, no additional investment, no downtime and average day is vacant and no turn costs. So we feel like that's - our approach is a little more stable.","Richard Anderson","Got you. Fair enough. Last question is for anyone in the room, the theme this quarter has been low turnover. You guys mentioned it, pretty much everybody is mentioning it. We have a pretty good economy. You would think people would be more inclined to look around and improve their residence to some degree. I'm curious what your thoughts are as why turnover is so low? Is it just simply housing market is sort of questionable, single family market? Or is it something else that's driving it down?","Eric Bolton","Rich, this is Eric. I think a couple of things at play here. One is what you referred to. I think the housing market in general is challenged increasingly by the lack of affordable single-family housing. I think we see the rental side of that business continue to really ratchet up with pretty high rent growth. We see pricing for starter homes continuing to move up. There's just not enough supply out there. And as a consequence, I think it is becoming increasingly more expensive.","But I think the other thing that is at play here a little bit is just a more function of just demographic and society changes. If you look at our portfolio today, our resident profile, 75%, 76% of our rental profile is single, not married; 52%, 53% are female. And I just - I continue to believe that this is a demographic more so today than ever in the past. It's not really motivated to go out and move into a single-family home, whether that be for rent or for purchase. And so I think it's a combination of those factors right now that are sort of helping the industry as a whole to capture some pretty good retention.","Richard Anderson","I guess, if you're single you can't get divorced so.","Eric Bolton","That's right.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","I guess, one of the levers you have to maintain your same-store expense growth at 1.3% for the year is decline in building and maintenance cost of 6%. And I'm wondering if you're basically deferring some of these costs to future periods or capitalizing these costs to redevelopment? Or is that...","Thomas Grimes","Yes, we're doing neither of those, John. I mean, what really is driving at is putting our approach to repair and maintenance on a portfolio that was more heavily weighted to contracting out labor. At the end of the day, they did - drastically increasing the number of paints that we do in-house and the number of carpets that we do in-house, and the number of cleans that we have in-house, and that is 100% what is driving this. And certainly, nothing in the deferred maintenance or capitalizing those costs.","Eric Bolton","And I'll tell you the other thing that's been part of the equation as well is just the benefits of the economy of scale. I mean, we renegotiated virtually every single contract we have for procuring services and products that we use in the operation of on-site activities, and all those prices went down as a consequence of the scale we got too, so there's no deferral going on, I can assure you that. It's really the point that Tom mentioned and the scale advantage.","John Kim","So this is mostly attributable to Post integration?","Thomas Grimes","Right. Yes. That is right, yes.","Albert Campbell","Yes. We've been talking about that I think last several quarters, John, that was the first thing, it was really easiest for us to jump on begin with actually a little better and faster than we had expected. I think as we move into '19, we would expect that to normalize a bit, but the revenue opportunities are growing and will be contributing in 2019. So that's kind of how we think about it.","John Kim","Okay. And then the 3.3% blended growth rate you got in July, I know you kind of forecast a significant down a little bit in the second half of the year, but how much visibility do you have on August as far as renewal rates and new lease growth?","Thomas Grimes","Sure. I mean, limited like none on new lease, because obviously as we haven't executed enough to do that. But as far as our renewals, they're continuing to go out. August, September and October all went out in the 6% range, and we're getting back high 5% in that range. So we feel good about that part of the equation.","John Kim","So that's about 40 basis points lower than what you got in the second quarter. Is that correct?","Thomas Grimes","Yes. I mean, and I think we mentioned at NAREIT, 5.9%, we're really pleased with. But we didn't plan for that. And one shouldn't plan on 5.9% going forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo Okusanya","Could you talk a little bit about the markets where you are seeing still a lot of supply pressures? How these developers are competing? Are you seeing increased concessions? What are they kind of trying to do to kind of drive lease-up in their assets? And how is that impacting your portfolio?","Thomas Grimes","I would tell you, Tayo, you're hitting on it in places like Atlanta, Austin and Dallas. And just pockets of Atlanta, really, they're competing with concessions. I will tell you that as we mentioned on an earlier Q&A, we saw a heavy hit of new development in late last year, it ramped up. And what we are seeing now as far as concessions in the marketplace, in those kind of places, is generally better than it was at that time. So they're still doing a month, two months free. It really depends on the submarket and market there. But there you're seeing that with that's how they're competing, it's just upfront discounts of concessions.","Omotayo Okusanya","Got you. Okay. And then second of all, when we kind of think about the back half of the year, I think you guys have been done an amazing job just with managing OpEx growth. And your guidance seems to imply that, that's going to continue for the rest of the year. But are there any potential kind of headwinds there that could make that number go up in the back half of the year?","Albert Campbell","Tayo, this is Al. We don't see any significant headwinds, and we feel pretty confident in our current on guidance on expenses for the back half of the year. As mentioned, we would expect a lot of that's attributable to the favorable performance from achieving the Post synergies or opportunities, those scale and processes we talked about. So I think as we move into 2019, the repair and maintenance and some of those lines may moderate to a more normal level. And as we mentioned, I think we expect the revenue part of the synergies to pick up stronger at that point as well.","Omotayo Okusanya","Okay. And then just the last one for me, what's the latest kind of with the DC portfolio? How are trends for the quarter? How you're just kind of feeling about that portfolio since it's an outlier relative to your typical regional exposure?","Thomas Grimes","No, I mean, DC has been steady for us. Our blended lease-over-lease rate rents for that group were 2 7. We continue to be pleased with the teams there and the redevelopment opportunity. And it is steady as it goes in DC for us.","Operator","We'll move now to John Pawlowski with Green Street.","John Pawlowski","On the revamped portfolio, the incremental 4,000 units to be done the rest of this year, are those costs bought out or is there any construction cost risk?","Thomas Grimes","Those costs are not bought out, John. I mean, we have tagged them, but we're working with - I won't call, bought out, but fairly fixed pricing. And we have not seen the volatility in dealing with renovate upgrades there that we have - that I think the industry has experienced on construction costs. It's just - It has not been a factor or a risk of our return.","John Pawlowski","On the broader pipeline, the 22,000 to 25,000, I guess, how is it completely new? You said labor shortages, so material inflation outpacing rent growth. So if the current environment persists, how do the economics trend on the broader pipeline in the next couple of years if construction cost broadly are outpacing inflation by a wide margin?","Thomas Grimes","Yes. I mean, I would tell you we don't have lumber in that number, we don't have concrete in that number and we don't have steel in that number. It's really appliances; in some cases, a countertop. And in sort of reskinning it [Technical Difficulty] and I think that's probably why it's different. I understand your point. It's well made. We just don't have a history of those costs trending in line with construction costs.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Makes sense. And the comments on supply being down nearly 20% next year, could you give us the one minute overview of how you identify what's competitive new supply and what's not competitive? Because candidly, when you roll up the market level permitting, which I know it's not great, but it does provide a directional proxy for supply growth, it doesn't paint the picture for anything near a 20% drop in the supply in '19. And 2020 looks pretty painful as well.","Thomas Grimes","Yes. I mean, what we're doing there is looking at the AXIO data over our broad markets, and then adding all of those markets up and comparing them. So this is not an asset-by-asset buildup, but it is a market buildup using that data.","Eric Bolton","I mean, we check it for reasonableness by - I mean, we know what's happening obviously in our submarkets and our properties know what's under construction. I think it's pretty easy to get a pretty good sense of what's going to happen 12 months out or so, because if it's not under construction now, it's not going to deliver next year and we know that. I do share your opinion that as you start to look at what's happening with permitting, it starts to suggest that 2020, maybe 2021, we might see a reacceleration of deliveries. But when you look at just - if it's not under construction now, it's not going to deliver next year. So we do think that '19 is shaping up to be a better year in terms of supply pressure. But I think beyond next year, I think it starts to get a little bit more questionable.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wesley Golladay","Just want to go back to the revenue guidance for the year, looking at the blended rent change. Assuming you're tracking a little bit above last year, you get to the high teens in 3Q. You'll probably need about 1.5% blended rent growth, if my math is correct, in 4Q. And it sounds like that will all be driven a little bit better new leasing; last year you were flat for the blend, and you highlighted to some degree that there's a lot of disruptive supply in 4Q in the select market, it sounds like the supply will not be as disruptive this year, but do you think you can get a materially better new lease growth in 4Q?","Albert Campbell","Yes. One thing I'll mention as you talk about your math and doing that is keep in mind though that the second quarter, there were a lot of leases that was signed in the second quarter. So simple average won't quite get you there. I think it's a little bit a better picture or a lower picture for the fourth quarter if you consider the weighted average because there were like a number of leases in the third quarter. But in general, I think you outlined it correctly.","Wesley Golladay","Okay. And that, I guess, last year, do you have a sense of how much the market such as uptown, I think maybe the other markets hit you. How much does that bring the overall new lease down? Was it a few percent just in those few markets alone for the overall portfolio impact?","Thomas Grimes","Those markets, it's down - I don't have the exact breakdown. But particularly, the way the Dallas supply hit last year was impactful.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back today for any closing or additional remarks.","Eric Bolton","Well, thanks, everyone. We appreciate you joining the call this morning. Any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to us. Thanks and we'll talk with everyone later. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation.

Thank you for participating in the MAA Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.","At this time, we\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin.","Tim Argo","Thank you, Leo. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO, Al Campbell, our CFO, and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out, that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the safe-harbor language included in yesterday\u2019s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call will be available on our website.","During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. When we reach the question and answer portion of the call, I would ask for everyone to please limit their questions to no more than two, in order to give everyone ample opportunity to participate. Should you have additional questions, please re-enter the queue or you are certainly welcome to follow up with us after we conclude the call. Thank you.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. As outlined in yesterday\u2019s earnings release, second quarter results were ahead of expectations. Solid rent growth, supported by occupancy that matched last year\u2019s strong results, generated same store net operating income that was ahead of our forecast.","Core FFO per share of $1.49 was at the top-end of our guidance with the favorable NOI performance driving the majority of the outperformance for the quarter. It\u2019s also worth noting that Core AFFO was $1.25 per share for the second quarter, or 16% ahead of the second quarter of last year. As a result of the better than expected second quarter performance, combined with our outlook that leasing conditions over the rest of the year will support continued solid rent growth and strong occupancy, we\u2019ve raised the expectation for Core FFO for the full year.","As discussed in our first quarter call, it\u2019s important to keep in mind the record level of occupancy that was captured in the back half of last year, particularly in the third quarter, that will serve as this year\u2019s comparative benchmark. But, to be clear, we anticipate the current strong occupancy and pricing trends will continue. For the full year we continue to believe that we will capture average physical occupancy at 96.2%, slightly ahead of last year\u2019s record performance at 96.1%, while also driving solid rent growth that supports the year-over-year gains in revenue leading to our increased expectations for the same store NOI growth. Al will walk you through the more detailed assumptions in his comments covering our revised and increased guidance for both same store NOI and Core FFO.","Same store operating metrics remain strong with resident turnover in the second quarter down 4.6% as compared to the second quarter of last year. Daily physical occupancy averaged 96.2% throughout the quarter matching last year\u2019s strong performance. Effective rent per unit increased 4.4% over the second quarter of last year and was up 1.4% on a sequential basis, with all of our markets registering both positive year-over-year and sequential rent growth with the exception of Houston which was down slightly by 0.2%. Tom will give you some additional insights on the operating trends we are seeing as well as outline performance differences across our markets.","Overall, we are encouraged with the continued levels of growing demand that is clearly keeping pace with new supply delivery across our diversified portfolio and balanced sub-market strategy. We continue to work through a very robust acquisition pipeline with deal flow running well ahead of last year. As outlined in the earnings release, we were successful in the second quarter with the acquisition of a new property in its initial lease-up in the Phoenix, Arizona MSA. This particular acquisition is a good example of the sort of opportunities we target involving a new lease-up development with a local developer and motivated capital that enables both our operating and transaction execution capabilities to capture a high-quality opportunity at a price that we believe will add to future value per share.","We expect to capture a stabilized NOI yield in the 6% range on this high-end new property once we complete the lease-up and execute on other opportunities associated with onsite operations and revenue management practices. As new supply continues to come on line in a number of our markets, we\u2019re optimistic that additional opportunities will be captured later this year.","So in summary, we like the market trends we are seeing and the MAA team has the operating platform executing well, the balance sheet is in terrific shape and our transaction pipeline is very busy. With that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Grimes","Thank you Eric and good morning everyone. Our second quarter NOI performance of 5.7% was driven by revenue growth of 4.4% over the prior year and 1.2% sequentially. We have good momentum in rents as all in place effective rents increased 4.4% from the prior year. In the second quarter, new rents and renewal rents executed during the quarter increased 5% on a blended lease over lease basis. We also matched the strong average occupancy of the prior year.","Overall same store expenses remain in line, up just 2.3%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry leading initiatives, such as our vendor owned shop stocking program and our interactive marketing strategy, have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check. Third quarter trends continue the positive momentum. Average daily physical occupancy of 96.2% is in line with July of last year. Our 60 day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60 day period is just 7%, below our prior year by 50bps. New and renewal rents have built on the strong trends of the second quarter.","On a blended lease over lease basis, our July rents increased 4.3% and early indications are that August will increase to 5%. On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Phoenix and Atlanta. The secondary markets continued to close the effective rent growth gap with the large markets. Since the third quarter of 2015, the rent growth gap between large and secondary markets has narrowed 60 basis points. Revenue growth in Jacksonville, Greenville, and Charleston stood out.","As mentioned, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy, rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry bead is Houston which represents just 3.4% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. As we approach the end of July, our Houston market\u2019s daily occupancy is 95.2% and 60 day exposure is just 6.6%. Move outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 4.6% over the prior year and turnover remained low at 51.5% on a rolling twelve month basis. Move outs to home buying were down 1%. Move outs to home rental, which represent just over 7% of our total move outs, were down 5%. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupants again paid off, and we were able to reduce by one day the average vacancy between occupants which helped drive the second quarter average physical occupancy to 96.2%.","During the quarter we completed over 1,800 interior unit upgrades, bringing our total units redeveloped this year to just over 3,200. We expect to redevelop over 5,000 units this year. Our redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 - 20,000 units remains robust. As a reminder, on average we are spending about $4,500 per unit and receiving average rent increases of approximately $100 over a comparable non-renovated unit, generating a year one cash return of well over 20%.","Our lease-up communities are performing well. Station Square at Cosner\u2019s Corner II closed the quarter at 99% occupancy. Cityscape at Market Center II is leasing well. They are currently 95.6% occupied and expected to stabilize on schedule in the third quarter of this year. Rivers Walk II in Charleston is 71% leased and Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes II in Orlando is 18% leased, both are on schedule. Our second quarter acquisition, Residences at Fountainhead in","Phoenix, Arizona is currently 78% occupied. At the midpoint of our summer season we are on track and the portfolio is performing very well, Al.","Albert Campbell","Thank you Tom and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll provide some additional commentary on the company\u2019s second quarter earnings performance and balance sheet activity and then finally on revised earnings guidance for the full year. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.49 per share, which represents a 10% increase over the prior year. Performance was $0.05 per share above the mid-point of our previous guidance. About two thirds or $0.03 per share, of this outperformance for the quarter was related to favorable property operating results, primarily due to operating expenses, as both personnel and marketing costs were better than expected for the quarter. Remaining $0.02 per share was primarily related to gains on casualty insurance claims settled during the quarter, as shown on the reported income statement. Strong rental pricing and continued high occupancy levels carried through the quarter, as expected, supporting the earnings performance.","As Eric mentioned, we acquired one new community during the second quarter, Residences at Fountainhead, located in Phoenix, for a total investment of 69.5 million. The community was in lease-up when acquired, and was 75.8% occupied at quarter-end. As Tom mentioned, lease-up continues to progress well, and we expect the community to complete its initial lease-up early next year.","During the second quarter we sold three parcels of commercial land and the remaining commercial JV property originally acquired in the Colonial merger for total proceeds of about 4.5 million, producing the small gains on sale of non-depreciable and depreciable assets reflected on the income statement for the quarter.","We had four communities, all phase II expansions of current properties, remaining under construction at the end of the quarter. We funded 16.1 million toward completion during the second quarter, and have an additional 48 million of the 97 million total projected cost remaining to be funded. We continue to expect stabilized NOI yields of 7.0% to 7.5% on average for these communities once completed and stabilized.","Our balance sheet remains in great shape. At quarter-end our, our leverage, defined as Net Debt to Gross assets, was 40.7%, 70 basis points below the prior year, while our Net Debt was only 5.7 times Recurring EBITDA. At quarter-end, 92% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective interest rate of only 3.8%, with well laddered maturities averaging 4.7 years.","At quarter end we had almost $600 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility providing both strength and flexibility for growth. Given our current expectations for acquisitions and dispositions over the remainder of the year, along with our projection for excess cash of 90 million to 95 million representing FAD less all dividends, we do not anticipate new equity needs this year and we expect to end the year with our leverage slightly below current levels.","Finally, as Eric mentioned, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for 2016 due to the stronger than projected performance. We\u2019re increasing our Core FFO projection by $0.04 per share at the mid-point, to reflect both the $0.05 per share second quarter outperformance and our revised expectations for real estate taxes for the year, now expected to cost us an additional $0.01 per share over the remainder of the year, as valuations, mainly in Texas, came in a bit higher than expected.","Our forecast generally continues to be based on our current strong occupancy levels carrying through the year, with the toughest comps in the third quarter, combined with pricing performance continuing in the 4% to 4.5% range. Core FFO is now projected to be $5.77 to $5.93 per share, or $5.85 at the midpoint, based on average shares and units outstanding of about 79.6 million. Core AFFO is now projected to be $5.07 to $5.23 per share, or $5.15 at the midpoint, which produces a strong 64% AFFO payout ratio for the year.","We also increased our same store NOI guidance to an expected range of 4.75% to 5.25% for the full year, based on higher revenue growth increased range to 4.0% to 4.5% and lower operating expense growth decreased range to 2.5% to 3.5%, which includes the impact of higher real estate taxes, now projected to grow 5.5% to 6.5% compared to the prior year. The other major components, including transaction and financing assumptions remain similar to our previous guidance.","That is all we have in the way of prepared comments, so Leo we will now turn the call back to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question comes from John Kim, BMO. Your line is open.","John Kim","Some of your markets have significant new supply expected over next few years, markets like Nashville, Charlotte and Austin where there is supposed to be about 9% new supply at least. And I know lot of this new delivery doesn't really compete with your asset directly, but I am just wondering if there are any markets that concern you as far as too much supply coming to market?","Eric Bolton","Yeah, I mean not at this point John. In Charlotte and Austin are good ones to talk about and I mean, they both have been delivering fairly high level of supply. I Charlotte that is quite isolated to sort of the urban core where just three of our assets are expect Charlotte to continue to be strong. In Austin, the development has largely been scattered most concentrated in the down town area but scattered across the MSA but it is largely you know will have a property to house a little bit of pressure from a single asset going up across the street then it will abate and honestly we have seen sort of similar things in Dallas as well but I think overall the fundamental line situation of strong job growth is continuing and it is allowing us to work through this deliveries.","John Kim","In this period you had revenue growth accelerate in Phoenix, Tampa and Dallas. I was wondering over the next 12 months what markets you're most bullish on, where you see revenue growth accelerate.","Eric Bolton","I think those and Orlando probably fit the bucket for us.","John Kim","Okay great, thank Eric.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Rich Anderson","Thanks, good morning. Good quarter, of course. So, you're kind of putting up a positive spin on new supply coming online because it opens up acquisition opportunities as you described Eric. How should we think about that? I mean, is the supply picture to you currently a positive consideration or are you just trying to eke out some positives out of a negative consideration?","Eric Bolton","No, I think - I mean obviously supply in a market brings into question, your ability to raise rents and just operating fundamentals but as Tom was just going through there, I mean as we look at it today, permitting across our portfolio in 2017, is forecast to be down 10% from what it is this year. So on balance given the strong job environment that we continue to see across our region from an operating perspective while we are not getting the sort of trends that we saw two years ago, we are still doing very well and as we try to emphasize the trends that we\u2019ve seen strong early this year. We expect those trends to continue, so from an operating perspective we are not nervous about supply trends at this point but -","Rich Anderson","I guess - of course, supply is a risk, I get that. But I was just wondering if there is an optimal amount of supply that gives you these acquisition opportunities and if you actually welcome some level to see -","Eric Bolton","Yeah, we do. I mean on the acquisition side of the equation, yeah absolutely right and what we liked to see particularly is more supply, comes on line particularly when it is concentrated and certain sub market and so forth which would often tends to be. We often see situations where like the situation I described that we just acquired in Phoenix where, you know so local developers or third party managed situation, they are really not in the business of leasing operating in a manner similar to what we are able to do and you through a little supply pressure into that sub market where they are trying to eke out the leas up, yeah, pressure mounts and buying opportunities emerge out of that. I mean all the deals that we acquired over the past year or so are very much along these lines where there leased up situations and we have got four or five deals on the hopper right now that we are underwriting pretty aggressively that are all very much along the same line. So I continued to feel that as over the next three or four quarters that we are going to see some good opportunities.","Rich Anderson","And then just, my second question is, do you feel like there is some sort of new paradigm emerging here? Obviously, your portfolio has always been thought to be low barrier, high-risk supply markets, offset by job growth, but the story today is a lot of urban development and maybe a causal factor to EQR\u2019s [ph] problems. Do you expect this to reverse back to more normalized conditions where you know your markets become the centerpiece of supply risk or do you think that there's something changing in your world that actually makes you a little bit more supply - more tefloned [ph] I guess?","Eric Bolton","Rich, I don\u2019t know, I will say this, you know we have always gone at this with a belief that we are trying to build a portfolio in markets and in sub markets and at price point that offer us the ability and you have heard me say this for years, outperform over the full cycle and you know market fats come and go, cap rates come and go but we are not driven by those things. We are driven by recurring cash flow, we deploy capital with that thought, we allocate capital across the region with that thought. We like the strong job growth metrics of the South East markets, we can\u2019t do anything about supply per say other than just be sure we got a very competitive platform and that we know how to operate very aggressively. And basically we feel like we can compete with anybody and we can compete superior to a lot of people we compete within these markets. So the supply will do what it does, what I really more focused on is being sure we deploy capital where demand is going to be and we think that demand is largely a function of job growth and economic growth and we like the South East for that reason.","Rich Anderson","Right, so I guess - I was thinking maybe lenders are exercising different standards to providing debt financing to developers and maybe that's something that's changing, but maybe not, I guess so -","Eric Bolton","It will change it comes and goes, right now for sure, they are probably nervous about funding a lot of construction in urban core areas.","Rich Anderson","Right, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Nick Joseph of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Nick Joseph","Thanks, Al, I'm wondering if you can give little more detail on the underlying assumptions that go into the back half of the year for same-store revenue growth guidance. You did 4.9% in the first half, the back half at the mid-point assumes 3.6% growth. You mentioned rent growth should be maintained at about 4% to 4.5%. There's the occupancy headwind of about 20 basis points. So, what else is driving or what are the other headwinds there to get from maybe that 4% down to the 3.6% implied by guidance?","Albert Campbell","Yeah, Nick sure I can give you some color on that. As personally just underlying what you mentioned we are not projecting the core fundamentals to decelerate in the back half and the core fundamentals for us are occupancy that would continue at the record 96.2 and the pricing growth. We expect to be in the 4% to 4.5%, we are certainly seeing that and expect to just to continue to see that through the back half. As you compare back to the prior year, the top of the comps are more difficult in two years, primarily third quarter and both the occupancy and your fees. Our fees and reimbursements that we have in our program that is a $30 million line item. So you put those two things together, that is getting you from 4% to 4.5% growth rate down to the 3.5% to 4% that is projected over the back half of the year. That is just you know math related to the comps to comps last year but the fundamentals of the business is strong and we expect that to continue.","Nick Joseph","Thanks, but what's a good run rate for fee growth going forward?","Albert Campbell","I would say that the issue with it for the back half is it was growing those two lines together we are growing comp of 7% to 8% last year. This year in to the future 3% more of a normalized growth rate, it is just last year as we are building occupancy, we just had as we talked about has it very end, we get capturing the final vestiges was called the Colonial, we had a very strong performance in those line items. So comparing back of 7% growth rate yielding torpidity long term is just not 3% something in the normal range as what we expect and it is pretty big line items that cause in the comparison.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. For those assumptions, are there any differences between what you're expecting from the large markets versus secondary markets?","Eric Bolton","On occupancy the headwind on the secondary is greater in the third quarter. Now it\u2019s not that much Nick, pretty consistent with the transfer seeing right now.","Operator","Our next question is from Jordan Saddler of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Austin Wurschmidt","It's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan, touching a little bit on next question, building off of that, I mean, turnover is really down again this quarter. Do you feel like you've taken your foot off the gas at all on rental rate growth given trying to manage a little bit of the more difficult occupancy comps you face in the back half the year? And then could you also give us what the rental rate growth was last year for July and August?","Eric Bolton","Answering your first question, no we don\u2019t think we have taken the foot off the gas at all. Turnover for move outs to rent increase moved from 14% of our move outs to 13%. So that is immaterial and we are getting 6.5% rent growth on that we feel pretty good about that and have it backed off at all on that. And then remind me your second question Austin.","Austin Wurschmidt","Yeah, just comparing the 4.3% increase you got in July and the 5% you expect in August, what were those numbers last year?","Eric Bolton","They were in the range last year, we will dig in for numbers, going increase over last year, it is within 50 basis points last year on appointed basis.","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay, thanks for that and then just, what is the average occupancy assumption you've got for the second half of the year?","Albert Campbell","96.2% and following on Nick\u2019s point, I think we have a record high of 96.6% in the third quarter last year, call it some of that, I think back half of the year, last year was 96.4% given there.","Austin Wurschmidt","So, you'd say that occupancy will be a headwind sort of 20 basis points in the back half of the year?","Albert Campbell","Slight headwind just from the comp, but we have a very strong still 96.2% for the year is a record level, it is actually 10 basis points above 96.1% that was record level last year, so that is how we look at, we are going to continue strong occupancy, continue push price and we believe that forecast back half is good.","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay, thanks for taking the question.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Gaurav Mehta of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Gaurav Mehta","Hi, good morning. Just going back to transactions, I was wondering if you could touch upon disposition, what you're seeing in the market and what's the timing of the sales of assets?","Eric Bolton","Well we are currently actually working on number of those transaction, we actually have seven properties currently in contract that we are working through due diligence on and we would expect assuming everything plays out as we think it will expect to close on those of those - most of those in the third quarter with the others probably in Q4.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. And then going back to acquisition, I was wondering if you could comment on - if you've seen any distressed product in the market as a result of tightening lending standards?","Eric Bolton","Not really, what we are seeing are more evidence that some of the lease up velocity that was taking place last year, some of these new properties is slowing a little bit and so some of the properties are brought up out of the ground early this year that sort of get to that 50%, 60%, 70% leased status, that\u2019s typically where you start to run into the most headwind, we have more of those in the market today and therefore, that\u2019s where our belief that we will see more opportunities, that\u2019s where that originates from.","Gaurav Mehta","And I guess last follow up. Are there any markets where you're seeing more of that product or its market wide in your markets?","Eric Bolton","It is pretty consistent across the board. I wouldn\u2019t point anything unique, we are seeing, mean Houston is a market where folks have been focused on trying to find some great buying opportunities but we continue to see pretty front pricing in that market. So it is pretty consistent across the board.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay thanks for taking my questions.","Eric Bolton","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Your line is open.","Rob Stevenson","Good morning guys. Tom, is there any of your top 10 markets other than maybe Houston where redevelopment isn't penciling today, where you are not able to get the returns that you would want in order to put capital to work.","Thomas Grimes","The redevelopment program is going strong Rob and it is generally not sort of a market by market decision. So it is has a bias there but in those assets are working every now and then, we will test a property to see if it works and then back off pretty quickly but there are no ongoing redevelopment jobs that we have backed off on or cancelling and on the tests that we do, we are generally seeing the same go forward rate as we had in the past. That is a place where new development does help us a little bit on assets that is 10 years old and they build right next to year, the latest and greatest and charge $500 bucks more, we can pop out the nice from micro counter tops and put in granite and charge 200 or something like that. It gives us an opportunity to grow that program.","Rob Stevenson","And then, Tom or Eric, I mean, when was the last time when you go back and look at the secondary markets actually outperformed your large markets for any length of period of time? I know it has gotten smaller as a percent, it gets you down to like 35% of NOI, now. But I'm just curious as you think about the portfolio going forward and sources of capital and things of that nature, whether or not that goes significantly lower because it seems like it's been a while since those markets have really outperformed?","Eric Bolton","You have to go back to really late 2008 throughout most 2009 time frame when we saw obviously a fairly deeper session taking place in the country. We saw the employment markets really take a beating and those kind of environments, recessionary environments, where job loss is really driving sort of the economic landscape, that tends to be where the secondary markets hold up a lot better and you can actually get to a point where the secondary markets are outperforming the large markets, both in terms of occupancy and in our ability to hold rents. So I think they are really more for that purpose for sort of severe economic or economic downturn conditions, I think that what you are going to see is as we have continue to cycle capital out of some of the older investments that we would had as you have pointed out, a lot given the sort of base rich notion of the company and where we sort of came from allow the over asset happen to be in some of the more tertiary market of the portfolio and that\u2019s where we cycled out a lot of we have accident close to 20 property over the last several years, selling over 13000 apartments. I think as we go forward you will see us continue with the primary focus on cycling out of some of the older assets where the CapEx requirements are growing and the after CapEx is likely to show more moderation and that will continue to adds an example to seven properties that we have under contract right now. Three of them are [indiscernible] sale in North Carolina, one of them is in Greensborough, one of them is in Huntsville. I think that - but having said that you will see us continued to look at opportunities in places like Charleston, Kansas city, Fredericksburg, clearly other secondary markets but we think that newer assets where we think the return on capital will be better over the next several years versus what we are selling.","Rob Stevenson","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Lesnick of Capital One.","Tom Lesnick","Hi, guys good morning, thanks for taking my question, I guess first, I was just curious, how is June across your markets? And I guess in that context, could you provide a little insight on what the quarter trends were like, were they consistent across all three months or was there some choppiness there?","Eric Bolton","Tom, they were really pretty consistent in terms of how rents went, blended rents went through, so June fits in line with what the quarterly average was and you know I guess there weren\u2019t a lot of difference between May, June and July and what the second quarter was to answer you on market level.","Tom Lesnick","That's very helpful. And my second question, what's your view on the fragmentation opportunity today across apartments in the Southeast; I mean, I guess if you look where stock price is today and the current premium to NAV with that, what's your appetite for acquisitions and scale at this point?","Eric Bolton","Well, I mean we are very interested in pursuing opportunities, as I mentioned in my prepared comments our deal flow is running probably 30% higher than it was this time last year, we are pushing hard on underwriting and processing as much opportunity as we can. I think as always though our focus is centered on ability to make an investment and ultimately capture a NOI yield and cash flow growth rate out of that investment that is at or better than the long term average that we are goal, that we have for the company and so we are not one to be, I mean while we are certainly aware instances to the concept surrounding our focus on capturing our spread between our current cost to capital and current cap rates. You know our focus is just always instead centered on capital allocation model, with priority on capturing NOI yield that meets or exceeds long term earnings growth profile we have for the company and ability ultimately to achieve higher return on capital long haul that is better than what we think our investors are expecting.","Tom Lesnick","All right, thanks guys appreciate it.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Tom.","Operator","Our next question is from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","Good morning guys.","Eric Bolton","Good morning Drew.","Drew Babin","In the first quarter, it looks like you had about a 40 basis point lift in your same-property revenue growth from fees, but wasn't accounted for by rent growth and occupancy growth. There seemed to be some contribution there that seemed to be absent in the second quarter and I was just wondering whether that was sort of a deceleration off of more rapid fee growth in past years or whether there's anything deliberate going on at the property level, maybe being a little less aggressive with these?","Eric Bolton","I\u2019ll give you some color and then Tom can jump in it. If you think about the first quarter Tom, we had a little bit remaining year over year occupancy lift in the first quarter and as you build occupancy fees come with that and so that happen I think in the third quarter, fourth quarter and the first quarter to a smaller extend but that very fact is part of the big discussion earlier that has given a confidence we can pay back the last year. We think these going forward going to grow in good normalized growth. We are having just very high, very good growth last year related to growing occupancy in the final vestiges of Colonial.","Thomas Grimes","I would say the other thing that has been a headwind on fees is barely and frankly and that positive is it with turned down consistently we are getting less and less in the way of termination and spread fees which worked for us but those are material feels and then secondly in the first quarter we had a sort of lights out delinquency bad debt month, we are still very, very good where we are but not quite as good.","Drew Babin","Okay that all make sense. And then one other question on some of the markets you mentioned throughout the Southeast, both large markets and secondary markets seems like demand growth is continuing to track very well, based on your comments? But it looks like just on a pure rent growth basis, there was a little bit of deceleration in few of the markets, we just wondering kind of is that supply issue primarily, not direct but indirect, you know is that something potentially could burn off of the coming quarters, what is behind that?","Eric Bolton","Of course, this is going to depend on the market we are talking about and so forth but broadly I would tell you that wherever we see any sort of if you will deceleration quarter over quarter basis in a given market more often than not it is a function of supply issue in a particular sub market affecting given property or something to that degree. I mean fundamentally the demand dynamics, job growth, population trends, all the other sort of factors that drive renters and leasing prospects to our properties all those fundamentals continue to show evidence of sustained strength and consistent with what we have been seeing for some time and where there is moderation if you will is going to be pockets of supply here and there.","Drew Babin","Okay, thank you, that\u2019s helpful, great quarter.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Drew.","Operator","Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Tayo Okusanya","Good morning everyone. So, just a quick question around supply, I know we've all kind of harped on is it seems like you guys are acknowledging that some of your markets are seeing increased supply and that it's manageable, but are there any markets where you start to worry that supply starts to overwhelm the system, and then you suddenly lose pricing power similar to what we're kind of seeing in New York and San Francisco?","Eric Bolton","I would tell you that I mean obviously we worry about hold of comp but two things that I would tell you is that obviously a lot of the supply that we are seeing in some of our markets it is tending to me more concentrated in some of the more urban core centric areas which happens to be where we don\u2019t have a lot of exposure and so we don\u2019t see anything suggesting that anything different is likely to ply out in the near term, so we continue to feel okay about that. We have been saying that supply had picked up over the last couple of years, so I mean we are not, it is not like it is a new thing. I mean it is just happens to be in areas that we don\u2019t have a lot of concentration. But I would tell you if you are trying to get at what it is going to change the chemistry, what is going to change the leasing dynamic in a material way and put us into a scenario where we are having same kind of pressures that some of these portfolios in San Francisco and New York are having. From my perspective the only thing that really materially weakens the chemistry for us is that we see a material weakening on the demand side of the equation. We see some sort of economic recession take place in a material way that causes job loss to come back into the equation and jobs to really start to pull back and in absence some sort of major disruption on the demand side of the equation right now it is hard to see anything it is going to cause material disruption in the positive leasing chemistry that continues to allow us to deliver we think pretty above long term performance. It is moderated from what it was a couple of years ago as a consequence really, a little supply but honestly just tougher comps and that\u2019s where the pressure has been but the strong trends per say are going to continue from what we see today.","Tayo Okusanya","That's helpful and then I'll just - again thanks for some of the comments on the back half of the year and what it could look like. Apart from some of the revenue pressures that you discussed, anything on the operating expense side that results in a weaker same-store NOI growth in the back half of 2016 versus the back half of 2015?","Albert Campbell","I think Tayo as we talk about a little bit in the call, very expense control, just as Tom said one of the hallmarks and we are very proud to continue that and across the lines as personnel, marketing for sure, very much under control. The one exception is real state tax as we talked about, we did get majority about valuations come out in the second quarter which is typical. In the beginning of year you sort of guessing on that just based on trends and so came out a little higher than we thought particularly in Texas as valuation in Dallas and Houston didn\u2019t soften like we had thought hope did it would any. So I think that\u2019s where the only pressure expenses is, we raised our guidance a percent at the midpoint on real estate tax guidance. Now we think it will grow about that 6.5%. That\u2019s you know thorough to be operating expenses but even with that we reduce, we were able to reduce midpoint of our expenses for the year by about 25 basis points. So some revolve that is, now we expect to be well under control.","Tayo Okusanya","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Good morning guys. Great quarter, looking at the demand side, job growth in US has tapered off a bit. Have you changed your outlook on demand for your portfolio?","Eric Bolton","Yeah, Wes at this point we have - I mean we will be taking a hard look at expectation for 17 as we work towards developing initial guidance and so forth on that. But as we see here today you know we haven\u2019t seen any evidence that weakness in employment trends are going to create any issues for us of course the other thing that\u2019s a strong under pinning to the demand component of our business is just all the sort of psychology surrounding home ownership versus rending their homes and all the demographic factors that are continued to work in our favor and so those powerful forces are there and they are going to continue from many thing that we see would allow us powerful forces to really be unleashed of courses, is a good job employment scenario where people can get the job. From what we see, employment trends tend to generally some of the particularly larger markets across the South East tend to be at the high end relative to what we see elsewhere across the country and that\u2019s largely frankly why we tend to focus, as much as we do on that region.","Wes Golladay","Okay and have you seen any, I guess, secular trends where big corporations are now moving into your markets, I think Dallas and Fort Worth have been a big beneficiary of that over the last few years, but I guess throughout your portfolio, are more companies getting ready to move to your cities and do you have any - I guess, next year that would be noticeable?","Eric Bolton","The South East continues to be a place lending significant manufacturing jobs, Volkswagen expanding and BMW expanding, probably largest Auto plant in North America outside of Greenville, and Tristan [ph] which already has Boeing rocking all along has picked up Volvo as well, General Dynamics expanding. So we are seeing those things happen as well as with Panama Canal opening up, our port locations have opportunity goes well. So those are continuing.","Thomas Grimes","And the markets as you mean, Atlantic continues to be a very strong magnet for corporate relocation just great quality life airport capability there and so and so. I mean Dallas, Fort Worth, Atlanta, I think Charlotte and Orlando, we are seeing really good things in terms of job grow and corporations moving operations to Orlando as well. ","Wes Golladay","Okay thanks for all the color.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Rich Anderson","I sort of keep it going but I'm just trying to think of the land gained projection. How much of that is completed and are there any kind of gains or actually should I say land proceeds, are there any more gains expected for the third or fourth quarter?","Eric Bolton","Nothing significant Rich, I will tell that is us continuing to move through, almost two small talk about now because of the income statement want to walk that through for you. So three parcels of land from the Colonial Merger, the remaining joint venture we had very small and the gains are small. It is all about half a million dollars on the income statement. So we have another few parcels of land we make sale of the course of the year and really the point there is, we value those well, we are getting gains on that sale, we don\u2019t think it will be significant but we are glad to turn that with more productive capital in our properties and have a slight gain over the back half of the year.","Rich Anderson","Would you be able to tell us what NAREIT FFO would be from a guidance perspective relative to your 5.85% on a core basis?","Eric Bolton","I think it would probably and will have that right from Rich, I mean you have to get that with your offline but that certainly would be a little bit I am not sure that is higher, how many cents? $0.6 per share higher, that is not precision right now.","Albert Campbell","Around $6 FFO for the year Rich, given","Rich Anderson","$6 right. That said could you have a big debt mark to market that would be in the near eight number.","Albert Campbell","Correct, so from 585, excuse me.","Rich Anderson","Okay great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Conor Wagner of Green Street.","Conor Wagner","Good Morning.","Eric Bolton","Good morning Conor.","Conor Wagner","On the redevelopment program, can you tell us how the units you did in 2014 are doing relative to their comps?","Eric Bolton","Our units done in 2014 relative to their comps.","Conor Wagner","Yes, you mentioned you get like 10% rent bump on the ones you are doing today. I was just wondering how durable that is, now that we're two years out from some of those redevelopments or the ones that you did in 2015?","Thomas Grimes","What happens there is that, you don\u2019t have comps anymore if that make any sense because on something that all the unit has, it don\u2019t have a comp to compare to because we redeveloped the whole property.","Eric Bolton","Tom is referring to comps meaning you know non-renovated units at the community. You are referring to the comps as what is happening in the market. And we would have to, we can get offline and figure out a way to pull that for you Conor but basically what we basically we do is, we do renovate, we go into our system and we make sure that the system knows that unit has had a capital infusion and therefore when we look at market rate trends over the next seven eight years, we take our comparison for our unit and that premium markup has to be there on a continuous basis for five or seven years or in other word, whatever premium we got to market when we initially did the deal, we track it to make sure that premium stays in place over the life of the investment that we make and there is, we have classification on buy unit where we can charge premiums for use, we can charge premiums for this upgrade, we can charge premiums for whatever, we got a lot of different premium levers and when we throw those levers they stay there and that becomes the benchmark that compares against the market.","Conor Wagner","So then, I guess you could say, if you track those units from 2014 you're obviously still able to get that premium?","Thomas Grimes","Yes.","Eric Bolton","Yes.","Conor Wagner","And then for your redevelopment plan, do you plan on doing a similar number of units in the 2017?","Thomas Grimes","What happens there is that, you don\u2019t have comps anymore if that make any sense because on something that all the unit has, it don\u2019t have a comp to compare to because we redeveloped the whole property.","Eric Bolton","I would think we would be in that ballpark, I mean hadn\u2019t penciled it just yet, the pipeline continues. It can, and we feel good about the opportunity to do at least that.","Conor Wagner","And that's typically going to be about a $5 million boost to NOI in a given year, so that like 1% boost to NOI growth?","Eric Bolton","I think it is closer to 40 perhaps.","Conor Wagner","I guess, all right maybe from the rolling of the previous year, right. With the stuff that you're doing -","Eric Bolton","Double off, that would be correct.","Conor Wagner","You do it on a continual basis. And then last question just on renewals, where are you sending them out for August and September?","Eric Bolton","We are going out at 6.5% to 7%","Conor Wagner","6.5% to 7%, great. Thank you very much guys.","Eric Bolton","Okay thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Buck Horne of Raymond James.","Buck Horne","Hey there, good morning guys. Appreciate the time. I was just browsing some of these stats that just hit the tape [ph] from the Census Bureau talking about a million new households are being formed all of them renters in the last quarter, at least on a year-over-year basis, and looks like the homeownership rate just hit the lowest level since 1965. I guess my question is are you guys surprised at this point in the cycle that move-outs to homeownership are not going up at this point, where the mortgage rates are at and what's happening out there? I guess is there any signs in your incoming tenants whether it's average FICO or rent to income or some other metrics that - something is changed in the demographics or changed in the propensity to rent or preventing people from buying?","Eric Bolton","No, I mean Buck the rents to income ratio of our folks is about 17% and 18%. Their credit scores are very strong. Either folks that could go by house tomorrow are choosing not to and really nothing in our sort of what we are seeing in demographics that makes us think that I mean 74% single right now, or predominantly female there, they just doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of demand for owning your home out of our residents at this point.","Thomas Grimes","Buck, I mean you research this very well and you know lot about this but these trends but I just think it gets back to just the whole psychology that late 20 early 30 year old today is just different than it was years ago and I think that as you know whether they are getting married later in life or starting family later in life, just life conditions are different today than they were years ago and as a consequence to that, they are just more in kind want to rent their housing as supposed to making the obligations surrounding buying a home and it is hard for me to see how that is going to materially change. I think, people are more motivated to make a decision to buy versus a rent for life style reasons and attractive financing and low interest rate notwithstanding I don\u2019t think it is going to compel people to abandon a lifestyle choice just because it gets little bit more affordable.","Buck Horne","I appreciate those comments. And just going back to the acquisition opportunities, have you seen or detected any changes to cap rate expectations in the market, just given maybe the surge of activity that you're seeing in the pipeline? What are cap rates for well-located property in your markets, roughly?","Eric Bolton","We are still seeing very low five, high for cap rates pretty routinely. We haven\u2019t seen any evidence as to suggest the cap rates have materially changed. We are just seeing more opportunity and of course where we focus on some of these leased up opportunities as you know those are situations that are little bit more difficult to finance and only the strongest buyers can take on some of the initial dilution associated with acquiring a non-stabilized asset and our ability to execute on all cash basis from an acquisition perspective really gets us to a lot of opportunity versus a lot of the other constant that we run into our competitors that we into. So we haven\u2019t seen any evidence to suggest the cap rates have changed in anyway. We are just seeing more opportunity and working that angle to our benefit.","Buck Horne","I appreciate it very much, thanks gentleman.","Thomas Grimes","Thank you, Buck.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take question from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.","Dennis McGill","Good morning, thank you guys. First question just on Houston, interested in your perspective on where you think you are in the pricing cycle there, does it feel on the ground as though prices have stabilized or do you feel like there's more pressure ahead?","Eric Bolton","We are continuing to have pressure on new lease prices, so I think that\u2019s going we are not quite bottom on there, renewals were still getting positive at 3, 3.5. So I think we have got little more tough slotting in Houston and I mean we are so - of course Houston is a very, very big market and it is going to vary a lot of sub market and some of our suburban locations are going to hold up better than some of those stuff around the gallery and well inside the loop and so it is going to vary a little bit. But I think Houston has got another three or four quarters to go before I mean, good news is supply has really stopped, debt stopped and I think you just got to work through the absorption over the next three or four quarters and I think Houston becomes more of a recovery story, perhaps in late 17 certainly by the time it get to 2018.","Dennis McGill","And then separately, a couple questions on turnover. When you look at your turnover today, I think in the past, there were times where it was in the low 60% range. Do you feel like normalized turnover is somewhere in that range or is it different today based the shift in the portfolio versus let's say 10 years ago?","Thomas Grimes","Yeah, I don\u2019t think we will get back to those really hard turn over numbers, shift in the portfolio as well as shift in consumer habits around.","Eric Bolton","I think as Tom said there is two factors, as we have sold of some of the older properties that we had over the last several years, a lot of those properties where in some of these smaller more tertiary market and some of those properties tend to be dominated by more of a military profile where you tend to have a higher turnover rate associated with the activity at the property and I think that is a little bit apply in our portfolio coupled with the other point Tom mentioned which is just renter psychology is so much different and average length of stay in our portfolio is longer than it has ever been and our average rent is higher than it has been and I just think that you know the odds of getting back to 64% - 65% turnover, we just don\u2019t see anything that is likely to get us in that direction.","Dennis McGill","So, if you thought about and appreciate that you probably are not going to get back to 64% or 65%. If hypothetically renter choices change and let's say it trends back to 60% over a couple of year period, what would that do to operating margin if you isolated that instance and let's say pricing power remains relatively similar 3% to 4% type range, if that happened over a couple of year period?","Eric Bolton","Every 1% change it is about a penny for share so it is not quite a significant as you think but it is the best impact you could think about.","Dennis McGill","Okay perfect, thanks guys.","Eric Bolton","Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Eric Bolton","All right we appreciate for joining us this morning and follow up with us if you have any other questions.

The outlook for continued recovery and job growth across our portfolio along with positive demographic trends are expected to generate continued growth and demand and net positive absorption.","Across our large tier market segment of the portfolio, the ratio of new jobs to new unit deliveries is expected to remain very healthy in 2013 at almost 9:1, while the secondary market segment of the portfolio will be slightly stronger at close to 12:1.","During the fourth quarter, resident turnover declined 4.5% as compared to the prior year. Move-outs to buy a home declined 1.8%. Move-outs to rent a home moved up only slightly from 5% to 6% during the quarter and remain an insignificant factor in driving resident turnover. The number of new resident move-ins in the fourth quarter increased 2.5% when compared to the prior year.","Effective rent across the same-store portfolio grew 4.8% in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, new lease rents grew 3.2% in the fourth quarter. Renewal pricing for existing residents on a lease-over-lease basis increased an average of 5.5%.","We continue to make progress on positioning the balance sheet for broader access to the unsecured debt market. We ended the year with over 52% of the portfolio unencumbered and expect to see the unencumbered asset pool grow in 2013. As reported a couple of weeks ago, S&P issued an initial investment grade rating on MAA, a BBB-minus with a positive outlook.","Leasing continues to go well on our new development projects in Nashville and Little Rock with rents running ahead of pro forma. Initial occupancy started last month at our new lease-up in Charlotte and while still early in the process, we\u2019re on track to meet expectations at this Phase II project. Construction is underway at our project in Charleston and we expect to begin pre-leasing late this quarter.","We\u2019re excited about our new project in Jacksonville that broke ground in Q4. Our 220 Riverside project is located in a highly desirable urban location across the street from the headquarters of three of the city\u2019s largest employers. It\u2019s adjacent to Unity Park, Jacksonville\u2019s newest urban park and is within easy walking distance of the city\u2019s Riverside Arts Market.","We expect the acquisition environment to remain competitive in 2013 as capital continues to chase yield and investment opportunity. We\u2019ve modeled $250 million to $300 million of wholly-owned acquisitions in 2013, which is down slightly from the $345 million in acquisitions completed in 2012.","In our base case modeling for 2013, we\u2019ve not assumed any additional JV acquisitions as we expect the environment for value add or repositioning place to remain very pricey. Our strategy and approach for deploying capital remains consistent with the focus on both large and secondary markets across our Sunbelt footprint. As noted in our earnings release, we expect to increase our disposition activity again this year with dispositions ranging from $150 million to $160 million. We remain committed to a steady program of recycling capital from lower after-CapEx margin investments into higher margin properties.","As we head into 2013, our performance objective for shareholders remains centered on strengthening MAA\u2019s full cycle performance platform. As increasing levels of new construction come online in 2014 and 2015, we expect our disciplined approach to investing, across both large and secondary markets, combined with a significantly strengthened balance sheet will position the company to both capture steady external growth and generate superior stable, long-term, same-store results.","I\u2019m going to now turn the call over to Al to update you more on Q4 and 2013 guidance. Al?","Al Campbell","Okay. Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll provide a few comments on earnings performance for the fourth quarter and on our balance sheet. And then I\u2019ll outline the key assumptions included in the 2013 guidance. FFO for the fourth quarter was $53.4 million or $1.21 per diluted share, which represents 13% growth over the prior year and a $0.06 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. About two-thirds or $0.04 per share of this favorability from expectations was produced by property performance with $0.03 related to the same-store portfolio and another $0.01 related to development in recent acquisition properties.","Revenue performance for the fourth quarter was essentially in line with expectations, while utilities, repair and maintenance and real estate tax expenses combined and produced the majority of this favorability for the quarter with roughly equal contributions. An additional $0.02 per share was related to interest expense and acquisition costs for the quarter primarily due to no acquisitions occurring during the fourth quarter.","FFO for the full year was $196.3 million or $4.57 per share, which is a record for the company and represents 15% growth over the prior year. During the fourth quarter, we sold one additional community for $13.6 million completing recycling plans for the year and bringing year-to-date gross proceeds from dispositions to about $113 million.","And as Eric mentioned, we continue to make good progress on the development pipeline. During the fourth quarter, we funded an additional $20.5 million toward completion, leaving just over $57 million to complete all projects currently underway. You\u2019ll notice in the supplement to the release that the total \u2013 our disclosure of total estimated cost for the development project has been revised. The total cost presented now represents all costs expected to be capitalized for the projects instead of primarily construction-related costs included in the prior disclosure. And I should note that the projected cash flows and expected returns for these projects remain intact and well above our investment hurdle rate.","Our balance sheet ended the quarter in great position and we continue progress towards achieving full and efficient access to the public debt market. During the quarter, we issued around 343,000 common shares to the ATM program at an average price of $65.67 per share for total net proceeds of $22.2 million which was primarily used to fund development activity.","Also, as Eric mentioned, in January, we received a first time issuers rating from Standard & Poor\u2019s which reflects the strength of our balance sheet and really completes our goal of receiving investment grade ratings from all three rating agencies. We plan to put these ratings to good use in 2013 which I\u2019ll discuss just a bit more in just a moment.","Now, I\u2019ll turn to earnings guidance for 2013, and we\u2019ve outlined the major assumptions in the supplement to our release, but in summary, we projected diluted FFO per share for the full year of $4.83, the midpoint of our projected range of $4.73 to $4.93 per share. FFO is expected to be between $1.13 and $1.25 for the first quarter, $1.18 and $1.30 for the second quarter, $1.12 and $1.24 for the third quarter and between $1.16 and $1.28 for the fourth quarter. Our quarterly guidance range reflects the potential impact of timing of our significant transaction disposition and financing activity planned for the year.","The primary driver of 2013 growth is expected to be continued strong performance from the same-store portfolio. Our estimate includes full year same-store NOI growth of 4% to 6%, based on a 4% to 5% growth in revenues and a 3.5% to 4.5% growth in operating expenses. We expect solid pricing performance to continue in 2013 with some moderation as we move into the back half of the year. And our estimate is based on occupancy levels remaining essentially constant with pricing growth in the 4% to 4.5% range.","We expect real estate taxes, which remember represent about a quarter of our operating expenses, to produce the largest increase in expenses project to grow 5.5% to 6.5% over the same-store portfolio in 2013. Our guidance includes acquisitions of wholly-owned communities of $250 million to $300 million including the planned acquisition of two communities from Fund I, our joint venture with Fannie Mae.","We also plan to sell $150 million to $160 million of wholly-owned communities during the year and our cap rate expectations for acquisitions are in the 5.5% to 6% range with disposition cap rate expected to be about 100 basis points higher on average.","We expect to fund an additional $40 million to $50 million on the development pipeline to 2013 with no new developments currently planned. We also expect to spend an additional $8.5 million of redevelopment capital on the interior renovation program and on recent acquisition communities combined.","Capital spending on the existing properties is projected to be around $41 million or $840 per unit with $30 million going to our recurring capital expenditures and an additional $11 million toward revenue enhancing projects.","Other key assumptions include plans to refinance about $150 million of existing debt, prepaying a portion of our 2014 maturities. We do currently plan to access the public bond market in 2013, most likely in the back half of the year as we continue to transition our balance sheet, fund growth and broaden our cap resources.","We expect our leverage to find as debt to gross assets to range between 43% and 45%, while we expect our unencumbered asset portfolio to increase to a range of 55% to 60% of gross assets by year-end.","Interest costs are expected to be 3.8% to 4% for the full year of course depending on the timing of financing transactions mentioned earlier. We anticipate combined property management and G&A expenses to be between $37 million and $38 million for the year, declining about 20 basis points as a percent of total revenue.","That\u2019s all that we have in the way of prepared comments. Tammie, I\u2019ll turn the call over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Karin Ford of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc","Hi, good morning. Just wanted a quick question on your fourth quarter revenue growth, just looking specifically at the large markets, but I guess it applies to both. You posted 7.1% revenue growth, but it looks like rent was up 5.9% and occupancy was up 10 basis points. So was ancillary income \u2013 could you explain the gap and why was that up so much on a year-over-year basis?","Tom Grimes","Thanks for asking that question, Karin. It\u2019s two pieces of it and you mentioned one. Ancillary income is a component of that. We\u2019ve been able to push through larger cable increases in our larger market groups and that\u2019s showing up a part of it. And the other piece of it is we\u2019re reporting our quarter end fiscal occupancy in our average fiscal occupancy for the quarter for the large markets group was up 70 basis points. So it\u2019s a pretty big driver of it as well.","Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Next question is, can you just talk about what the post quarter trend has been in January, what\u2019s occupancy today and where have renewal increases been so far this year?","Tom Grimes","Sure. It\u2019s continuing on with \u2013 it\u2019s very good trajectory occupancy. At the same point, it was last year at 95.5%. And our renewal increases, we\u2019re getting around a little above 6% right now.","Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay, great. And last question is just a bigger picture one for, Eric. Can you just talk about your view on the right size of the development pipelines for Mid-America at this point in the cycle and do you expect it to be increasing or decreasing here as we push through 2013?","Eric Bolton","I would tell you, Karin, that we\u2019re \u2013 as Al mentioned, we haven\u2019t delved in any expectation starting anything new in this year other than the 220 Riverside project in Jacksonville. Having said that, we continue to look at a number of opportunities and developers continue to approach us. It\u2019s conceivable that we might do another project or two. Broadly speaking, we are comfortable carrying roughly somewhere around $150 million to as much as $200 million of development on the balance sheet. We just continue to believe in the strategy for us that make sense is to be more focused on looking for opportunistic buys of some of these new constructions that is going to be coming out of the ground particularly in 2014 or 2015.","We think that over time, we\u2019re able to generate better returns for capital and certainly take on a risk adjusted basis that we\u2019re better able to just be there in 2014 and 2015 while this new project comes out of the ground. All of it won\u2019t work and there maybe some that ultimately provides a better way to bring that new product in the portfolio. Having said that, as I mentioned don\u2019t be surprised if we announced another deal or two this year. But with the other projects leasing up as well as they are and the funding pretty well set, we feel like we could probably start another one or two if we find the opportunity.","Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc","Great. Thanks for the color.","Tom Grimes","Thank you, Karin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Good morning, guys. Just a follow up on the last question on development. What\u2019s the expected stabilized yield on those three projects in the pipeline today?","Al Campbell","Rob, this is Al. It\u2019s about 7.5% to 8%. That really hasn\u2019t changed, and so that\u2019s the expectations.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Okay.","Al Campbell","So lease up is going well, we\u2019re meeting those targets.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. So with those projects coming in and the other projects coming out from basically being in leased up, it\u2019s still 7% to 8%, you said?","Al Campbell","It is that the latest project is at the lower end of that, I think, because it\u2019s a different point in the cycle. But 7.5% to 8% for that group is the right number.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. And then if I think about the $121 million you did in the fourth quarter, Al, what has to happen? What\u2019s the two or three major levers that would drop you towards the low end of your first quarter guidance range?","Al Campbell","We\u2019ve got a couple of things going on in Q1, Rob. One is a little bit of normal seasonality as the winter leasing season plays out in the first quarter, but then you have some timing as some SG&A cost really bigger in the first quarter related to some gearing work and some things that we had going on with our bond program this year that we expect in the first quarter. So that\u2019s causing the largest part of that decrease. And I think to go beyond that to the bottom end of the range, you\u2019d have to have some transaction timing that we have planned in the year be significantly different in that first quarter.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. So, basically, you\u2019d have to sell $160 million at some point already in the past here to get that type of dilution?","Al Campbell","Yeah. If you look at the quarterly guidance, I think for the year, yeah, you have to assume like you sold assets faster than we thought. We bought assets later than we thought, I\u2019m taking for a negative result, and things like that. And then, obviously, our same-store performance that we didn\u2019t quite meet the targets there that we had set out. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, but that\u2019s what the guidance range is there to cover.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. And then can you guys talk about what the \u2013 how much non-core assets you guys have today? I mean, you guys are targeting $150 million to $160 million of dispositions. I mean, what\u2019s the size of the entire \u2013 when you take a look at your portfolio today that if you had an opportunity to redeploy proceeds, I mean what\u2019s the size of the potential disposition over the next couple of years for you guys?","Eric Bolton","Well, we don\u2019t really, to be honest with you, Rob, we don\u2019t have a core versus a non-core definition. For us, we don\u2019t have really any desire to make any sort of strategic shift from our footprint, no strategic shift from our allocation between large and secondary. We like the strategy. Having said that, our disposition program is driven by, I believe though it\u2019s just prudent to cycle out some of the large margin investments every year. We\u2019ve gotten to a point now with coverage ratios and other aspects of the balance sheet now able to support a little bit more of a robust effort as it relates to recycling. We think going far for the next couple of years or more that something around $150 million to $170 million is likely what we will be doing every year going forward.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. And then lastly, what\u2019s your view today on moving further Northern Virginia? Does any of the sort of issues that you\u2019re seeing in sort of north of the core, sort of Northern Virginia, DC, suburbs make you hesitate about moving further north? Do you see opportunity, something that you guys have been taking a more active look at these days?","Eric Bolton","We have been looking more in Northern Virginia. We certainly don\u2019t envision going into DC itself and I think that really doesn\u2019t fit with what we\u2019re trying to do from a strategy perspective. But, Northern Virginia certainly is a market that we continue to like. We\u2019ve added a couple and are looking at some other opportunities up there now.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Are you seeing better opportunities today as a result of concerns about sequestration and things like that or is it still a pretty tight surprising market in your view?","Eric Bolton","It\u2019s still pretty tight, it\u2019s still pretty tight.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gaurav Mehta of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Gaurav Mehta \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Good morning.","Eric Bolton","Good morning.","Al Campbell","Good morning.","Gaurav Mehta \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Couple of question on your guidance. So, if I look back, your large market had been outperforming your secondary market. What do you expect in 2013? Do you expect the gap to widen or narrow and would you be able to break down your NOI guidance by large and secondary markets?","Eric Bolton","Well, broadly speaking, we think that given the ratio of new job growth to supply that I mentioned earlier, and the fact that the ratio is actually stronger in the secondary markets in 2013 as compared to what it was in 2011 and the fact in the large markets, that ratio weakened slightly in 2013 as compared to 2012, we don\u2019t think that the gap gets any wider. We think that 2013 is probably an inflection year and that the secondary markets will perform in a more aligned or closer to the large markets.","It just really depends on how much supply does come into some of the larger markets in 2014 and 2015. But I\u2019d certainly expect that by the time we get to late in 2013 and into 2014 that the gap is fairly narrow between the two segments in terms of their performance. And just depending on, again, how the supply picture works out and how the economy and job growth picture works out, we very well could see the secondary market performance begin to pick up and surpass large markets at some point down the road. That\u2019s really the piece of our whole strategy is to try to create a more, in aggregate stable level of performance by trading off a little bit between the large and the secondary markets.","Gaurav Mehta \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. That\u2019s Helpful. Second question I have is on your balance sheet. So, if I look at your guidance, it looks like you\u2019re expecting $0.01 debt refinancing charge in 2013. And then you also talked about your desire to access public bond market. So can you perhaps expand on your refinancing activities in 2013? When I look at your maturity table, it seemed like you don\u2019t have any debt expiring in 2013. So would you be looking to refinance perhaps from that from 2014 and 2015?","Al Campbell","Well, that\u2019s a good point. I think, in general, we don\u2019t have to do anything in 2013. As you mentioned, we have no maturities, but we do have plans to continue our progress and do a couple of things. One, to continue increasing our unencumbered asset portfolio. As we talked about, our targets are 55% to 60%, which we think is \u2013 60% is where long-term we think we want to be. Also to increase our fixed rate protection, so we think that in the end of the year, we\u2019ll be closer to somewhere call it 93% to 95% of our debt fixed and which is taking a little bit higher. It\u2019s a good time to do that and it\u2019s something we want to do to protect the balance sheet.","So, I think those two things are part of our plans and to execute that we do plan to be in the \u2013 and obviously, we want to put our ratings, the progress that we\u2019ve made to this point, it\u2019s a good use in 2013. So we plan to go to bond market probably the back half of the year to do a transaction. A good way to model it would be a transaction that\u2019s the minimal size to be index eligible at somewhere in treasury plus 200 basis points. Hope we can beat that, but given a first-time issuer in those kind of things, that\u2019s kind of how we look at it and the plans that we have. And then also the funds of that will be used to knock down the 2014 maturity stock that you see there and get us ahead of that.","Gaurav Mehta \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. And then last question I have is on your JV. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you\u2019re not looking to acquire anything via JV. Is that because of the economics that do not make sense for you or you do not have interest from the JV partners? And also what are your thoughts on future development via JVs?","Eric Bolton","Well, the expectation at least in our initial guidance that we won\u2019t have any JV acquisitions is purely just a function of we think the market to buy and that those sort of value adds older properties which is what our JV is focused on doing. The pricing in that market is just really frothy right now and we\u2019ve not been able to make any deals work as those projects are easy to finance. Frankly, buyers are able to get a little bit more creative with some of their underwriting. And we just see that the pricing is really tough to make work right now in that regard for the older products.","JV for development probably not something we\u2019re interested in doing. We continue to believe that the right approach for JV or for development is for us is essentially a pre-purchase model. It\u2019s not to say we would never consider it. But at this point, it\u2019s certainly not something we\u2019re focused on doing.","Gaurav Mehta \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Thank you. That\u2019s all I had.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hey, thanks. Good morning folks.","Eric Bolton","Good morning, Rich.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hey, Al, I just noticed one thing about the balance sheet now that you\u2019ve gotten the investment grade rating from all three agencies. Debt-to-total gross assets reflects maybe even a little bit of an increase over the course of the year. Can you explain that?","Al Campbell","No, debt-to-gross-assets compared to prior year-end is down a couple of 100 basis points really.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","No, I mean talking about your guidance. So, I think you were 43.9%, right, as of the end of the quarter...","Al Campbell","Yeah...","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets:...and the guidance is 43% to 45%?","Al Campbell","Yeah. The guidance is to stay about where we are plus or minus a few bps. But 44% is sort of the midpoint of the guidance and that\u2019s really our target.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay.","Al Campbell","You might see us go a little bit below that as we progress in the year, but that\u2019s really \u2013 given our strategy, Rich, sort of a lower risk strategy and the reception that we\u2019ve gotten from the rating agencies, we think that\u2019s pretty much the right level.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Eric, you talked about 2014, 2015 supply risk and I think you kind of said \u2013 you kind of explained some of the strategy that you\u2019ve put in place that mitigate some of that risk for you guys in your markets and one of them being I guess buying out products coming out of the ground and developing it yourself. But what other strategies, can you provide a little bit more color on what MAA is going to do differently this time when supply does inevitably kind of rain on the parade at least to some degree for you? And how your behaviors might change from maybe the past few cycles with other cycle?","Eric Bolton","Well, I think that for us we think that now given our markets and just given our strategy, now is not the time to ramp up a big development pipeline. I think that there\u2019s plenty of that happening and plenty of it coming and we find that particularly in some of the secondary markets that a lot of these developers are not really building this product with the intent of holding it.","We also find a lot of them are not particularly adept at leasing and lease-up and we find that while there\u2019s a lot of handwringing in one sense from an operating perspective about, worry about supply trends, in another sense I\u2019m looking forward to it, because I think it\u2019s going to yield for us some terrific buying opportunities down the road and that\u2019s why the work underway on the balance sheet is so important. And for us it\u2019s all about just trying to find a way to create a competitive advantage for our capital and with the balance sheet and with the execution capabilities that we have as some of this product comes in the market, certain submarkets, without a doubt are going to get a little bit soft in 2014 and 2015 and we hope to be there with a checkbook in hand and create some great buying opportunities.","So, I think that for us it\u2019s all about just making sure we\u2019re positioned for some inevitable submarket weaknesses that will pop up from here or there, and not get enamored with the idea that everybody is building and we need to build too and let\u2019s just ramp up a big development pipeline. That\u2019s just \u2013 that\u2019s not the way we operate.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","So would you say that\u2019s the biggest difference for the company, the balance sheet and your ability to participate on the buy side versus last \u2013 previous cycles? And is there anything strategic you can do besides that to mitigate some of the risks or is that basically it?","Eric Bolton","I think that\u2019s basically it. I think that just being disciplined with how we deploy capital is the best thing you can do to mitigate risks when things weaken. And as we look to deploy capital in 2013, our expectation in the underwriting will reflect some level of rent growth moderating in 2014 and 2015, and if we can buy on a basis that has that assumption built into it, we\u2019ll buy. If not, we won\u2019t.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Fair enough. On your commentary, you said 9 to 1 jobs to units for large markets I think, right, and 12 to 1 for secondary, is that what the numbers were?","Eric Bolton","Correct.","Al Campbell","Correct.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","What\u2019s the trouble down there? I assume it\u2019s not 1 to 1, right? So I assume you got to have some number, is it 5 or 6 to 1 where you\u2019re kind of equilibrium? Like how far above are those numbers from where if you kind of get into an equilibrium-type stage?","Eric Bolton","I\u2019ve seen a couple of different reports or several different reports and it\u2019s either 5 to 1 or 6 to 1 is kind of where the equilibrium. Different people go through different allocations in terms of certain number of households will choose to own versus rent and certain ones will choose to rent a home versus rent an apartment. And so, most suggests that 5 to 1, 6 to 1 you\u2019re kind of at equilibrium.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Back to you, Al. If you were to hold everything else constant except for the fact that you now have three investment grade ratings. How much do you think the company saves if, notwithstanding the change in interest rates and all that, sort of stuff, just holding everything else stationary, is it 50 basis points, call it, 10-year money what \u2013 more than, less than that, what do you think?","Al Campbell","Well, I think we\u2019ve already captured to the process on our credit facility 30 to 40 basis points, Rich, and that was \u2013 you need one \u2013 you need two ratings to do that. With this final rating, I think that the next step will be at full access on an efficient basis to the bond market should get you another 20 or 30 basis points I think. Now you may not see all of that the first issuance but certainly as you become a seasoned issuer that\u2019s very realistic, I think. So that\u2019s the goal.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. And last question is on the same-store guidance of 4% to 6% NOI. How much would that be if you kind of took out the ancillary stuff in the revenue line, would it be 100 basis points less or maybe not that much. Can you just kind of...","Al Campbell","Maybe 40 to 50 basis points, Rich, somewhere in that line. It\u2019s a contributor but certainly rents are the primary driver.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay, fine. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paula Poskon of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert Baird","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Eric Bolton","Good morning, Paula.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert Baird","Eric, regarding your acquisition guidance, can you just talk about what deal flow has looked like recently in particular with EQR selling so many of their assets in many of your core markets and whether or not you\u2019ve looked at those and whether or not you think even just having that additional activity has attracted new buyers to your markets?","Eric Bolton","Well, the market is pretty active. I mean our deal flow remains very, very full. We\u2019re looking at a lot of different opportunities at the moment. I think that whether it\u2019s the EQR transactions, or properties or whether it\u2019s just capital broadly being drawn to the apartment sector, there is certainly a lot of capital in all the markets than we\u2019re seeing more activity in secondary markets as well.","As it relates specifically to the EQR assets, honestly, we\u2019ve seen a couple of them. But for the most part, it\u2019s really not the product that we\u2019re targeting to buy. We\u2019ve added a little over $1 billion worth of new assets in the last four years. The average age has been four years old. The product that we\u2019ve been seeing that EQR is putting out there was 15 and in some cases 20 years old and that\u2019s really not what we\u2019re targeting to add to the balance sheet.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert Baird","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Eric. Are you guys surprised that move-outs to home ownerships is down given all the euphoria about the housing recovery? And I guess, relatedly, how is that metric varying across your markets?","Tom Grimes","Paula, it\u2019s Tom. I think surprised not so much in fourth quarter because it\u2019s been sort of the story all year down to flat, flat to down, down to flat. It\u2019s not materially down to be honest with you, but it\u2019s at an all time low. I think this time last year, I would have thought it would have picked up a little bit, but it\u2019s not that surprising to be honest with you. As far as how it varies by market, we see a higher percentage in the large markets moving out to homebuyers and a lower percentage in the secondary markets.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert Baird","Interesting. And finally, are you seeing any competition from the single-family rental product that\u2019s also been so much in the news in recent months?","Tom Grimes","Just none. And we\u2019re really glad we\u2019re not doing it because it seems like a very, very hard business to make money doing on an ongoing operating basis. But I mean there\u2019s just not been that move-outs, renting homes has stayed between 5% and 6% for the last two years. I would think now is the best time it\u2019s ever going to be to rent a home and it doesn\u2019t seem to move the needle and certainly not with the folks that we\u2019re renting to. My sort of sense is that home renter is most likely going to be an ex-homeowner and that people just want to be in a house aren\u2019t coming back to us, they\u2019re going to that pool.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert Baird","Thanks very much. That\u2019s all I have today.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Paula.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mike Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good morning, guys.","Eric Bolton","Hi, Mike.","Al Campbell","Hi.","Mike Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Al, just to go back to the debt offering situation. I know you guys \u2013 you don\u2019t have a lot of debt maturing but you do have a bunch of swap maturities maturing. Is kind of the plan as those maturities come due to then do the unsecured offering and kind of time that so there\u2019s no significant benefit. I think you threw out a number of treasuries plus 200 basis points would probably put you right around 4% there versus the 5.2% maturities. Just kind of wondering what you\u2019ve got kind of embedded in terms of interest rate savings on that.","Al Campbell","You\u2019re right on top it, Mike. That\u2019s a very good number you put together. And you\u2019re exactly right, we are knocking down 2014 maturities and we\u2019re going to do that after the swaps mature. Now, since you do a bond transaction in one big deal, we\u2019re going to let the $100 million to $150 million of those swaps mature before. That\u2019s why we say we\u2019ll be in the bond market in the latter part, call it, late second, third quarter time range and let majority of those swaps mature so that we can match that very well. But you\u2019re on top of that, it\u2019s to replace those costs and around 4% is what we have. That\u2019s a good estimate to dial in right now.","Mike Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. So pick the interest expense savings that you\u2019ve dialed into the numbers is pretty minimal, the way its set up there?","Al Campbell","It is. It is. It is. And obviously because we\u2019re also moving fixed rate debt up as a percentage, so that we\u2019re taking it closer to 93%, 94% fixed at the end of the year versus we\u2019ve average more or like 90% fixed or hedged this year. So that has impact on as well, Mike.","Mike Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. I appreciate that. Eric, you talked about the disposition strategy not wanting to change your exposure between primary and secondary markets. But can you talk a little bit about your exposure between secondary and kind of tertiary markets? Do you expect to change that around a bit over the next couple years?","Eric Bolton","Well, it\u2019s a good question, Mike. And yes, we do. What we\u2019re really driven by, as I mentioned, is a desire to continue to harvest value out of the lower margin investments and reinvest in a higher margin investments. What that generally translates to is selling older properties and buying newer properties. As it so happens, a lot of our older assets are in the more tertiary markets that we have. And so as a consequence of that, you will see the tertiary market component of that secondary market segment begin to shrink.","And as it relates to \u2013 and you look at the dispositions we have planned for this year of the markets like Brunswick, Georgia, Valdosta, Thomasville, Melbourne, Florida, Athens, and Lagrange, Georgia. Those are all targeted dispositions this year. And we believe that in our goal is honestly just to be sure that we\u2019re getting this capital recycled into investments that we think over the next 10 years will produce higher margins.","And to the extent that we\u2019re able to cycle out of some of those markets, those names I just mentioned and go into some other secondary market such as Kansas City, such as Charleston, such as Savannah, the hope is that that creates maybe a little bit more comfort with the secondary market segment of our portfolio and we hope the market appreciates that change.","Mike Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And, Tom, not to leave you out. I think you said 40 to 60 basis points embedded in the outlook for 2013 related to ancillary income. What\u2019s kind of the forecast in terms of market rent growth you guys are kind of thinking about for 2013 dialing in? And also not sure if you have this number, but what\u2019s kind of like the loss to lease are, embedded like where market is versus kind of where the portfolio is today?","Tom Grimes","It will be just sort of a continuation of what we\u2019ve got, it will be on market rents between 4% and 4.5% and in terms of what average effective will be throughout the year. And then ask that question again about loss to lease \u2013 where we are loss to lease or is that sort of what\u2019s baked in?","Mike Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yeah, kind of what\u2019s \u2013 kind of where does \u2013 what are portfolio rents like how much have you captured kind of what\u2019s the earning in 2013 versus how much do you expect in terms of market? I\u2019m just trying to walk through the dynamics of that.","Tom Grimes","Yeah. I mean a lot of it is based on the good work that was done this year on moving renewals and new rents out. So I think it\u2019s a blended effort between new rents and renewals and that it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re probably 30% of the way done, something like that.","Mike Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you much.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James","Hey, thanks. Good morning, gentlemen.","Eric Bolton","Hi, Buck.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James","Eric, if the market for older value add assets is still frothy right now, why not accelerate the capital recycling efforts a little bit more aggressively and really try to lower the average age of the portfolio into this market right now?","Eric Bolton","Well, we are selling more than we\u2019ve ever sold. We sold more last year than we\u2019ve ever sold in a given year and we\u2019ll sell more this year. I think that to some degree it\u2019s a function of also being able to redeploy those proceeds. We\u2019re mindful of how much earnings dilution we\u2019re willing to take in a given calendar year to complete this recycling effort. I would say that, we\u2019re pretty comfortable executing at this level. Having said that, I mean, obviously, if we see an opportunity to sell two or three more assets than what we had contemplated, we certainly won\u2019t hesitate to pull the trigger on that.","But broadly speaking, we think that the volume that we\u2019re contemplating is about right given our ability to reinvest the proceeds. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re not under any sort of pressure. I don\u2019t feel \u2013 we\u2019re not trying to strategically change anything about our portfolio. We\u2019re not trying to do anything fundamentally different. It\u2019s really just a steady diet of continuing to recycle \u2013 harvest value, recycle into higher margin investments and we expect to be at this level for quite some time.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. Also thinking about your markets right now, there is a couple that kind of pop out of me, I\u2019m just kind of curious about specifically Jacksonville, Nashville, and maybe Raleigh is places where it seems like a lot of new housing supply has started to ramp up in those areas, but maybe the job growth and\/or the income growth in those markets hasn\u2019t quite met what some economists might have thought would have occurred in those markets. And I\u2019m wondering what your thoughts are. I know you\u2019re expanding into Jacksonville and that maybe a kind of a bit of a unique opportunity. But what are your thoughts about those types of markets? And then separately from that, what are your thoughts about Texas and what your maximum exposure to Texas ought to be?","Tom Grimes","All right. I\u2019ll jump in, Buck, this is Tom on the market stuff and I\u2019ll let Eric cover the exposure to Texas. I\u2019ll be glad to talk about what we see happening there. But just \u2013 I think you said Raleigh, Jacks, Nashville and was there a fourth?","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James","No, just those three would be \u2013 just at a high level, talk about those areas?","Tom Grimes","Sure. No, I think Raleigh is pretty encouraging on the job growth front, but it has some new construction coming into the market they were watching carefully. It tends to \u2013 it\u2019s spread out a bit. It\u2019s a little bit of exposure in our Brier Creek submarket, not so much in our Cary properties and virtually nothing that competes with the Hue, Downtown. So, we\u2019re optimistic on that one. It\u2019s been good for us. We think it\u2019ll continue to put out good growth but not over-the-top growth.","And Jacksonville is one where that opportunity is unique and we can go into that further if you want to, but it\u2019s just, as Eric described in the call comments, sort of a super opportunity. But right now, Jacksonville is chugging along at 5% on a revenue growth rate, growth of 37 and occupancy at 96. And I think you\u2019ll see out of markets like Jacksonville and Raleigh just kind of continued steady good growth. It is not going to compare to \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not early in the year to Austin, Dallas, Houston, those kind of places. So I would expect it just to continue to do well.","Nashville, we\u2019re expecting to be strong again. It\u2019s jobs to completions ratios, 8:1 and we\u2019re pretty optimistic about what Nashville can do next year.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, great. Texas, real quick, it\u2019s obviously very strong. What do you think maximum exposure in Mid-America\u2019s portfolio ought to be to Texas?","Eric Bolton","Well, I think that, I mean, as far as Dallas and Houston are concerned from a broad portfolio allocation perspective, we\u2019re pretty much there. We started recycle some money out of Dallas little bit last year and the year before and Houston, somewhat similar. I would tell you that we\u2019re looking at more opportunity in Austin and looking at a little bit more opportunity in San Antonio, two markets where our exposure from a portfolio perspective is not too great at this point. I wouldn\u2019t see Texas broadly as a market that gets a lot more growth in our portfolio, but as you know it\u2019s a pretty strong economy there and we like the long-term dynamics. We just have to be mindful of the supply issue from time-to-time.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James","Thanks, guys.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Buck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","Yes. Good morning. Congrats ongoing three-for-three with the rating agencies. Most of my questions have been answered, but just a quick one. The increase in recurring CapEx, that\u2019s in the numbers 2013 versus 2012, could you talk a little bit about that and what\u2019s driving that?","Al Campbell","I think the important thing to note \u2013 Tayo, this is Al, good morning. I think the important thing to note about that is over the long-term there is a increase from the prior year, I think it\u2019s by 6% \u2013 $0.06 to $0.07 somewhere in that range. But I think if you look over the last five years, CapEx has grown probably 2.5% on average for the five-year period. So, the recurring capital tends to be a little bit volatile depending on the project you have going on. Paint jobs, roofing are pretty significant projects and can be pushed forward or backward here or there and so that has a little bit of impact long-term 2.5% growth. We think the current spending level is a good level and over the long-term the inflationary growth is about right.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then also could you talk a little bit just about what you\u2019re seeing from a tax perspective, as well as increases on property taxes?","Al Campbell","I can. Interesting thing, you\u2019ve seen, you\u2019ve followed us, we went into this year thinking taxes would grow 4% to 5% having 4.5%. We ended up seeing about 3% this year. The main pressure as we expected were Texas, Florida and Georgia. We expected both value increases and millage rate increases in those three key areas and we saw all of that in Texas. I mean, they are definitely aggressive on their program.","Florida and Georgia what we saw was the values began to come up, but we didn\u2019t really see the rise in millage rates that we had and thought might happen. That\u2019s a little bit more of a political situation, a lot of things involved in that. So that was part of that favorability coming in the fourth quarter.","Going into 2013, we do expect at least in the short term some continued pressure in this area and in those key markets, Texas, Florida, Georgia, and add Tennessee in there for 2013 at least because it\u2019s on a revaluation cycle and 2013 is a revaluation year. So, all those things are part of that growth. I think important again to take a long term perspective on taxes just like I mentioned capital, if you take our projected 6% midpoint growth in taxes for 2013, and you add that in to the last six years, you\u2019re going to get less than a 2% growth in taxes over the last six years. And so, again, important to note, though we\u2019re seeing pressure now and maybe some in 2014 over long term more modest growth, the states and municipalities are really getting back a little bit of the declines that they gave up back in 2009 and 2010.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carol Kemple of Hilliard Lyons. Your line is open.","Carol Kemple \u2013 Hilliard Lyons","Good morning.","Eric Bolton","Good morning.","Carol Kemple \u2013 Hilliard Lyons","Earlier in the call, you all mentioned buying a couple of properties from the JV. At this point, do you think you\u2019ll look to buy the JV out or why these two properties in particular?","Eric Bolton","Well, this is the Fund I JV that we had with Fannie Mae and we just approached them, and began conversations some months ago and just decided that \u2013 that\u2019s a JV that we capped. It\u2019s not active in the market looking to add any assets. They were interested in just cleaning that up and so we\u2019re just going to buy them out of those two properties.","Our other JV, Fund II that we have, it\u2019s an active JV. It\u2019s one that\u2019s targeting the value-add reposition in place. It\u2019s still \u2013 our partner is still very much interested in finding ways to deploy capital as we are, but as I mentioned, it\u2019s just the pricing for those value-add opportunities is very, very competitive and we just didn\u2019t feel comfortable forecasting any acquisition activity in that this year. But the assets that we co-own with them at this point, they\u2019re comfortable continuing to own as we are and so that one is still active.","Carol Kemple \u2013 Hilliard Lyons","Okay. And then do you know with the properties that you all targeted for disposition this year, what their average effective rent rate would be on a monthly basis?","Al Campbell","No. I can\u2019t tell you specifically for that portfolio. I can tell you this, Carol, this is Al. If you take the property that we\u2019ve sold over the last few years, you\u2019re talking about a difference in dispositions, the average is less than $700, call it $650 to $700, and then the ones we\u2019re acquiring are more like $1,000, $1,100 on average per unit. So there is a pretty big difference there.","Eric Bolton","And that would hold true for this group as well.","Al Campbell","Yes.","Carol Kemple \u2013 Hilliard Lyons","Okay. So the $650 to $700 would probably be true?","Al Campbell","I would expect that, yes.","Carol Kemple \u2013 Hilliard Lyons","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is a follow-up from Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Sorry for keeping you around. Just a small one. Al, what you have dialed in to G&A for acquisition related expenses?","Al Campbell","What we do, Rich, is very simple. We take 75 to 80 basis points of the acquisition volumes, so you can take $250, $300 what you dial-in times call it 80 basis points, and that would be what we\u2019d use. That\u2019s over long term what we\u2019re seeing to be the average of that cost.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Is that \u2013 just out of curiosity, has there been a way to manage those costs now that they\u2019ve been expensed in the FFO calculation or is there no real way to kind of lower that exposure?","Al Campbell","You\u2019re talking about primarily like commissions and legal costs. I mean if you buy a bigger deal, it\u2019s a little more efficient because of the leap on all the activities, but other than that, it\u2019s really tough to manage that much more than that. It used to be \u2013 I\u2019ll give you this, it has come down, it used to be closer to 100 basis points.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Right. That\u2019s what I mean, yeah.","Al Campbell","75 to 80 basis points because of the size of deals and we are working on...","Eric Bolton","I think the size of the deal has been \u2013 frankly, several years ago, some of the deals that we\u2019re buying were \u2013 had legal issues or financing issues and some of the legal issues were just a little bit more challenging. Frankly, going forward, what we\u2019re seeing is things are a little cleaner and not nearly the level of distress and so, it may come down a little bit.","Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions. If you\u2019d like to \u2013 any closing remarks?","Eric Bolton","No closing remarks.

Thank you for participating in the MAA Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin.","Timothy P. Argo","Thank you, Pricilla. Good morning, this is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO.","Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making Forward-Looking Statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results.","These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.","When we reach the question-and-answer portion of the call, I would ask everyone to please limit their questions to no more than two in order to give everyone ample opportunity to participate. Should you have additional questions, please re-renter the queue or you are certainly welcome to follow-up with us after we conclude the call. Thank you.","I'll now turn the call over to Eric.","H. Eric Bolton","Thanks Tim. MAA wrapped up calendar year 2015 with another quarter of strong performance. Importantly, we expect favorable leasing conditions across our region and the trend supporting record high occupancy and solid momentum in rent growth to continue in 2016.","As outlined in our earnings release, our forecast for MAA for the coming year is defined by continued record occupancy results consistent with what was captured in 2015 and rent growth that is also consistent with the strong momentum from last year and that remained well above long-term averages.","Operating expenses are expected to remain well in check with real estate taxes being the only item driving any pressure and reflecting the continued strong valuation in leasing fundamentals that are supporting the apartment market. During the fourth quarter, we captured positive pricing momentum across the portfolio on both the year-over-year and sequential quarterly basis.","Tom will provide you with more details surrounding leasing conditions across our markets. But overall, we believe the supply and demand dynamics across our high growth Sunbelt region coupled with a portfolio that is uniquely diversified across both large and secondary markets and that offers a price point appealing to the largest segment of the rental market will drive solid results in 2016.","As noted in yesterday's earnings release, we were successful in securing a couple of acquisitions in the fourth quarter, both of which have an efficient and accretive Phase II benefit to them, which enable the deals to work within our disciplined underwriting model.","We expect the transaction market in 2016 will be similar to 2015 with robust transaction activity fueled by a high level of new development and lease up projects being brought to market with the continued high level of investor and buyer interest surrounding current valuations.","We remain disciplined in our approach and have forecasted 2016 a comparable volume of acquisitions and new developments funding as compared to 2015 that we plan to match fund with the disposition activity and internally generated free cash flow.","With the start of expansion and our newly acquired Denton property in Kansas City, we now have a $117 million of new development underway with each of the five projects representing highly accretive Phase II expansions of existing successful properties.","During 2016, we also anticipate another active year of redevelopment through our very accretive kitchen and bathroom modeling program. Al will recap for you the changes in our balance sheet and transactions completed in fourth quarter, which further expands our growth capacity.","As noted in our earnings release through a combination of the capital recycling completed last year and the free cash flow now being generated, the balance sheet was further deleveraged in 2015 with debt to market cap at 32.2% by year-end. We anticipate continued strengthening of the balance sheet in 2016. In summary, we believe MAA\u2019s balance sheet is well positioned for future opportunities as they emerge.","Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to say to all our MAA associates how much I appreciate all of your hard work and tremendous results in 2015. Thanks to your efforts. MAA produced top tier total investment returns for our shareholders in calendar year 2015 and we are well positioned to continue our legacy of outperformance over the full cycle as we head into 2016.","And with that I'm going to hand it over to Tom. Tom.","Thomas L. Grimes","Thank you, Eric and good morning everyone. Our fourth quarter NOI performance is 7.3% was driven by revenue growth of 5.4% over the prior year. We have good momentum in rents and saw effective rents increase 4.4% on a year-over-year basis and 70 basis points sequentially strong average physical occupancy contributed 70 basis points over the prior year.","Overall, expenses remain in line, up just 2.4%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry leading initiatives such as our vendor owned inventories shops stocking program, which will be completed this year have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check.","January demand trends continue the positive momentum. Average physical occupancy of 96.1 ran 94 basis points ahead of last year. A 60-day exposure which is current vacancy plus all notices for 60-day period is just 7%. This is a 120 basis points stronger than the same time last year. January blended rents on a year-over-year basis were up 5%.","Occupancy exposure at the critical beginning of the year are better than we have seen in recent years. On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results, they were led by our Orlando, Fort Worth, Atlanta and Phoenix.","The secondary markets achieved 4.4% revenue growth. And these markets were benefiting from improved job growth as well as a sophisticated operating platform that has competitive advantages across our footprint in markets. Revenue growth in Charleston, Greenville, Savannah and Jacksonville all stood out.","As mentioned above, our momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy, rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our market worry to-date is Houston which represents just 3.5% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor Houston closely and protect occupancy in this market. Turnover for the quarter was again down by 7.5%, and down 180 basis points on a rolling 12-month basis to 52.5%.","Move outs to home buying was down a 100 basis points and remain below historic norms. Move outs to home rentals was down 6% and represents just 7% of our total move outs. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupancy again paid off. The improvements in average days vacant between occupancy for the quarter of 2.5 days helped drive down the fourth quarter average physical occupancy or drive the record average physical occupancy to 96.1%.","During 2015, we've completed 5,781 interior unit upgrades, 3,200 of those were on legacy CLP communities. We expect to redevelop 5,000 units next year and expect the mix to continue to favor the legacy CLP portfolio. As a reminder, on average, we spent $4,500 per unit and receive $95 increase over our comparable non-renovated unit, generating a year one cash return of well over 20%.","Our active lease-up communities are performing well, and we completed construction of 220 Riverside in Jacksonville in the fourth quarter. As you will notice in our release we moved the stabilization of this community up to Q1 of 2016 rather than Q2, because of better than planned lease-up supported by rents above pro forma.","Colonial Grand at Bellevue II and Retreat at West Creek one both stabilized on schedule for the fourth quarter. Station Square at Cosner's Corner II and Cityscape at Market Center II are currently 67.5% and 82.1% at lease, and expected to stabilize in the fourth quarter and third quarters of this year respectively. We ended the 2015 in strong fashion and are well positioned for 2016. Al.","Albert M. Campbell","Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the Company's fourth quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally on initial guidance for 2016.","The record occupancy levels, continued pricing momentum and solid expense control during the fourth quarter produced record levels of core FFO per share for both the quarter and the full-year 2015. Core FFO, which excludes certain non-cash and non-routine items was $1.45 per share representing a 10% increase over the prior year.","Recurring capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.6 million or $0.11 per share, which produced Core AFFO of $1.34 per share providing strong coverage of our $0.82 per share quarterly dividend. Core FFO for the full-year was $5.51 per share also representing a 10% increase over the prior year.","And our Core AFFO for the year was $4.80 per share representing a 12% increase over the prior year. The outperformance for the quarter was primarily produced by same-store NOI growth driven by continued record high average occupancy levels during the quarter 70 basis points above the prior year. And our operating expenses also remained well under control during the quarter increasing only 2.4% over the prior year with favorable real estate tax appeals riding some benefit in the fourth quarter.","During the fourth quarter, we acquired two new communities for a total investment of $79 million including the land [purchase] (Ph) of two Phase II expansions which were both started during the quarter. These purchases bring our full-year acquisition investment to $327 million for seven new communities containing 1,782 units.","We also funded an additional $13.6 million of development costs for the five communities under construction during the quarter, all Phase II expansions leaving $74 million of the $117 million total projected cost to be funded as of year-end. We expect NOI yields in the 7% to 7.5% range for these communities once they are completed and stabilized.","We also invested $8.3 million in our redevelopment program during the fourth quarter, bringing our full-year investment in the program about $31 million. We continue to capture rent increases of 10% above the non-renovated units from this program.","During the fourth quarter, we completed several important financing goals for the year. We recast our unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing our borrowing capacity to $750 million from $500 million, extending the maturity to 4.5 years and improving the terms to reflect our stronger credit profile. We also refinanced $150 million term loan improving the rate about 25 basis points, extending the maturity and modifying the terms to be consistent with our new credit facility.","Of course, we also executed a very successful bond issuance during the fourth quarter, issuing 400 million of 10 year notes at coupon rate of 4% priced at 98.99%, which complete our refinancing plans of 2015 debt maturity. We are very pleased with the investor support and execution of this issuance which we think and we believe provides further confirmation of this strength of our balance sheet.","At year-end, our leverage defined as net debt to gross assets was 190 basis points below the prior year at 40.6%. Our current EBITDA continues to grow and reflect the quality of our earnings profile, covering our fixed charges about 4.5 times.","At year-end 96% of debt was fixed or hedged against interest rates at an average effective rate of 3.8% with well out of maturities averaging five years and we also have over $700 million of total cash and credit available at year-end.","Finally, we did provide and issue earning guidance for 2016 with the release. Core FFO is projected to be $5.68 to $5.88 per share or $5.78 at the mid-point based on average shares in units outstanding of about $79.6 million. Core AFFO is projected to $4.98 to $5.18 per share or $5.08 at the mid-point representing about a 6% growth of the prior year.","The primary driver of 2016 performance is expected to be same-store NOI growth which is forecasted to be 4% to 5% base on a three and three quarters to four and a quarter percent growth in revenues. And two and three quarter to three and three quarter percent growth in operating expenses.","Our revenue projection include expectations of continued record high occupancy levels averaging 96.1% through 2016 combined with continued rental pricing above long-term trends similar to 2015 levels ranging 4% to 4.5%. We expect operating expenses to remain well under control with real estate taxes continuing to present the [indiscernible] pressure as the strong operating performance pushes valuations higher.","We expect acquisition volume to similar 2015 with $300 million to $400 million repurchases included in our projections; we also expect to fund an additional $50 million to $60 million of construction cost to the completion of the five communities under development.","We plan to essentially match fund these investments with $200 million to $300 million of multifamily dispositions starting with $60 million of commercial assets in land dispositions and with $90 million to $95 million of internally generated free cash flow.","And giving the timing required to recycle assets along with the initial loss of NOI deals, our forecast for the full-year includes $0.04 to $0.06 per share of dilution related to these 2016 dispositions points.","Our current plans do not include the need for new equity during 2016 and we expect to end the year with our leverage at another slight year reduction from the prior year.","That\u2019s all that we have in the way of prepared comments, so Pricilla, we\u2019ll now turn the call back over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instruction] We will take our first question from David Toti with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open.","David Toti","Eric, quick question for you. Unlike many of you peers, the company appears to the projecting pretty decent acquisition volume in the year ahead. Can you give us a little more though as to where you see attractive opportunities in market? Is it because you are largely in markets with the recent competing, are you seeing yields become more attractive, what's the motivation for that picture volume?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, first of all, it's pretty consistent with what we did this year and we think the conditions in the market place in 2016 are going to be somewhat similar to what they were in 2015, if not more robust. As we get later in this cycle we just see more development projects in lease-up communities being brought to market. And our deal flow is running higher this time this year than it was at the same point last year.","So we think the transaction market is going to be very active over the course of the year. And so we put a number out there $300 million to $400 million which is consistent with - we did a little over $300 million this year and we will see what happens. I\u2019m optimistic that we will see something that become increasingly compelling and we may find some situations where we have these Phase II opportunities associated with them like we did in December. And I think that we will see how things play out over the course of the year.","We have assumed in our guidance that we will do $200 million to $300 million of dispositions, we are going to wait on that. That will be more backend loaded over the course of year depending on what opportunities emerge on the acquisition front. So David it's not a specific detailed answer to you, but it's really more just to reflection of we think conditions are going to be consistent if not a little bit more robust from an activity perspective and that May yield some opportunities for us.","David Toti","Okay no that\u2019s very helpful Eric, thank you. And my second question is just a quick one. I seem to recall the unit CapEx the money you are spending on sort of upgrading units to be producing yield that were around 12%, am I remembering wrong, it seem to be a little bit lower today.","Albert M. Campbell","I think what you probably return to is the internal rate of return data which is in the 11% to 12% range, but the rent growth compared to a non-renovate unit has consistently been 10% to 10.5% I think for a while. IR is higher than that.","David Toti","Okay, thanks for the detail today.","Operator","Thank you. And will move next to Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. I'm wondering if you could talk about how you build up the guidance. The stock has slowing off this morning and we saw a similar reaction last year at this time. The initial 2015 guidance - a sense than 2015 guidance clearly prove to be conservative and the stock has been a top performer. So do the guidance process this year change at all relative to how you said it in the past and how do you think about the opportunity and what you would need to see in order to exceed initial guidance similar to what you saw last year.","Albert M. Campbell","Thanks Nick. This is Al. I'll tell you a bit how it was prepared this year. No real changes there, I'll tell you, what we are expecting for 2016 first and foremost is not any deceleration in momentum in our business, and what we\u2019re projecting is for occupancy level of 96.1% which is above the way record high for the company that we had in 2015 to carry through 2016. And I'm talking about average 365 days for the year which is pretty strong access full.","And so on top of that I mean so you are flat with 2015 hold that level, on top of that we expect pricing levels to be consistent with 2015. Again, well above long-term averages and norms, we expect pricing to go up 4% to 4.5% and so that really is tradition that revenue growth and then we have the expense control we talked about the drop at the bottom line of NOI.","The comparison to 2015, I think the challenge there is that we had about 150 basis points of things in our 2015 revenue that were unusual. I hesitate to call them one-time, but similar to that one-time items such as we built our occupancy 75 basis points during the year getting to that 96.1% was on average 75% basis points in revenue above the prior year.","And then related to that we while we were building occupancy, we also had higher fee performance related to building their occupancy fee as either add fees, processing fees, pet fees all of those things. And also as we've talked about some during the year we've had a little better performance in 2015 in catching some of the final remaining portions of the synergies from our merger.","We really had a strong performance in 2015 and the fees, to give you context they grew 15% in 2015 over 2014. We certainly expect to hold a majority of those fees and carry that into 2016, but that growth rate - it would be more of a normalized growth rate going forward. So hope that gives the sum.","H. Eric Bolton","Hey Nick. The takeaway from that is that when you look at 2015 the surprise factor was occupancy and we had anticipated that coming out of 2014 that we would hold the 2014 occupancy which was pretty strong and we didn\u2019t really contemplate seeing occupancy lift as much as it did over the course of 2015. And we and frankly I think many in this sector were surprised at how strong the markets were a last year and I think everybody for the most part was raising guidance over the course of the year.","As we got into 2016 guidance were coming off a year where average daily physical occupancy was higher than we've seen in our 22-year history. We ended the fourth quarter with the highest average daily physical occupancy we've ever had. So to go into 2016 within anticipation that we are going to beat that again and get above average daily physical occupancy of 96%, we just were a little hesitate to take that back and we think we are going to hold it.","We think that the conditions are great in our markets and great in our region and we think we are going to hold that record occupancy and we think we are going to get very solid rent growth of 4% to 4.5% as well. Again in line with what we saw this past year, but just the incremental lift in occupancy is not expected to repeat itself again in 2016 and that's the big difference between 2016 and 2015.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks that makes sense and then just going back to David's question. What's the impact of the redevelopment spend on 2016 same-store revenue growth and what was the impact on 2015 same-store revenue growth?","H. Eric Bolton","Consistently about 20 basis points to 25 basis points impact pretty consistently.","Nicholas Joseph","Okay, thanks. And then just finally. Can you talk about your performance expectations of the large versus the secondary markets in 2016?","Thomas L. Grimes","I think what we would expect to see is the job growth in the large markets continue to lead the way, absent some sort of macroeconomic change on the demand side, we are expecting those to lead and expecting the Atlanta, Orlando, Phoenix probably to perform top set of that group. In the secondary markets where we get a little less supply, we\u2019re seeing job growth build there and would expect to see places like Charleston, Greenville, and Jacksonville do well. But we would expect that large markets would continue to outperform secondary markets at this point.","H. Eric Bolton","Where the secondary markets really make a huge positive impact to our performance. Nick if you want to start to looking at a real sort of sea change and sort of the leasing environment where either we see a supply get way out of hand and relative to the demand and we get into recessionary environment or we see job growth really start to pull back.","That's where the secondary markets really start to hold up a whole while lot better than what you typically see in the larger markets, but at this point in cycle with fundamentals still being strong as Tom was outlining. We think that there still will be a reason for the large markets to continue to outperformance this point the secondary markets.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Gaurav Mehta from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Gaurav Mehta","Hi good morning. I just wanted to back to your comments on acquisitions and disposition, can you speak about cap rate spread that\u2019s expecting between what you are selling and what you are buying?","Albert M. Campbell","Well, if you look at it on a cash flow cap rate basis, certainly just looking what we sold this past year, 21 properties that we sold, the cash flow cap rate was around $5.8, I mean we are buying at around $5.5. So from the cash flow perspective it's pretty close, when you look at sort of NOI yield, initial NOI yield particularly if you assume as we do that some of the acquisitions that we make are still in lease-up and not yet fully stabilized.","We gassed out more so, it can be 150 basis points or so. And therefore that\u2019s why from an earnings perspective we've assumed $0.04 to $0.06 of earnings dilution in our guidance predicated on that gap in NOI yield, both as a function of the higher yielding assets that we are selling coupled with the non-stabilized nature of what we assume we\u2019ll be buying.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay and my second question is you mentioned Houston as one of the market that you are monitoring, are there any other market that you are concerned about in 2016 outside of Houston?","Albert M. Campbell","Houston is the one with that demand dynamic that\u2019s traded down. We would like to see a little more job growth come out of Little Rock and Norfolk but we are relatively slightly exposed to those markets, but Houston is the main worry there.","H. Eric Bolton","But no other ones that we are particularly concerned about, I mean when you look at the job growth and the supply dynamics and the ratio between those two they are all well above what would be defined as healthy absorption.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. We will move next to Rob Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.","Robert Stevenson","Thanks Al. Can you talk about any in terms of the fees what was the gross level of fees in 2015 versus 2014 and what's in the 2006 guidance in terms of the magnitude, in terms of the overall little over billion dollars of revenue that you guys had this year?","Albert M. Campbell","To answer that is it's certainly not in scope as large as the rents and other. It's probably about $50 million and again the majority of growth this year came from of add frees, these processing fees, pet fees and those are the main drivers of growth.","Thomas L. Grimes","[Multiple speaker]. This things associated with increasing occupancies.","Albert M. Campbell","Right, but the large part of that $50 million is you also have water reimbursement, cable reimbursement other thing and the growth came in some of fee related to growth and occupancy this year.","Robert Stevenson","It was like $42 million in 2014 and up $50 million in 2015 and I mean just modest sort of growth in 2016 is how you thinking about it this year?","Albert M. Campbell","Exactly, right exactly right.","Robert Stevenson","Okay and then when you look at the core FFO guidance, when you are sitting here today what is the difference between core and NAREIT from the things that you know today?","Albert M. Campbell","The biggest thing is fair market value of debt adjustment. And the others are acquisition cost and then gains, loss or distinguishment of debt and some small things. But the big number what's driving at difference is really fair market value of debt. And I will tell you Rob, we chose to when we did the merger a couple years ago, we had that significant number for that. We chose to pulled back out of AFFO, because it's non-cash and we are getting an credit and interest.","And we just feel like it was better to show it without that because it's not cash and so some other people do it defiantly, we know it's a little bit confusing, but that\u2019s the main difference and we will continue to do that until that burns. It will burn off in another couple of years and tat significant difference should decline.","Robert Stevenson","Okay and then lastly what is the 100 basis points of turnover cost, turnover goes up 100 or 200 basis points this year. How do you think about that impacting the expense side equation?","Albert M. Campbell","Usually about $0.01 to $0.015 per percent on that Rob, I mean it's meaningful to our business in terms of the actual impact of AFFO given the size and scale of the company, its smaller than you would think.","Thomas L. Grimes","So 1% quite stood a penny and a half roughly of AFFO.","Robert Stevenson","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our question from Dan Oppenheim from Zelman & Associate. Your line is open.","Daniel Oppenheim","I was wondering if you can talk a little more in terms of large and secondary market, I think comments about large - performing here in 2016 kindly I think we will look some of the trends recently in terms of that I think that will continue. But you mentioned Houston in terms of challenges but the number of other larger markets where there is more supply coming and wondering how you think about that in terms of not so much as the absolute level but the level of deceleration that could come through in large markets versus in the secondary markets?","H. Eric Bolton","Dan, since what we are seeing as in large the 2015 looks an awful lot - 2016 looks an awful lot like 2015. It should fill down the way we keep - try to keep in mind the balance between demand and supply, the jobs to completion ratio and they are at about seven for both years in a row and job growth 2015 for that combination of markets is 27 and it's about the same for 2016.","I think related to our portfolio specifically, this has been worn out in the media I think a little bit but it is true the demand in some of these large markets is coming into the urban areas where we have a little less - the supply is coming in where there are a little less exposure important clarification there. thank you. Where we've got a little more and the inner loop satellite cities and suburban like exposure.","Daniel Oppenheim","Got it. And then in terms of you talked about the blended rent growth of 5% in January, curious in terms of where the or you see in terms of the renewals that you are sending out that it went out for February and March versus the new leases?","Albert M. Campbell","Yes sure, we are getting about 6% on the renewals through March.","Daniel Oppenheim","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll move next to Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Your line is now open.","Thomas Lesnick","First question. You have been obviously made improvement in people expertise in the secondary markets over the last year. But looking at average effective rent per unit obviously large, so [indiscernible] secondary by a pretty wide margin. I'm just wondering is there some limiting factor in the secondary markets like personal income growth that's keeping that number down or is that a strategic decision on your part to keep secondary market a little bit lower to push occupancy this year and is that something we could expect to see you guys push on the rent side now that occupancy is at 96%?","H. Eric Bolton","Sure. Tom and affordability in secondary's and non-issue, it's actually we have better rent to income ratios in secondary been in large in both - we\u2019re talking a 100 basis points difference went roughly $17.5, $16.5 so not materially different, but it's a non issue there and I think now it\u2019s a real balance on rent and occupancy. And one links to the other as demand in secondary looks very good at this point, occupancy in January average physical is actually higher now in secondary than large and we are in very good shape on our exposure, so we are optimistic about rents in secondary at this point.","Thomas L. Grimes","What I would also tell you Tom is that to some degree the spread and average rent between our large and secondary segment of our portfolios of function are the fact that we have I think a higher percentage of older properties. Some of the legacy assets that we've owned for a long time are in some of the secondary markets. Now that's changing and that's evolving as we continue to build out our presence in markets like Kansas City, San Antonio and Fredericksburg. Some of these newer markets that we've been getting into with newer assets.","But when you look at the age of the assets across the portfolio, we have percentage wise a higher concentration of older legacy assets to some of the secondary markets and I think that probably accounts for some of that pricing spread that you are mentioning.","Thomas Lesnick","Got it. And then looking at same-store operating expenses the dispersion of year-over-year comps in the secondary markets is pretty wide. This quarter I was just wondering, if there is anything in particular that was kind of driving the dispersion there across all of this secondary markets?","H. Eric Bolton","Texas is one factor in it and then Charleston obviously stands out, we had a weather event in Charleston where you probably read about it tons of rain there and we didn\u2019t have any material damage, actually no units down or anything like that. But we did have a fair amount of landscape work that had to occur in that market during the fourth quarter just drying things out replacing some damages.","H. Eric Bolton","I think in aggregate, it was probably real estate taxes drove.","Albert M. Campbell","That\u2019s a lot of the credits came in the Texas markets which are all in our - expect the San Antonio large segment.","Thomas Lesnick","And then one final question. Now with occupancy over 96%. Looking at where we stood relative to last year, how is your average day return time changed over the last year or so?","H. Eric Bolton","Average days return is with that is down 2.5 days, we would expect to drop another two next year. I think the thing that probably modes the best for revenues is that exposure at the end of January is down a 120 basis points and that's sort of the leading edge of our pricing power.","Thomas Lesnick","Great. Thanks guys, I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Will move next to Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Drew Babin","Good morning, guys. First question, one Phase III you really outperformed the expectations in 2015 was property tax expense growth and the initial guidance for the year is - seems that also this year 4.5% to 5%, you hit that the low end of that ad I know this was in the third quarter, you had some successful appeals both in terms of [indiscernible]. What you are assuming for 2016 with your forecast in terms of whether you can qualify kind of win percentage any assessments and could that - what\u2019s the potential for that number to possibly come in at the lower end of the range?","Albert M. Campbell","I\u2019ll try to give you some color on that Drew, I think what happens in the begging of the year in year, you just don\u2019t have a lot of information to go on, you talk to assessors, get a feel for what is happening in each jurisdiction and you start your estimates. As you move into second quarter, you have a little more information, third a lot and fourth you finalize I think that\u2019s this year.","And so what happened last year as we start out the pressure was coming from Texas, Florida a little bit in Georgia as we have some revaluations occurring there. But we start out the year with expectation in 2015 really high numbers come out of Texas. Particularly in third quarter we started to get some information believing that was going to moderate low bit in the fourth quarter, we got that finalized notice and so that\u2019s why it came down in 2015.","Looking into 2016, we are still getting very high numbers out of Texas and then we got some revaluation in Georgia and some in Florida. I would tell where we sit today, we expect to think about especially what they do, they are doing evaluation of assessments of 2016 looking backward to 2015. Record year for the company in many areas and so we expect those initial violations come out high and we expect to jump on early, hopefully have some success.","We have some success in fighting what we think will come out built in our numbers, but hopefully we will meet that and even be able to have more success. But I\u2019ll tell right now given the performance we had in 2015 the valuations are base off of income, it's hard to see those taxes begin the moderate significantly until the cycle changes. And so that\u2019s what we are projecting to 2016.","Drew Babin","Okay and one more, despite the fact that that costs had likely bottomed both on secured and unsecured side, private equity remains pretty aggressive and within cap rates lower. As we look at the accretion between their cost of capital and what they are paying for assets. Are you hearing anything from private players that you talk to about LTVs debt rates that they are able to get to kind of feel this? just curious if you have any color there or anything that\u2019s maybe a read through that you are looking at acquisition to obviously with lower leverage levels?","Albert M. Campbell","We continue to see private capital securing loan to values in 70% to 75% range pretty easily and the agencies remain very active and coming out of the national multifamily housing councils annual meeting back in January that mean all the feedback and all the information that we got is that probably capital. Both domestic and foreign indicates a huge appetite for multifamily real estate. It appears that the financing windows are wide open very much from a loan to value perspective very much consistent will what we saw in 2015.","I think that despite the slight bump that the Feds made in interest rates earlier. The expectation is that rates are going to continue to remain pretty low this year. So from our perspective it's really hard to see how the valuation market is going to change much, I think it's going to another active year, another fueled by a lot of investor interest. I think the only thing that potentially is going to evolve is I just think it maybe more deal flow, I think there may be more transactions in the market than we have seen in 2015. But I think it will still be a very robust environment.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Wes Golladay","You gave the color on the renewal leases for January, what you seeing on the new lease?","Albert M. Campbell","New leases in January on a year-over-year basis were [49] (Ph).","Wes Golladay","Okay and then you guys mentioned you record occupancy, do you plan to be more aggressive on the renewal leasing, I guess at least in the near term? And can you verify, you guys are backing in essentially flat rate growth or the similar rate growth versus last year?","H. Eric Bolton","Yes, our rate growth we expect to be very much in line with 2015 and that\u2019s sort of that\u2019s backed in.","Thomas L. Grimes","And then our pricing approach is more aggressive at this time this year than it was last year both because of the factor of lower exposure and system automatically relates that. But we are also managing the system at appropriate level, at a market level, at a core plan level depending on the time of the year and the cycle and we are more aggressive on our settings this year than we were at this time last year.","Wes Golladay","Okay so if we were to pick a point where you guys are probably surprise with the upset, would that be there you think you will come from?","Thomas L. Grimes","Probably but most likely.","Wes Golladay","Okay and then you mentioned more deal flow for the acquisitions now would this be more of the urban core properties you are you looking for? And are you seeing any developers get in trouble yet, are they just seeing capital markets in the stock market and might bring to the table?","Albert M. Campbell","Well, we are not particularly targeting more sort of urban core, what I would tell you is that\u2019s where so much of the supply is being delivered that I think if that\u2019s where the opportunities will emerge as some of these lease-ups run into trouble or they are not leasing either at the velocity or the rents that they had pro forma. So I just think that it\u2019s a stock that\u2019s continues to play out that\u2019s more than likely where the opportunities will emerge.","We are not seeing what I would consider to be real operating distress or lease-up distress frankly where we see our opportunities are where we see private capital come in tie up a deal on very, very aggressive terms and then running to some kind of a problem in getting the financing or they don\u2019t get loan proceeds equivalent to what they thought they were going to get and they you go back to the developer to try to re-trade the deal and developer sort of blows up and then they come back to us.","And so every deal we bought last year was on a rebound and I think that from an operating perspective we are not seeing any real weakness yet but I just think as the deal flow picks up we think that may very well yields to increase opportunity.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator"," Thank you. Will take our next question from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Tayo Okusanya","I may have miss this earlier but could you talk a little bit about the timing in 2016 of the acquisitions versus the dispositions?","Albert M. Campbell","We have the acquisitions - we\u2019re projecting pretty evenly spread throughout the year Tayo beginning somewhere in March maybe a $40 million to $50 million a month through call it Octobers and then the dispositions a little bit more towards the mid to back part of the year really looking to match fund those as much as we can as Eric mentioned in the start of the call and so you can kind of start at midpoint of the year and layer those in.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay, that helps. And then same-store NOI growth in the fourth quarter versus 3Q there is a material slowdown in secondary markets again markets like Little Rock, Arkansas that you mentioned and transaction in Mississippi and some of these other smaller markets Huntsville, Alabama, could you kind of talk specifically about what's happening in of the secondary markets that there was the slowdown?","Albert M. Campbell","And Tayo I mean it's a good observation that a transition from third quarter to fourth quarter a little bit lower on revenue and there is a seasonal factor to these markets and I don\u2019t think it is odd to see them drop down. So either way going from third quarter to fourth quarter, there is lower traffic, there is lower demand and that pattern has repeated itself over the years with us and as usual we see good pick back up with the beginning in the year in those markets the secondary markets average physical occupancy for January is 96.6 so we've seen pop up there so I would expect that what you are observing is not change from the market dynamics, but seasonality as we move from third quarter to fourth quarter and mostly it will come back.","Tayo Okusanya","I don\u2019t think they have dropped so much more versus the primary markets. Which is kind of what I was trying to get out.","Albert M. Campbell","Sure. And I think that's a difference in households moving to those markets, the secondary markets are in the fourth quarter they are just a little bit slower and you have lot more going on and they are large markets.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay. And then just last one from me. Just Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina were still good job growth particularly increasing the concern about supply. Could you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing then what's your outlook is for 2016?","Albert M. Campbell","Charlotte in particular is an urban suburban story a little bit and looking at the amount of product it's coming in South Church area is noticeable, there is a lot happening there, so a lot less happening in suburbs and that is where the majority of our exposure is. So we like the job growth and on the product that we have in Charlotte it is there is not a lot of comps going in next forward to it.","Similar story in Raleigh, over the last couple of years we saw fair amount of the supply coming in and the prior Brier Creek submarket where we exposed it's one of those appealing submarkets but that has burned off and it's shifted more to Downtown as well where we have one asset.","Tayo Okusanya","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our final question today from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Jordan Sadler","Hi guys good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just kind of big picture I know you mentioned move outs for home purchases decline in the fourth quarter, but we have seen that sort of nationwide tick up a bit. Is there any concern that moves out around purchases could start to increase particularly in your more suburban locations.","Albert M. Campbell","Honestly there is no sign of that and that is something that's trended down pretty much every quarter this year and there doesn\u2019t seem to be an interest both in and sort of psychology and lifestyle reasons that people are interested in moving at this point, we\u2019re just simply not seeing that.","Jordan Sadler","What sort of the average age, I guess when you look across the portfolio of your renters?","Albert M. Campbell","We\u2019re right at 38.","Tayo Okusanya","That's helpful. And then just lastly I was just curious when you think about the dispositions, how are you kind of coming through the portfolio and ranking I guess potential candidates for sale and how does that balance out between your large and secondary markets?","H. Eric Bolton","We take a look every year at every individual investment we have and we look at sort of the acted CapEx cash flow being generated off the investment and what it likely is going to trend out at over the next few years. And make a decision on which ones do we think are going to yield us the weakest or declining if you will cash flow and target those as ones that we need to recycle cap out of into something more compelling.","I think that we do this several year and we sold over 13,000 apartments in the last five years and so we take a very proactive approach to keeping certain level of recycling taking place every year. As we look at 2016 should the investment opportunity show up and then presents an opportunity to recycle money out of some investments, I would expect 2016 to be sort of evenly we split between both large and secondary markets, we have a good mix in both.","Tayo Okusanya","Great. Thanks for the detail.","Operator","And it looks like we do have a follow-up, we will go back to Tom Lesnick with Capital One Securities. Your line is open.","Tom Lesnick","Just one quick question. Looking at the acquisition for the quarter up to $79 million, how much is allocated to the non NOI producing Denton Phase II piece?","Albert M. Campbell","Sorry, how much is going non same stores there were no Denton\u2026","Tom Lesnick","No the Denton Phase II development sight, how much of that $79 million\u2026","Albert M. Campbell","Okay that was smaller, let\u2019s say the number allocated to that was about $10 million its smaller, 55 units in smaller so about $10 million of that.","Tom Lesnick","Okay and are you guys able to provide cap rate anything on the acquisition that are actually produce in NOI at this point?","Albert M. Campbell","I think what I would say is once they are stabilized we would say five and a quarter likely, but obviously those aren\u2019t stabilized but that\u2019s the projection once they are stabilized.","Tom Lesnick","Okay, appreciate it thanks.","Operator","And we have no further questions. I\u2019ll like to turn the call back to Tim Argo for any closing remarks today.","Timothy P. Argo","No further comments. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you for participating in the MAA Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, we would like to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin.","Tim Argo","Thank you, David. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, Company management will be making forward-looking statements.","Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the safe-harbor language included in yesterday\u2019s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Tim and good morning.","Third quarter results were at the top end of our guidance as solid same store results, which were captured against a record occupancy performance of last year, coupled with favorable trends in G&A and interest expense, drove Core FFO per share of $1.49, representing an 8% jump as compared to Q3 of last year. As outlined in our earnings release, we have raised full year guidance for Core FFO to a range of $5.86 to $5.96 per share.","We continue to capture solid leasing trends across the portfolio. Average daily occupancy within the same store portfolio in the third quarter was a very strong 96.4% compared to the likewise very strong 96.5% occupancy in Q3 of last year. Effective rent per unit increased 4.2% with higher performances coming from Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, Charlotte and Fort Worth.","As noted in our release, we were successful in closing two acquisitions during Q3, one in Houston and one in Greenville, South Carolina. Both transactions are newly constructed properties and represent compelling long-term investment opportunities for those two markets. We were also successful in completing the disposition of seven older properties in the third quarter as part of our efforts to steadily recycle capital to protect and enhance MAA\u2019s long-term earnings profile. Additionally, we currently have five other properties under contract for disposition and expect to close on these transactions in the fourth quarter.","Our merger with Post Properties is making good progress. Both companies have shareholder meetings scheduled for November 10th and we anticipate a closing of the merger effective December 1st. Processes associated with integration of the two companies are well underway with the go-forward organization structure and team members now in place. As outlined in our announcement of the merger, we anticipate that upon completion of integration activities by the end of 2017, we expect to capture overhead synergies of $20 million. Specific line items and decisions associated with capturing this opportunity have been identified and we remain very confident in achieving this performance benchmark.","As we continue to engage in the more detailed tasks surrounding the integration of the two companies, we remain very enthused and confident about capturing the improved operating margins and NOI lift from the legacy Post portfolio that is important to the overall value proposition of the merger. Our work to date associated with inventorying and comparing the more detailed operating practices of the two platforms, further assessing opportunities surrounding our larger scale and enhanced market efficiencies and evaluating the redevelopment opportunities, all combine to have us also feeling very confident about this aspect of the value proposition. We will begin to lay out more details upon closing the merger and as part of providing our initial guidance for calendar year 2017.","Before turning the call over to Tom I want to express my appreciation and thanks to the associates working at both MAA and Post for their hard work and great support during the past few weeks as we have worked through the difficult task of merging the organizational structures and preparing for consolidated operations, while also taking care of our residents and existing operations. Our newly combined company will have a number of strong attributes that position us well for the future. The professionalism and dedication that our combined team of associates demonstrates each day are key among these qualities.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tom.","Tom Grimes","Thank you, Eric. And good morning, everyone.","Our second quarter NOI performance of 3.7% was driven by revenue growth of 3.6% over the prior year. Revenues were up 1.5% sequentially, which is 30 bps higher than the sequential change last quarter. We have good momentum in rents as all in place effective rents increased 4.2% from the prior year. In the third quarter, new rents and renewal rents executed during the quarter increased 4.3% on a blended lease over lease basis. We achieved 96.4% average daily occupancy which is strong on an absolute basis but slightly lower than last year\u2019s record performance.","Fourth quarter trends continued the positive momentum. October\u2019s average daily physical occupancy of 96.1% is in line with October of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period is just 6.6%, below to prior year by 55 basis points. New and renewal rents have built on the strong trends of the third quarter. On a blended lease over lease basis, October rents have increased a seasonally strong 3.3%.","On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results. They were led by Fort Worth, Orlando, and Atlanta. The secondary markets continued to close the effective rent growth gap with the large markets. Since the third quarter of 2015, the rent growth gap between large and secondary markets has narrowed 80 basis points. Revenue growth in Jacksonville, Charleston and Memphis all stood out.","As mentioned, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy, rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry bead is Houston which represents just 4% of our current portfolio. It\u2019s worth noting that Houston will drop to less than 4% of NOI after the merger. We continue to closely monitor and protect occupancy in this market. As we approach the end of October, Houston\u2019s average daily occupancy is 95.9% and 60-day exposure is just 6.1%.","Our customer base remains stable. Move-outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 1.4% over prior year and turnover remained low at 51.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. Move-outs to home buying remained at 20% of total move-outs. There was also little change in move-outs to home rental, which represents just over 7% of move-outs.","During the quarter, we completed over 2,400 interior unit upgrades, bringing our total units redeveloped this year to just over 5,400. Our pre-merger redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remains robust. As a reminder, on average, we are spending about $4,500 per unit and receiving average rent increases of approximately $100 over a comparable non-renovated unit, generating a year one cash return of well over 20%.","Work is underway defining the scale and scope of the redevelopment opportunity for the Post portfolio. Indications are that it will be a significant value creation opportunity. We are excited about adding units from the Post portfolio to our redevelopment pipeline.","Our lease-up communities are performing well. Station Square at Cosner\u2019s Corner II and Cityscape at Market Center II both stabilized on schedule during the third quarter. Rivers Walk II will stabilize on schedule in the fourth quarter. Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes II in Orlando is 30% leased and on schedule to stabilize at the end of next year. Our three new acquisition communities in Tempe, Greenville and Houston are all on track.","We are pleased with our progress thus far on the Post merger. The operating structure of the combined companies has been finalized and communicated. There is a high degree of overlap in both systems and markets. We have enjoyed meeting the Post onsite teams and believe that adding these solid teams as well as excellent product and locations to our operating platform will create value for all of our stakeholders. We are in good shape for fourth quarter and set up well for 2017. Al?","Al Campbell","Thank you, Tom. And good morning, everyone.","I\u2019ll provide some additional commentary on the Company\u2019s third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet position, and then finally on the revised earnings guidance for the full year.","Net income available for common shareholders was $1.12 per diluted common share for the quarter. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.49 per share, which represents 8% increase over the prior year. This performance was $0.04 per share above the mid-point of our previous guidance. Our same store performance continued to be solid, which is in-line with our expectations. About half of the outperformance or $0.02 per share was related to the favorable impact from the timing of our planned bond deal, previously projected for the third quarter, which has been postponed until early next year due to our merger activity and will a little bit more about that in a moment.","An additional penny per share is related to the timing of our transaction activity during the quarter, and the final penny per share is related to favorable G&A expenses for the quarter. As Eric mentioned, we acquired two new communities during the third quarter. We invested a total of $133 million for these two new communities, bringing our total acquisition volume year-to-date to $264 million. We also sold seven communities, averaging 22 years of age, during the quarter for gross proceeds of $152 million, which represented a 6.3% cap rate. We also exited two additional secondary markets with these sales, Winston-Salem and Greensboro, North Carolina.","Our plans for the year include selling an additional five communities, which are expected to close during the fourth quarter. We completed one community during the quarter, River\u2019s Walk phase II in Charleston, and we had three communities, all expansions of current properties, remaining under construction at the end of the quarter. We funded $13 million of construction costs during the third quarter, and have an additional $33 million to be funded on the existing pipeline. We continue to expect average stabilized NOI yields of about 7.5% for these communities once completed and stabilized.","During the third quarter, we paid off $75 million of maturing public bonds, which we expect to refinance as part of a public bond offering early next year. Also during the third quarter, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured rating to BBB+, a stable outlook, and S&P placed our credit ratings currently at BBB flat, on positive Credit Watch to reflect the anticipated increased strength of the balance sheet from the announced Post transaction.","Given the merger announcement and related activities, we have postponed our original plans for a bond deal late this year in order to allow the merger to close, which we expect to provide support for a financing early next year. Our balance sheet remains in great shape at quarter-end. Our leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 39.7%, which 100 basis points below the prior year, while our net debt was only 5.6 times recurring EBITDA.","At quarter-end, 89% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective interest rate of only 3.9%, with well laddered maturities averaging four years. At quarter end, we had almost $570 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility, providing both strength and flexibility.","Given our current expectations for acquisitions and dispositions over the remainder of the year, along with our projection for excess cash, we do not expect any new equity needs other than the shares issues for the merger transaction this year. Also, we expect our leverage to decline upon the closing of the merger with Post, ending the year in the mid-30s as a percent of gross asset value.","Finally, as Eric mentioned, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for 2016 due to the stronger than projected performance. We\u2019re increasing our core FFO projection by $0.06 per share at the mid-point, to reflect both the $0.04 per share third quarter outperformance and $0.02 per share for our revised expectations for the remainder of the year. We expect interest expense for the fourth quarter to be about $0.03 per share favorable due to the delayed timing of the planned bond deal, offset by about $0.01 per share of costs relating to cleanup from Hurricane Matthew. We were very fortunate to avoid significant damage from this recent storm, but we will incur some costs during Q4 for repairs and clean-up.","Core FFO is now projected to be $5.86 to $5.96 per share, or $5.91 at the midpoint, based on average shares and units outstanding of about 79.7 million. Core AFFO is now projected to be $5.16 to $5.26 per share, or $5.21 at the midpoint. The major components of our guidance, including same store growth, transaction and financing assumptions, remain similar to our prior guidance, with the one exception of the bond deal timing, as discussed.","As mentioned in our release, given the merger transaction is not yet approved, this guidance does not reflect the anticipated impact of the transaction. If the transaction closes as planned, we expect to end the year within this current guidance range, although near the lower end given the initial dilution expected from the merger transaction. We expect to provide guidance for 2017 and more details regarding the merger transaction with our fourth quarter press release.","As discussed during our merger announcement call, we plan to capture synergies and additional earnings opportunities from the merger with Post that will recapture the initial dilution from the transaction over the first 12 to 18 months, and what we have seen thus far continues to support these expectations. We plan to outline this further with our fourth quarter release.","That\u2019s all we have in the way of prepared comments, today. So, now we\u2019ll now turn it over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open.","Rob Stevenson","Good morning, guys. Eric, help me, help frame the thought process as you go forward between the large markets and the secondary markets in terms of how do you -- it seems like most of the sales keep coming from the secondary markets. Do you turn using the Post platform and do development in some of these secondary markets to maintain the exposure? As this cycle gets late in the tooth because that\u2019s typically been where you\u2019re stability has been during down cycles. Is it just a factor of post Post, you\u2019re going to be much more large markets? I mean how should we be thinking about that as the Mid-America platform moves forward in terms of market distribution?","Eric Bolton","Rob, I will tell you, we remain very committed to the overreaching objective of keeping a diversified and balanced attribute of earning stream. And we think in our region of the country, high job growth region of the country, one of the best ways to create that full cycle profile, if you will, is maintaining a healthy allocation between both large and secondary markets, high growth large and secondary markets.","As of today, we have about 65% weighting in large markets and 35% waiting in secondary markets. After the close of the merger, it will be more along the lines of 75-25. Now, you are right and that a lot of the asset sales that have taken place have come out of the secondary markets. But primarily that\u2019s a function of prioritizing disposition focused on older assets where the after CapEx margins are starting to show signs of moderating. And we feel like we can pull money out of those specific properties and recycle into better margin, better growth opportunities.","And so, given the history of our Company, it just so happens, a lot of the older assets were in some of the more secondary or tertiary markets. So, just as a consequence of our overall recycling objective, we\u2019ve seen the allocation between large and secondary, and of course the Post transaction is going to change it. I will tell you this going forward, you\u2019ll probably see the 75-25 revert back to closer to call it 60-40 weighting, 65-35 weighting kind of where we are today.","We are going to continue to look for opportunistic acquisitions, as well as opportunistic development opportunities in both large and secondary markets as exemplified by this quarter, we bought one Houston, one in Greenville, so we did one in each segment. So, we remain very committed to the whole strategy that has really defined us for the last 20 years. And we will ebb and flow a little bit just as a consequence of recycling and market opportunities. But fundamentally, we don\u2019t plan to change who we are.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then Tom, you talked about the redevelopment in the portfolio. I mean, you guys have done close to 5,500 units in the existing Mid-America portfolio. When you look forward to 2017, 2018, 2019, assuming the market\u2019s cooperative and no recession et cetera, what\u2019s the remaining opportunity in the core Mid-America portfolio? And then, I know it\u2019s early but what\u2019s the magnitude of the number of units that you think are appropriate within the existing Post portfolio to do the rehab on?","Tom Grimes","Sure. On the MAA side, Rob, we\u2019ve got north of 15,000 units remaining and we\u2019d expect to see next year in the range of what we did this year. We\u2019re really working through, we\u2019re in the sweet spot of the Colonial portfolio at this point. On the Post side, it is still early, but we are very excited about those locations and how the interiors of those units will line up against the market norms in those locations and what that opportunity is. And so, I would tell you right now, it looks like it\u2019s 10,000 units or better.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird & Company. Your line is open.","Drew Babin","Following on Rob\u2019s question on redevelopment opportunities within Post, would you expect that some of the assets might find themselves kind of on the development and redevelopment page in the supplemental, as kind of more impactful redevelopments or do you envision the renovations being more kind of the kitchen and bath on turnover type projects?","Eric Bolton","There would be the kitchen and bath on turn opportunities. We are pretty disciplined about that and will likely not do a full -- evict everybody or ask people politely to move out and take the whole units down. We feel like that maximizes the opportunity. Now there are inside of that that\u2019s what we call heavy and a light, and there\u2019ll be some opportunities to do some granite and stainless upgrade as well as some light fixture changes as well, meaning just doing floors and fixtures and some items like that. But we\u2019re still mapping out those opportunities, but really excited about the conditions of property and the locations and the opportunity there.","Drew Babin","And on the disposition side, the 6.3 which I assume is an economic cap rate on what was sold in the third quarter. Would that be a good run rate kind of modeling dispositions going forward? Obviously it\u2019s much lower cap rates than some of the assets that have been sold over the last few quarters. Obviously, the remaining assets would be of higher quality, which we feel confident underwriting that type of disposition yield in the next year?","Tom Grimes","I would say so, yes. Yes. The five that we\u2019ve got on the contract, if all proceeds as we expect, there will be similar cap rate achieved on those.","Drew Babin","Okay. And finally, the 4.3% blended rent increase in 3Q, can you break that out by renewals and new leases?","Tom Grimes","Yes, sure. That was -- let\u2019s see, it was on third quarter, it was 2.4 and 6.6.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question form Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi. Good morning. It\u2019s Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just sticking on the Post transaction, as you\u2019ve come through that portfolio, how are you thinking about asset sales on the combined portfolio into 2017, and particularly interested in maybe some markets where you are going to have a much bigger presence for example in Atlanta? And then, I\u2019d also be interested in any updated thoughts on what you\u2019re intending to do with the DC, either keep or potentially selling those assets?","Eric Bolton","Well, I would tell you that we are just really starting to dig in a lot on our plans regarding portfolio, any sort of capital recycling that we\u2019re going to be doing and putting our plans together for next year and really for the next three years. I would tell you that probably my biggest priority exist on recycling some capital probably out of Dallas and Atlanta. Those two markets are going to comprise a fairly healthy percentage of overall portfolio concentration and that both would be a little bit higher than I think we want to maintain over the long haul. So, there\u2019ll probably be some recycling opportunity in those two markets would be a more for a priority for us. ","DC, we were up there last week and starting to really understand more about that opportunity. As I think you know the DC market is starting to finally show some signs of recovery. And bottom line is we are going to be patient with our analysis and thinking about what to do up there. We think that holding on to those assets at this point makes a lot of sense, particularly given where we are in the recovery cycle of that market and things that they bring, again different earnings profile element to the portfolio with our objective of really aiming to create balance on our earnings stream. We think those assets are good for the portfolio at this point.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks or the detail there. And then just any other opportunities as you start to dig in? You mentioned integration is well underway and might not have been as obvious when you completed your initial underwriting either on the operational side, revenue management related?","Eric Bolton","Well, again, we\u2019ll get into more specifics as we get the transaction closed and we start to put out our 2017 guidance. We\u2019re really digging in on the mechanics of the details, policies and practices on everything from how we manage and utilize LRO overall to how we manage and turn apartments to everything. And I would just say that we feel very optimistic about what we\u2019re seeing at this point and feel very confident in the overall value proposition.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. And then just last question for me. On the Houston acquisition, just curious about how you guys underwrote that and how you\u2019re thinking about market rent growth in Houston over the next, call it 12 to 18 months?","Eric Bolton","Well, this is a very opportunistic situation which presented to us off market with the developer and capital equity partner that we know very well, we\u2019ve done business with over the past. They were motivated to cycle out of the investment. Houston Heights district is a very high-end area, just northwest of downtown, the 3 miles northwest of the CBD of Houston, very restrictive covenants about supply in this particular sub-market back. In fact, this is the first community delivered in that sub-market since 2008, which is saying something when you\u2019re talking about Houston. But we went in there very conservatively. We basically assumed no rent growth for the next two years, 1.5% rate growth in the third year. I believe Houston will likely do better than that, but that\u2019s what we assumed. And on that basis, it underwrote at a level that we felt pretty good about, 5, 6 stabilized NOI yield first year, based on what I consider to be kind of probably lower rents than certainly what we\u2019ll see long-term. So, we feel, it was a pretty opportunistic buy, at this point.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Robert Wagner with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","Conor Wagner","This is Conor. Good morning, guys. So, Bob couldn\u2019t be with us today. Overall, Eric, if you could continue commenting on Houston. Have you seen other deals where, I know you guys have been looking there for a while where sellers have been less willing or just overall the transaction margin. Is this deal indicative that the transaction market in Houston is opening up or sellers still trying to wait for better pricing?","Eric Bolton","I think it\u2019s probably not indicative of where the market is right now, Conor. I think that, as you say, we have been looking at a lot of opportunity trying to chase opportunity there for last couple of years and haven\u2019t really found. We think a few transactions take place, but not much. And this was just the unique situation that was presented to us, and we jumped on it. I think that everybody is fully aware that supply trends and new permitting trends pulled way back in Huston. And I think we\u2019ve got to get through 2017. But I think, anybody that\u2019s got the wherewithal and ability and\/or the interest in holding on to 2018 is going to do that. So, I think Huston, we\u2019re going to continue to keep an eye on that market and like it long-term. But I think that it\u2019s probably too early to suggest that this transaction is indicative of anything really turning there in terms of transaction activity.","Conor Wagner","And then, you mentioned supply, the supply issue in Houston. Any markets next year where you are most concerned about supply growth versus any markets where supply growth pictures becomes more favorable?","Tom Grimes","No, Conor. I think in general we\u2019re seeing that 2017 looks a lot like 2016 in terms of supply that developers are beginning to have trouble with financing our lining items up in that area and then it probably peaks in 2017 and backs off in 2018. As Eric mentioned, Huston deliveries will be roughly half, will see half of the levels that they were this year and Atlanta, Dallas and Nashville will see modest increases but job growth remains very strong in that area and then really the reminder are in line with 2016.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Your line is open.","Tom Lesnick","I guess first, and I am sorry if I missed this. But Tom, could you maybe provide the renewal and new lease over lease comps for both your primary and secondary as well your overall performance?","Tom Grimes","Yes. It\u2019s 2.4 and 3.1 for the third quarter. And give me just second, I\u2019ll get it for large and secondary. Did you have another question while we\u2019re just having the primary and secondary?","Tom Lesnick","Yes, actually yes. So, on the on the Colonial transaction, you guys included the debt mark-to-market add back in your definition of core FFO, and some of that\u2019s still tapering off. Do you guys have any estimates of what that would be based on where rates are on today on the Post portfolio?","Al Campbell","Tom, we do. We\u2019ve talked about that a little bit. I\u2019ll tell you, I think a bigger point is we\u2019re really looking at how we\u2019re going to handle that this transaction given all the -- there is a lot f discussion in industry about non-core measures and handling of that. SEC is very focused on that and of course the REIT industry is right in the bull\u2019s eye on that. So, I think what you\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re going to take a look at that and most likely what we\u2019re going to do going forward next year is focus more NAREIT FFO and discuss the transaction merger integration cost. So that means that the fair market value adjustment will be included in that instead of pulling it out as for core FFO. I think our peers do include that, we\u2019re going to go ahead and do that and line that up within NAREIT FFO. Having said that, I think the number is around 35 million, something like that in total that we talked about and we\u2019ll get more details on that when we give guidance for 2017.","Tom Grimes","Alright and then Tom -- sorry, go ahead, Tom. ","Tom Lesnick","No, I was just saying I got that. I appreciate it. And so the comps?","Tom Grimes","Yes. For the third quarter, the large market growth was 3% on new lease and 7% on renewal and secondary is 1.5% on new lease and 6% on renewal.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Tayo Okusanya","Along the lines of the Post merger, apart from the $25 million of synergies that you guys have talked about. You\u2019ve also kind of now talked about these redevelopment opportunities within the portfolio. Anything else you are targeting out there that should give investors much more confidence about the amount of synergies overall they could get from the deal over a two to three-year holding period?","Eric Bolton","Well, I would tell you, Tayo. First, let me make sure it\u2019s 20 million of overhead, not 25, but 25 was on Colonial, 20 on Post. But as far as the areas of opportunity and sort of the opportunity to recover earnings solution. First of all, it\u2019s important to recognize that we\u2019re taking on the Post portfolio. And what\u2019s going to happen is the dilution that we see will be frankly at its highest point at the very first month or two and then it begins to taper off over the coming 12 to 18 months. And so, we think that by the time we get to the end of 2017 that the recovery associated with overhead synergy that $20 million number would be fully realize by the time we get to the end of 2017.","Beyond that, there are really three other sort of big areas of opportunity, first and foremost is the development pipeline that Post has. Again, we\u2019re taking that development pipeline on at frankly its most dilutive point. And, we will see as these properties come online and the earnings contributions start to grow, that will start to really show up, really towards end of next year and really into 2018 as these construction projects finish. But that\u2019s going to be a meaningful area of opportunity.","Thirdly is what Tom was talking about a moment ago, the redevelopment. That\u2019s a two to three year process. We see tremendous opportunity there, these are terrific locations that we think are just absolutely right for our redevelopment program. And we think that potentially is going to be much more significant frankly than what we contemplated that going into this. And then finally, the fourth area is we just refer to it generally as NOI lift. And it\u2019s a combination of a bunch of things. It ranges all the way from how we execute with LRO, yield management practices, as I was saying earlier, how we turn apartments, capturing the full benefit, surrounding the scale that we have. And frankly those benefits regarding scale and efficiencies, there is going to be some benefit accrued to the existing legacy MAA portfolio as a consequence of this combination as well.","So that particular opportunity is still being mapped out in detail, but we think that over the next 12 to 18 months that it likewise is a very significant opportunity. When you pull it all together, I mean when you look at sort of the -- there is a lot of different ways to think about sort of the value proposition here. But certainly, when you look at the pricing pay versus the upside that we think it\u2019s going to be realized over the next couple of years or so. Much in the same way we saw with Colonial, we think this one here with Post is going to be frankly more upside than what we saw with Colonial. ","Tayo Okusanya","And then just one more for the road. Just in regards to some of your secondary markets, there was also some weak same-store NOI growth there, Savannah, San Antonio, Greenville, and Birmingham. How should we be -- sorry, Birmingham and Little Rock, Arkansas. How should we be kind of thinking about those markets since we don\u2019t really talk much about but some of their numbers are also pretty weak?","Tom Grimes","I would tell you, I mean it\u2019s little bit different stories on some, on those first couple that you mentioned. They have very strong on year-over-year occupancy growth this time last year and tapered out a little bit. But Savannah, we feel good about long term. Their job growth is north of 2%. They\u2019re managing through some deliveries in the pooler submarket. But frankly that has become an aviation aerospace hub, almost smaller version of Charleston. And then Little Rock and Birmingham, I think they continue to improve but limited supply there and job growth in recovery mode, but they do not have quite the strengthened job growth that place Savannah, Charleston and Greenville do.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Gaurav Mehta","Following up on your comments on redevelopment opportunities within the Post portfolio, I was wondering if you could comment on your thoughts on using the Post brand. And on the merger call, you said that you\u2019re still evaluating how you\u2019re going to do the integration with different brands. Is there any update on that?","Eric Bolton","We\u2019re -- that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be very careful with and very thoughtful about. We think that the Post brand has value. We think it\u2019s particularly important in the Atlanta market. We are going to -- you\u2019ll see no change initially whatsoever. All the Post property names will continue just as they are. And we have no near-term plans to modify anything along these lines. But over the course of the coming year, we will be looking at opportunities to get a little bit alignment, some degree of alignment between sort of the Post brand and the MAA brand and see if we can come up with something that makes sense. But above all, we\u2019re absolutely committed to doing all we can to protect the I think very high rating that the Post brand maintains in a number of markets, Dallas included but particularly Atlanta I think is very important, and as well strengthen in a lot of the markets we\u2019re. So more to come on that but we understand the value of the brand and we\u2019re interested and want to be certain that we don\u2019t lose that.","Gaurav Mehta","And I think you highlighted Atlanta and Dallas as the couple of markets where you maybe overallocated Post merger and you may plan to recycle capital, are there any markets Post merger that you feel you\u2019re underallocated and where you plan to put that capital?","Eric Bolton","Well frankly, I mean really just about any other market that we\u2019re in at the moment, has capacity, if you will. So, we\u2019re going to continue to -- all existing markets that we\u2019re in, continue to look for opportunities. I think we will continue to as we have talked about with our recycling effort, we will continue to look at older assets, we still have a few. But not much left in that regard, but we have a couple one-off opportunities here and there that we will probably look at next year. But I think overall, the markets that we are in and certainly we like them and we would be happy to recycle capital in any of those markets.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.","Neil Malkin","First, some anecdotal evidence relative to single-family homes and trends. It seems like the first-time homebuyers that data is at pretty high levels or is accelerating. So, I am wondering if particularly in your secondary markets you are seeing any pressure on moveouts due to home purchase, any type of that activity going on just given the price point of your assets?","Tom Grimes","We\u2019re not and actually in our secondary markets group, there is lower -- the home buying, moveouts to home buying lower in secondary markets than in the large markets group. So, nothing there.","Neil Malkin","And then other one, you have been sending out or receiving pretty good renewal increases relative to new leases -- new lease rate increases, I am wondering at the current time, what -- is there a gain or loss at least in your portfolio and how do you look at the balance or the marriage between the two to not get too ahead of the market?","Tom Grimes","Yes. So, the way we really look at it is that we monitor the gap between the absolute dollar value of the renewal and the absolute dollar value of the new lease and what you find is it has some seasonal attributes to it. And so, it is -- it will be as little as $2 or $3 in the summer months when leasing is full bore. And then, as it begins to wind down and it\u2019ll open up to about $25 at this point. But right now, the way that it works is just in general at some point, if those become divergent and stay that way, it inhibits new lease price growth. But the dollar value between the two has remained narrow for the last couple of years and thus we\u2019re continuing to be aggressive on renewals.","Neil Malkin","I guess another way, if you were to reset all of your leases to market, would you roll up or down?","Tom Grimes","We\u2019d up roll up another 3.5% to 4% loss to lease in our portfolio right now\u2026.","Neil Malkin","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our last question from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Buck Horne","My quick first question actually was on the renewal numbers as well, that 6.6 seems pretty strong. Maybe a little color on it, just how did it trend throughout the quarter, if there was any significant change from month-to-month? And maybe what you\u2019re going out with on renewal offers for November and December?","Tom Grimes","I mean what we\u2019re doing -- that has stayed pretty steady as it goes, to be honest with you Buck. Renewals have been a bright spot for us for some time. August was 6.5, September was 5.9, October 6.2 and then you know the fourth quarter will be a hair lower than that, upper 5s just because we try not to force, we try not to force as little turnover as possible in the slower months. But frankly our lease expiration management was in very good shape, which has allowed us to continue to ask for what will work. I mean we have great customer service on site and markets are reasonable. So, we continue to work successfully with the renewals at that time.","Buck Horne","Sounds good. And my last question is on costs, a little bit. Maybe Al, if you could help us. Understand some of the movements, maybe start with the real estate taxes and so, explain -- a little bit of a comp issue in this quarter, and it looks like the guidance is forecasting for the fourth quarter to be a little bit easier for you on real estate tax pressure. Maybe just also if you foresee any other items coming up over the coming year, particularly maybe personnel costs; are you seeing any pressure on personnel to retain on site teams or anything like that?","Al Campbell","Well, I guess it\u2019s a good question and real estate taxes, I think it\u2019s important to focus on exactly what you did at the full year, the guidance we put out is 5.5%, 6.5%, don\u2019t expect that the change. Taxes, you get a lot of volatility sometimes in quarterly comparisons because there\u2019s couple of things that happen and you get -- timing of getting your information during the year can change year to year and timing of getting appeals successful or not successful can change year to year. So, I think the story for the third quarter is that last year in third quarter, we got a lot of information and some favorable appeals that were very favorable and really helped us understand. As so, we are facing a tough comp this year, third quarter, but our trajectory for the whole year is much more stable this year. Every bit of information we\u2019ve gotten seems to support our initial expectation. And so we feel good about the 5.6 to 6.5 and pressure coming from the same places we talked about, in Texas, in Georgia as they aggressively chase value of some of those areas and have a lot of transactions to support it. So, that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on in there.","Another is no, we really don\u2019t expect at this point a lot and the pressure going to fourth quarter. In terms of our -- what we\u2019ve put out and what\u2019s in our guidance continued expense in personnel, continued expense in other areas in line with what our expectations were. So, it\u2019s nothing new. Only unusual item we think of right now, mentioned a little bit, little bit storm cost cleanup in fourth quarter, Hurricane Matthew, certainly very fortunate that we\u2019ll have little bit cost in the fourth quarter to clean that up but other than that, nothing unusual we found to be expected. ","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Eric Bolton","Okay. Well, thanks nothing else from management at this point. And we\u2019ll see a lot of you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

And thank you for participating in the MAA Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.","At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tim Argo, SVP of Finance. You may begin.","Tim Argo","Thank you, Priscilla. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO.","Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday\u2019s press release and our 34-Act filings with SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call will be available on our website.","During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eric.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Thanks, Tim and Good morning everyone. Operating results for the third quarter were in line with our expectations and reflect continued strong leasing demand across the portfolio.","In addition, with our merger integration process now largely complete, results are beginning to reflect the benefits of enhanced execution on the legacy Colonial portfolio as well as the benefits of increased scale impacting the combined portfolio.","For the quarter, pro forma same store revenues increased 3.6% as compared to prior year and effective rent growth was 3.2%. Encouragingly, when considering just the leases written during the third quarter, pricing was on average 4.8% higher as compared to the prior year, well ahead of the cumulative rent growth on all the in-place leases during the quarter.","Occupancy remained strong with quarter and fiscal occupancy for the entire portfolio at 96.3%, putting us in a good position for the traditionally slower leasing activity during the winter months.","Resident turnover continues to run below long-term average, with move-outs during the third quarter down 7% on a pro forma same-store basis when compared to prior year. Move-outs to home buying declined a significant 14% when compared to the third quarter of last year.","Our new supply continues to come online in a number of markets, job growth across most markets has been sufficiently strong to support positive absorption and solid rent growth.","While there are going to be pockets of extra supply relative to demand in some sub market, I expect this to continue to be the exception and not a widespread concern.","As the economy continues to show slow recovery and new construction activity picks up, we believe these trends will be positive for job growth and demand for rental housing, construction and construction related industries including single family construction and an improving housing market have typically been a boost to the economy in the Sunbelt markets.","One of our best years of rent growth in our 20-year history was in 2007 when the single family housing market was at a very robust level. Absent a slip in the recovery of the job markets, we expect continued solid leasing fundamentals and rent growth into next year.","As mentioned third quarter results reflect the growing impact of the merger opportunities we have previously discussed. After closing the merger on October 1 of last year, we began executing a number of changes to on site practices and policies within the legacy Colonial portfolio.","Most of these changes required the re-working and consolidation of various systems and software conversions, while some changes were a matter of re-training our associates and retooling a number of operating processes.","It can take two to three quarter for the impact of these sorts of changes to show up in reported result. Comparing the legacy Colonial performance same-store portfolio on a year-over-year, during the third quarter, we improved the NOI operating margin on these properties by 250 basis points.","Changes made range from how we execute with our revenue management system and establishing pricing targets and exposure tolerances to how we approach property staffing and unit turn activities.","In addition to the operating upside within the legacy Colonial portfolio, our merger transaction also created a number of benefits resulting from expanded platform size and scale. This of course benefits both the legacy Colonial portfolio as well as the legacy MAA portfolio.","When comparing the NOI margins for the same-store legacy MAA portfolio for the third quarter on a year-over-year basis we captured a 130 basis point improvement in performance.","We've reworked a number of national contracts for various products and services earlier this year and those renegotiated pricing terms have began to more actively work their way through our operation and have a positive compounding effect on results through the busy summer leasing season.","As we continue to harvest these opportunities as well as execute on the redevelopment opportunity within the legacy Colonial portfolio, we continue to feel good about capturing the upside in NOI operating synergies as well as the G&A synergies that we've previously identified in our merger transaction.","As outlined in the earnings release, we remain very busy on the transaction front. We've completed our planned apartment property sales for the year and are substantially through the disposition of the commercial properties that were acquired as part of our merger.","You will note that we've increased our guidance for the year surrounding acquisitions as we have a number of properties currently under contract to buy and expect to close most of these by yearend.","As new development activity has picked up in a number of markets, we've see a noticeable increase in deals being brought to market and are encouraged this pattern will continue into next year. This should support our efforts to continue with an active program of capital recycle.","In total at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect to sell just over $300 million of properties this year and expect a similar volume of activity in 2015. We also continue to make good progress leasing our existing new development and lease-up pipeline and expect to have full productivity of most of these deals in 2015.","We're currently negotiating a couple of additional pre-purchase opportunities and would expect to reload our development pipeline although at a reduced level over the next few months as another source of opportunity for recycling capital.","That\u2019s all the way I have in the way of opening comment. I am going to turn the call over to Al.","Albert Campbell III","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll provide some additional commentary on the company\u2019s third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally on updated earnings guidance for the year.","FFO for the quarter was $103.8 million or $1.31 per share. Core FFO, which excludes certain items, primarily merger and integration cost and market value adjustment for debt assumed and debt extinguishment cost was $101.6 million or $1.28 per share, which was $0.07 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance.","The results were supported by solid performance from our pro forma same-store portfolio, which produced NOI growth in line with our strong expectation for the back half of the year. Our G&A cost were about $0.01 per share favorable to expectations for the quarter, but a portion of this is timing related. ","During the quarter, a promote fee associated with the wrap up of our Fund II joint venture. The total fee earned was $4.8 million with $2.5 million or about $0.03 per share recognized in FFO and with remaining portion related to gains on properties acquired from the joint venture applied to our investment basis in these properties.","Additionally we made a $0.03 per share adjustment to interest expense from accounting adjustment related to four interest rate swap contracts acquired in the merger with Colonial and these two items combined produced the remaining $0.06 per share [indiscernible] expectations for the third quarter.","Our pro forma same-store portfolio produced 6.8% NOI growth over the prior year, based on a 3.6% growth in revenues and a 80 basis point decline in operating expenses.","As Eric mentioned, solid pricing performance continued through the third quarter producing 3.2% growth in effective rents with the remaining 40 basis points of growth coming primarily from higher average occupancy during the third quarter.","Fiscal occupancy for the pro forma same-store portfolio ended the quarter at a strong 96.4% which is positioned well for the fourth quarter. The decline in operating expenses was primarily related to reductions in personnel, repair and maintenance and instruments cost as compared to the prior year, which are all areas where we've began to see the benefits from the merger. Our utilities and real estate tax expenses both increased during the quarter offsetting a portion of these declines.","With the acquisition of the remaining two thirds of Verandas at Southwood, the final Fund II property located in Tallahassee Florida, total acquisition volume year-to-date was $178 million.","As Eric mentioned we're currently pursuing additional acquisition opportunities that have accordingly increased our guidance to a range of $275 million to $375 million, for the full year a $75 million increase at the midpoint.","We also sold five wholly owned multifamily communities during the third quarter, containing 2238 units for total gross proceeds of $115 million. These sales completed our 2014 multifamily disposition plans, which produced total proceeds of $158 million and recorded gains on sale of $42 million for the year.","The average cap rate based on trailing NOI, a 4% management fee and total CapEx was 5.7% for the eight properties sold in 2014.","Structure and lease-up of our development pipeline continues to progress well. During the third quarter, we funded an additional $11.4 million, a development cost primarily toward the two remaining construction communities, 220 Riverside located in Jacksonville and Colonial Grand at Bellevue II located in Nashville.","Also during the quarter, two lease-up communities, Colonial Reserve at Frisco Bridges located in Dallas and Seasons at Celebrate Virginia II located in Fredericksburg reached full stabilization, which we consider greater than 90% occupancy for 90 days.","We have communities remaining in lease-up at the end of the quarter, with an average ending occupancy of 94% and all four are on track to reach full stabilization during the fourth quarter.","In the third quarter, we also continue to capture balance sheet and financing benefits from the recent merger. We amended the agreement for $250 million term loan acquired from Colonial to reflect the strength of the combined balance sheet and the current market price.","The amended loan, which matures in August of 2018 has a new credit spread, which is 65 basis points below the prior agreement at the current credit rate for the [company].","At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet remains in great shape. Total company leverage based on market cap was 39.7%. The fixed charge coverage ratio was 4.1 times and our total debt to current EBITDA was 6.2 times.","Also we have only $24 million of remaining funding commitment for our development pipeline with over $580 million of total cash and credit available under our line of credit at quarter end.","Finally based on the third quarter performance, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. We now expect core FFO for full year to be in a range of $4.87 to $4.99 per share which is $4.93 at the midpoint.","We continue to expect pro forma same store NOI to range from 4% to 4.5% for the full year. Core AFFO for the full year is now expected to be $4.12 to $4.25 per share, which represents about a 70% dividend payout at the midpoint.","And now, I'll turn it over to Eric for some closing comments.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Thanks Al. it was a good quarter for MAA as the work of the past year in integrating the legacy MAA and Colonial operations is ramping up and the benefit surrounding the merger are increasingly reflected in our results.","We're encouraged with the leasing conditions across the portfolio and our team is focused on continuing to execute on the various operating improvements that have been made.","We're making steady progress on recycling capital and continue to enhance portfolio quality and future internal growth prospects for the company. MAA's balance sheet is in terrific shape and we have ample capacity to execute in our plans moving forward.","I want to thank all of our MAA associates for their hard work and extra effort surrounding our merger over the past few quarters. Thanks to your hard work and successful integration of our platforms, our consolidated operating and reporting systems are in great shape and the company is well positioned as we head into 2015.","That's all we have in the way of prepared comments and Priscilla, we're going to turn it back to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Good morning, guys.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Hey David.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","And I apologize in advance, I might have missed some of your opening remarks, it's been a bit busy today. Did you mention any plans for non-core asset sales in the retail, in the retail pool?","Albert Campbell III","We -- we've got the most of the remaining assets under contract to sell and would expect to get the remaining ones mostly closed by the end of this year. We've got some residual land assets that will probably slide into next year, but the operating assets, we expect to be gone by the end of this year.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. And then -- I just want to go back to the sort of merger synergies and kind of reversal and OpEx in the quarter, and just talk about the sustainability of that, you said if you were to characterize the appearance of the synergies, are we sort of in early stages or is this kind of a one-shot deal?","Do you expect that there will be additional savings, additional margin expansion in the next couple of quarters, how would you characterize that? ","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","I would say David that certainly the changes that been introduced to date are sustainable going forward. There are sort of permanent changes if you will that we've made. Now the year-over-year benefits of that will obviously lessen over time as we get to year-over-year comparisons reflecting where the change took place.","But the changes that were made were more systemic in nature and as I said in my comments, it takes a while for these things to actually get implemented and then a while for them for being to show up. And Q3 being a busy quarter as it typically is, it really began to show up and with all the integration behind us in the early part of the year.","So now there are few other remaining items that we're going to still harvest in the area of some turn activities and some other things that we're working on, but certainly what we've seen to date, we think will carry this going forward for some time,","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. That's helpful. And then just my last question has to do with some of the ships in occupancy, which is counterintuitive in my view. The secondary markets were relatively stable, large markets had higher occupancy, was there increased concession activity if you achieve that, what do you think the dynamic was that created sort of some occupancy strength in the period?","Thomas Grimes Jr.","I think -- David this is Tom, I think clear eyes and a lot of focus generated that. We were a little -- I think in second quarter you saw a little bit more focus on secondary markets, but we felt like the large markets were not firing on all cylinders as we would like and you saw that build back quite well.","I think our pricing performance which Eric mentioned in the call up $4.8 million for the quarter in the case that we didn't have to do anything out of the ordinary for those.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay, good. Thanks for the detail today.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","Thanks. Good morning.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Hey Rich.","Thomas Grimes Jr.","Hey Rich.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","So back to David's question on synergies if I can, I remember couple three, four quarters ago, the number of $0.30 to $0.45 of operating synergies was kind of, you know your game plan.","Do you still have that view about pure operating synergies is always to G&A synergies and where are -- do you feel you are in terms of getting into that range right now?","Thomas Grimes Jr.","Let me answer initially Rich and then maybe Al can add some details, but in answering your question, we absolutely feel very confident about -- we actually the range that we show before on the NOI was $0.30 to $0.50 per share and we feel very good about achieving that.","That's really broken down into four different components NOI stabilizing the development pipeline recycling non-earning assets and redevelopment of the Colonial assets. All those things run away and in fact on the NOI operating synergies.","Frankly what we saw in the third quarter you just annualize that. We were at the very top into that range. So we spec we will probably do better than what we initially thought in that particular line item.","The G&A savings which is the other big component of this roughly $25 million or $0.32 a share, you'll see that all next year. our run rate certainly about the end of this year as we've always said would be reflecting that savings and we feel very good about delivering on that value creation as we initially identify.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","So the G&A of $0.32 is not included in the $0.30 to $0.50?","Albert Campbell III","No, that's additional above that.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","Okay. And so you get all of that in 2015, but how much of the $0.30 to $0.50 do you think you get in 2015?","Albert Campbell III","I think the four items were NOI synergy stabilizing the development pipeline to give the majority of those two Rich. The other two items, the redevelopment of the Colonial assets and these recycling the non-earning assets, they're going to take a couple more years on the redevelopment pipeline.","Just to give you an example we laid out 10,000 to 15,000 units of opportunity there. We feel very good about that. We did 2,000 this year. We'll probably do more like 3,000 next year. So it takes a few years to fully get that 10,000 to 15,000 units. But we feel very good about that program and the economics are still strong.","The non-earning assets, the land, we'll probably be active on selling added thing and you'll see the impact more in '16 I would say.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","Okay. So these two kind of in-process, are they half of the $0.30 to $0.50 or they less than that?","Albert Campbell III","They are on the recycle of non-funded assets there we said $0.08 range on the redevelopment program, $0.10 to $0.17 range. So the redevelopment program of that 30-50 is a pretty meaningful piece and we will see that play out over the next couple of years.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","Okay, that's great, thanks. In terms of your dispositions, Eric, you mentioned $300 million possible in 2015. How much do you think will come out of the secondary markets being that you've had some little bit of choppiness there or are you not going to be willing to necessarily make a trade just because you had a couple of moving parts in the last couple of quarters.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Rich, we remain very committed to our strategy allocating capital both in large and secondary markets and the balance that we have today are roughly about 60% to 40% allocated, 40% allocated to secondary, 60% to large. We think that's the right model going forward. So we're not going to change that.","Now having said that, of the $300 million that we probably will sell next year overwhelmingly that will be within the secondary market segment of the portfolio. There is some fine tuning within that component of the strategy that we're executing on.","You will see and really the focus as it always has been for us is just to cycle some of the older lower margin investments and higher margin investments. As it so happens given the history of our company, a lot of our older investments happen to be in some of the more tertiary markets within that secondary market segment of the portfolio.","So that you will see more of the recycling taking place within the secondary segment of the portfolio, but we remain very committed to the overall strategy.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","Okay. I read a new story a few weeks ago about the jobless rate in the south being higher than -- it was surprisingly high considering this is where you'd see job growth Atlanta, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana and South Carolina, all registering high from an unemployment rate perspective.","I'm not, I don't know if you saw that article and -- but I was just curious if you've sensed anything about a job, job growth perspective in some of your markets or if that's not kind of coming through in the numbers.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","I didn't see the article that you're referring to. What we have seen is in some select secondary markets weaker job growth than what we've seen take place in some of the larger markets and thus sort of the weaker performance out of the secondary segment of the portfolio -- market segment of the portfolio to specifically Memphis, Little Rock and Norfolk Virginia have been a little bit weak. San Antonio has been a little bit weak.","Offsetting that though to some degree has been certainly Charleston, Savannah, Greenville, Spartanburg, South Carolina, they\u2019ve been very strong. So it's hit or miss and some have been weak, some have been strong and so it's -- but again we continue to while the demand side or the job growth side of the model has been a little bit weak in some of those markets, the good news is that supply trends are still very muted within that group of markets overall and I think if can just continue, the economy pick up a little bit more steam.","And you look at the job projections in the next year and the year thereafter, a lot of these secondary markets are showing pretty good momentum on the job front. So we're encouraged with the trends and I think that we should see that performance improve over the next year.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","So is October 6, page 84 in the Wall Street Journal, I saved it just for you. And then last question is, the development pipeline reloading it, I'm curious I mean how much will development never being your kind of for take prior to Colonial, why now is it kind of the something that you wanted to do maybe with more of a long-term perspective?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","It's really no change Rich. We feel like that our approach to development has historically been and will continue to be built around essentially a pre-purchase model of something to be built by a developer. The incident or the occurrence of MAA actually being the developer is highly unlikely.","We may do that on a phase two expansion or something of that nature. We're very familiar with the product, but broadly speaking when we talk about new development, what these really are pre-purchases of to be built properties.","We think that the volume for us is going to probably be around $200 million to $300 million offset on a $8.5 billion balance sheet. So overwhelmingly the external growth story for us is largely continues to be built around acquiring existing assets.","Rich Anderson - Mizuho Securities","Great color. Thanks a lot, appreciate it.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go now to Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital","Hi. Good morning.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Hi Karin.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital","Just wanted to ask about the incremental level of acquisition opportunities that you're seeing in the market today. Does that cause you to potentially consider accelerating the dispositions and the portfolio recycling that you're planning for the secondary markets for 2015, now that you're seeing, if you're seeing more volumes on the acquisition side?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","We're going to be selling more certainly on the apartment side in 2015 than what we've ever sold. We were selling about $300 in total this year call it half of its apartments have obviously existing commercial assets to Colonial.","Next year the $300 million will be comprised totally of apartments, but having said that, our strategy is really built around a discipline of sort of steady recycling from lower margin investments to higher margin investments.","We're not trying to make any sort of major portfolio shift or there is no strategy change that we're trying to pull off here. And as I said, we believe very much in being allocated between large and secondary markets.","So what we're finding is and we've always found typically is good opportunities to harvest value out of lot of these assets and then see secondary markets by selling them in a very steady fashion on sort of a retail basis as opposed to putting a big package together and trying to find some wholesale buyer to take us out.","So we're going to push the agenda there as aggressively as we can depending on redeployment opportunities, but we also are very mindful of protecting a steady of performance to steadily AFFO and the dividend, which we think is an important component of long-term shareholder returns.","So we're going to push that agenda Karin as aggressively as we can, but to some degree it's a function of where the redevelopment or sort of the reinvestment opportunity plays out.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital","And where do you think the spread stands today on a cap rate basis between what you'd like to sell in the secondary market versus what you'd like to buy next year?","Albert Campbell III","Karin this is Al. I think one thing I'll point you to is on the eight assets we sold this year multifamily. if you take the trailing NOI minus the 4% cap management fee and all the CapEx internal property last year that's a 5.7% cap rate and I will say we're buying probably in the 5% to 5.5% range altogether.","So it's tighter than you would think and on a cash flow basis. Now NOI to little bit wider spread than that, but on a cash flow basis, it's pretty tight.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital","That's helpful. Can you give us just a sense for how October trends where just what new on renewal, lease increases were and where occupancy stands here in October?","Thomas Grimes Jr.","Sure Karin, this is Tom and occupancy is at 96, exposures roughly 76, which is about 30 basis points better than it was the same time last year and this is on a year-over-year basis, new leases are blended was 5 and it's 4.8, new lease 5.2 renewal.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital","Okay. So October sounds like you continued the momentum that you saw in the\u2026","Thomas Grimes Jr.","Yes and as Eric touched on some of these systems that we've in place to harvest efficiency and value are really beginning to pay off and we think we've got an opportunity for the next quarter or so to continue the improvements in our pricing arena.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital","That's helpful. And my last question is just on the performance of the primary markets versus the secondary markets. Can you just give a general sense as to where you think that the spread between -- the performance spread between those two groups is going to trend here in the next coming quarters?","Do you think the gap is going to widen out further? Are you expecting the secondary markets to start to narrow the gap a little bit and do you have any visibility on improving job growth trends or any other types of trends that might be affecting the secondary market?","Thomas Grimes Jr.","We feel like the -- on a positive note both groups improved very well from the second quarter to the third quarter. We think that the gap between them will narrow, but are enjoying the strength of the primary markets.","Looking forward, we're particularly encouraged by the lack of new supply in the secondary markets. Then we do have a few that have been pressured by weaker job growth Eric touched on those, with Memphis, Little Rock and Norfolk Virginia all at less than a percent of job growth over the last year or so.","Those are expected to do a little bit better in 2015, but we need to monitor those. Memphis was affected, Memphis revenues were 140 basis points lower this quarter than we would have expected because of a couple of down units or because of a number of down units related to flood event, which will have back in the first quarter.","So the job markets for the secondary group for those properties are expected to be 2.6%6 in Memphis next year, 2.9% in Little Rock and 2% in Norfolk, all of which bodes well for 2015. I would like to point out that we're seeing great strength in places like Charleston and it was up 3.4%, Greenville up 4.1% in revenues and Savannah at 5.1%.","So I think we've to be careful not to bucket all properties as secondary. It really comes down to what the job growth characteristics were and those appear to be improving.","Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital","Thank you for the color.","Thomas Grimes Jr.","Thanks Karin.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital","Hey, good morning guys. Al, Eric, quick question as it relates to turnover. What was turnover in the quarter? So what I'm trying to get is the mix of new lease versus renewals, how did that change kind of year-over-year.","And then as you think about, given the strong renewal growth you had relative to more moderate new lease growth, where does the loss to lease in the portfolio or the differential between new lease and renewal rents in place right now stand.","Thomas Grimes Jr.","Hi Mike, it's Tom and we were down 847 fewer units or 6.6% during the quarter on that and rephrase the second part of that question if you don't mind.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital","Just given the strong renewal growth that you had during the quarter relative to more moderate new lease growth, where do kind of in-place rents today stand versus kind of market, if you just look at the delta even pushing on renewals versus new leases, I was trying to get a sense of how the ports in place rents compared to market right now.","Thomas Grimes Jr.","Well I can tell you that in the third quarter we reported overall year-over-year in-place leases for all of Q3 this year versus Q3 last year, up 3.2%. If you look at the leases that we just wrote in the third quarter, just in the third quarter compared to just the leases we wrote in the third quarter of the prior year, they were up 4.8%.","Albert Campbell III","And I'll just add to that Mike, if you look at the months in the quarter, September was the highest effective rent which was in-place at 3.5% showing escalation or growth of those new prices early in the portfolio that Eric was pointing out.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital","Okay, that's helpful. Second question, Eric, you touched a little bit more just in terms of the acquisitions in the pipeline, you are looking at those more secondary or primary markets, will there be a lease up component of those, can you just give us a little bit more color there?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","They are a mix of some large, some secondary markets and these are all stabilized assets.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital","Okay. Any comment on pricing?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","I would better wait till that to be closed on and we're talking about that next quarter.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital","No problem then. And then just in terms of development starts, I recall in a prior call you talking about kind of focusing the development starts more in the secondary markets, markets where it was hard to find product. Is that we should expect with development starts or these are going to be more primary?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","It's going to -- again it's going to be a mix. We've got a couple that we are looking at right now, once in large, once in secondary. We've got another one that we're really on in conversations about in another large market. So it's going to be a mix.","We are increasingly finding more and more interest in this area of sort of developers who are looking for -- we're hearing from developers that financing equity capital in particular is getting more difficult.","These guys are very much interested obviously in continuing to keep their doors open and stay in business and we're having a lot of conversations with a lot of developers who very much want to sort of build a sustained relationship with us.","And so which also gives me some degree of comfort that hearing that the capital is tied with a lot of these developers gives me some comfort that the thread of massive overbuilding is pretty remote and so I think that we're encouraged with what we're seeing on that front.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital","That's all for me guys. Thank you.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go now to Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Hey, good morning, guys.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Good morning.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","So, a couple of quick ones from me. Eric, I know it's probably a bit early to talk about 2015 guidance, but some of your partner maybe brethren have discussed a directional sense for 2015 same-store revenue.","So I was wondering if you'd be willing to similarly provide an early sense of how you're feeling about same-store rev heading to 2015, especially given the comments you made about supply and to me a largest Sunbelt and then the job wage growth in your smaller Sunbelt markets.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","I think that I've seen what some of the others have said. I think that MAA is going to be competitive with the sector next year. I think that we're going to see -- 2015 looks very similar to 2014, just without the lumpiness and drama.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then one for you, Al, just wanted some clarification. Can you walk us through the adjustment for the treatment of the derivative contracts associated with Colonial merger? Just wanted to confirm that first thing what contemplated in prior guidance and then two, what's causing that adjustment to be reflected if booked now?","Albert Campbell III","Yes what that is when we acquired Colonial, there were four interest rate swaps that we acquired and they are very similar to swaps that we have, the plain are normal and they're hedging or locking in the rate on their term loans.","When we acquired them though they had a market value. When we incur a swap or start a swap, there is zero balances and the accounting is every period when the change in value you record that to other competitive income, which is below net income.","So we handle these swaps because they're similar same way and the technical accounting as we continue to review and scrub all of our treatment from the merger the technical accounting is actually to -- since those swaps had a market value at the time you purchased them, a portion of that change period to period should be applied back to interest expense.","And so this was accumulative adjustment for Q4, one and two immaterial in any period presented, but to get it correct, we wanted to give you all information, so you could see it. We left it in FFO and core FFO because had we done it that way, through the life, it would have been in interest expense with the other items and so that's it in a nutshell. Is that what you were asking?","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Yeah, that was, I appreciate that. And then one small follow-up. On the 3Q asset sales, were those individual or was that a portfolio sale?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Those are individual asset sales.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And type of buyers, we are talking private, local buyers effectively. I am just curious if you're seeing any change in demand etcetera from those guys, just trying to get sense on the transactional market.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","No, these are all private buyers and generally they're not [at the core] (ph). They are funds that manage anywhere from companies that have institutional capital often behind them, but these are managed 5,000 to 7,000 units, one group out of California, one group out of New York, one group out of Dallas.","So they're kind of all over the Board, but it's generally not just a small sort of country club kind of group of people. These are usually platforms again anywhere from five to one group ahead up to 15,000 units.","But typically higher leverage buyers. They're usually getting agency financing anywhere from 75% to 80% financing on the deals and we're finding it a good market for that.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go now to Paula Poskon with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Good morning, Paula","Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson","Eric, I just wanted to follow up on stat in your prepared remarks about the move-outs to home buying, did you say that relative 14%?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","It was down 14% from what it was\u2026","Albert Campbell III","Paula it's about 17% of move-outs right now.","Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson","Okay. And is there -- are you seeing any divergence across the communities in terms of or across your markets in terms of spikes up or down that surprised you?","Albert Campbell III","In terms of home buying, Paula?","Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson","Yes.","Albert Campbell III","Not really. I would tell you broadly it's lower than we thought it would be this year, but it's been relatively the normal band large markets moving out for home buying at a slightly higher rate than secondary, but nothing really stands out.","They are pretty tightly banded between sort of low of 15 and high of 22 or so.","Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson","Okay. Thanks, Al. And the other comment was Eric, when you said the new supply you thought would just be in kind of in certain pockets, but not a wide spread concern. Are there specific markets or sub markets that you are concerned about for 2015?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","I'll Tom answer that Paula.","Thomas Grimes Jr.","Paula, we're still monitoring sort of the same suspects, Raleigh is probably the one that has shown the most is sort of most effective supply. It actually seems to be responding reasonably well now, but effective rent growth there was only about 1.2%, but blended rates for the quarter are actually up there. So we're encouraged by that.","Austin we're monitoring I think along with everyone else, but their effective rent growth is fantastic and the jobs really just seem to be absorbing the units at a pretty good clip and then monitoring Dallas with that supply seems to be focused sort of Uptown area and North Dallas where we have relatively limited supply.","So I would say those are sort of places where I am watching in 2015, but we keep the job growth numbers for '15 slightly better forecast than they were last quarter. So we are encouraged by the job growth side of the equation.","Paula Poskon - D.A. Davidson","Okay. Thanks. That's all I have.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Thanks Paula.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Your line is open.","Tom Lesnick - Capital One Securities","Hi. Good morning, guys. Just curious with the upper revision in your acquisition guidance is the -- are the sellers more tax motivated or what's driving that?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","It's really in every case is a brand new property. So these are developers who are looking to cycle out. They never intended to hold these assets for long and in one case, it's a property we've been tracking. It went under contract to someone else earlier recently fell out.","They came back to us at our earlier pricing and we were able to make it work, but in every case these are one of the benefits of the new supply thing up in a number of these markets as I say is it's creating more and more eying opportunities and that's really what we were targeting is new product and so that's where we are seeing activity now.","Tom Lesnick - Capital One Securities","Great. And then how do your pre-purchase yield expectations compare to in-place acquisition cap rates right now?","Albert Campbell III","Usually about a 100 basis points higher from an NOI yield perspective.","Tom Lesnick - Capital One Securities","All right. Great, thank you.","Albert Campbell III","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go now to David Bragg with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to grab a couple of data points from me here at the end. First, what are the operating margins for the legacy and Colonial portfolios?","Albert Campbell III","Hold on just a second. I'll give you. As we talk about Dave, while we're pulling that, what it specifically is, the margin growth in the Colonial is 250 basis points improvement and it's a 130 basis points improvement on the legacy MAA piece, well actually underlying for synergy there Tim?","Tim Argo","Yes Dave, its Tim. For the legacy MAA, the NOI margin for Q3 was 59.9 and 59.5 for legacy CLP.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Okay. So they're pretty close to each other and generally given your knowledge of these two portfolios, do you expect them over time to be pretty comparable as they are now?","Albert Campbell III","I think that over time they probably will be. We frankly would expect to see the margin improvement grow a little bit in the CLP portfolio just as a consequence of some of these changes that Tom and his folks are working through as well as recognizing that there is a higher concentration of higher rent properties in the legacy CLP portfolio.","Now as we continue with our recycling effort and continue to cycle out of some of the lower margin investments, older assets that we have, which as I mentioned earlier, a lot of the activity next year will take place in the legacy MAA portfolio. I think you\u2019ll begin to see the margin then pick up more substantially in the legacy MAA portfolio.","Ultimately they'll settle out about the same place, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see for the next year or so for the CLP margin portfolio to or margins in CLP portfolio to actually accelerate beyond MAA.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Okay, thank you for that. And the other thing is, we spoke about move-outs buy, but can you provide move-out to single family rental this quarter and a year ago?","Albert Campbell III","Sure Dave, move-outs to rent increases are actually down slightly from second quarter. It's 8% this quarter and then\u2026","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","That's rent house.","Albert Campbell III","Sorry, rent house. That was what you were asking right?","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors","Renting the house, yes?","Albert Campbell III","And then it was -- so it was 7% this time last year.","Tim Argo","But it's moved up from 7% to 8% of our move-out over the last year.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors","8% and 7%, okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go now to Buck Horne with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates","Hey guys, thanks. I think a little deep on my listed things to ask you guys, maybe any update on recent rent to income trends, are you seeing a larger group of higher income tenants or is it still relatively steady?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","No it's at 17%, which is still very, very good and the downturn is it probably peaked around 18% or 19% and so it's at a very healthy point and the Sunbelt I think apartments are affordable. There is a lot of upside on what people can pay in upfront.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates","And I'm pretty impressed that the resident turnover levels are declining and then as high as they are at this point of the cycle, I know if you got any additional color on, if you're surprised where the resident turnover levels are.","I don't, I'm just the detail and can you -- do you have any of the station on where your tightest in your product like whether it's one-bedroom units or two bedroom units that are tighter right now and what the, what your tenants are doing in terms of managing their household structure?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","No about 70% of our households are single adult led. Home buying is the thing that we would tell you is slight different. I don't want to overstate this. We expected it would pick up a percentage point or two and it's dropped a couple. So not wildly different, but it was up in '13 from '12 and I think modestly and we expect that to continue and it didn't.","But I think it really speaks as much as anything to our renter psychology, their appreciation of the flexibility of renting and frankly the fear of home buying. Nothing new here in terms of theory, but that's -- they're just staying same put a little longer and appreciating renting a little longer.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move next to Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons. Your line is open.","Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons","Good morning.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Hi Carol.","Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons","I just have a question related to move-outs, are you all seen an increase from last year of tenants moving out related to a job transfer?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","That has moved up just a tad Carol. That's always been our largest cause for people leaving us and moving out and in the third quarter that constituted 29% of our turnover, whereas a year ago, it constituted 29% of our turnover. So that typically is the largest reason why people move out as a change in the tenant.","Thomas Grimes Jr.","And the downturn, that was the reason it was dropping, when we look at job transfers overall a positive sign.","Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And I\u2019m showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Okay. Thank you.

The company will first share its prepared comments followed by a question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin.","Leslie Wolfgang","Thank you, Jonathan and good morning everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Director of Investor Relations for MAA. With me this morning are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO.","Before we begin with our prepared comments, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to Safe Harbor language included in yesterday\u2019s press release and our 34-X filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call, will be available on our website.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Leslie. We appreciate everyone joining us this morning. FFO results for the first quarter of $1.25 per share were at the top end of our expectations and represented a record quarterly result. About half of the favorable performance was due to strong results in same-store operating expenses with the balance of the variance due to lower than expected G&A costs partially resulting from some timing differences versus our forecast. As Al will recap for you in his comments, we have increased the midpoint of our FFO guidance for the year to $4.87 per share as a result of the favorable Q1 result with some offset driven by earlier timing of balance sheet and financing plans.","Same-store revenues for the quarter were in line with our expectation as pricing performance drove the results with effective rents increasing in every market across the portfolio. Top performances were captured in Austin, Dallas, Houston, and Nashville within our large market segment of the portfolio with Fredericksburg, Lexington, and Chattanooga delivering top results in our secondary markets.","Resident turnover in the first quarter increased 3% as compared to Q1 last year and a 57% on a rolling 12-month basis. Resident turnover continues to trend lower than our long-term average. Move-outs associated with single-family home buying represented 20% of our move-outs in Q1 only a slight increase from 18% in Q1 of last year. Move-outs associated with single-family rental continue to not be a meaningful factor driving only 6% of our turnover in the quarter consistent with the results over the last several quarters. We continue to believe that a recovery in single-family market is a net positive factor for performance across our portfolio. It\u2019s interesting to note that the top three markets driving 63% of the increase in move-outs during the quarter due to home buying which were Austin, Nashville, and Dallas also posted the strongest rent growth during the quarter.","Taking a look at permitting activity and new supply trends, we continue to believe that at this part of the cycle \u2013 as this part of the cycle matures, our secondary market segment of the portfolio will generate a more stable performance profile and serve to offset some of the moderation associated with higher levels of supply in the larger markets. Permitting activity within our large market segment has clearly moved up, but it\u2019s still about 10% below the peak level during 2006 and encouragingly permitting within our secondary market segment, it\u2019s still only running at about 50% of where it was at the peak in 2006.","More importantly, when looking at the demand side of the equation, job growth prospects continue to show improving trends and when compared to supply projections suggest that leasing fundamentals should continue to support healthy rent growth. Looking at updated projections and the ratio forecast in new job growth and permitting activity at a healthy 10 to 1 relationship we continue to believe that while leasing fundamentals and pricing trends would show some moderation from last year\u2019s record performance, net absorption across some markets should remain strong and pricing trends should continue to exceed historical averages. We are actively underway with efforts to sell 11 properties in the portfolio with four of those under contract and expected to close soon. We continue to forecast total dispositions for the year in the $150 million to $160 million range.","As noted in the earnings release during the quarter, we closed on the acquisition of Milstead Village in Atlanta from our Fund I joint venture and expect to close on the one remaining property within the fund located in Houston during the second quarter. We are currently working on several other acquisition opportunities and remain comfortable with our guidance range for the year of $250 million to $300 million in wholly owned acquisitions. The market environment remains extremely competitive for fully and stabilized properties with cap rates holding steady. We\u2019ve clearly seen investment capital move increasingly into some of our secondary markets. We continue to believe that our long established record for performing for sellers and extensive deal flow really yield us additional acquisition opportunities this year, work environment is clearly very competitive.","As we enter the peak leasing season we feel good about the outlook for the year. We don\u2019t see any evidence to suggest that the recovering single-family market is a meaningful threat to our ability to capture solid rent growth. And while new apartment deliveries are clearly accelerating, so long as the employment markets continue to show recovery as we expect they will, we believe that absorption will remain strong.","That\u2019s all I have in the way of prepared comments and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Al. Al?","Al Campbell","Thank you, Eric and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll provide a few comments on earnings performance and balance sheet activity during the quarter and then I\u2019ll highlight the key assumptions included in the updated guidance. FFO for the fourth quarter was $55.2 or $1.25 per share which represents a 12% growth over the prior year and $0.06 per share above the midpoint of previous guidance. About half, as Eric said, or $0.03 per share of the favorable performance compared to the original forecast came from the same store portfolio which produced 7.7% NOI growth compared to the prior year versus an expectation of about 6%.","Revenue performance for the first quarter was in line with expectations supported by 4.7% growth in effective rents and stable occupancy levels. Operating expenses drove the favorability in the same store with personnel, repair and maintenance and real estate tax expenses combining to produce the majority of our performance for the quarter. Real-estate tax expenses in the first quarter benefited from favorable prior year appeals, which is expected to be offset over the remainder of the year by continued pressure on taxes in several of the key areas discussed before. The majority of the remaining out performance in earnings for the quarter was produced by G&A as bonuses, health insurance and professional fees were all below projections for the first quarter with a portion of the favorability related to timing differences.","During the first quarter we acquired one community for Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, a 310 unit property located in Atlanta and entered an agreement to acquire the remaining community in the Fund, a 360 unit property located in Houston. And the gross combined purchase price is $59 million including an $18.3 million loans to be assumed by the company.","MAA owns a one-third interest in Fund I which will be closed following these transactions and the company continues to hold and pursue joint venture investments through Mid-America Multifamily Funds II and III in the future. We continue to make good progress on the development pipeline during the first quarter. MAA now has three communities under construction with two others recently completing in the lease-up phase. Two lease-up communities both attained 82% occupancy during the quarter and they are expected to be stabilized in the second half of the year. We funded an additional $12.4 million for the completion of the three communities remaining under construction during the quarter and we took delivery and leased the first half of 2025 South Church located in Charlotte.","We expect delivery of the remaining units during the second quarter. We also expect initial unit deliveries at River\u2019s Walk in Charleston during the second quarter with 31 of the units already leased. Initial deliveries for 220 Riverside located in Jacksonville are expected in the second half of 2014. Our balance sheet ended the quarter in a great position. During the first quarter, we issued around 325,000 common shares through the ATM program at an average process of 68, 62 per share with total net proceeds of $22 million, which was primarily used to fund acquisition and development activity.","We also repaid $75 million of additional secured borrowings during the quarter releasing the mortgages and increasing our unencumbered asset total over 57% of gross assets. The company is now in a good position to approach the public bond markets for future financing needs. At the end of the first quarter, the company leverage defined as net debt to gross assets was 43.7%, total debt was 6.3 times EBITDA, and MAA\u2019s fixed charge coverage ratio was 4.5 times.","At the end of the quarter, 90% of our outstanding debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates supporting a total leverage interest rate of about 3.6% for the quarter. We expect to increase our protection from rising interest rates with long-term fixed rate financings planned later this year. And just after quarter end, we executed $150 million of interest rate swaps effectively locking a portion of the interest rate on expected future financing transactions.","Finally, given the first quarter performance and updated expectations, we are increasing our FFO guidance for the full year by $0.04 per share to midpoint. We are maintaining our same store guidance, which continues to project strong price and performance and stable occupancy producing 4% to 5% revenue growth for the full year. We expect operating expenses over the remainder of the year to increase in line with our original forecast as term costs begin to rise with growing leasing activity and re estate taxes reflect of upward pressure in key areas we discussed previously. We also expect timing of funding transactions for the year, primarily the planned bond financing and equity activity, to produce about $0.02 per share of dilution compared to the original forecast for the year as we move somewhat earlier than planned to lower execution risks.","We\u2019ve outlined the major assumptions for our guidance in the press release. In summary, we now expect our project diluted FFO per share for the full year to be 477 to 497 or 487 at the midpoint. Quarterly FFO per share is expected to be $1.16 to $1.28 for the second quarter, a $1.13 to a $1.25 for the third quarter and a $1.15 to $1.27 for the fourth quarter. Our quarterly guidance ranges continue to reflect the seasonality in our business as well as potential impact of timing on the significant acquisition, disposition and financing planned for the year.","AFO for the full year is expected to $4.10 to $4.30 per share which represents a 66% payout at the midpoint. That\u2019s all we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Jonathan I\u2019ll turn the call over to you now for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question please.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Hey, good morning guys.","Eric Bolton","Hey, David.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Just a couple of sort of kind of detail questions. Did you disclose what the rent mix was in the first quarter in terms of growth for new versus renewals?","Tom Grimes","Sure, David, it\u2019s Tom. I\u2019ll rattle those off on the first quarter on a year-over-year basis new lease rates were 3.8%, renewals 4.9%, blended 4.3%.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Should we expect those kind of rates going forward through the rest of the year to be consistent with your total revenue expectation?","Tom Grimes","Total revenues were 4% to 5% for the year and it really is driven by pricing so, I would tell you that generally, yeah.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Are you seeing any kind of convergence in those rates at this point or are they still \u2013 are they maintaining a relatively consistent spread?","Tom Grimes","Right now, they\u2019re staying pretty balanced and consistent. We\u2019re not seeing anything closed certainly on that.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay, and then I guess how is that \u2013 how do we think about that versus the performance gap that we\u2019re seeing between the (inaudible) group, the large and the secondary markets together from a revenue perspective. That gap seems to be closing a little bit at the revenue line. Is that more of a function of occupancy then?","Tom Grimes","No, I mean, I think what you\u2019ll see is the large margins begin to moderate as new construction comes and play and it will begin \u2013 you will begin to see the secondary markets begin to pick up a little bit as their advantage and deliveries begins to show. The timing on that couldn\u2019t exactly predict for you, but we don\u2019t think the Texas is going to roll the way Texas has been rolling for the infinite future is just being great for us, but at some point we\u2019ll begin to moderate.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","And just one last question, so a year from now, maybe we expect that we could expect that the gap between the revenue performance for those two buckets to be a little bit closer than it is today, sounds like?","Tom Grimes","Yes, we would think that our crystal ball sometimes is foggy but that\u2019s what we would anticipate at this point.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. Thanks for the detail.","Tom Grimes","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson from Macquarie. Your question please.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Good morning, guys. Can you talk a little bit about some of the markets that have been a bit of a surprise operationally to you to the upside and downside thus far in the year relative to expectations?","Tom Grimes","Sure, Rob, I mean, I have probably historically underestimated Texas\u2019 strength a little bit, I mean, it is \u2013 it\u2019s encouraging to see what it is continue to do and then I think Jacksonville is a real bright spot. I think a lot of folks have thought that it was not a great place to be and its performance was 5% revenue stable occupancy and growing rents is pretty encouraging. On the little bit slower side and not really surprising seeing some of the things \u2013 we would have expected I think the secondary markets to come in a little stronger in places like Columbus, Georgia but that is a market that has the ability to do great things, it\u2019s just been a little slow lately.","Eric Bolton","Yeah, I will tell you Rob, this is probably the biggest worry bead in the portfolio now to me would be Raleigh. I think that\u2019s a market broadly just getting a lot of supply. It\u2019s kind of all over the city and I think that\u2019s probably one of the weaker markets I would expect over the next 6 to 8 quarters, but as Tom says Texas just continues to be quite strong. There is a lot of supply picking up in the Texas markets, but the job growth engine there is so robust it just continues to handle it. But all-in-all, we do think the secondary markets will continue to show growing strength as we get into next year in particular.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Alright and then Al, I mean you guys did only 60 basis points of expense increase. When you look out over the year, I mean is \u2013 does this bode, is it just a timing issue or are you, sort of, at four months through the year now? Are you guys running ahead of what your expectations were for expense growth for the full year?","Al Campbell","Well, thank you. First quarter was better than we expected. There is no question, Rob, and as we talked about really that was couple of things real estate taxes and really turn costs. And taxes are somewhat timing and that we\u2019ve got some favorable appeals in the first quarter and we continue to expect pressure in the back half of the year, so it is somewhat timing. And on the turn costs we certainly have down in our forecast rising turn costs over this year as we talked about. We expect that will be the case in the second, third, and fourth quarters and especially as we get into more leasing activity in the second and third quarter. So, we saw some benefit in the first quarter that was some timing and some unexpected favorable surprise. And in terms of our guidance we carry that through the back half of the year that performance, but our same-store performance as it was is intact and so we expect it from the second quarter on to be about what we thought.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, and then just the last question. Eric, when you take a look at the supply that\u2019s coming online is some of your bigger \u2013 of the sort of larger markets, what\u2019s going on with construction costs there? I mean are the numbers still working for people if they stick a shovel in the ground today or six months from now from a numbers standpoint when you consider land costs and then plus what you have see in terms of inflation, in terms of material and labor?","Eric Bolton","I think it\u2019s getting tougher Rob. I was at a meeting last week with a number of developers talking about the growing pressures surrounding lumber costs and labor costs in particular and if the single-family housing market continues to pick up and you continue to see building taking place there, the labor situation for the multifamily developers is only going to get tougher. And I think that this rising pressure on construction costs and development costs could begin to act as a bit or a moderator to the level supply heading into \u201814, \u201815 kind of delivery. So, from a perspective of not being a big developer, I\u2019m kind of encouraged to see these trends picking up. I think it is starting to create pressure and these fields are not penciling out as well as they were a year ago.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, and then I lied. One last question, may I know have you guys given the tier in the market with the properties for sale, have you guys seen any sort of impact thus far from the presumed changes to Fannie and Freddie financing?","Al Campbell","Not really at this point Rob, we\u2019re certainly seeing a lot of people bidding on projects we\u2019re seeing pricing be about what we thought and as we reflect in our continued guidance. So, at this point we\u2019ve really haven\u2019t seen much impact in that.","Eric Bolton","And frankly we\u2019re seeing some of the life companies coming in increasingly to some of these markets offering some incredibly attractive terms 7.5, seven year money. And so we\u2019re not seeing any financing issues that cause us to worry about our ability to continue to cycle capital out of these secondary markets.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Is that \u2013 are the life guys going to smaller and regional guys or is this basically available to you and the other sort of bigger players only?","Eric Bolton","They are certainly going broader than they have in the past I think because they see multifamily is a good industry in a pretty good yield and given the risk they are not going to go to some of the markets but they go broader than they have in the past which is supporting the market.","Rob Stevenson \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hi, good morning guys. Just, following-up on the disposition question, can you give us a sense how dispositions are going to play out for the year just based upon what your marketing \u2013 maybe how much you expect to close in the quarter and kind of what you think it\u2019s going to close in the back half of the year?","Al Campbell","Yeah Mike, we\u2019ve got as Eric mentioned I think in his comments we\u2019ve got four assets under contract. I think we would expect us to close near the last part of the second quarter maybe one or two spill into the very first part of the third quarter and that\u2019s about half of the plan for the year. After that they are fairly evenly spread probably another group in the third quarter and another group in the fourth quarter of roughly equal sizes.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And you\u2019re still thinking late second quarter, early third quarter in terms of the unsecured debt issuance. And also just in terms of being a first time issuer, what kind of spread are you expecting at this point?","Al Campbell","Yeah Mike, we \u2013 as we\u2019ve talk about I think in our original guidance we had it occurring late July, early August, we have moved that up a little bit just because the market is in really good shape obviously our balance sheet is in great shape. We are ready to go to the market and it\u2019s just timing of when we need the money at this point. The market is red hot. You\u2019ve seen a lot of deals come through at very good spreads and obviously treasuries remain low. So, we believe if we went to the market right now we can get of treasury somewhere in the 175 to 200 over treasuries for the applicable period, which if you do the math on that, at the high end of that, you are at 3.25% for a 10-year deal. And that\u2019s pretty good, that\u2019s inside of inside of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That\u2019s a good pricing. We would hope to do that or even a little better assuming current conditions and so, we\u2019re moving as quickly as we can given the dilution on how the other factors in our plan to execute on that strategy.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Switching gears here to operations, did you get April leasing trends and I think you mentioned a 4.3% blended increase \u2013 average increase in the first quarter. What was that versus the first quarter of 2012?","Tom Grimes","It was up versus 2012, excuse me, honestly I don\u2019t have that, I think it\u2019s down, we are expected there is some moderation there first quarter, it was down of \u2013 first quarter of \u201812 was a little around 7% blended.","Eric Bolton","We would definitely expect the rent growth trajectory to be a little lower this year then it was last year so, that\u2019s not unexpected but blended 4.3%, I don\u2019t know off the top of my head what it was for Q1 last year, but it was I\u2019m sure north of that.","Tom Grimes","Yeah.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, fair enough. And finally, Eric, can you just touch upon, kind of, the acquisition pipeline, I know the first quarter is usually slow, but how is that firming and kind of, what are you seeing in terms of pricing difference right now between your primary and secondary markets?","Eric Bolton","Well, we are looking a lot of things right now, Mike, it\u2019s \u2013 as I said pretty darn competitive. We still feel good about $250 million to $300 million guidance that we have out there. We\u2019ve got couple of deals under contract currently that are going to due diligence so, I can\u2019t comment on the certainty that they\u2019ll close but they\u2019re looking pretty good. I would tell you that we\u2019re routinely seeing for the quality of the assets that were after the pricing in the large markets versus secondary markets versus secondary markets, the GAAP is probably around 50 basis points, I mean, pricing running 5.5% to 6% in the secondary markets and 5% to 5.5% in the larger markets and it\u2019s particularly for the stabilized deals it\u2019s super competitive, but pricing is holding up real strong.","Michael Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","I appreciate the color guys. Thank you.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon from Robert W. Baird. Your question please.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Eric, given your comments on construction costs, what is your appetite for continuing to do the one or two development deals a year and are you still getting a healthy volume of inbound calls from those private or regional developers with attractive projects that you\u2019d be interested in?","Eric Bolton","But we definitely are feeling a lot of those phone calls, Paula and that continues to be our favored way pursing development opportunities. We \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m probably had a bit more cautious about it today then I would have been a year ago just given the volume that we are seeing \u2013 what we are seeing is increasing \u2013 increasingly more developers who are interested in a presale and taking the risk off the table sooner rather than later and so, we went to a period sort of towards the end of last year where the conversations were more around with the developers wanting to have a continued interest of some hype in the project sort of once we got stabilized, there were some sort of promoter, some sort of back-end opportunity that they could continue to participate in.","Today, the conversation at least from what we are seeing is a little bit more urgent and they are not as aggressive about wanting to stay in and they are little bit more interested in wanting to get a certainty of giving out, which I think says something and about, sort of, what the developers, I mean there is obviously a lot of talk about supply so, I just think it\u2019s a time to be prudent and cautious and we have not \u2013 we don\u2019t have any other development situation or opportunities underway right now and if someone comes to us with a really compelling opportunity we would certainly have an interest in it, but we are \u2013 I think a lot of the supply that it\u2019s going to get delivered in \u201814 and \u201815 is going to create some good buying opportunities, and we are okay with being patient.","Paula Poskon \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thanks very much. That\u2019s all I have.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Paula.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Your question please.","Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","Yeah quick question. Just in regards to transaction markets. I mean, you guys are saying things are very competitive right now. Does that compel you to consider selling more assets and specifically selling more assets in primary rather than secondary markets?","Eric Bolton","Not really I mean our disposition strategy is really built around the idea of continuing to cycle capital out of investments that we feel like have margins that we can do better with. And that really is to process that we go through to decide where \u2013 which assets to sell and it\u2019s not so much a market driven decision as much as it\u2019s after CapEx almost if you will and AFFO margin decision that drives our selection process. And so we\u2019re selling in large markets and we\u2019re selling in secondary markets but the idea that we need to monetize a bunch of investments because of some portfolios shift or strategic objective that we have we don\u2019t really have that concern of that need. So we \u2013 that $150 million to $160 million maybe $175 million range it\u2019s a level that we think is about what we\u2019re very comfortable with, we\u2019re comfortable with ability to redeploy that capital and keep manage the earnings process through this and so that\u2019s kind of the way we\u2019re approaching it and I think you will continue to see that over the next couple of years.","Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","That\u2019s helpful. And when I just kind of think about guidance, this quarter, your prior guidance, the midpoint was $1.19, you guys came in at $1.25 which is a $0.06 beat, but you raised overall guidance for 2013, the midpoint by $0.04. So, I was kind of curious why just the $0.04 raise versus at least the $0.06 just to account for the 1Q beat?","Al Campbell","Tayo, this is Al. The $0.06 as you mentioned $0.03 call it same-store performance, $0.03 G&A and other items did carry through the year, but that\u2019s all set by couple of cents of items that as talked about earlier and mentioned the Mike\u2019s question. We are changing the timing of some of our transactions here, the bond transaction a little bit sooner, and if you saw we raised if you put together our plans this year and we talk about before we think we\u2019ll need around $25 million in equity for the full year to maintain our leverage given the dispositions and everything we have going on. So, you can see we have done most of that in the first quarter. So, that was a little bit earlier than we had originally planned. Those two things cost about $0.02 neg against the $0.06.","Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies","Got it. Thank you very much. Great quarter.","Eric Bolton","Thank you.","Al Campbell","Thanks Tayo.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Dave Bragg from Green Street Advisors. Your question please.","Dave Bragg \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Thank you. Good morning. In your press release you left the door open to more future joint venture purchases. Can you just talk about under what circumstances we should expect to see this from you and how the level of interest from partners compares to recent years?","Eric Bolton","Well, Dave, we have \u2013 we mentioned two funds. Fund II and fund III actually Fund II is a fund that is sort of kept off we really only have one investor that we do business with one probably capital investor and the only fund we really active if you will and looking to add new assets to Fund III. Having said that, that fund in our strategy for using the fund is really get towards value add acquisitions looking for properties that we define is being seven years of age or older that we can go in we have and those particular types of transactions particularly in today\u2019s market are very, very hard to find in terms of pricing that we feel comfortable with fully stabilize assets at that level are very easily financed. And so we really have not dialed into our forecast this year any expectation doing any more JV acquisitions this year. Having said that, we\u2019re still looking at them and we\u2019re still being given opportunities to bid on them. But the pricing is just very, very frothy particularly in that market given the financing availability.","Dave Bragg \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay, thank you. And Eric, we have spoken about this many times in the past, but given the increased level of purchases from single-family rental investors, especially in Atlanta and Phoenix and it seems as though those two markets slowed disproportionately for you in the first quarter. Are you observing more competition from the single-family rental asset class than you were, say, a year ago?","Tom Grimes","Hey, Dave, this is Tom. That hasn\u2019t changed at all at this point in terms of move outs. Atlanta, I think it has the ability to pick up steam here in the very near future, we have one property that was off which was really some people changes that we\u2019ve made adjustments on that pulled the market down a little bit and that group closed at 95.7 and we\u2019ve got a nice pop and occupancy which will hope to drive revenues in Atlanta. Phoenix is an encouraging story all around, I\u2019m optimistic about where it\u2019s going particularly our assets to the north is surrounded by the great deal of infrastructure in business construction. So, well, with single family of rentals is the factor it is not at this point, the factor that\u2019s changed much.","Eric Bolton","I think Dave just as you say talk about this lot. I do think that we continue to believe that the single family rental threat is not a meaningful threat for us. We\u2019ve been at 6% of our turnover due to move outs for home renting for now probably 8 to 10 quarters. If that number would have \u2013 let\u2019s say it moves to 8% and it\u2019s never been that I don\u2019t see a giving proportionately a lot of worsen it is right now, I mean, going back several years ago, the lowest it\u2019s ever been is about 4% so, it\u2019s kind of hang in a very steady level and I continue to just believe that people make their decisions in terms of renting a home versus renting apartment for a lot of lifestyle reasons and the people we\u2019re catering to just really I think are going to continue to favor the apartment rental over the home rental.","Dave Bragg \u2013 Green Street Advisors","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Dave.","Tom Grimes","Thanks, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your question please.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James","I was just wondering if you have any recent statistics on rent-to-income ratios for new leases signed.","Eric Bolton","Yeah, sure. The portfolio average for rent income ratio is about 17%, which is still down from the 19% or a peak sort of the part of the recession and then March is, sort of today\u2019s incomes on today\u2019s rents is 16.7.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James","That\u2019s great, thank you and any comment on foot traffic in the communities this leasing season and one quick one for Al. I just wondered if you could help quantify the magnitude of the property tax swing you\u2019re thinking you\u2019ll see later this year.","Al Campbell","Sure. On the first quarter foot traffic was right where we needed to be to so essentially flat with last year and then really look at April is that it\u2019s picked up a little bit on \u2013 in the 3% range, but just still positive and exactly what we needed to be.","Eric Bolton","Buck, I\u2019ll answer you on the taxes. In first quarter, given the \u2013 we have projected for the full year of about 6%, 5.5% to 6.5% guidance still believe that\u2019s correct. The first quarter was little over 3% because of some of the credits we got because of the assessments and appeals that were favorable. So you can do some math on that. We are \u2013 we would say that the second, the third, and fourth quarter higher, probably second quarter 4% to 5% and little higher in the third and fourth, just because comparisons from credits and things we had in the prior year.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James","Alright, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you guys.","Eric Bolton","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I would like to handle the program back to Eric for any further remarks.","Eric Bolton","Thank you.

We\u2019ve been through this merger process before and have developed a lot of strength and capabilities that are clearly on display.","Upon announcing our merger with Post, we outlined the fact that we expected the first year of consolidated operations would include some initial earnings dilution as we introduced three key variables that would have a near-term dilutive impact on year-one earnings. Specifically, those variables were the fact that we were bringing a $480 million development pipeline onto the balance sheet that was not yet productive.","Secondly, we acquired a portfolio of properties exposed to different submarkets that for the near-term would be facing higher supply pressure. And finally, that in combining the two balance sheets, we were meaningfully strengthening the MAA balance sheet through deleveraging the company by over 600 basis points.","As outlined in our earnings release, our initial guidance for 2017 projects FFO per share of $5.72 to $5.92 or $5.82 at the midpoint, which includes $0.15 per share of non-recurring merger and integration costs that we expect to incur as we wrap up consolidation activities.","It\u2019s important to note that excluding the non-recurring merger and integration costs from both 2016 results and our 2017 forecast, the midpoint of our forecast represents only a 1.9% decline from prior year. This is despite the short-term pressure from the three factors just noted that will dilute our earnings in 2017. This is a better result than we expected.","Our work to date on consolidating and reconciling property operations between MAA and Post has us even more enthused about the opportunity surrounding the long-term value proposition from this merger. Our work to date on the consolidation of back-office systems, reconciliation of property-level practices, rework of existing contracts to acquire the benefits of our enhanced scale and the initiation of significant unit interior redevelopment opportunities, cause us to remain very excited about the merger.","We expect the NOI margin enhancement opportunities we\u2019ve previously discussed to become increasingly evident as we approach the end of this year and into 2018. In addition, we remain confident that $20 million of G&A and overhead synergy opportunity that we previously identified will be fully captured in 2018.","Tom will discuss in more detail what we are seeing in the way of leasing conditions across the portfolio. Overall demand remains strong. We expect the well-documented pick-up in new supply trends will cause some moderation in rent growth versus prior year. Our combined adjusted Same Store revenue guidance of 3% to 3.5% is largely a result of expected rent growth and we expect to hold continued strong occupancy at around 96%, consistent with our performance in 2016.","Demand for apartment housing remains strong across our markets with leasing traffic consistent to what we\u2019ve been experiencing over the past year. Resident turnover or move-outs in the fourth quarter were down as compared to prior year. Encouragingly, based on the trends we see with new permitting and starts across the majority of our markets, coupled with the feedback we receive from developers who find today\u2019s construction financing market significantly more challenging, we remain optimistic that our markets will continue to hold up well as employment markets and wage growth continue to support solid demand.","As noted in yesterday\u2019s earnings release, we were successful in acquiring one property in the fourth quarter. The acquisition has attributes consistent with essentially each of the deals we\u2019ve acquired over the past couple of years, namely a high-end newly developed property by a regional developer undergoing initial lease-up in a submarket seeing near-term supply pressure, which created an opportunity for compelling acquisition.","We continue to look at a number of additional opportunities and find that overall cap rates appear to be holding up and generally in line to what we\u2019ve seen over the past year. Our guidance for acquisitions in 2017 is in line with performance in 2016. But we remain hopeful that as year unfolds, we may see more opportunities that meet our long established disciplined approach to deploying capital.","That\u2019s all I have in the way of prepared comments. And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Grimes","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter Same Store NOI performance for legacy MAA at 4.2% was driven by revenue growth of 3.6% over the prior year. On a sequential basis, we matched last year\u2019s strong seasonal revenue result and declined just 20 basis points from the third quarter to the fourth.","The top line was driven by rent growth, as all-in place effective rents increased 3.9% from the prior year. Occupancy exposure trends are strong. January\u2019s average daily physical occupancy of 96% matched January of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period is just 7.3%.","As expected, our pricing trends are showing some sign of moderation. During the quarter, blended lease prices on a lease over lease basis increased 2%. On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results. They were led by Fort Worth, Atlanta and Orlando.","The secondary markets continued their study revenue performance. Revenue growth in Memphis, Greenville and Charleston stood out. In both portfolios, Houston remains our only market-level worry bead. After the merger, Houston represents just 3.6% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market.","At the end of January, our combined Houston market\u2019s daily occupancy was 94.3% and 60-day exposure was just 7.3%. Renter demand remains steady and our current residents continue to choose to stay with us. Move-outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 9% over the prior year and turnover dropped again to a low 50.3% on a rolling 12-month basis.","Move-outs to home buying dropped 5% and move-outs to renting a house declined 14%. The integration of Post is off to a good start. Progress is being made reconciling our pricing platform. We\u2019ve centralized our pricing process and are now aligning pricing practices. On the redevelopment front, opportunities that have been identified are greater than we initially expected.","On the Post portfolio, we believe we have a pipeline of 1,300 units. We have already begun to upgrade units in the Post portfolio and look forward to updating you further throughout the year.","For the MAA portfolio, during the quarter we completed 1,300 interior unit upgrades, bringing our total units redeveloped for this year to just over 6,800. On legacy MAA, our redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remains robust.","On a combined basis, our total redevelopment pipeline is in the neighborhood of 30,000 units. Our active lease-up communities are performing well. Rivers Walk\u2019s stabilized - Rivers Walk Phase II stabilized on schedule in the fourth quarter. Post Parkside at Wade is 61% leased and on schedule to stabilize in the third quarter of this year. Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes Phase II in Orlando is 69% leased and on schedule to stabilize at the end of this year.","Post Afton Oaks is 15% leased and in line with our expectations. Given the conditions in Houston, we have planned for it to stabilize in the second quarter of 2018. Our new acquisition community in Charleston is on track. And finally the Retreat at West Creek Phase II which has not delivered yet, but it\u2019s already an incredibly good 84% pre-leased.","We are pleased with our progress thus far in the Post merger. The operating structure of the combined companies is in place and functioning well. There is a high degree of overlap in both systems and markets. The combined team is quite capable and we are confident that by reconciling the practices between the two companies that we will fully capture the opportunities of this merger. Al?","Albert Campbell","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll provide some additional commentary on the company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings performance, the balance sheet activity, and then finally on the initial guidance for 2017.","Net income available for common shareholders was $0.44 per diluted common share for the quarter. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.50 per share which was $0.01 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance, despite $0.02 of dilution from the Post merger, which was not included in the previous guidance.","Operating performance for the quarter continued to be strong in line with our expectations. Interest expense and disposition timing combined produced majority of the $0.03 per share favorable performance for the quarter, which was partially offset by the $0.02 per share dilution from the Post merger. For AFFO for the quarter was $1.40, which represents of 4.5% growth over the prior year, despite the Post dilution.","Core FFO for the full-year was $5.91 per share, which represents 7% growth over the prior year. Core AFFO for the year was $5.29 per share, which represents 10% growth over the prior year. And very healthy 62% dividend payoff ratio for the year, which is well below the sector average.","During the fourth quarter, we acquired one community for $70 million, and sold five communities for $113 million in gross proceeds completing our capital recycling plans for the year. Total gains of $32 million will recognize related to the dispositions during the fourth quarter.","For the full-year, five acquired communities combined totaled $334 million of capital investments. Our 12 communities were sold producing combined gross proceeds of $265 million, and $80 million of recorded gains on sale. We also funded $16 million of additional development costs during the quarter, bringing total development funding for the year to $59 million.","Our total development pipeline year-end now contains nine communities including the six acquired from Post, with total expected development cost of $562 million of which $200 million remains to be funded.","We expect NOI yields to average around 6.4% once these communities are completed and stabilized. During the fourth quarter, we completed several important financing goals for the company. First, we assumed over $900 million of debt in the Post merger with very minimal transfer costs. In conjunction with this, we expanded our credit facility to $1 billion from $750 million and refinanced $300 million term loan acquired from Post to extend the maturity date and improve the terms.","And also as mentioned in our prior quarter release, we postponed our original plans for bond deal in late 2006. This allowed the Post merger to close and enabled us to capture the benefits of additional balance sheet strength from the combined balance sheets prior to completing a new deal. Immediately following the merger, Standard & Poor\u2019s did upgrade our investment grade rating to BBB plus from BBB, which improved our current pricing and several of our borrowings, including our credit facility in term loans, and our expected pricing for future bond deals.","At year end, our leveraged defined as debt to total assets for our public bond covenants was 33.9%, which is 700 basis points lower than the previous year. And unencumbered assets were over 80% of gross assets. We also had over $540 million of combined cash and capacity under our unsecured credit facility to provide protection to support our business plans.","Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2017 with release you will notice that we are providing guidance for net income for diluted common share, which is reconciled to FFO and AFFO in the supplement. Also given the recent industry focus to a one common non-GAAP earnings measure and a desire to simply our earnings presentation. We are providing FFO guidance only on a NAREIT-defined basis for 2017.","Of course, we will continue to clearly disclose significant noncore items such as merger integration costs and a mark-to-market debt adjustment in order to allow modeling as desired. Net income per diluted common share is projected to be at $1.82 to $2.02 for the full year 2017. FFO is projected to be $5.72 to $5.92 per share or $5.82 with the mid-point, which includes $15.0 per share merger integration costs.","AFFO is projected to be $5.12 to $5.32 per share or $5.22 at the mid-point. The primary driver of 2017 performance is expected to be the combined adjusted same store NOI growth which is projected to be 3% to 3.5% based on 3% to 3.5% revenue growth and 3% to 4% operating expense growth.","Our revenue projections include continued strong occupancy levels averaging about 96% for 2017 combined with average rental pricing in the 3% to 3.5% range for the year. We expect operating expenses to remain under control with real estate tax is the only area that expect to pressure which are projected to continue growing in the 5% to 6% range for the year.","We expect acquisition volume to range between $300 million and $400 million with disposition buying range between $125 million and $175 million for the year. We expect to fund between $150 million and $250 million of development cost during 2017 projecting to fully complete six of the nine communities currently under construction. Given our expectation of generating $90 million to $100 million of internal generated cash flow in 2017 along with the anticipated asset dispositions for the year. We do not currently have plans with the new equity during 2017.","Our guidance assumes we incur additional $16 million to $20 million of merger and integration cost in 2017 and capture a full $20million of overhead synergies on a run rate basis by the yearend. We also expected to gain capturing additional NOI synergies primarily in the later part of the year as operating practices and platforms become more integrated.","So that\u2019s all that we have in the way of prepared comments Tanisha. We\u2019ll turn the call back over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] and we\u2019ll go ahead and take our first question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Robert Stevenson","Good morning guys. Tom, can you talk a little bit around the same store revenue guidance in terms of what markets are likely to be materially above the sort of range and then what markets other than Houston expected to be sort of below the sort of low end of the range, and where you have some concerns even if it\u2019s not going to be Houston level concerns, but where you\u2019re continuing to see weakening results for 2017.","Thomas Grimes","I\u2019ll start with sort of the strongest of the bunch, and frankly, it lines up pretty well with what 2016 results were, but I would expect things out of Atlanta, Orlando, Phoenix, Raleigh, Tampa, Jacksonville, Charleston and Memphis. If I can\u2019t not mention Memphis, Houston as a slower one and remind that it\u2019s just 3.5% of the portfolio. And then on the slower but frankly we like some of the fundamentals out of it are DC and Savannah. I think both of those have the - those will start a little slower, but I think they both have attributes that give us optimism towards the back half of the year.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then what markets do you think at this point in time have the widest variability in potential results for 2017?","Thomas Grimes","That is relatively I would say hard to predict. Of course, Rob I think the supply side of the equation is relatively clear and their demand stays on as expected. I would tell you that will roll out about as we would expect if we have some sort of shock to the system in some way like we did with the oil shock in Houston that would change volatility. I\u2019m just not very good at seeing those shocks coming around. But right now, we would expect them to be in those ranges.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then Eric, what are you guys thinking at this point in terms of new development starts in 2017 even if they\u2019re sort of fourth quarter sort of loaded. I mean, what do you - given what you acquired potentially in cost and what you had working on mid America. I mean, what does 2017 look like for starts for you guys?","Eric Bolton","The only project that I think you may see is start in 2017 is a phase 2 opportunity we\u2019re currently looking at associated with the acquisition we made in the fourth quarter in the Charleston market, 1201 Midtown is the name of the property. We have an adjacent parcel of land there they were currently looking at, other than that I don\u2019t envision of starting anything new in 2017.","Currently the combined development pipeline now represents roughly 3% to 4% of our enterprise value. I think that will probably scale down a little bit over the coming year to two years as we bring some product online, and we\u2019re going to be active in the market looking for opportunity you may see us acquire land site or too, but I would not see a starting anything this year and probably we would be back half of 2018 before you would see us likely start something.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then now, the 3% to 3.5% revenue - Same Store revenue growth guidance that\u2019s just a Mid-America portfolio or that includes post?","Albert Campbell","No, that includes post. I may just clarify that Rob, it\u2019s a great question is the guidance that we put out is on a adjusted combined Same Store basis we\u2019re in line with that, because it\u2019s both portfolios added together as if we owned Post in both years. We have the numbers so we - and we know that\u2019s what interest peoples who want to show that, and there are technical Same Store is properties that we\u2019ve owned for two years.","So that guidance is based on adjusted Same Store performance as if we own both 3% to 3.5% combined, obviously that\u2019s with Post coming out of the gate lower than MAA beginning the year, and as we worked in the back part of the year capturing some of the synergies tried closing that gap, but that\u2019s a combined basis.","Robert Stevenson","For the full year how material is the difference if you were providing guidance for just the Mid-America portfolio and then for the Post portfolio.","Eric Bolton","The back end - there is a back half on Post it make up for the first-half\u2026","Albert Campbell","No, it doesn\u2019t make up Robert, but tightens the gap. So in the zero 15 basis points range for the full year but when you\u2019re done, because of the performance that we expect to capture from some of the things that Tom and his team doing on pricing and expenses that you will see more in the third and fourth quarters of the year.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then just lastly, how much of the $0.15 or so from a noncore perspective is sort of frontend loaded or is that sort of ratably throughout the year sort of $3.5, $4.0 a quarter.","Albert Campbell","No, it\u2019s sort of frontend loaded. I would call it 40-30 15-15 if I were modeling it, Rob. And that\u2019s just because half of that is people, that are staying with us to help us integrate these systems that are identified as interim or part time. And as their projects are completed and they began to roll off, you will see that come down. So I would go with 40-30 15-15 range.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our next question from Nick Joseph. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Just want to go back to one of the previous questions to clarify. So Same Store revenue for the combined company is 3% to 3.5%. How do that breakdown between Post and MAA legacy portfolio.","Albert Campbell","MAA legacy portfolio for the full year - well, two things at segment, at the beginning of the year Post is starting up lower, but for capturing synergies and things by the end of the year they close that gap, so they\u2019re still below but the gap is much tighter. So full year call it between 0 and 50 basis point spread that time we done at the end of the year.","Nick Joseph","Okay. So just to clarify Post is zero to 50 basis points dilutive throughout the year at different place.","Eric Bolton","Yes.","Thomas Grimes","And Nick, this is Tom, one point to add is that the Post portfolio represents about 25% to 30% of our total Same Store portfolio, so that can help you do the balancing that.","Eric Bolton","Good point.","Nick Joseph","Perfect, thanks. And then Eric, I\u2019m just wondering what are your thoughts on the DC market and if it\u2019s a long-term market for you.","Eric Bolton","To be determined, I would tell you, Nick, we\u2019re pretty excited about the properties that are there. We\u2019ve been up there visiting with the teams and getting familiar with the properties or great assets, great locations as you know that DC market is starting to show some signs of recovery, and for the foreseeable future we are enthused to be there and believe it will be a nice complement to our portfolio and don\u2019t have any plans to make any changes.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Eric Bolton","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Kim","Thank you. It sounds like supply growth is peaking for the most part of this year. But I\u2019m wondering if there are any market that you\u2019re in where you think supply growth may be at risk of accelerating in 2018?","Thomas Grimes","John, it\u2019s Tom, I think, you will see a little bit of supply growth in Austin, Nashville, and Atlanta that that tends to be more in the urban core area, we are not exposed to that in Nashville, we will see a little exposure to that in Atlanta, and light exposure to that in Austin. You are talking probably about 1,000 to 2,000 unit bump in the each of those markets.","Eric Bolton","John, this is Eric, I will tell you that I think based on just again, I\u2019ve had a lot of conversations with developers over the last several months. And it\u2019s a consistent message that financing is very difficult, right now. And I mean equity capitals available but the financing is difficult, and on that basis it\u2019s hard for me to see supply trends in 2018 being certainly any worse than what they are in 2017. And I would suggest that based on everything that we see right now, we likely we will see supply - I believe in our markets peak this year, and portfolio wide see a little moderation take place in 2018.","John Kim","Can you just - Eric, can you just kind of unwind that\u2019s happening right now with the banks for financing development.","Eric Bolton","Well, I think that there has been a lot more information available and widely sort of put out there suggesting the supply trends and picked up quite a bit, particularly in the high-end of the market, and in some of the more urban locations. And as a consequence of that I think the financing environment has just become a little bit more cautious about funding and financing apartment construction at the moment. And as a consequence of that again, I wasn\u2019t actually in attendance, but I talked a lot of people coming out of the national housing conference last week. And that was absolutely consistent message that financing is very difficult to come by right now.","And we put on top of that the rise in land costs, construction costs, construction labor and particulars become increasingly challenging. It just hard to see at this point, how supply trends begin to elevate in any way from where they are today. And in fact I would - as I said a moment ago I believe they will like to say fewer deliveries in 2018 versus what we are seeing in 2017.","John Kim","Okay. And I think, Tom, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that move onto home buying and single family rental declined this quarter. And I\u2019m wondering how much of that is seasonal or is that market driven as far as the market tightening.","Thomas Grimes","That\u2019s a quarter-over-quarter comparison over prior year. So in other words it\u2019s relative to same time last year. So it take seasonality out of it, so that\u2019s an absolute drop.","John Kim","So what do think this is occurring?","Thomas Grimes","I think the myriad - there is a myriad of reasons out there, and it was touched on in the journal this morning with the new home buying stats, the homeownership rate dropping again, I just think it is people pushing back major life decisions, they are buying homes, they\u2019re getting myriad later, they\u2019re buying homes later, and they\u2019re investing in their pets. And so they tend to want to rent longer and value that flexibility.","John Kim","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Thomas Lesnick","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess first, you mentioned construction financing being really hard to come by. You would think that would give REITs that much more of a cost of capital advantage. And at the same time, you talked about your acquisition opportunities, basically looking to buy recently developed assets.","So I\u2019m just wondering, what is the calculus in your mind between doing development yourself versus buying recently developed assets? How do you measure that risk adjusted return?","Eric Bolton","Well, generally, I\u2019ll tell you Tom, we look to get a little bit better yield, higher yield on the development side, equation given the fact that we are taking on more risk and we also are tying up capital in a non-productive fashion longer. As a consequence of doing a development versus an acquisition. So call it 100 basis points spread or something of that nature, maybe a little north of that is what we tend to often - or tend to look for.","And given where we are right now, we are having a hard time making the numbers work on the development side given the reasons I spoke of a moment ago regarding land costs and construction costs generally particularly construction labor. So we are just - we are not finding - and underwriting as realistically as we can. We really feel that it\u2019s tough to pencil out development right now.","And on the acquisition side there has been likewise hard to make the numbers work, and hard to buy anything other than again the characteristics that I spoke up, which is really everything we\u2019ve bought for last two or three years is some sort of recently developed or development by a regional developer that really doesn\u2019t have the balance sheet or the wherewithal to sort of carry the deal for very long-time, or has impatient equity partner involved in the development that anxious to sort of monetize their investment, and I think that has supply trends continue to sort of come online this year, or new products come online this year.","I continue to be helpful, we\u2019ll find more that opportunity, and give us the chance to buy at a price point that is frankly pretty down close to replacement value, and without the construction risk associated with it. That\u2019s sort of how we think about it right now, and it continue to sort of stick to that level of discipline.","Thomas Lesnick","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Just one more from me. Now that you\u2019ve got your hands on the Post assets, how would you triage the parts of the portfolio for redevelopment? What are the first assets you\u2019re going to consider and what are the metrics you\u2019re looking at on that?","Eric Bolton","Tom, I think, I mean, I pick up on a little bit with triage. I mean, it\u2019s not an emergency situation there in great locations, and they are well maintained. We are really sort of thrilled with the opportunity. And you start with a little bit older assets, but the locations in places like Atlanta and Dallas are phenomenal, and there is a great core of opportunity in those two markets.","And then followed probably by the Tampa assets, and their locations and opportunities. And there is good bit of upside in Charlotte, and DC as well, which I think a pretty much rattled off everything that there is short of Orlando and Raleigh, which Orlando has some opportunity as well, though smaller because the assets are newer. It is really just a get in - get us many test units and as we can do in those various markets, hone the scope and then move forward.","I will tell you it is likely that the opportunity to redevelop on a per unit basis and the Post assets is going to be a little higher than the average 4,500 and we think we\u2019ll get - we will get a larger rent bump for that, because of the locations, we can do more upgrades like in granite and countertops and get a return for them. So we are excited not just in the volume, but in the sort of the bump in the quality, the bump that will get from the Post redevelopment opportunities.","Thomas Lesnick","Got it. Really appreciate that insight. Nice quarter, guys.","Eric Bolton","You bet. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard Anderson","Thank you. Good morning. First of all, congrats on moving to NAREIT-defined FFO. I for one appreciate that a lot. I hope more REITs follow suit. Second is on your AFFO guidance. Is that a quote-unquote normalized AFFO or is that simply - is the difference just CapEx between your FFO guidance and your AFFO guidance?","Albert Campbell","Second, Rich, it is FFO guidance less than normal recurring CapEx pull out.","Richard Anderson","Okay. So you still have the merger costs and the debt mark to market in the AFFO?","Albert Campbell","Yes. You would take the $5.22 midpoint plus $0.15 and that would be more normalized FFO, yes.","Richard Anderson","Got you. You mentioned 30,000 units in redevelopment sort of cross hairs, roughly one-third of the portfolio. How long do you think it\u2019ll take to kind of get through that chunk of activity?","Eric Bolton","I would think that three to five years or better. We are very disciplined about the volume that we put through the pipe, not from a scalability production, but we think it\u2019s vital to test the units side by side with non-renovated units. So that we can look you guys in the eyes and be confident that we\u2019ve gotten the return and we tested it against a unit that is not renovated and that return if real.","So for that reason it takes a little bit of time, but we rather go steadily and know that we\u2019re getting the return then get out there. The other thing is that Rich is that we do these as apartments come. We don\u2019t force turnover to occur, and I think that protects the economic side, but we did over 6000 years this year. I mean, we\u2019ve looked at may get to 7000 units or something like that. So you can do the math, as Tom said, it\u2019s probably a three or four-year endeavor.","Richard Anderson","So if you did 7000 on your own, will that number actually go up, because you\u2019re bigger company already think it stays in that range.","Albert Campbell","I think it will probably stay in that range, maybe a bit over but yes.","Thomas Grimes","The Post items will be additive, but not\u2026","Richard Anderson","Right. More to choose from, more to choose from. So by the time the fifth year comes along. What\u2019s the pace by which units start to become redevelopable? In other words, this is kind of circular right. I mean, by the time you\u2019ll add to that redevelopment pool. Do you have a sense of what number of units sort of get to a point just because of the process of age become redevelopment candidates.","Thomas Grimes","It really determines - depends on the market and if we feel like there is an opportunity to grow the top line reinvesting, and we\u2019ve done that in some places and others we\u2019ve never revisited again. So I mean, it\u2019s truly asset by asset or market, sub-market by sub-market.","Albert Campbell","I\u2019ll add to that, Rich. In our underwriting for those, we get our returns on their consulted basis with a less than 10 years underwriting with no kick-out value. So it leaves us that opportunity. We choose to do that.","Richard Anderson","Right. And so also the number of tenants have put holes in the walls is also a function that I supposed to, but hopefully you don\u2019t lease to many of those types of people.","Eric Bolton","No. We tightened our screening processes to help with that a little bit.","Richard Anderson","Okay, good. And last question is kind of big picture for Eric. You guys with your Sun Belt interior focus have shown exactly what you want to show which is stability through different cycles, but I\u2019m curious it is forever saying or do you foresee a period of time in the foreseeable future where coastal starts to be a winner again, and you just kind of have to kind of muscle your way through those things or do you think that there is something systemic about the business that puts the Sun Belt in interior locations and better position for a long time to come.","Eric Bolton","Well, we\u2019re a big believer in the Sun Belt in the interior locations for several reasons. First and foremost it starts with really how do we want to - what sort of earnings profile are we trying to create over a full cycle. What sort of earnings profile we\u2019re trying to create over call it a 5 to 7, 8, 19 year horizon, and we think that ultimately, we can optimize that performance - that earnings performance over that horizon by first and foremost focusing our capital in markets where we think the demand is more likely than not to stay stable and or strong, and this region of the country arguably over that kind of a horizon is going to produce some of the best and least volatile job growth over that period of time.","So we like the demand side dynamics in that regional country and choose to allocate our capital within that way. Having said that we understand that these markets like all markets like coastal markets can have supply pressure from time to time, and what we tend to do is just really balance our capital, diversify our capital across this region and in order to try to mitigate some of that pressure. Whether it is both A and B pricing asset or A quality, B quality price assets, as well as suburban and urban locations and that\u2019s what the part of the Post rational for us was the fact that it allows us to further diversify our footprint and further diversify our product and capital across what we see as a very dynamic growth region.","Richard Anderson","So the kind of leading question is, the next chapter of this Company years from now maybe isn\u2019t to like tap into California or more on the East Coast as a means to balance that sort of discussion further or do you - you\u2019re going to stay where you\u2019re at, so to speak?","Eric Bolton","We like staying where we are Rich, and I\u2019ll tell you the other attribute or the other factor that I really think a lot about is where can we take our shareholder capital and create a competitive advantage for it in what is a very, very competitive industry.","And we think that a lot of these markets that we choose to compete in offer dynamics and competition frankly, that we can create a superior level of performance out of those markets and out of that create value. Going to a lot of these more institutionally owned markets with pretty sophisticated capital and pretty sophisticated operators, the opportunity to really carve out a differentiation and carve out a competitive advantage I think becomes much more challenging.","And ultimately, the value proposition is built around creating competitive advantage, holding on to that and then exploiting that. And we think that the region we\u2019re in allows that.","Richard Anderson","Okay, sounds good. Thanks, appreciate it.","Eric Bolton","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Drew Babin","Good morning, guys.","Eric Bolton","Good morning, Drew.","Drew Babin","Couple of quick questions related to market balance, the large markets relative to the secondary markets. Do you plan to use your pipeline beyond 2017 to maybe increase your exposure in the secondary markets by using the [development there] [ph]?","Eric Bolton","What I would tell you, Drew, is really what we\u2019re focused on increasingly is just focusing our capital on the best growth market opportunities or best growth markets that we see across the region that we focus on. And ultimately, it\u2019s all about achieving diversification and balance, such that we create the best risk-adjusted earnings performance we can over the full cycle. So some of these smaller markets that have very dynamic growth characteristics associated with the places like Charleston, South Carolina; Greenville, South Carolina, you\u2019re going to continue to see us focus capital on markets like that.","And of course, we continue to stay interested in markets like Atlanta, and Dallas, and Houston, and Phoenix as well so. So it\u2019s really more a function of where do we think the job growth, demand side of the equation is likely be the strongest, stay very balanced, and then balance within those markets both in more urban-oriented locations as well as some of the suburban or satellite locations, and then also be focused on kind of both an A and the B priced product. And ultimately, we think it sort of creates, as I said earlier, the earnings profile we\u2019re after.","Drew Babin","And also, you talked before about Atlanta and Dallas as two potential markets, where you may manage exposure a little bit after the Post merger. In the disposition guidance for 2017, do you expect that some of those assets might be included in that number? Is there anything specifically that is in there?","Albert Campbell","I think you can assume that some of those acquisitions will come - or dispositions I should say, will come out of those two markets. We are in the process of really evaluating that at this moment. And we\u2019ll have more say on that later this year. But with 14% of our NOI now coming out of the Atlanta area, that\u2019s frankly a little more concentrated than I think we need to be long-term.","Drew Babin","Okay, just lastly on fourth quarter dispositions, what were the nominal and economic yields on those?","Albert Campbell","On the dispositions themselves, sort of the after all CapEx, if you will kind of a cash flow yield on the dispositions is around a 6.2. And I\u2019m sorry, what was the other part of the - or nominal\u2026?","Drew Babin","Just on nominal NOI as well.","Albert Campbell","Yes, it would\u2026","Eric Bolton","Nominal was just over 7, that was for CapEx and [Nashville load] [ph].","Drew Babin","Right. All right, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Omotayo Okusanya","Yes, good morning. Thanks for the details around the guidance. Just a quick question, understand that the $20 million in G&A is built into it as kind of a ramp-up process, but could you talk about just total synergies that are built into the 2017 guidance of the annualized $60 million to $70 million you do expect from the Post deal?","Eric Bolton","Right, it\u2019s a good question, Tayo. So 2017 is primarily focused on capturing the overhead. The biggest impact will be from the overhead synergies of the $20 million. And as you mentioned, it will grow over the year. But by the year-end, we will have captured on a runway basis that full $20 million that we talked about.","And in addition to that, we will have some NOI synergies that we talked about that we will begin to capture more so in the third and fourth quarter they\u2019ll begin grow. And initially they will be focused on the pricing performance, in the revenue section and mostly revenue, a little bit of expense. But it\u2019ll take 2018 to really to begin to see the most of that NOI additional synergy to be to be harvested.","And so, the majority of 2017 is overhead. We\u2019d call it, $4 million to $6 million into our forecast for other synergies, NOI level synergies, and that\u2019s really what we see. And I will have - we also are seeing some balance sheet synergies, because as I mentioned, we got upgraded by S&P and right on the merger announcement. That immediately took our cost down on our financing instruments, our term loans, amount of credit.","And so we expect $2 million in interest savings right off the bat there. So those are really the three that you\u2019ll see the impact in 2017, all three areas.","Omotayo Okusanya","And the total amount of that is what, like $25 million of the $60 million to $70 million you\u2019re expecting or could you just give us a number?","Eric Bolton","I don\u2019t have that total upright, but that\u2019s about the right range.","Thomas Grimes","And Tayo, this is Tom. I\u2019d say about, $20 million to $25 million for everything, including the cost of debt and NOI and overhead.","Omotayo Okusanya","That\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s good. And then second question, fourth quarter results, I mean, some of your secondary markets did experience pretty negative Same Store to NOI growth. A lot of it seems to be driven by just huge increases in operating expense - Same Store OpEx. Could you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s kind of driving some of those big increases in some of those markets?","Eric Bolton","Primarily what you\u2019re looking on the large number like Savannah is taxes to be honest with you, Tayo. And then on the coastal items, with Savannah, Jacksonville and Charleston, you also had some Hurricane Matthew storm mitigation expenses.","Omotayo Okusanya","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Okay. Okay, that\u2019s great. And then lastly, could you just talk a little bit about just kind of January, February trends in regards to asking rents and renewals and things of that nature?","Eric Bolton","Yeah, sure. For MAA average physical occupancy was 96.2% and consistent with last year\u2019s record performance. Exposures, we\u2019re just under 7.2%, which is 22 bps better than last year. And, Tayo, that\u2019s all current vacant plus notices, 60 days out. And blended rents are up 2%, so about in line with where they were in the fourth quarter.","Omotayo Okusanya","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Dennis McGill","Good morning, and thank you, guys. First question just had to do with the guidance for the full year, the 3% to 3.5% of top line. How would that phase through the year by quarter, roughly?","Eric Bolton","That\u2019s pretty consistent with a little increase as you move into the back part of the year, because of the synergies that we talked about on the Post side of the business. But pretty consistent with a little bit of ramping from that.","Dennis McGill","Okay. And then, the number you gave, I want to make sure I got this correctly, the 2.0% blended, that was the fourth quarter number just for legacy MAA?","Eric Bolton","2% on the rent - sorry, Dennis, I was looking at another side.","Dennis McGill","It\u2019s okay. I think you disclosed 2% blended rent growth. I just want to clarify, that was fourth quarter just for legacy MAA?","Eric Bolton","No, it was for the quarter legacy MAA. It was also January MAA.","Dennis McGill","Okay. And then, just for the fourth quarter then, can you split that between new lease and renewal as well?","Eric Bolton","Yes, sure. So new lease and renewal for MAA for the fourth quarter was renewals were 6.1 and then as expected new leases were about 1.4, so you have a seasonal slowdown there.","Dennis McGill","Yeah. And then also for the fourth quarter, any color you can provide legacy Post as far as Same Store metrics there, revenue, NOI as well?","Eric Bolton","Yeah, sure their revenue was 2.3, occupancy 95.8, and rent growth of 2.2.","Dennis McGill","Okay. And then, just last question, more a big picture, as everyone is trying to get their arms around supply and when it peaks, whether it\u2019s this year, next year, mid-year, late year, et cetera, just curious, Eric, from your perspective, when we think about supply it\u2019s beyond just when it\u2019s delivered. There\u2019s a tail to it. There are some rolling effects that take some time to really get back to something more normal.","And wondered from your history and perspective in various markets, how do you think about that tail effect? When a product does come to market, how long does it really take to get back to a balance where the pricing pressure from new lease-ups and then when you cycle those original leases are fully out of the market?","Eric Bolton","Well I mean that how long it takes as a function of how much supply did come into the market, and then sort of how strong the demand side of the equation is, and just obviously ultimately just how strong the absorption is, I think that it\u2019s going to vary, I think that we see nothing at this moment that causes us to believe that the demand side of the equation and demand dynamics are showing any signs of weakening.","And so I think that if you take a market other than Houston where the demand side of the equation did in fact collapse, and so you take a market like Houston where it was the demand side of the equation that disrupted the calculus of what was happening in that market that\u2019s a two-year kind of a process, I think, to kind of work through it as you wait for weak demand to take on what supply had been built up.","You take a market like say Nashville that\u2019s been getting a lot of supply, but also having great job growth dynamics there. I think Nashville will see broadly is likely going to see a little weaker year this year.","But, again, as I was saying earlier the supply side of the equation looks to be showing signs of sort of tapping the brakes, and as long as the demand stay strong. I would think a market like Nashville is back sort of back on its feet in 2018, no problem. So it just varies on those variables a little bit, but I think broadly speaking the markets where we see supply has caused moderation to occur. Absent any disruption on the demand side of the equation and absent any sort of acceleration of supply trends. I think there\u2019s reason to believe that 2018 shows a little more strength in 2017.","Dennis McGill","As you think about 2017 just in from first half, second half, is it fair to say as you guys look at that revenue pressure, most of that has already been felt from supply and you feel like the pricing pressure now has stabilized, which allows you to see pretty stable growth through the year?","Eric Bolton","Well, I think you have to kind of roll through it. We\u2019ve had a number of new lease trends that have been under pressure for a while. And ultimately it starts to have an impact on the renewal pricing as well, but so I think that - I think we\u2019re going to see the pressure really throughout the course of 2017 and then by the time you get to early 2018, I think depending on the market, you could begin to see the pressure lesson. And as we sort of get a new lease pricing back on a healthy trajectory, and new lease prices kind of a leading indicator of what\u2019s happening.","And right now the indication generally is more negative than positive, and I think it\u2019s going to take the better part of this year to sort of get that trend reverse.","Dennis McGill","Okay. Sorry, so just last follow-up, I promise, but I want to make sure I understand this correctly, then. If you\u2019re assuming that new lease pressure does take some time through this year, then the fact that revenue growth is stable pretty much through the year is really only a function of the Post synergies, so absent the Post synergies, you\u2019d see deceleration otherwise?","Eric Bolton","Well, yes. I mean, we would definitely see deceleration this year otherwise. There\u2019s no question about it, I think for all the reasons that we\u2019ve just been talking about, I mean new lease truck trends are not as robust this year as they were last year, and ultimately that will mitigate what we\u2019re able to do on renewals at some level. And so I mean the market conditions do suggest deceleration this year, and we are feeling that.","And I think that our situation is a little bit unique in that we do see some opportunity in the Post side of the portfolio that probably helps to mitigate some of that pressure and creates, what appears to be a more consistent performance year-over-year.","Dennis McGill","Okay. That makes a lot of sense. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Dennis.","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our next question from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Conor Wagner","Good morning. On the Post assets, what is the [Technical Difficulty] this year?","Eric Bolton","I\u2019m sorry, Conor, you broke up there. We didn\u2019t hear that question.","Conor Wagner","The impact of redevelopment on the Post assets this year, how much will that contribute to revenue growth in that portfolio?","Albert Campbell","I think about $1 million for the year for the full-year, I think it will take time for that program to ramp up and be as fully productive, as we expect it to be in 2018 and even going forward, but we\u2019ve got, call it $1 million addition in 2017.","Conor Wagner","Great. Thank you. And then what is your guys overall forecast for job growth for the year and how do you see that trending?","Eric Bolton","Well, broadly speaking, it seems like the economists generally are sort of gathering around an expectation of 150,000 to 200,000 jobs added a month, and we continue to believe that our markets in the south east, south west regions will get a good healthy component of that. So on a macro basis, we think that the employment trends in 2017 are pretty consistent to what we\u2019ve been seeing in 2016.","Conor Wagner","Great. Thank you. Then Eric, earlier you talked about taking shareholder capital to markets where you have competitive advantage. How does DC fit into that outlook for you?","Eric Bolton","Well, I also talked about the fact. We\u2019re trying to create a balanced earnings profile and I think that the DC market has dynamics associated with it that are different and offer some diversification for us, and so we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate that market and meanwhile harvest the opportunity that both of those assets that have some redevelopment associated with it and the recovery in that market have to offer harvest that opportunity for capital over the next couple years and then we\u2019ll evaluate from there.","Conor Wagner","Great. Thank you so much.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Conor.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Wes Golladay","Good morning, guys. You mentioned that 14% in Atlanta might be a little too much. What is your optimal limit for a market and over what time do you think Atlanta will get to that level?","Eric Bolton","I would generally tell you that once you get above 10% of the portfolio in a given market. I think it starts to create some nervousness at least on my part. So there is no magic to that. I think to some degree a 10% or 12% allocation in a given market. You have to also look at sort of how you diversify from a price point perspective yet, they look at how you diversify from a submarket perspective, you\u2019ve to look at what is the redevelopment opportunity that may or may not exist in that portfolio. So there is a number of factors that we think about.","But I think that once you get to 10% I really start to challenge our thinking a little bit in terms of by doing more in that market and we have to have enough diversification there to support it. but I would think that for us, it\u2019s probably a couple years or so to make that transition.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And looking at some of the one-off assets, it looks like you\u2019re buying into supply. How much competition are you seeing for these assets? Are some of these retrades?","Eric Bolton","Almost every one of them are retrade, and we still see - it\u2019s not, I mean, it\u2019s not as many people in the processes I will say a year or two ago, whereas when a product will come to market there will be 12 people in the tent, now there\u2019s five or seven. But I can\u2019t think of a deal that we bought for the last two years that wasn\u2019t a rebound transaction where the deal had been on a contract before.","Wes Golladay","And what are your thoughts about Houston? Would you buy more into that market now that you\u2019ve reduced your exposure?","Eric Bolton","We would, we would. We believe long in the merits of Houston long-term, its I think a much more diversified market that has been historically obviously still a lot of oil & gas there. But yes, we\u2019ve got capacity to do more Houston should the opportunities present themselves.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thanks a lot and congrats on closing the merger.","Eric Bolton","Thanks.","Tim Argo","Thanks Wes.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Buck Horne","Hey, good morning, guys. Quick question for me on the balance sheet. Just thinking about now that you\u2019ve closed the deal and successfully you kind of rerated the balance sheet here. Do you think about utilizing a little bit more leverage potentially to drive some acceleration in the growth if you can do so without jeopardizing the new ratings you\u2019ve got? Is there any wiggle room to potentially use a little bit more leverage going forward?","Albert Campbell","Hey, Buck. This is Al. We really want to protect the strength of our balance sheet for sure. We like who we are. It\u2019s big part of our - cost of capital is very important to produce some returns that we need for our investors. So we like that, so no significant change there.","I will tell you that this year if you take the amount of investment from the acquisitions we plan to make, funded with dispositions and internal capital. We are leveraging up a little bit, call it, between 50 to 100 basis points, still well below 35% debt to assets. So it\u2019s really very safe place to be.","And I\u2019ll tell you as you move into 2018 with development funding likely to decline some that will probably trickle back down a bit as our internal cash flow and earnings growth, internal cash flow picks up and even grows from there.","So summary of that is we like where we are. It may fluctuate a little bit around where we are as we execute our business plan, but no significant changes in that.","Buck Horne","Okay. And maybe following that with the internal cash flow you guys are looking to drive this here, how do you think about the payout ratio for the dividends? And maybe longer-term what your target might be for the payout ratio?","Eric Bolton","Well, the way we look at is from a long-term perspective is what sort of growth rate in the dividend do we believe are our business model really supports. And right now the way we think about it, we think that we\u2019ve got a model and a portfolio in place that will sustain sort of a core 6% earnings growth rate over a long period of time. I mean, it will fluctuate a little bit year-over-year, but broadly we think we\u2019ve got a business model supports that kind of 6% growth rate.","And ultimately we think that, keeping the payout ratio kind of where it is, then by definition would mean kind of an annualized 6% growth rate in the dividend. Now, as a consequence of some of the things that we\u2019re doing with this Post portfolio and driving down our cost of capital, I mean, we may very well see our growth rate, I hope, start to improve a little bit beyond where it is right now.","But ultimately, I think the dividend is more a function - and the growth in the dividend on a sustained recurring basis is more a function of sort of core organic growth rate of earnings that the company is supposed to - you know we don\u2019t think about it so much in terms of payout ratio.","Buck Horne","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Nicholas Yulico","Thanks. Dallas is one market that screen says is having a fair amount of supply under way. What are concessions like in the market? And are you seeing an impact to your pricing power yet?","Thomas Grimes","Hi, and Dallas is one that I probably should have mentioned as far as having supply come on board. We\u2019re in net effect of rent shop, so the numbers that we have been giving you on our rents have been inclusive of concessions. So I mean you\u2019re seeing some people use them from time to time, half month or a month, something like that.","But it is - we\u2019ve had relatively good results in Dallas thus far. But I think that\u2019s one that has - we\u2019ll be facing some supply headwind in 2017.","Nicholas Yulico","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just last question, as you think about your Same Store expense guidance this year of 3% to 4%, is that growth likely to come down as you get into 2018 as you get some of the property-level expense synergies from Post? So that let\u2019s just assume here, Same Store revenue growth is the same next year, is this year we\u2019re likely to see better same store NOI growth just from better expense growth?","Eric Bolton","I think it will be two areas you may see it come down, Nick, in the future. One is real estate taxes. If you look at our expenses this year and what our guidance is, all the areas of our expenses other than real estate taxes are well under control. Taxes, which are about 30%, 35% of our operating expenses are the one pressure point, really Texas, Georgia, Tennessee in this year continue to be some pressure in those areas.","So I think that\u2019s the one thing to consider. That over time hopefully will come down. And Texas in particular is very aggressive. Think about Texas as backward looking thing. 2016 was a good year, there were a lot of transactions that support a low cap rate, so we expect values to push that. And the other areas we expect to be pretty modest under control. And I do think as we move into 2018, 2019, we will see some capture from the Post side, which will hopefully blend the other areas, repair, maintenance and some of the other areas down as well. So in general, you\u2019re correct with taxes and merger success.","Nicholas Yulico","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our next question from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Austin Wurschmidt here. Just wanted to touch on acquisitions a bit, and what markets kind of screen to you that you would like to improve your diversification in terms of the balance of A and B product you have or urban-suburban exposure? And then also what does guidance assume in terms of the net contribution from acquisitions? If you could provide any color there, it would be helpful.","Eric Bolton","Well, I\u2019ll take the first one and let Al do the second. In terms of markets where I think that we may see some expansion, some growth and opportunities presents themselves with a market like Charlotte, where we don\u2019t have a lot of exposure to the downtown more urban-oriented centers of Charlotte. Most of our locations are suburban. And a lot of the supply pressure is taking place in Charlotte right now is more of the downtown, fringe downtown areas.","So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see opportunities come out of that market, that fit the need that we have, somewhat similar story in Raleigh. And then also as Tom mentioned, Nashville is another market that I feel like offers that opportunity. A lot of stuff going on in Nashville right now, downtown, The Gulch area, where we have no exposure to. And we like the performance dynamics of Nashville long term. So those are three that come to mind offhand.","Albert Campbell","I\u2019ll just add the spread for the year is pretty straightforward and simple in our model. We\u2019d start from March through, say, November of the year, pretty even spread, a deal a month, something like that. Also I mean there\u2019s no science to that other than the spread that even as we feel the activity will likely be.","And then I\u2019d say, on the disposition side that\u2019s different. We have basically two waves that we expect something midyear and something later in the year, similar to what we did this year. That\u2019s particularly how we do it.","Eric Bolton","And one thing to add on acquisitions, Austin, we\u2019re assuming about 40% of those deals would be these lease-up opportunities that Eric\u2019s talked about. So the blended yield may be perhaps a bit lower than a stabilized yield initially.","Albert Campbell","In 2017, growing 2018 and\u2026","Austin Wurschmidt","That\u2019s helpful. And then are you assuming that those get funded on the line or would you guys look to do a potential bond deal at some point in year to kind of pay - or cover the gap I guess in the dispositions and acquisitions?","Albert Campbell","Yes, initially certainly funded on the line. We look at the line as our liquidity for us to have flexibility move as we want to in acquisitions. And then we move tactically throughout the year to - they have been working perfect. From our maturities to our capital plans, we\u2019ll do one bond deal a year and use our line of credit to manage around that. And so that\u2019s kind of what we are thinking for 2017.","We did postponed a deal we\u2019re going to do late last year. That\u2019s kind of just moving into 2017. So we will likely early to mid-year be in the market potentially for fairly large deals to pay down our line of credit and to fund those acquisitions and development.","Austin Wurschmidt","That\u2019s helpful. And then just last one for me. Other income has been an item that has moved Same Store revenue around a bit and been a tailwind at certain points as well as a headwind. What do you assume in terms of growth in other income? And is there any opportunity there within the Post portfolio to drive other income?","Eric Bolton","Broadly, and Tommy add some components to that. Broadly what we see in 2017 is, because of the components of other income, it\u2019s going to grow a little slower than our rent growth. And so that\u2019s why what you saw in the fourth quarter, we had revenue growth of 36. We had effective rent growth of 39. So some of the components of that are cable projects, are utility reimbursement program. They don\u2019t tend to grow as fast or rents to some parts of the cycle. And so, that\u2019s actually taking our revenue going down just a bit in 2017.","Thomas Grimes","And, Jordan, where I would say the opportunity on the revenue side, on the Post is a sort of pricing practices, pricing management. We feel like there\u2019s upside opportunity there despite the market and we believe the redevelopment is a real material opportunity. Those are fundamental and those are long-term, and we\u2019re excited about those opportunities.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer portion. I will now hand it back over to your speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Tim Argo","We don\u2019t have any further remarks. Appreciate everybody for joining the call.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s program. We\u2019d like to thank you for your participation.

At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin.","Tim Argo","Thank you, Steve. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO.","Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the safe harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34-Act filings with SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results.","These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures.","Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.","[Operator Instructions] Thanks. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.","H. Eric Bolton","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter performance was strong, as favorable leasing conditions supported solid rent growth and continued strong occupancy, which along with good expense control, generated net operating income that was ahead of our expectations.","As outlined in our initial guidance for calendar year 2014, momentum and operating performance increased during the year. Continued healthy leasing conditions, coupled with the growing benefits harvested out of our merger, supported the strong results that we expected over the back half of the year.","Our merger integration activities are complete, and our focus is now fully attuned to further refining and enhancing our platform. The company is in a solid position as we look forward to 2015.","As we ramp up 2014 with record earnings, I want to say to our entire team at MAA, thank you for your hard work and great efforts over the past 18 months to make our merger successful. Your efforts have our platform in a strong position and we have a great opportunity ahead of us to generate increasing value for our residents and shareholders.","Solid revenue performance during the fourth quarter was driven by continued strong occupancy as average daily occupancy for the same-store portfolio was 95.5% or 40 basis points ahead of the prior year.","Resident turnover remains low with the number of move-outs during the quarter, as compared to prior year, down slightly.","Move-outs to buy a house were down 4.5% during the quarter.","Taking a brief look at specific market performance for the quarter, Atlanta was our strongest market generating 7.6% revenue growth, with Houston, Dallas, Phoenix and Austin also generating good results.","Within our Secondary Market segment of the portfolio, Greenville, South Carolina, generated strong growth in revenues at 7.3% over the prior year, with Savannah and Charleston also continuing to post solid performance.","Looking at 2015, continued strength in employment trends across the Sunbelt suggest that despite projected higher levels of new supply coming online across a number of markets, rent growth prospects should continue to be above long-term trends.","As outlined in our 2015 earnings guidance, we are forecasting revenue growth in the 3% to 4% range. We expect to be able to hold occupancy and capture the bulk of this performance from growing rents.","Looking at the ratio of forecasted job growth to new apartment completions coming online in 2015, we expect to see our strongest performances out of Atlanta, Fort Worth and Phoenix.","With steady improvement in new job growth forecast across a number of our Secondary Markets and continued modest levels of new supply, the ratio of job growth to new supply suggest that we should see also improving results from this segment of the portfolio in 2015.","We expect to see good performances this year from Charleston, Fredericksburg, Greenville, and Savannah.","As noted earlier, we have completed our most significant merger-related activities with all properties now on the same property management, revenue management, payables, accounting and management reporting platforms. The combination of adopting best on-site operating procedures and full integration of MAA's asset-management programs, coupled with benefits from a larger scale and synergy, resulted in an 80-basis-point improvement in operating margin from the Legacy-Colonial portfolio over the course of 2014.","In addition, we captured a 30-basis-point improvement in the operating margin in the Legacy MAA portfolio during the year. At the time of our merger, we expected to generate combined NOI operating synergies of $0.05 to $0.11 per share, and now expect to fully capture the top end of this range.","In addition with the organization now fully integrated, we expect to fully capture the anticipated G&A and overhead expense synergies of $25 million, or $0.32 per share, which is fully reflected in our guidance assumptions for 2015.","Our redevelopment program continues to generate strong rent increases and long-term value. During 2014, we completed renovations of just over 4,500 units, which was a meaningful increase from the almost 2,600 units in calendar year 2013.","We expect another big year of redevelopment in 2015, and are targeting in excess of 4,000 units with the much heavier emphasis on the Legacy-Colonial properties. In total, we believe we have 15,000 to 20,000 units of redevelopment opportunity within our same-store portfolio, and expect this program to be a multiyear contribution to earnings performance and value growth.","As outlined in our guidance for 2015, we expect another active year of property dispositions and are targeting to sell $350 million to $425 million of properties, an increase from the $250 million of sales completed in 2014.","Our capital recycling activity this year as compared to prior year will have a much heavier emphasis on multi-family assets and specifically legacy MAA properties located primarily in tertiary and select secondary markets.","We expect to complete this disposition activity in the first half of the year, as we move to take advantage of current market conditions. Our transaction group is also busy with the increasing level of acquisition opportunities coming to market. As noted in the earnings release, we closed on 3 acquisitions in the fourth quarter, which were located in Atlanta, San Antonio, and Houston. We closed another acquisition in Kansas City in January.","As one of the largest platforms focused exclusively on the Southeast and Southwest, a strong balance sheet with ample capacity, experience to efficiently execute for sellers and developers, and a focus on maintaining an active capital recycling program, we continue to be presented with a growing number of attractive new investments.","We're estimating $400 million to $500 million of acquisitions in 2015, slightly ahead of the $400 million closed in 2014.","We expect the opportunities to increase over the course of the year from both new, newly stabilized properties as well as properties that are still in their initial lease-up. We also continue to look at opportunities to prepurchase to-be-built properties and Phase II expansion of existing properties, but expect that at this point in the cycle, this will be a more selective component of our capital deployment activity, as we begin this year with $73 million of new development underway versus just over $200 million at this time last year.","So overall, we expect a busy 2015 with continued stable leasing conditions and active capital recycling effort and a focus on further enhancing operating margins as we fine-tune and improve on a number of merger-related projects that were completed during 2014.","We continue to feel good about our strategy and are excited about activities underway to further strengthen the platform. We look forward to another good year in 2015.","That's all I have in the way of comments. I'll now turn the call over to Al.","Albert M. Campbell","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's fourth quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally, on our initial earnings guidance for 2015.","We had strong earnings performance in the fourth quarter, which produced record levels of FFO per share for both the quarter and the full year of 2014. FFO for the quarter was $107.4 million, or $1.35 per share, and core FFO, which excludes certain unusual or nonrecurring items was $104.7 million or $1.32 per share, which was $0.06 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance.","Solid operating performance during the quarter from both our same-store and non same-store portfolios produced about $0.03 per share of this favorability, with another $0.03 per share coming from favorable G&A and interest costs during the quarter.","The majority of the G&A savings during the quarter came from reduced insurance costs as lower current claims and revised projections for health insurance, workers' compensation and general liability insurance impacted both the current costs and year-end accruals.","Since we've now owned the Colonial portfolio for 15 months, we transferred the Colonial communities to our actual same-store portfolio during the fourth quarter. However, full year comparisons for 2014 continue to be presented on a pro forma combined basis in our release, as we did not own the Colonial portfolio for the first 3 quarters of 2013.","For the fourth quarter, the same-store portfolio produced 5.6% NOI growth over the prior year, based on a 4.2% growth in revenues and a 2.1% growth in operating expenses.","As Eric mentioned, solid pricing performance and strong occupancy continued through the fourth quarter, producing 3.6% growth in effective rent, with an additional 40 basis points of growth coming from higher-than-average occupancy -- higher average occupancy during the quarter.","On a pro forma combined basis, same-store NOI growth for the full year was 4.2%, based on a 3.4% growth in revenues and 2.1% growth in operating expenses. And the majority of increase in operating expenses for both the fourth quarter and the full year was related to real estate taxes, which increased 5.8% for the full year of 2014.","During the fourth quarter, we invested a total of $191.8 million in 3 new communities acquired, located at Atlanta, San Antonio and Houston. We also funded an additional $11.7 million of construction cost from development communities, with an estimated $12.3 million remaining funding to complete the 2 communities under construction at year end.","During the fourth quarter, we sold Colonial Promenade Huntsville, a 23,000-square-foot retail center as well as Town Park Moreya, a 25-acre plot of undeveloped land, both acquired in the Colonial merger.","Combined proceeds of $12.3 million were received from these sales, and recorded net gains of $200,000 on asset sales during the fourth quarter.","The only significant financing transactions during the fourth quarter were the assumption of a $40 million loan related to the Atlanta acquisition, and an amendment to a $150 million term loan, which effectively added an additional 3 years to the loan and reduced the borrowing spread by 25 basis points, taking full advantage of our strong credit rating.","At the end of the fourth quarter, our balance sheet remains in great shape. Total company leverage based on market cap was 37.3%. Our fixed charge coverage ratio was about 4x, and total debt to recurring EBITDA was 6.4x. Over 96% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rate, and 67% of our assets were unencumbered at year-end. Also we had over $460 million of total cash and credit available under our unsecured line of credit at year-end.","Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2015 with the release. Core FFO was projected to be $5.09 to $5.33 per share or $5.21 at the midpoint, based on average shares and units outstanding of about 79.5 million shares.","Core FFO per share is expected to be between $1.23 and $1.35 per share for the first 3 quarters of '15, and $1.28 to $1.40 per share for the fourth quarter.","The primary driver of 2015 performance is expected to be same-store NOI growth, which is projected to be 3% to 4% based on a 3% to 4% growth in both revenues and operating expenses.","We expect operating expenses to continue to have some pressure from real estate taxes, which are projected to grow between 4.5% to 5.5% for 2015.","We plan a significant amount of transaction activity in 2015, as we recycle older assets and continue to dispose of commercial and land assets acquired from Colonial.","We plan to sell 300 to 350 of multi-family communities in 2015 and an additional $50 million to $75 million of commercial and land assets. We expect to reinvest these proceeds and\/or excess cash generated from operations into $400 million to $500 million of new multi-family assets. We also expect to begin a limited number of development projects during the year, consisting of Phase II expansion opportunities at 2 of our existing properties. And we also anticipate that we'll identify one additional opportunity on a prepurchase basis of a new development project during the year.","Given the interest-rate environment and high demand for apartment assets in the current market, we believe the majority of the property sales will occur early in the year, and we're projecting about $250 million sales in the first quarter and the remainder $150 million or so in the second quarter.","We project about $90 million of new acquisitions in the first quarter, really representing one deal that's already closed in January, and one additional deal currently well into the contract process.","Other than these, we expect the remainder of the acquisitions to occur over the back half of the year as transaction volume continues to grow and opportunities expand, which is reflected in our 2015 guidance.","We expect dilution during 2015 from both the initial loss of NOI yield or spread from selling older assets and buying new, as well as from the timing of the reinvestment, and as outlined in our earnings release, our current projections for 2015 includes dilution-related recycling plans as well as the new development projects mentioned earlier.","Keep in mind that on an after-CapEx basis or cash flow basis, the dilution from this recycling is much smaller, as the initial spread between the older, higher capital needs assets we are selling is much closer to the yield on newer assets being purchased -- only about 25 basis to 50 basis points spread.","Other key assumptions in 2015 include plans to refinance about $400 million of debt maturities in the fourth quarter and combined G&A and property management expenses for 2015 of $56.5 million to $58.5 million, reflecting the full synergy capture forecasted from the merger.","Our current plans do not include the need for any new equity during 2015, and we expect to end the year with leverage defined as net debt to gross assets of 40% to 42% or 1% to 2% below our current leverage level, which is a very strong position given our lower risk or limited development strategy.","That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments, Steve, and so now we'll turn the call back over to you for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rich Anderson from Mizuho Securities.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","So can you break down the disposition-related dilution, the $0.19? You said, it's kind of a combination of timing and cap rate. When you look at the multi-family amount that you're selling, the $300 million to $350 million, how does those cap rates compare to new? Is that the 100 basis points or are you taking into account the commercial as well that you can see that spread?","H. Eric Bolton","I think, that spread is everything included, but primarily multi-family is driving that, Rich. And these assets, they're pretty close. So let me break that down for you. $0.19 that we outlined in the press release is made up of $0.16 from this recycling effort and $0.03 from development. So just putting development, and development's just carrying that capital during the year on the new projects that we talked about without having the earnings yet. The $0.16 is really $0.10 per share from the NOI spread loss, both the multi-family and the development that we will have. We're selling assets that are older, higher CapEx needs that have about a 8% NOI yield. We're buying assets that have a 5% to 5.5% NOI yield, so that's a 200 to 250 basis points spread. But let me point out, that's on an NOI business. When you look after CapEx, as we talked about, these are -- these older properties are 1,000 to 1,300 unit on CapEx, and so that makes that spread, call 25 to 50 basis points, much tighter. But we're showing the impact on FFO in this, so $0.10 from that and then $0.06 really from just timing of these transactions -- selling the assets, we talked about having activity early in the year and really reinvesting over the back half of the year, so hopefully that gives you your...","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. So but you're selling multi-family assets at an 8 cap -- NOI cap?","H. Eric Bolton","NOI yields, an NOI yield, that's before any CapEx. So that's...","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","I got you. I got you. I understand, but it's still a pretty big number. Okay. And what about the commercial stuff. You think, looking at -- those are -- it seems like $50 million to $75 million is just basically all of it?","Albert M. Campbell","We had a little bit of all of it, it's all the operating assets. We have one joint venture. We still have -- it's very, very minor left, $250,000 or so. But, yes, essentially all the operating commercial assets will be sold here in the first quarter.","H. Eric Bolton","We just have land left.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, when you look further out, not that I'm asking for 2016 guidance, but when you look further out, I mean, do you think that this is the last kind of year of this significant recycling downside to your numbers, are you kind of cleaning house of at this point? Or do you think, you will be a net seller for many years to come as long as cap rates stay where they are at.","Albert M. Campbell","No. I'll tell you, Rich, I mean, we see a window of opportunity right now to harvest capital out of a lot of older assets that we've owned for a long time that we feel offers a great value opportunity. So we're going to -- we're jumping on that opportunity. And we're going to move on it pretty aggressively early in the year. I think that, ultimately we're not interested in trying to overhaul the portfolio. There is not some sort of major transformation going on here. We still feel very much committed to our bifurcation between large and secondary markets. It's really just harvesting out of some smaller assets and the window of opportunity right now is very strong. So we're looking effectively to match-fund acquisitions with this effort. And we'll see how the market conditions continue to hold up. But if the market conditions continue to support an opportunity to pull capital out of assets that we feel like the after CapEx performance is going to -- over the next 10 years, not be as robust as alternatives we can find in some newer assets then we will continue at a pretty good clip, but it all -- it's a tough time to be a buyer as you know. And of course, relate -- this late in the cycle, frankly, piling a bunch of money into development is not something that's real high interest to us as well. So we'll just see how the reinvestment opportunities pan out. We're optimistic that we'll get it done. And -- but to suggest that we've got some sort of major overhaul, a major recycling that we're going to be doing for quite some time, I think is an overstatement.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","So would you -- how much of the $300 million to $350 million is legacy MAA assets?","Albert M. Campbell","About 99%.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Is that right, okay. Interesting. You mentioned -- you just used the term late in the cycle, what do you mean by that?","Albert M. Campbell","Well, I think that we're at a point where a lot of supply is coming into the market and developers are pretty active. And I mean -- at this point, I mean the demand side of the equation supports it, but as we know, I mean this business, I still fundamentally believe has a cyclicality to it that we have to be mindful of, and we've been in a very healthy period for some time. And so I would argue that, that we're on the peak or the back end of the cycle to some degree. And I think that it's hard to see anything that's going to completely weaken anything materially in the near term, but I do believe that given the level of new supply coming into the market, that us ramping up a big development operation is certainly not the thing to do. And I'd rather just be an opportunistic buyer of this product coming into the market.","Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, just lastly, what do you do -- you said above trend rent growth, what do you define as trend?","Albert M. Campbell","Rich, we'll answer this, and then we're going to jump to another question. But I would tell you that trend for us is going to be at right around 3%, and -- so I think we'll be a little bit better than that.","Operator","Our next question is from Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess, Eric, I just wanted to go back to that comment you just made about where you think we are in the cycle. I wanted to probe to see if you feel that way about the secondary markets. They haven't participated in job growth, they didn't grow as much as the bigger markets did last year, and there was a really nice pickup here in the fourth quarter? So would you clarify those comments just to say -- do you feel differently about the secondary markets in those terms?","H. Eric Bolton","That's a good point, Karin. I do feel differently about it for a lot of reasons you just mentioned. I do think that these secondary markets have clearly not seen the level of robust job growth, and they're clearly not seeing the level of new supply. And this is why we have them in the portfolio, because we do believe that as conditions eventually moderate in some fashion that these markets tend to not move off this sort of steady-state level as much as you sometimes see in the larger markets. And just to clarify sort of the comment, I don't anticipate, by any means, that we're going to see any material deterioration or any sort of material weakening beginning to take place in the apartment real estate fundamentals. I mean, we've got too many favorable sort of macro variables, demographics and all the things that everybody knows about -- attitude towards home ownership and all those other factors that are really going to, I think, propel a very strong demand side performance for some time. But I do believe that just as a consequence of the sector continuing to attract a lot of interest and capital, supply is going to continue to pick up, and the job growth improvement trends will begin to moderate at some level. I mean, we're not going to go to 3% unemployment, and so there will be some level of moderation that will eventually take place. So I think that over the next couple of years, it's hard to see anything absent of recession or absent some sort of cataclysmic event elsewhere that really causes the economy to retract in a meaningful way. It's hard to see anything causing a significant weakening in apartment fundamentals over the next 2 or more years.","Albert M. Campbell","And then, Karin, on the secondary markets, jobs to completions improves to about 13, and we see job growth really is the key factor in these markets driving it. It will move from 14 and 16 [ph] to 2015 at 25. And we've certainly been happy with the performance of Charleston, Greenville and Savannah. It's just a matter of getting a few others some job growth and getting them off the mark.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Thanks for the color.That's helpful. My second question is just on revenue growth for 2015. Can you talk about what revenue growth you've already earned into the rent roll? And what type of ability you've seen to push rents here early in the year in 2015, just what the post quarter trends have been? And have you seen any impact in your tenancy with the decline in gas prices?","Albert M. Campbell","Karin, this is Al. I'll cover the first part and let Tom cover the second portion of that. But if you look at our overall portfolio and our forecast, we think we have about 2% sort of baked in or earned in based on the contracts we have in place and the current pricing of the marketplace. So we feel good about our projections for the year, and that's pretty strong. And then on top of that, we expect to get -- to get to our mid-point of our guidance, we'd need similar pricing over the remainder of the year and capturing that back half. And I'll let Tom...","Thomas L. Grimes","Yes. And Karin, blended rates for January on a year-over-year basis were 4.4%. That's up 63 basis points from January of last year and exposure's about 50 basis points lower. We're seeing higher traffic as well, so very encouraging trends as we move into January.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And -- or do you think gas prices have -- had any impact yet?","Thomas L. Grimes","Karin, I think that everybody is enjoying having a little bit more money in their pocket as a result of that. And we believe that, that will benefit for us down the road. Our rent to income ratio is very low at 16%; this just helps this. Does it make a difference today in our sort of lower demand part of the cycle? I don't think so. But it will have a compounding effect as we get into the year.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just one last quick one. Can you just tell us what the accretion was from the development that you completed in 2014 and 2015?","Albert M. Campbell","When we -- you mean in terms of how much is contributing to the forecast or the guidance in '15 overall?","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Correct, yes.","Albert M. Campbell","Yes. I'll just break that down real quick. I guess the main components driving our earnings, are same-store portfolio, which is adding about $0.23 per share from the midpoint of our growth. Then there's about $0.15 to $0.18 per share that's going to be added from our non same-store portfolio, which includes recently acquired deals, this development, which is a big part of it is the development coming to fruition, Karin, you're talking about, and those things all coming together about $0.15 to $0.18. And then obviously, you got this $0.16 per share from recycling offsetting that to get you down to our change for the year.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So large chunk of that, $0.15 to $0.18 is development. Okay.","Albert M. Campbell","Yes, obviously we have 5 deals undergoing at the end of last year, or 4 -- excuse me, and a large part of that is productive this year.","Operator","And our next question is from Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So quick question on your same-store revenue guidance. I just want to make sure I understand this correctly. The current same-store revenue out that you have does not contemplate the dispositions in it, is that right?","Albert M. Campbell","The dispositions -- our portfolio has been pulled out of our same-store, Haendel, because we -- when we target them, we pull them out so that we can have a consistent same-store portfolio throughout the year. So yes, it does not include that.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got you. Okay. And then, curious on -- you haven't given, I don't think, new versus renewal trend specifically for 4Q and January? And what you're asking for in February, March?","Albert M. Campbell","Yes. Sure. On a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter, new leases were up 4%, which is about 40 basis points higher than prior year. Renewals were up 5% for a blended of 4.7%. Going -- looking forward on renewals, January, we asked for about 8%, we got 7.3%; for February, we asked for about 8% again and got 7.1%. And then, in March, it was 6.5%.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got you. And a couple of quick follow-ups. I guess, your thoughts on Houston from an investment perspective. I heard the other day from a peer of yours, looking opportunistically for development opportunities there. Just curious on your thoughts there in terms of acquisitions, potential dispositions given what could present some -- the dislocation -- expected dislocation that could present some opportunities in Houston over the course of this year and early next year?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, Haendel, this is Eric. We like Houston long term. We think there are going to be some good opportunities emerge over the course of this next year. And we're going to continue to be active in the market looking for opportunities. I absolutely agree with the point.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And what was the move-out of the home buying during the quarter?","H. Eric Bolton","It was down from 21 to 20, Haendel, I believe. Yes, 21 to 20, down 4.5%.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. I'm just curious, Eric. As you sort of look ahead, we've heard from some of the builders here that they're feeling a bit more bold up [ph] it sounds -- starts estimates are up 20 percentage year-over-year, credit is slightly improving. It's certainly painting the picture for a slightly more competitive headwinds from the for sale markets and given your footprint and a lot of where the builders are expected to build, just curious on what your thoughts are for that competitive dynamic as we roll through this year into next year?","H. Eric Bolton","I'm sorry what -- and that was the competitive dynamic associated with apartments or...","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The fit for sale single-family?","H. Eric Bolton","Single-family, I'm sorry. Okay. Haendel, we continue to not to be worried about mounting pressure from single-family. I think that -- yes, that, I mean, you know all the dynamics surrounding people's attitude and people putting those decisions off later and all the sort of issues that go with that. I mean, we continue to believe that, ultimately a strong single-family housing market ultimately is a good thing for the economy and ultimately is a good thing for the apartment business. I think the job creations that come out of that, particularly in this region of the country, tend to drive positive things for the economy, the trickledown effect of a healthy housing environment has -- continues to -- we think ultimately create positive implications for demand for apartment housing. And to give you just a perspective on that, I mean, if you go back to sort of the 2006, 2007 time frame, where arguably the single-family housing market was at a fairly robust level, we were generating some of the strongest rent growth we've ever generated in our 21-year history with rents on average year-over-year going up 5%-or-so. So we think that a vibrant housing market is a good thing.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I appreciate that. I was just sort of looking back through my notes here. It looks like the move out of for home buying you said this quarter were -- you said were down to about 20%, is that -- if I heard it correctly?","Albert M. Campbell","That's right.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It looks like over the course of last year that was more in the low-to-mid teens?","H. Eric Bolton","I mean, last year it was 20%. It was -- 1,842 moved out for home buying versus 1,759. Now, Haendel, it will change by quarter. So, it's a little higher actually in the fourth quarter I think than it was in the second, as people who are trying to get into houses right at the end of the year due to their closings. But the trend for the year and the trend for the quarter is down.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'll stick to the 2 questions here. Just first question in terms of your assumptions for 2015 for revenues, what is the breakout between primary and secondary markets, so if you look at the 3% to 4%, what would you expect for the primary versus secondary? And also in terms of rank, what would you assume in those?","H. Eric Bolton","I think, probably on a rounded basis from the primary, probably 4%, and the secondary, closer to 3%. And so, that gives you the 100 or maybe a little over, spread between -- through the year, so that's the assumptions in general that we put in, Mike.","Albert M. Campbell","And the bulk of -- and the revenue growth will largely come strictly from rent growth.","H. Eric Bolton","Yes, pricing is...","Albert M. Campbell","We plan to hold occupancy fairly consistent.","H. Eric Bolton","Actually, I give a little -- we plan to give a little bit occupancy back about -- only about 10 basis points, because we do expect turnover to increase just a little bit with the job market, Mike, but in general, it's pricing this year.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Second question. Eric, it was a bit of a surprise to see the big pickup there in the acquisition forecast, just given the aggressive pricing we're seeing both -- even in the Sunbelt [indiscernible] right now. Can you just give us a little color where you're sourcing that? Have acquisition cap rates or IRR targets changed at all? Or is your growth forecast increased enough to offset that?","H. Eric Bolton","No. I mean, cap rates haven't really moved, Mike. It just continues to be a consequence of -- frankly, we're seeing more activity just as more of this new construction comes on line, developers are increasingly -- we're finding anxious to pull their money out of the deals that they've either just started or just started leasing. And they want to pull the money out and get -- and start another project as soon as they possibly can. So I think just as a consequence of not wanting to miss out on this window of opportunity for the next 2 to 3 years of what is expected to be very good leasing fundamentals and a good time to -- as a developer arguably to try to bring something online. We're just seeing a lot more transaction volume; it's starting to really pick up. It hasn't really manifested itself in any way that we've seen in increasing cap rates. There is still a lot of cap out there. But just as a consequence of the volume and then as I said just given our focus on these markets now for as long as we've been in, and I mean, we're seeing a lot of deals that are on an off market basis, deals that had fallen out of contract. I mean, a number of these deals that we just closed on, had all been on a contract previously. And we had been tracking the process and they came back around; for whatever reason the deals fell out. So it's really just a volume-related sort of thing that we see creating -- growing opportunity and that's what's really driving it.","Operator","And our next question is from Buck Horne from Raymond James.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to go back to the question about Texas, maybe just a little bit more broadly in your thoughts about future investment allocations to the entire state, just given the overall energy outlook with Mid-America's exposure being a little bit elevated. How do you think about not only just Houston, but Fort Worth, Dallas, Austin? Have you seen any signs yet of rising turnover or bad debt in any of those Texas markets' job turmoil?","H. Eric Bolton","Buck, I would say just quickly, no, we haven't seen anything in our numbers from a bad debt or rent trends or anything that would suggest any weakness at this point. But broadly speaking, I mean, we continue to feel very good about the Texas markets overall. Houston being only 3% of our NOI, we feel like that we've got room to expand our presence in Houston frankly and not really create too much of a concentration risk broadly speaking for the portfolio overall, and to give you a perspective on this, just -- where we're surrounding oil pricing and any particular weakness coming out of Houston, if we saw, as an example, instead of 3% NOI growth out of Houston, if we saw 0% NOI growth out of Houston in our portfolio, the impact for us over the course of a year will be less than a $0.01 a share for FFO. So it's just not a worry for us generally on this question surrounding Houston and oil pricing and so on and so forth. But having said that, I mean, we continue to believe the Texas economy, just the pro-business environment there, great quality of life, great standard of living, low cost of living, lack of state income tax and the way that, that economy continues to track businesses out of the Northeast, off the West Coast is going to continue to cause Dallas and Austin, San Antonio and Houston continue to be a very prosperous place to do business. And now having said that, I mean, our current investment allocation from a portfolio perspective to both Dallas and Fort Worth and Austin are -- is fairly full. You're not going to see us grow our presence much in those 3 markets from where we are today, and we will be doing some recycling I'm sure over the next several years. But in terms of growing our presence given our current size, we'll likely -- unlikely to grow a lot more there. Houston's a market where we feel like we do have some growth capacity and same with San Antonio.","Albert M. Campbell","And Buck, just some local coverage in Houston. Of our properties there, we only have one in the energy corridor. It has about 25% exposure of employment to oil and gas. On the economy front, job transfers are up, which we view as a healthy reason, up 9. They've lost 1 job in the last 60 days and delinquencies improved by 10 basis points. So -- and frankly pretty healthy fundamentals, if you didn't read the press and you just looked at the numbers, we -- Houston looks pretty good.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That's a very helpful answer, very thorough. A quick follow-up, though. Given your earlier comments about you are seeing developers get a little bit more aggressive, supply is certainly ramping particularly in some of the primary markets, I'm kind of thinking of places like Austin and Charlotte as well, would you look to potentially downsize or reallocate capital away from markets that you think may have excess supply pressure over the next couple of years? Would you reduce your exposure to some of these primary markets in advance of some of that supply delivery?","H. Eric Bolton","Yes. I would tell you, Buck, that we'd be unlikely to move a bunch of capital out of a given market, because what we worry regarding a 2-year window, where supply may be a little bit excessive. I mean, when we buy these assets and deploy this capital, I mean, it's sort of a full cycle mindset that we go in with. And so, I think that what we typically do when you see markets get a little bit sort of out of balance, it's a time to think hard about any sort of fine-tuning that you want to do from a recycling effort as a result of rotating out of some older assets and the newer assets or things of that nature. But sort of wholesale changes to market mix and market allocation as a consequence of periodic supply issues is not something that we think we should be doing.","Operator","Our next question is from Dave Bragg from Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Eric, can you please elaborate on your statement that you'd look for opportunities in Houston. How are you adjusting your underwriting? And what change in values or cap rates do you have to see to account for lower growth prospects in that market?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, Well, I think, obviously we would be pretty cautious right now in terms of rent growth outlook for the next couple of years or so. I mean, the deal that we closed on in November, this was located in Northwest Houston. It's exactly adjacent to the new Hewlett-Packard Campus that employs 10,000 people. It's half -- less than half a mile from Houston's Northwest Medical Center and Saint Luke's Hospital. And so we feel good, but given Houston and the concerns that we all know about, I mean, I think we assume 2.5% rent growth the first year and pretty modest for some time. I think that when -- I think we have to see how this plays out, Dave, to understand the likely -- how bad it gets or how we can may -- it may become. I believe that it's probably likely that this doesn't persist much more than a couple of years, and I don't think we can get back to $100 oil, but I don't think we stay at $40 either. So -- and of course, the Houston economy has continued to diversify itself a little bit over the last 10 years or so, and we think that between the healthcare industry and logistics and shipping and the port activity, that Houston has got a vibrant-enough economic base, absent oil and gas, that it's not going to just be anywhere close to sort of the same level of pressures that you see in a market like Washington, that is so influenced by federal employment levels and federal government trends, I think Houston has got a little bit more of a diversification to it. And so I think that this is possibly a good time to buy. But at this point, I can tell you that some of the things we've been looking at, we haven't seen any worry come into the pricing yet, and we may not be able to buy down there, given the continued healthy appetite that capital has for multi-family in general including in Houston, so it's just a -- it will continue to be a wait and see. And obviously, if we close any deals this year, we'll be glad to talk to you about it.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second question relates to the possibility of being an opportunistic buyer. You've spoken about that in the past, given that potential for overbuilding in some of your markets. Should we see a material change in asset values, both in the private market and the public market, could you talk about how well positioned you believe the balance sheet is or will be to allow you to take advantage of those opportunities?","Albert M. Campbell","Yes. I mean, Dave. This is Al. We certainly feel that our balance sheet is in very good shape to take advantage of opportunities. And I'd point back to a recent time in history in 2009, '10 when it happened, we certainly didn't have nearly as strong a position or balance sheet and took great opportunity of it then. We think we're much better prepared today. And if those opportunities come forth, I mean, we have plenty of capacity, great relationships across the debt spectrum and we've worked hard on our equity programs, have ATM in place, have issued equity under overnights' prepurchase deals, all kinds of tools or methods in place. So we feel very good about our ability to raise capital to do that, and we'll certainly opportunistically be in a position...","H. Eric Bolton","And Dave, I will add. I mean, we're generating more free cash flow, if you will, than we ever have as a company, and we're selling more assets than we've ever sold as a company. So I mean, if we do a $400 million to $500 million acquisition volume year -- this year, which is the most we've ever bought in a given year, and we're doing it without issuing a $1 of equity, I think it gives you some sense of our capacity to handle opportunity.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last question relates to the potential opportunity on the revenue side from lower gas prices. What are the strategic conversations like internally? Is this something that you just watch happen and you feel as though you'll reap the benefits or do you think that you can adjust yield star and push more aggressively on renewals than you would add $100 oil and capture a benefit proactively quicker?","H. Eric Bolton","And we are -- David, what we're doing is watching demand over the sensors and then maximizing that. So we feel comfortable that if there is the ability to push rents, our system and our approach to the system, it's not just the system, but it's the way you monitor it, would allow us to maximize that as it happened, if that make sense. In other words, we don't dial it in for macro changes in the marketplace, but we are accurate enough to exploit those when they occur.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And your portfolio is one of the most suburban portfolios of the apartment REITs, and with gas prices already down significantly, are you pushing harder on renewals today than you would have at $100 oil?","H. Eric Bolton","Dave, renewals went out at 8%, that is aggressive and that was -- that we feel like is what the market will bear. We are not adjusting ours for $100. We are adjusting it for how many people are moving out, how many people are looking. And we would expect resident quality to improve, we would expect delinquency to improve. But our residents aren't really folks that are right living on the edge, it's a matter of seeing the opportunity and exploiting the opportunity.","Albert M. Campbell","And the 2 metrics that we've monitored probably more than anything else about, are we pushing hard enough or not too hard, is really move-outs due to rent increase, and then, of course, the rent to income ratio in the portfolio. And both of those metrics are very supportive of being pretty aggressive right now on rents. And as Tom says, that's exactly what we're doing.","Thomas L. Grimes","And we're also monitoring take rates and conversion rates. And if those go up, our price goes up. And if those goes down, our price goes down. Or we figure out is there a non-price reason for that and we attack our operation and refine it from there.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Lesnick from Capital One.","Thomas James Lesnick - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","I know you guys already talked about move-outs to purchase home already, but obviously, not everyone is in a position to buy a home. So I'm just kind of curious what percentage of your tenant base rents by choice and what percent of your tenant base, whether it be by savings, income or credit, really has no choice but to rent, and how has that trended over the last, call it, few quarters?","Thomas L. Grimes","Yes. I won't be able to answer that directly. I would tell you 100% of our residents rent by choice, because they probably have other options available to them. With a rent to income ratio of 16, that's improved; at sort of the bottom of the cycle, that was as high as 20. And if you figure that, a bank is going to want what 25% down or the ability -- not 25% down, but the ability to -- the PNI is less than 20% to 25%, we feel like you've got a huge chunk of those renters who are choosing that option. I think it's more a lifestyle choice honestly, Tom, than I think it is an affordability choice. I think with a booming economy, there are folks who are interested in being close to jobs and close to good retail centers and value the flexibility of a lease and the services that our teams provide.","Thomas James Lesnick - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","All right. Great. And I guess, shifting back to large versus secondary markets, I know you talked about limited supply and some of the secondary markets being later to the recovery. I'm just kind of curious to what extent income growth is limiting growth in those markets? And I guess, how the rent to income ratio differs between some of your larger markets and secondary markets?","H. Eric Bolton","Yes. And I don't have it for this quarter, but historically, affordability has actually been a little better in the secondary markets.","Operator","Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a couple from us. Gentlemen, you did mention again in the new supply kind of starting to come online in some of your markets, can you just kind of identify the markets where you are most concerned about new supply?","H. Eric Bolton","Sure, Tayo. And I think it's more kind of an improving situation, where we're still monitoring Raleigh, which is 7:1. It is -- it's working its way out with stronger job growth. And Austin is worth monitoring as well at 5:1, but again it's been very resilient and largely our properties, which are more suburban in Austin, have not borne the brunt of the central core area. And then in Dallas, we have light exposure to the uptown with 1 property and 2 properties in Las Colinas, which you're seeing a little supply [ph] .","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then from an acquisition perspective, with the Gables transaction now done, are there any other kind of fairly large portfolios out there that kind of would fit thematically what MAA would be interested in buying?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, yes, there are a few opportunities that bounce around from time-to-time, and as we usually take a hard look at them. But I will tell you that in most cases, there's usually 2 issues that we find tough to get over. One is usually there is some asset quality in that portfolio that is -- that would be really a step back for us, that we find is not really worth the effort to try to bring in the portfolio and then turn it all around and then try to sell it. So usually there's asset quality issues. And then secondly, often, particularly in these private funds or private portfolios, usually have in-place financing that is not as attractive as the financing that we're able to put on and you usually have to bring the debt with it. And so ultimately, it creates an opportunity that is not as attractive as the opportunities that we're finding focused on fairly new product, fairly recently built, new or to-be-built product that we can come in and put the right debt structure on -- right financing structure that really keeps our balance sheet where we need to keep it, and really, we think materially more so improves long-term asset quality. So we'll continue to look at them, but we generally find there's usually something about it that is as not particularly as attractive as what we're doing otherwise.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then just one more from me in regards to the Colonial portfolio. Just at this point, is there still any additional synergies you expected to kind of get out of that portfolio or it's been optimized at this point?","Albert M. Campbell","I'll just say, Tayo, if you think -- look at our guidance for the current year or for 2014 and our performance, we captured a lot of those synergies in the back half, third and fourth quarter particularly on the expense, so I think on a quarterly run rate, we feel like the expenses are pretty fully captured. There is a little bit of revenue left to capture, and I'd say we'll feel a little bit in the first and second quarters of next year, probably 2\/3 out of the 3 quarters and all that opportunity has been captured on a run rate basis in Q4 though.","Albert M. Campbell","And I would also tell you, though, we've talked about having 15,000 to 20,000 units of redevelopment opportunity in the portfolio. The lion's share of that is the Legacy-Colonial asset base, and that's something that we'll be doing over 4,000 units this year, so that's something that we think over the next 2 to 3 years that we'll continue to capture in the way of a sort of opportunity out of this merger. Frankly, it's a bigger opportunity than what we initially thought it was when we went into the merger. So we -- as Al said, a lot of it has been sort of captured and we've sort of permanently, if you will, improved margins as a consequence of that. We do think as we get towards the latter part of this year, we'll start to sort of normalize, if you will, and some of that lift out of the merger starts to dissipate just as a consequence of year-over-year comparisons, but the redevelopment component will continue for some time.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Oppenheim from Zelman & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the -- those revenue expectations for 2015 again. You talked a lot about the expectation for some better results from the secondary markets. Do you think that -- how comparable do you think you will end up seeing the revenue growth in terms of the large versus secondary markets in 2015? And given your comments about the cycle, do you think we'll see a sort of switching point in terms of better performance from secondary?","Albert M. Campbell","Well, I'll answer the first part and probably Eric will answer some of the cycle comments, but just in terms of what is in our forecast and expectations for 2015, we're calling for something like 4% revenue growth, maybe a little bit higher from the large markets and around 3% for the secondary markets blending to our average for the year at midpoint of 3.5% in our range.","H. Eric Bolton","And I would tell you that as the cycle continues to mature, we typically do see the performance delta between the large and secondary market start to close a little bit, as a consequence of supply pressure picking up more actively in the larger markets versus the secondary markets. And then also typically the secondary markets are a little later in the recovery in terms of the job growth front. So we do believe that if you want to assume and contemplate sort of a flattening or a moderation at some level, we typically see the performance delta between the 2 segments start to flatten out. Now to really get into a situation like we had back in 2008, 2009 time frame, where our secondary markets were actually outperforming our larger markets, you have to get really much more into a severe sort of recessionary-type environment, because in those kind of situations, the large markets really get hit pretty hard as a consequence of more severe job loss and then more often than not, those markets have also been oversupplied relative to that.","[Audio gap]","Dan Oppenheim","Got it. And then, on acquisitions, your recent acquisitions there in Atlanta","[Audio gap]","or do you think about given that there will be some of the legacy MMA assets likely in some of the secondary markets, would you think about sort of keeping the balance in terms of the weightings of large and secondary?","H. Eric Bolton","Yes. We absolutely are committed to staying broadly sort of balance 60% weighting of the portfolio in the larger markets and about 40% in the secondary markets. What you're seeing us do is technically pull out some older assets, where we feel like the after CapEx yields are likely to begin to show more severe moderation than what we would be able to achieve with some newer investment. As it so happens, given the history of our company, a lot of the older assets that we own are in some of the more tertiary markets of the Secondary Market segment of the portfolio, and thus, that's where the focus is at this moment in terms of harvesting capital out of these investments. But we will be absolutely committed to redeploying in the larger markets as well as secondary markets as we go forward. Unlikely we'll do tertiary markets, but I mean we will","[Audio gap]","We feel very committed to keeping a presence in those markets.","Operator","Our next question is Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","I was hoping if you could talk about the range of move out to buy ratios within the portfolio, sort of what markets you're seeing rent versus average cost of owning per month parity, where moving into a house is more just a financial decision versus markets where it's more of a lifestyle choice that involves commuting, things like that?","H. Eric Bolton","Yes. I would tell you, Drew, it really -- it appears to be -- to us less about that and more about vibrancy of the economy. Where we see home buying the highest is where we see job growth the highest. And where we see home buying the lowest is usually where job growth is the lowest.","Drew Babin","Okay. And one follow-up on the balance sheet. In terms of refinancing your 2015 debt maturities, there's certainly -- it's a lower number than we saw at this time last year. Will you be -- is the plan to kind of do all that in one larger unsecured bond or are there other sort of unsecured debt options that you're looking at vis-a-vis term loans, things like that?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, we certainly have a lot of -- the full slate of options available to us, Drew, but I think most of that debt matures in a fairly tight grooving, the end of the third quarter. So we have about $370 million maturing. We're going to pre-pay a couple of more loans. So probably, in terms of placeholder [ph] expect us to be looking for about $400 million to $450 million of financing, I think, likely best option at this point is a public bond, a 10-year deal in that range, which if we did that today, it's probably, call it 3.3% to 3.5%, on a 10-year basis, something in that range.","Operator","Our next question is from Carol Kemple from Hilliard Lyons.","Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","I just have a couple of questions on the developments. Earlier you talked about 2 properties where you expect to do some Phase II expansions at. When do you expect to break ground on those?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, we have just broken ground on one of them. And the other one would be later this year, probably third, fourth quarter of this year.","Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Okay. And then, you talked about buying one property that was probably still in development. Do you -- have you identified that property at this point?","Albert M. Campbell","No, we have not.","Operator","Our next question is from Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just one quick follow-up. What do you think the growth differential is going to be between the assets that you're going to sell this year and the assets you're going to buy?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, I think, as part of that NOI yield spread, I think is the answer to that question, Karin. And I think we're going to sell assets, though they have a high NOI yield now, they're probably expected to grow over the next couple of years between 0 and 2%, and what we're buying is we're expecting to grow probably 4% on average.","Operator","Next, we have a follow-up question from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-on along the same line as that Karin was asking. You mentioned earlier on that in regards to where we are in the cycle, the secondary or tertiary markets still feel like they're earlier in the cycle, they haven't kind of gotten the same kind of improvements that your primary markets have. But yet when you take a look at your acquisition and disposition activity, it's the stuff in the secondary markets that's being sold, when they are probably at the earlier -- or where hopefully they're about to just kind of go through the same kind of market improvement that the primary markets have gone through over the past few years? So I'm just kind of -- if you could just reconcile those 2 things for me, or why sell secondary when they haven't received the same boom that the primaries have and they should as the economy improves?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, because it's an optimum time to maximize sort of value capture out of -- pulling out of those markets, frankly in the sense that -- on the financing front. I mean, we're getting decent, if you will, NOI growth. I understand the point you're making that maybe next year or the year after is slightly better, but arguably, I would tell you that the financing environment that supports the capability to exit the investments on an attractive basis is better now than I've ever seen it. And I think that in an effort to sort of really harvest the best IRR and the best return on capital and create the most value for that capital, we think better to trade off a little current earning, if you will, in order to pull the capital out and get it redeployed into an investment that we think long term is going to likely create a better yield and a higher yield and a better return on capital. So it really is -- I understand the point you're making, but conceding, if you will, $0.19 of earnings this year is not something that we take lightly, but we think it's the right thing to be doing for value creation long term.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.","H. Eric Bolton","No closing comments here.

Thank you for participating in the MAA Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.","At this time, we would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Wolfgang. Miss Wolfgang, you may begin.","Leslie Wolfgang","Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Corporate Secretary for MAA. Tim Argo, our VP of Finance who normally introduces our quarterly earnings call cannot be with us this morning as he and his wife are awaiting the birth of their first child. We're excited to welcome the newest addition to the MAA family and we send them all our best.

Third quarter performance was strong and record high performance in both core, FFO and AFFO per share. The results were driven by record high effective occupancy and solid rent growth producing an 8.1% increase in same store NOI on top of last year's very solid NOI growth of 6.8%.","After a busy couple of years of merger and integration activities, the MAA team has our operating and reporting platform in a strong position. I want to express my thanks and my appreciation for their hard work and tremendous results.","Leasing conditions across our Sunbelt markets continued to support high occupancy and solid rent growth. We believe our strategy in diversifying capital across this high growth region with a production and a price point focused on serving a broad segment of the rental market enables MAA to capture the strong demand of the region, while mitigating to some degree new supply pressures.","We continue to see positive leasing momentum across the portfolio, job growth in most of our markets, particularly in the large market segment of the portfolio, coupled with management levels of new supply particularly in our secondary markets should combine to produce another year of positive leasing and pricing trends in 2016.","As outlined in our recently published report by the Urban Land Institute on the Gen Y generation and their housing preferences, positive demographic trends should continue to generate growing demand for apartment housing, particularly in our Southeaster and Sunbelt markets.","As outlined in the ULI study, a clear majority or 62% of this renter demographic identify themselves as residing in the south and west. Interestingly, the millennial group also described themselves as being essentially equally weighted in their focus on living in the city versus living in the suburbs, and importantly, only 13% of this millennial generation, according to the ULI study identify themselves as living in or near downtown areas.","In our South-eastern markets, it's important to remember that a lot of the employment centers and more appealing entertainment venues that create proximity demand for apartment housing are often located in more suburban or satellite municipalities and not in the downtown CBD or heavy urban submarkets, and further with the median rent for the Gen Y group at $925 per month per the ULI study, we believe our product holds appeal in terms of price point and as a result is well positioned to attract this larger renter demographic.","Overall, we continue to believe MAA's focused portfolio strategy reconciles very well with this growing renter profile and supports our goal to deliver superior full cycle performance. The meaningful reposition that we've accomplished with the portfolio over the past five years is making an increasing impact as we've continued to recycle capital from some of our older investments and captured attractive internal rates of return upon sale, we've been able to repopulate the portfolio with newer properties that have enabled us to capture a steady improvement in NOI margins, particularly on an after CapEx basis.","Over the past five years, MAA's same store NOI margin on an after CapEx basis has improved 590 basis points. We expect to capture continued improvement in margins as our lease-up pipeline, new development pipeline and redevelopment pipeline continue to drive higher margin performance into the same store portfolio.","On the transaction front, robust deal flow and strong investor appetite continues to generate a lot of activity, along with aggressive pricing. We have a number of opportunities we are reviewing and continue to remain patient and disciplined with our underwriting. As you'll note in our update guidance, we have pulled back a little on the volume of acquisitions that we expect to complete this year, but I continue to believe that more attractive buying opportunities will emerge as we work through the cycle.","As Al will detail in his comments, through a combination of asset sales, internally generated free cash flow, reworking our credit facility and further deleveraging the balance sheet, we have added more strength to the balance sheet and meaningfully expanded the Company's external growth capacity. We remain poised to execute on attractive opportunities as they emerge. That's all I have and I'm going to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Grimes","Thank you, Eric and good morning, everyone. Revenues for the quarter grew 6.1% over the prior year and 2.3% sequentially. Our record results were driven by a year-over-year increase in revenue per occupied unit of 5.1% to $1,123 and a 90 basis point increase in average physical occupancy.","October trends continue to be steady. Our 60 day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60 day period is just 7.1%, down 70 basis points from the same time last year. October blended rents on a year-over-year basis are up 4.8%.","Overall, expenses remain in line, up just 3%. The only item that ran ahead of expectations was our personnel cost, as the strong revenue results are driving higher than expected performance based compensation. Personnel costs less incentives were up just 2.2%.","On the market front, the vibrant job growth in the large markets is driving strong revenue results. 11 of our 13 markets exceeded 5% revenue growth. They were led by Atlanta, Orlando, Phoenix and Fort Worth.","The secondary markets which have lower supply pressure achieved 5.2% revenue growth. In these markets, we're benefiting from improved job growth as well as a sophisticated operating platform that has competitive advantages across our footprint and markets. Revenue growth in Greenville, Charleston, Savannah and Jacksonville stood out. Turnover for the quarter was again down, decreasing by 1.7% over the prior year, and down 100 basis points on a rolling 12 month basis to 53.3%.","Move outs to home buying were just 19.1% of total move outs and well below historic norms. Move outs to home rentals were down 6% and represent less than 8% of our total move outs. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupancy again paid off. The improvement in average days vacant helped drive the record average physical occupancy for the quarter to 96.6%.","Year-to-date, we've completed 4,200 interior unit upgrades, 2,300 of which were on legacy CLP communities. We're on pace to redevelop 5,000 units this year and expect the mix to favor the legacy CLP portfolio. As a reminder, on average, we spent $4,500 per unit and receive $100 rent increase over our comparable non-renovated unit, which generates a year one return well in excess of 20%.","Our four active lease-up communities are performing well, 220 Riverside is now 70% occupied and 84% leased. It's on schedule to stabilize in the second quarter of 2016. Colonial Grand at Bellevue II -- Phase II, and the Retreat at West Creek, are 92.3% and 94% occupied and will both stabilize in the fourth quarter.","Finally our newest acquisition in lease-up, Skysong in Scottsdale is 89% occupied and on schedule to stabilize in the first quarter of next year. On the customer service front, our recommend score on ApartmentRatings.com, which is currently the dominant rating site for multifamily reviews improved for the sixth straight quarter.","With Eric's comments about millennials in mind, we invite you to take a look at our redesigned website. This platform was built to continue our appeal to millennials in the way they prefer to search. Our URL structures and content management system were tweaked to strengthen our search engine strategy. Simply put, this means our website shows up higher on their search list without paying for higher placement. Once the website was improved our page views increased by five times which gives us more leads at a lower cost per lead. In addition I think you'll find it visually bold and easy to navigate. Al?","Albert Campbell","Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the Company's third quarter earnings performance and balance sheet activity and then on the revised guidance for the full year. FSO for the third quarter was $1.44 per share. Core FFO, which excludes certain non-cash and non-routine items was $1.38 per share. Recurring capital expenditures for the quarter were $15.8 million or $0.20 per share which produced Core AFFO of $1.18 per share providing strong coverage of our $0.77 per share quarterly dividend.","For the full year, core AFFO grew 11.3% over the prior year. The outperformance for the quarter was primarily produced by same-store NOI growth driven by record high average occupancy levels of 90 basis points above prior year and continued strong fee collections. Favorable real estate tax appeals and reduced insurance reserves [indiscernible] claims experience also contributed to the strong earnings performance.","During the third quarter, we acquired two new communities for a total investment of $86.6 million. These purchases bring our full year investment and acquisitions to $244.4 million for five new communities containing 1,409 units.","We also funded an additional $10.5 million on development costs on our four communities under construction during the quarter leaving only $54 million of the $120 million total expected cost to be funded. We expect NOI yields in the 7% to 7.5% range on these communities once completed and stabilized.","We also invested $8.2 million in our interior renovation program during the quarter, bringing our full year investment in the program to just over $19 million for 4,209 units renovated. As Tom mentioned, we continue to capture strong rent increases above non-renovated units, which are projected to produce unleveraged returns of 14%.","During the quarter, we sold three communities for gross proceeds of $121 million and recorded book gains of $54.7 million. These three sales bring year to date dispositions to 21 properties averaging 26 years of age for $354.3 million gross proceeds producing $109 million in recorded gains. The average cap rate for these dispositions was 5.8% based on last 12 months NOI, a 4% management fee and actual CapEx, which produced an average 14.1% return on our invested equity of the full life of these investments.","Our balance sheet ended the quarter in a very strong position, with leverage levels continuing to climb and coverage ratios growing further. At quarter end, our leverage defined as total net debt to gross assets was 39.9%, 140 basis points below the prior year. While our debt to recurring EBITDA was only 5.76 times, a record low for the Company. Our current EBITDA continues to grow and reflect the quality of our earnings profile, covering our fixed charges over 4.2 times.","Following the end of the quarter, we recast our unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing our borrowing capacity to $750 million from $500 million, extending the maturity to 4.5 years and improving the terms to reflect our stronger credit profile. This new credit facility supported by [indiscernible] provides significant liquidity and growth capacity for the Company. In conjunction with the new credit facility, we amended our $150 million term loan also improving terms and extending the maturity date.","For the current year, we expect to produce about $80 million to $85 million of internal free cash flow, which is essentially core FFO less all CapEx and common dividend payments. This is expect to grow just over $100 million for 2016, and given this free cash flow, production and the completed dispositions, our 2015 plans do not include new equity. We currently have over $420 million of total cash and credit available under our credit line, and we expect to end the year with our leverage about 100 basis points below the prior year numbers.","Finally, due to the strong operating performance during the third quarter, we are raising our guidance for core FFO and AFFO for the full year. We're now projecting core FFO for the year to be $5.39 to $5.49 per share or $5.44 at the midpoint representing a 9% growth over the prior year. Core AFFO is now projected to be $4.71 to $4.81 per share or $4.76 at the midpoint, representing an 11.2% growth from the prior year.","Same store NOI growth is now expected to be 6% to 7%, based on revenue growth of 5% to 6% and expense growth of 3.5% to 4.5%. Our expected acquisition volume for the year is now $300 million to $400 million. ","That's all I have. So, now, I'll turn the call over to Eric for closing comments.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Al. MAA's strong performance this year reflects both the favorable leasing conditions across our regional footprint as well as the benefits from our merger with Colonial Properties that closed two years ago this month. The value proposition that we identified at the time we announced the merger including both stated expense synergies as well as incremental revenue opportunities have been fully realized, and are on track to be exceeded.","We believe, we have the portfolio, the operating platform and the balance sheet, all well-positioned for what we expect to be both continued favorable leasing conditions and increasing our opportunities to capture new value growth as we had into 2016. That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Kevin, we'll turn it back to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. For the fourth quarter implied same-store revenue growth guidance of 4.6% at the midpoint, can you walk through the underlying assumptions for occupancy, rent growth and the fee income?","Albert Campbell","Absolutely Nick. This is Al, and I think, as we look at the fourth quarter, the story really has continued, pricing trends that we've seen this year. We're going to have a little tougher comps on occupancy and fees and revenues and that will fall to the bottom line about the 4.5 to 4.6 kind of implied midpoint, pricing in the 4 to 4.5 range. We do expect to pick up a little bit of occupancy year-over-year now from the high levels we have now, but the comp will become tougher and then combine it with the fees that will fall down to the 4.5, 4.6 implied on revenue growth.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Then, can you remind me if the units in the redevelopment program are included in the same-store pool?","Albert Campbell","They are. Our policy is, unless we do a renovation and it substantially disturbs or causes a very lengthy disturbance to the performance we leave it in same store and for annual basis, I think, it would be probably a 40 basis point or 50 basis point impact on a full-year basis each year.","Nick Joseph","Thanks, just last question. I'd like to get your thoughts on the transaction market today, both for the large and secondary markets, if you're seeing more opportunities with stabilized assets or with the presale opportunities.","Eric Bolton","Nick, this is Eric. I would tell you, most of where we see opportunities on the presale -- are sale of pre-stabilized situations or in some cases new development that's trying to get started and looking for capital. We continue to not spend a lot of time chasing after fully stabilized situations. Those are much more easier financed and that's where we see pricing, really the toughest. From our perspective, we're not going to go out and compete in a market based on price. We're looking to capture some value for our ability to execute for the seller, whether it is urgency of close or the ability to handle some complexity or the ability to not have to worry about some the financing issues that often a lot of these buyers in these markets are depending on. So, most of what we're after at this point is pre-stabilized situations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is now open.","Robert Stevenson","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Al, what's the current thinking in terms of property tax increases? I mean, are we past the big increases and they start normalizing over the next year or so and you talked about the incentive comp for employees, anything else expense wise on the horizon that's likely to have a major impact on the same store expenses going forward?","Albert Campbell","I think, those are the two main items Rob and just on taxes, as we've talked about for a while, the pressure that has been over the last few years really from Texas and Florida, as we began this year, Texas came out very aggressive with their assessments and so we dialed that into our number and really worked hard in the field, virtually every property in Texas, and had some favourability in the third quarter because we were successful on that and also as they came out with the actual rates, the millage rates, you have the evaluation and rates, the rates came in a little lower growth than we'd expected as well. So that's certainly benefited the third quarter.","As we talked about in our insurance reserves, we're so self-insured for some of our reserves. I mean, our client experience has been a little better and we thought that benefitted us a little bit. So, those are two things in the third quarter. I don't expect any significant -- I think in the fourth quarter you won't have that credit from real estate taxes impacting the fourth quarter and it's a pretty big component of your expenses, but full year, we expect Texas to rise, 5%. The last year, it was 6%. Next year, who knows, but we would expect as we've been saying for a while, continued slight moderation over the next few years until it eventually gets down to the 3% long-term average that it's been over time, but that may take a couple of years.","Robert Stevenson","Okay, and then in terms of -- the same store revenue growth has essentially been sort of turbocharged relative to the peer group by the occupancy increases this year. I mean, it seems like you're going to be hard-pressed to even keep occupancy at sort of 96.6%, let alone increase it from here. How should we be thinking about same-store revenue growth over the next five, six quarters without the benefit of an occupancy tailwind?","Eric Bolton","Well, Rob, this is Eric. We're not prepared to give 2016 guidance at this point, but what I can tell you is that based on everything that we see, the leasing environment should remain as robust as what we've seen this year. We think that it's going to continue to support very solid occupancy performance. We think that the strong occupancy performance that we've captured this year, we likely will be able to continue to hold it. We don't see any material deterioration in occupancy by any means, and we think that we can do that, while also getting rent growth that's going to be pretty comparable to what we've been seeing this year.","I think that some of the lift that we got this year from merger-related activities will begin to moderate a little bit. We'll hold those performance levels, but an incremental lift will become a little bit more difficult, because we're -- as you say, we're member essentially full. I mean, a lot of the performance lift that we got this year and frankly, some of the surprise in the third quarter was some of the great work that Tom and his team are doing on managing our days vacancy between turns and they've made some significant improvement in that over the course of this year, and again we think we'll carry that going into next year, but incremental improvement will be a little bit more difficult.","Robert Stevenson","Okay, thanks guys.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Rob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Conor Wagner with Green Street. Your line is now open.","Conor Wagner","Good morning. Al, you mentioned that the benefit from the redevelopment activity will be about 50 bps to same-store revenue growth this year. Do you have an estimate for what it was in '13 and '14?","Albert Campbell","Probably similar to that but we've been doing that program for several years Conor. I'd say pretty close, probably a little over, because we'd increased the program this year, but somewhere in that call it, 40 basis point to 50 basis point range [indiscernible].","Conor Wagner","That's helpful and then, on the reduction in frictional vacancy, is there -- is that portfolio wide or is there more of a benefit there with the Colonial Properties?","Eric Bolton","It is weighed a little bit heavily on the Colonial side, but we've picked up improvement everywhere, but weighed a little higher there as our approach to monitoring and managing the components of the average days vacant have come to play on that portfolio.","Conor Wagner","Then just a follow up on that. Is that more -- is it advertising? Is it how you get the unit done? Is the time just based on better leasing or is it better job that you guys are actually doing the work to turn the unit as far as cleaning or any necessary repairs?","Eric Bolton","It's really a combination of those things. We reduced the amount of time that it took to physically turn the unit. That doesn't do you any good if you didn't lease it faster, and we've really had to focus on pre-leasing the unit and locking in those days early. So, we were able to pre-lease a larger portion of our units and lock in a lower timeframe.","Conor Wagner","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thank you, good morning. You guys have talked a lot about aggressive pricing on acquisitions, cap rates, I think you've mentioned it's been in the low 5% range. So, I was just curious about your thoughts on what type of growth you think that apartment investors are underwriting today.","Eric Bolton","I don't know what they're underwriting. I mean, I don't know because I don't know what their return expectations are. I mean, obviously to some degree they're taking advantage of the very low interest rate environment to -- there's a cost to capital benefit that they're dialling into their assumption. So, it's hard to know and of course it's going to vary quite a bit. I think by market and by my property. I think that you can see some of these the more stabilized value add opportunities where there's a repositioning play and I'm certain that people get pretty aggressive on their assumptions as to what they can do there.","You take something that's brand-new whether it's really not a redevelopment or a repurposing of the interiors or anything of that nature and market expectations will vary based on the market and so, I don't know. It's hard to know what expectations are of any particular investor, I mean, from our perspective, you know, we we've been in these markets for a long time. We feel like we have a pretty good handle on what they can do over a long period of time and we apply that logic to any situation we look at, but, it's hard to know what they're thinking.","Austin Wurschmidt","That's fair, and then as you guys are trolling for new acquisitions given your comments on sort of suburban living in your markets, is there any submarkets or anywhere you are particularly focused today on the acquisitions side?","Eric Bolton","We like -- really, we like most all the markets that we're in right now and you whether it's in Dallas, whether it's in McKinney, Frisco, Las Colinas, Plano area but let me also add, I mean, we're also interested in continuing to explore opportunities as they emerge in some of the more traditional downtown or CBD areas as well. As you know, that's where a lot of supply is being delivered into the marketplace and we think that may be very well where some of the best buying opportunities emerge over the next year or so. Ultimately, what we're after is we're after a balance portfolio. We're deploying capital with a long-term horizon associated with it. We're looking to build a portfolio of assets that will deliver steady growing cash flow, and so having a blend of both the downtown, the inner loop, satellite city, traditional suburban we're interested in keeping a balance of all that.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks and then just last one for me is, how did the October rent growth stack up versus last year?","Thomas Grimes","It was about flat with last year at 4.8%, similar to Q3 and flat with October of last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.","Richard Anderson","Thanks. Good morning and great quarter. If I could just clarify the redevelopment impact on same-store is a positive 50 basis points, not negative because of down time?","Thomas Grimes","Correct, and Rich, we only take about seven extra days to do a renovate versus a non-renovate. So that is not much of a drag.","Richard Anderson","Okay. So, now it doesn't qualify for one of my two questions. So Eric, did you have any look or any knowledge of the EQR asset sale and if so can you talk about that and or the benefits in general of just being bigger than you are already today?","Eric Bolton","Well no. We didn't know about it and I'm certain we'd not have been a viable candidate for that transaction. The benefits of being bigger, I mean, within our footprint, we see and know about every deal that comes to market. We certainly are seeing a lot of opportunity and we're getting approached more so than we ever have in the past about not only one-off opportunities but bigger opportunities as well, and I think that just being in the markets that we're in now and being bigger in those markets, I mean, there are certain efficiencies that we have as a consequence from an operating perspective of some of the things that Tom and his team have done, have clearly enabled us to make some headway in terms of our operating margins, coupled with the recycling that we've done. So, I think that there's clearly some benefit that we feel like we're creating for shareholder capital, for both the legacy CLP shareholders and MAA shareholders as a consequence of the scaling up that we've done.","Richard Anderson","Right, but I'm really talking about entity level type, getting way bigger type of as opposed to one off type stuff.","Thomas Grimes","I'm sorry. Are you asking, are we interested in getting way bigger?","Richard Anderson","Yeah.","Thomas Grimes","No. To answer your question, no, not really.","Richard Anderson","Okay, and then to the other side of that, can you comment at all your input on some of the private equity interest in multifamily? To what degree you sense some interest in your stock to any type of color that you can get from the private side would be interesting.","Thomas Grimes","You know, I mean, I think there's clearly a lot of evidence that private capital has a huge appetite for apartment real estate and as evidenced by some of the transactions that have been announced over the last few weeks, I mean, clearly there's a buy into the Southeast markets and there's a buy into not only some of the more urban oriented locations, but suburban assets as well. So, I would just say there's lot interest and we like what we're doing. We like the portfolio that we have. We feel like we're hitting on all cylinders right now, but I mean, clearly there's a lot of interest out there.","Richard Anderson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","John Kim","Good morning. I was interested in your remarks on your prepared comments on the reduced move outs to home rental and home buying. I know it's just one quarter, but why do you think this is occurring in your markets at this point in the cycle?","Eric Bolton","It's been pretty consistently that way this year, honestly. Home buying has bounced in the 18% to 19.5% as a reason for move outs and home renting really never caught hold and is moving back. I mean, it's a large drop percentage-wise but it's not very many units. So, to me, John, honestly, it's a little more of the same old same old.","John Kim","Okay, and then in this quarter, Houston held up relatively well, but with weaker sequential rental growth as your other markets. Have you noticed anything in the last quarter or so as far as increased turnover or slow releasing velocity [ph]?","Eric Bolton","Yes, I'll just give you a Houston update. At this point, it's just 3% of our portfolio and as you point out, it did well. Turnover is actually well down. Turnover for Houston was down 10% with almost -- with home buying at that market dropping significantly. We expect it to remain above 95%, but do expect new lease rents to soften a bit. So, new lease rents are about flat. Renewals through the end of the year are up 4%. That's different than it has been in the prior six months. Job growth there is lower than it's been, but positive for '16 and I think, at this point, absent some sort of recovery in oil and gas with the amount of new supply occurring that you would expect rents to be under pressure for a little while.","John Kim","On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being very concerned and 1 not concerned at all, where would you rate Houston?","Eric Bolton","6, maybe. Something like that. I mean, I don't -- I think we're going to see it soften and on rents I think we'll hold on to occupancy. I can't predict the oil and gas futures market. I just don't have that club in my bag. So, that will depend, but in a long term, we love it and it will produce opportunity. If it drops off further than we expect, it'll produce a buying opportunity for us. We've got plenty of room in our portfolio to add in Houston, if the opportunity is there.","John Kim","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","Wes Golladay","Good morning, everyone. Excellent quarter. Sticking with the topic of softening markets, are there any other markets where you're seeing the initial signs of softening?","Eric Bolton","No. Honestly, Houston is the one sort of worry bead for us at a material level.","Wes Golladay","Okay, and then, with the strong leasing environment, is it harder to negotiate with the developers or are they just still looking to move on to the next project? Can you give us a sense of deal volume and your close rate versus prior quarters?","Eric Bolton","It's been pretty consistent, Wes. I mean, the deal volume is pretty high. Close rates are pretty low. We're seeing a lot of opportunity. I think that, we're going to have to see -- developers are still holding pretty strong right now with their asset pricing. So I think that the fundamentals of being as strong as they are and continuing to be as strong as they are is -- we haven't seen any real movement in cap rates or any real sense that pricing is starting to soften in any way.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thanks for taking the question and keep up the good work.","Thomas Grimes","Thanks Wes.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Wes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Gaurav Mehta","Thank you. Good morning. Going back to the transaction market, can you comment on what you're seeing for the older assets that you have sold so far? Is there room to maybe sell more than what you've sold?","Eric Bolton","We feel like -- I mean, the appetite's very good out there for really any apartment real estate right now, whether it be brand-new or slightly older. Having said that, we took advantage of it and we sold 21 assets year and only picked up five thus far. So, huge net sell this year. We like where we have a portfolio at this point. We exited 11 markets -- 11 tertiary markets. We very much believe in the same strategy that we've had for some time. We like the markets that we're in. We like the split between large and secondary markets. So, we're not after any sort of -- we've done the transformation that we're after and when you look over the last five years, as I've mentioned, we've sold over 13,000 apartments.","So, we've accomplished a lot of the repositioning that we are after. I mean, going forward, we will continue to obviously always look at opportunities to recycle capital where we can create better returns on that capital for the long-term, but we'll be in a position to be a little bit more patient with the process. So, we'll be looking to clearly match fund our acquisition needs with dispositions and so, it'll be a different approach. This year, we stepped up and went ahead and made the decision to pull capital out of a number of assets that we felt like -- in markets that we didn't -- were not really long-term hold for us, but -- so what we're left with today, we're pretty comfortable with.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay, and a follow up on large and secondary markets. If I look at the revenue variants between large and secondary, it seems like it has been converging for the last few quarters. Would you say is that really a function of you exiting the 11 lower growth secondary markets or is there something else going on in those markets?","Eric Bolton","Well, I think it generally is a function of, as we continue to move further into the economic recovery, the secondary markets are starting to pick up a little bit more traction on employment growth. These secondary markets continue to not see the supply pressure volume that you see in the larger markets and so as you may see, if you will, a little moderation take place in some of the larger markets as a consequence of supply continuing to come into those markets.","The secondary markets being a little later to show economic recovery and employment recovery are starting to get a little bit more traction on the demand side of the equation and still are not seeing the level of supply pressure that you see in some larger markets. So, it's playing out as we expect. I think as you get further into the cycle, you continue to see that performance delta begin to close a little bit.","I think you actually have to get into a much more of a recessionary-type environment for the secondary markets to actually outperform. We've see that in the past. We saw that back in 2008, '09 and part of '10. I don't think we're headed back to that kind of an environment, but you never know and that's why they're there.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Buck Horne","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess, Eric, if you could go back to some of the comments you made about the study that you were talking about earlier -- very interesting trends and I'm just wondering, if you've got any data in the Mid-America portfolio that maybe supports some of the stats you're talking about? I mean, have you seen any changes this year in the median age of new tenants? Are you seeing a skew towards younger renters coming in or likewise have you seen any changes in the median income of your new tenants? Are you getting that higher credit quality renter coming in?","Thomas Grimes","Yeah.","Eric Bolton","This is Tom by the way.","Thomas Grimes","Yeah, sorry. Dial it down a second. Tom speaking. I think the Gen Y study by ULI reflected reality, not really a change. So, our rent income ratio has bounced between 17% and 18%, and that's been very good. Average income of $66,000. 50% of our residents are Gen Y and another 15% in that -- or another 20% of that, 35 to 44 group. So, what we're seeing is across all facets of our portfolio, large and small, our reality ties pretty close to what that ULI study shows demographically.","Eric Bolton","But, I will say that we are seeing income levels continue to move up in our portfolio, both as a consequence of improving employment market and frankly, as we continue to improve the quality of the portfolio that we see that happening, but after four or five years of pretty steady rent growth, our rent to income ratios are holding very consistent in that 17% to 18% range. So, by definition of course, incomes are going up at a level sufficient to keep that ratio in line. So, the point obviously in putting some of this information out is just to bring home the fact that we see a lot of appeal amongst this millennial generation for a lot of these suburban locations in the South-eastern markets, and it doesn't all have to be downtown.","Buck Horne","Great. Very helpful, and switching to kind of the financing market. It sounds like the GSEs have tightened up their belt at least through year end on funding some new projects that are out there till they can reset their allocations. I'm wondering if you've seen any changes in pricing from LICOs or pension money that's out there and just how does that balance -- fit with your balance sheet capability and is it possible that you might see some deals come through before year end that you guys can act on, it might give you some upside to the acquisition budget?","Albert Campbell","Well, I'll certainly give you on what we're seeing in the agencies and life insurance companies, Buck and consistent with what you're saying, they've both -- I think have hit their cap a couple of months ago and what we're seeing is a lot of deals that come that are really -- when they get across their desk, they're pushing for January -- January, February. So we definitely -- and yet the life companies are there, but I think given the open window there I don't think they're being aggressive in price to pick up volume. I think they're kind of holding their pricing standards when they're there, is what we're hearing. So, we would certainly expect that there would be potential opportunities. As you say, we still have what, another $100 million this year left to dive into our guidance for our acquisitions. So, we're hopeful that as you move close to year end with that year end point drawing clear, there'll be some people who for a portfolio reason or for some reason want a deal done by year end and our strategy is to have very low-cost and very flexible capital and we certainly have that with our credit facility, $750 million. We have plenty of capital. So, we can certainly take advantage and our leverage is as low as it's ever been. So, if that opportunity comes we're certainly ready to take advantage of that and we think that's possible going forward. I think that agencies we have heard to date, they still will have some commitment to the environment next year and feel good that that will continue to produce support for liquidity next year.","Buck Horne","Very helpful guys. Thank you.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Buck.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Zelman. Your line is now open.","Dan Oppenheim","Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more in terms of the acquisitions here in terms of just looking for more through the end of the year. Is that something where you've some identified at this point or is that where there's a hope that there'll be some where there'll be some sellers with an urgent timeline in the last two months of the year here?","Eric Bolton","We've got one opportunity currently under contract that we're working through due diligence on right now that would get probably close to half of that opportunity should it close, but we typically just over the years have always seen in the last couple of months of the year. People get a little bit more interested about getting something done and we track a lot of deals over the course of the year that we pass on or that we feel like pricing has gotten away from us and often times those deals fall out of contract and then they circle back around and that typically happens the last couple of months of the year. So, we're going to be patient as I mentioned earlier, but we think it's conceivable that we'll get another deal or two done by year end.","Dan Oppenheim","Okay. Then in terms of the disposition environment, I think you did a great job earlier this year in terms of selling based on just the appetite from buyers out there and I heard your comments in terms of being happy and comfortable with the current market position. So, I guess, there's a difference between the content with the supply demand dynamics in a market versus the efficiency site and with some of the secondary markets where it's still pretty small in terms of the overall value there, how do you think about that in terms of the efficiency if this environment continues would you look to sell out of some more of those markets?","Eric Bolton","We feel like we're able to handle the operations of those secondary markets on a fairly efficient basis, because of course, recognize that they're all in the Southeast and so we can get to them all fairly easily, fairly quickly. We have divisional offices in Atlanta and in Jacksonville, in Nashville, in Dallas and in Charlotte, and so you know, it's pretty easy for our folks to stay connected and we don't think that we'd really give up a whole lot in efficiency and we gain a whole lot in diversification, value and benefit.","Dan Oppenheim","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Lesnick with Capital One. Your line is now open.","Tom Lesnick","Good morning. My first question just has to do with the potential for a rising rate environment. Obviously, yesterday people on the Street read through the Fed announcement and the probability of a rate hike jumped up by year end, but some of your private competitors in the Southeast likely need a greater amount of leverage in order to execute deals, and therefore the logic is that cap rates in your markets might be more sensitive to the rate increase. I guess, what's your view on that and since you're the largest fish in the sea, so to speak, does that actually give you an increased competitive advantage for acquisitions?","Eric Bolton","Well, we do think that in a rising rate environment where cap rates get to move up a little bit and financing cost move up a little bit, we do probably net-net get more of a competitive advantage in that environment. I do think that we have seen a lot of fairly large institutional capitalists, institutional investors in most of these markets that we're in, in the Southeast and so these are folks who have clear execution capabilities and strong balance sheets, but as you point out, they are using the financing environment to their advantage right now. I do think that if we do see over the next couple years, that dynamic change a little bit that net-net probably creates more external growth opportunity for us.","Tom Lesnick","Thanks, and then on I saw your acquisition guidance was revised slightly lower at midpoint. Are we to read through on that and assume that maybe that's you guys just being a little bit more conservative at this point in the cycle or how should we be looking at your investment in external versus internal value creation opportunities going forward?","Eric Bolton","Well, I mean, I think the read through on that is just more of a function of what the external market is experiencing as opposed to any change in our part. We've always had a fairly disciplined approach to how we deploy capital. We've got some very defined protocols that we've used for over 20 years and in some market environments, it creates a little bit more of a challenge to find ways to put money to work on a basis that will meet those hurdles because the market's gotten a little bit frothy, which is the situation we find ourselves in right now. So there's no change from our perspective internally on anything that we're doing. It's just market conditions have created that. So that's the point. I'm sorry. What was the second part of your question?","Tom Lesnick","Just, I mean trying to get in that view, would we expect to see you perhaps increase your redevelopment program going forward and look for internal value creation opportunities?","Eric Bolton","Well, we certainly are working that angle of capital deployment as aggressively as we can. I think, Tom and his team are looking at something around 5,000 units this year. We probably will have something comparable to that next year. What we find is that, if we begin to accelerate that or push that in a more aggressive fashion, we typically start to run into a little more vacancy loss and a little bit lower return on the capital when we start to press that agenda much more aggressively.","So, we're going to push it as hard as we can, but we're not going to push it a point we start to compromise returns and we think roughly around 5,000 units a year is about what we can handle without -- and keeping the returns very, very attractive.","Thomas Grimes","And keeping the test correct. I mean, it is very important to us to renovate. It's easy to do a renovate and think that you got it. It's is harder to do a renovate and know that you got the return. So, when we are doing a renovation, we do the redeveloped unit and release it right next to a non-redeveloped unit, and we measure the distance between the two so that we know we're getting a fair return on our capital. If you go too hard, you lose the ability to be disciplined about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Drew Babin","More of a top down question, many of your markets have benefited a lot from just not a lot of new supply deliveries, in kind of the 2010 to 2012 timeframe and elevated supply growth that we've seen in the last few years to really just kind of fill that void. Assuming demand kind of consistent with 15 levels going forward in '16, '17, '18, how much runway do you believe there is before the inflection point where supply kind of just causes some marginal deceleration in fundamentals and kind of what markets do you expect that to happen in quicker?","Eric Bolton","Drew, I've long believed that where you begin to see the dynamics and the chemistry if you will in the leasing environment materially change and it's really driven on the demand side of the equation. I think that the supply levels that we're seeing today as you point out in many cases are just in some cases, in some markets catching up, like certainly -- we've got a completely different sort of dynamic now with the millennial generation and the whole psychology, and in various stages in society to continue to create sort of an elevated level of demand at least for some time that we haven't experienced in the past.","So, it's really hard to see any sort of material weakening taking place over the next couple of years. As a result, on the assumption that the economic environment and the job growth environment continues at its current pace, I think where you see things really change materially is all of a sudden we have a shock to the economy. We have a shock to a particular market. Take Houston as an example, where all of a sudden the demand dynamics change and you never frankly in many cases, never see it coming, and it catches everybody off-guard a little bit and then you still of course have the supply pipeline that's still coming online and you've got to kind of work your way through that and that's where you see material change in the leasing environment, material change in your ability to push pricing.","So absent a tech meltdown in Atlanta or a [indiscernible] oil breakdown in Houston or some other sort of market specific kind of event that I could point to broadly speaking as long as the economy stays healthy we'll be okay, but if we have some sort of a crisis elsewhere in the world or something happens that causes the U.S. economy to all of a sudden nosedive, I think that, that could really change the equation quite a bit, because we'll still have the supply coming online and we'll have to deal with that, but we don't see that happening. Meanwhile, what we attempt to do is continue to build strength in the portfolio, continue to cycle capital, recycle capital, get it exactly positioned as we want, stay balanced, stay diversified, build balance sheet strength, so that when those things do happen and you see a material change in the environment we're first of all, okay and second of all in position to take advantage of it.","Drew Babin","Thanks for the insight. In your markets -- and I'll use Dallas as an example, a good deal of supply coming online this year and it's looking like next year as well is kind of concentrated in CBD sort of the same high end high rise type of product. In deliveries for maybe the second half of '16 and '17, are you starting to see developers' kind of target the suburbs a little more at the margin than they have been in the last couple of years?","Eric Bolton","I don't think there's any real evidence on that. I think that, we find that construction costs continue to create some pressure and I think that uniform across whether you're talking about more urban locations or suburban locations. I think that -- we've not seen any evidence to suggest that all a sudden now, suburban locations are going to be more exposed to overdevelopment. I think that we continue to see a lot of interest in developers focusing on some these infill locations.","You may see a little bit more effort taking place at some of these sort of what I call inner loop areas where they can go in and areas being re-gentrified in some fashion in they go in and do some teardowns. We see some of this happening in north of downtown, Atlanta area as an example area [indiscernible] so but I don't think there's any evidence at this point that we can see, suggesting that suburbs all of a sudden are going to be the big focus for developers going forward.","Drew Babin","Thank you. Great quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Omotayo Okusanya","Yes, good morning. Great quarter. I just started to look out a little bit further, 6 to 12 months, could you just talk a little bit about operating expenses and kind of what you think that's going to be going specifically if you think you're going to have another year like this with taxes where things missed out off pretty high and then everything started to moderate later on.","Eric Bolton","Well, I think, overall, let me start with that Tayo, we don't expect expenses as we move in the future, even in 2016 to be higher than they are today. I think we do continue to expect some pressure on the relative basis from taxes maybe a little less than we felt this year, except we were five this year and maybe we see that comedown but, overall it's still a third of our expenses and be higher than the growth rate of other expenses. So, I think across the board we expect next year to be not sharing expenses and under control.","Omotayo Okusanya","That's helpful. Then just in regards to particular markets. You did make some comments about Houston earlier on. In Atlanta, your same store revenue also kind of dropped over 100 basis points quarter over quarter and just curious if there's anything specific going on in that market.","Thomas Grimes","No, Atlanta is our strongest market. So, pricing momentum, there is good, results are good. I think if you look at the year-over-year comparison, second quarter to year-over-year in third quarter and give us a little bit of an odd story because the cop was much tougher in third quarter than it was in second quarter, but pricing momentum very strong in Atlanta and we're excited to be there and excited that it's a large market for us.","Omotayo Okusanya","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Haendel St. Juste","Can you guys provide a bit more color on the two assets acquired, the two leased up assets during third quarter? Perhaps some thoughts on stabilized yields and underwritten IRRs and then, what was the rationale for buying assets in Kansas City where you own just, I think two assets in Newport News or Virginia Beach, where you also own just a few assets. It seems a bit out of line with your goal of trying to rationalize some of your non-core market exposure. So is this you're signalling your intent to build some scale in these markets and now you consider this to be core markets for you or maybe more a reflection of the challenges of investing in some of your larger markets?","Eric Bolton","I think that both acquisitions are exactly in line with what our strategy is that we outlined. We've long said that Kansas City being a secondary market, we think fits very well within sort of the dynamic we're trying to create for the secondary market segment of the portfolio and so we've been active in that market looking for opportunities, being patient as we look for opportunities and the property that we acquired in Overland Park is, we acquired it at something around 5.2, 5.3 cap rate, in a stabilized yield around 5.7, 5.8. So we feel very good about that investment and it continues to add to what we expect to be a growing presence in Kansas City.","The acquisition in Virginia Beach, we've got several properties in that area. Again, it's a different dynamics as far as that area is concerned. A lot more government based employment, but we've made an effort to expand our footprint in that area. Fredericksburg is an area we've focused on. Charlottesville, Newport News, Hampton. We've got a fair amount of presence in that area and we plan to continue to stay active in that market as well and likewise again, that was property that we had been tracking for a couple of years. We acquired it at more around a 5.5 cap, closer to 5, again 5.8, 5.9 in yield somewhere in that range and it's a brand-new asset. So, we think it'll be a good long-term investment for us.","Haendel St. Juste","I appreciate that and then one more, if I may, a quick one on capital location. So you allocated some of your disposition proceeds towards paying down debt this quarter as opposed to buying assets, and now you're about 5.75 at EBITDA down from about 6 last quarter. So maybe you can share with us an update on your leverage goals today and where you want your leverage to be over the course of the next year, two years in terms of debt to EBITDA, and then as part of these capital allocation and\/or balance sheet management goals, how does stock buybacks play?","Albert Campbell","Haendel, this is Al. I'll answer the first part. I think in general, our leverage goals really haven't changed. We've long been in the 40% to 42% debt to gross assets as the right leverage level, given our strategy with the lower risk, minimal development high-quality cash flow diversified markets. That make sense for our Company. We're below in that right now, not so much focused on that as much as being patient on the acquisition side. We recycle capital. We haven't yet -- we're a net seller to the tune of about 110 million right now and so we're being patient with that, but we're comfortable with 40% to 42% range. I think over time, as we move forward you'll probably see us stay closer to the lower end of that range particularly as we continue to build and maintain balance sheet strength to have opportunity for the future when things change in a year or two. When, we don't know, but things certainly do at some point. We want balance sheet strength to take care of that. So, our strategy really hasn't changed and we feel like it's strong. We do think that the debt to EBITDA, we do expect it to stay below 6. I think it's an important mark. So, that was good to see.","Eric Bolton","And Haendel, on the share buyback, it's something we've done in the past. We obviously understand the approach. We understand the logic behind it. It's something we continue to monitor and keep an eye on. We, at this point, we feel like we can create better returns long-term with being patient with the capital that we have, deleveraging a little bit, building capacity for what we think will be better buying opportunities in the future and looking for the opportunities and scratching a corner for a few opportunities that we have gotten this year and those are going to be good returns on capital, we believe, but should the market turn particularly negative for some reason and we find ourselves trading at persistent meaningful discounted value, we certainly understand the logic behind using capital to reinvest in existing portfolio through share buyback and we'll continue to monitor it.","Haendel St. Juste","Remind me again, do you have a current authorization in place and if so what's the capacity?","Eric Bolton","There is one there. It's been some time ago. We visit with our Board on this periodically, but we do have a plan that's been there for some years. We'll probably be updating that at some point later this year.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to our speakers for any closing remarks.","Eric Bolton","No closing remarks. So thanks everybody for joining us and we'll see a lot of you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect. Thank you and have a great day."],"14864":["Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc (NYSE:MAA) Q1 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call May  1, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Tim Argo - Senior Vice President, Director of Finance","Eric Bolton - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer","Al Campbell - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President","Tom Grimes - Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President","Analysts","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Ryan Bennett - Zelman and Associates","Paula Poskon - Robert W.

Thank you for participating in the MAA first quarter 2014 earnings conference call.","At this time, we would like to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin, sir.","Tim Argo","Thank you, Keith. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO, Al Campbell, our CFO and Tom Grimes, our COO.","Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out, that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs, as well as information available to us at this time. Actual results may differ materially from our projections.","We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call will be available on our website. We undertake no obligation to update any information discussed on this conference call.","During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.","I will now turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. First quarter results were ahead of the midpoint of our guidance as operating performance came in a little better than we expected and G&A costs were lower. As outlined in our earnings release, given the better than expected Q1 result, we have increased our forecast of core FFO and AFFO performance for the year.","During the quarter, we captured steady growth in effective rent per unit, increasing 3.2% across the combined same store portfolio when compared to the prior year, which is consistent with the preceding fourth quarter's performance. Our large market segment of the portfolio continues to out-perform at this point in the cycle capturing 4.0% growth in effective rent per unit.","Our strongest performances in rent growth came from Houston, Austin and Atlanta. Rent growth in Memphis, Little Rock and Huntsville lagged within our secondary markets and weighed on revenue performance for that segment of the portfolio.","Physical occupancy at quarter-end was a solid 95.5%, a 50 basis point decrease from the 96% posted at the same time last year. Resident turnover declined 7% during the quarter when compared to last year and remains low at 56.8% on a rolling 12-month basis.","During the quarter, move-outs to buy a house declined by a significant 16% from prior year and constituted 18% of our total turnover. As we head into the spring leasing season, rent growth is increasing and we are encouraged with the trends. During April, rents for new move-in residents increased by an average of 3.1% on a year-over-year basis and lease renewals for renewing residents increased 7.1%.","As Al will touch on, our largest line item expense pressure in operating expenses was property taxes, up 9.8% in Q1. While still early, we continue to believe that real estate taxes will increase in the range of 6% to 7% for the year. Based on first quarter trends and our outlook for the rest of the year, we remain comfortable with our earlier guidance calling for combined same store NOI growth in the 4% to 5% range for all of 2014.","During the quarter construction wrapped up on our Randall Lakes property in Orlando with pre-leased occupancy currently standing at 55%. We expect to stabilize occupancy here in the first quarter of next year. We expect to wrap up construction on two other projects this quarter, our Lake Mary property expansion in Orlando and the South End property in Charlotte. Leasing continues to go well and in line with our forecasts at both properties.","Of the 2,200 units we currently have under development or lease-up, we expect to have 2,000 of these units productive by year end and fully contributing to core FFO growth in 2015.","The transaction market remains very competitive with the only acquisition completed during the quarter associated with our planned buy-out of the joint venture we had in place. We have two properties remaining in our JV and we expect to close on the acquisition of one of these properties this second quarter and we are currently under contract to sell the other property.","During the quarter we closed on the disposition of one other apartment property and are currently marketing for sale another eight properties, including the JV asset just mentioned. We are finding a high level of interest and continue to feel good about achieving our planned dispositions in the range of $125 million to $175 million.","In addition to these apartment property dispositions, as previously outlined, we are proceeding with the disposition of the remaining commercial properties acquired in our merger with Colonial. We made good progress in the first quarter with commercial properties now constituting less than 1% of our total gross assets. We are actively working on several other transactions and expect to be largely complete with this effort by year end.","Our management team continues to make terrific progress in completing the remaining integration activities surrounding our merger with Colonial. We expect to have the property management software integration complete in the next month. Accounts payable, financial reporting, payroll and all the other key system consolidation activities have been completed.","Our team has worked hard to complete these integration efforts before we get to the busy summer leasing season and they have done a terrific job. I really appreciate all the hard work. I am confident that we are now well positioned to begin executing on the various opportunities that we have previously identified surrounding our merger and look forward to capturing more efficiency and enhanced margins over the next several quarters.","That's all I have in the way of prepared comments and will now turn the call over to Al.","Al Campbell","Okay. Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. I will provide some additional commentary on the company's first quarter earnings performance, some balance sheet activity for the quarter and finally on updated earnings guidance for the year.","FFO for the quarter was $97.4 million, or $1.23 per share. Core FFO, which excludes non-routine items, primarily merger & integration costs, was $95.6 million or $1.21 per share, which was $0.03 per share above the midpoint of guidance provided. About half of the favorable performance compared to our forecast came from property operating results, as both the same store and the non-same store portfolios slightly outperformed. The remaining favorability came from lower than projected G&A costs, as bonuses, health insurance and professional fees were all below projections for the quarter.","The combined same store portfolio NOI grew 2.6% for the quarter, based on 3.1% growth in revenues, which was produced by the 3.2% growth in effective rents. Property operating expenses increased 3.9% for the quarter with over two-thirds of this increase coming from real estate taxes which grew 9.8% over the prior year. Our forecast, as Eric mentioned, for real estate tax expense growth for the full year remains at 6% to 7%, with the first quarter comparison impacted by prior year credits and the timing of accrual adjustments during the prior year.","During the first quarter, we acquired the remaining two-thirds interest in two communities from Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, our legacy MAA joint venture, for $38.8 million and we assumed loans totaling $31.7 million. We also closed on the sale of one multifamily community located in Columbus, Georgia, for gross proceeds of $10.6 million, which produced a gain of $5.5 million recorded during the first quarter.","As mentioned in the release, during the first quarter, we sold two operating commercial assets acquired with the Colonial merger, Brookwood Village Mall and CC Brookwood Village, an office asset, for a combined $80 million in gross proceeds. Also, during the first quarter, we sold five commercial land parcels acquired with the Colonial merger for combined gross proceeds of about $3.3 million. The company recorded total gains of $3.1 million during the first quarter related to the sale of these commercial and non-core assets we acquired from Colonial.","Construction and lease-up of our development pipeline continued to progress well. We funded an additional $16 million of development costs during the first quarter and fully completed one community, Randal Lakes, in Orlando, Florida.","We now have four communities, totaling 999 units, under construction, with $47.3 million of projected funding remaining to complete this development. We also had four communities in lease-up at the end of the quarter with an average occupancy of 66%. Three of the remaining lease-up communities and two of the development communities are now expected to stabilize during 2014 with the remaining communities in lease-up and construction expected to stabilize in 2015.","Our balance sheet remains in great position. At the end of the first quarter, company leverage, based on market cap, was 39% and based on gross assets, was 41.8%, which is 190 basis points below the prior year. And perhaps more important is that at quarter-end, total debt was only 6.2 times recurring EBITDA and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.6 times, both comparing well to the multifamily peer group.","At the end of the quarter, 97% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates for an average of about four years. Since year-end, we have executed $250 million of interest rate swaps to effectively lock a portion of the interest rate on future financing transactions, which we expect to further increase the duration of our interest rate protection. At quarter end, MAA's unencumbered asset pool was 63.9% of gross assets, and we had about $618 million of cash and credit available under our unsecured line of credit.","Finally, based on first quarter performance, we are increasing our core FFO guidance for the full year by $0.04 per share at the midpoint. We now project core FFO to be between $4.84 and $5.04 for the year. Quarterly core FFO per share is expected to be $1.15 to $1.27 for the second quarter, $1.19 to $1.31 for the third quarter and $1.21 to $1.33 for the fourth quarter.","Core AFFO for the full year is now expected to be $4.09 to $4.29 per share, which represents about a 70% dividend payout at the midpoint.","That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Keith, I will turn the call over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Eric Bolton","Good morning, David.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Just a couple of small questions. First, what's left on the Colonial integration in terms of, I guess in two dimensions, one, internal systems and operations and staffing, and two, costs?","Tom Grimes","Hi, David, it's Tom. Really, the large thing on systems is the conversion of legacy CLP communities over to the Yardi system. That is largely done. We have four of our five operating divisions converted and the fifth one tees up for us in May. And so we will be all on one system starting June 1. And then on the people side of it, we have really overhauled the commission structure, the pay structures and largely we are in good shape there. No other changes coming.","Al Campbell","I will just following him quickly on the costs. As you saw in the release, we estimate about $9 million to 10 million remaining for the full year. First quarter, we had about $6 million of that, and we still feel like that $9 million to $10 million is a good range for the year. We will probably end up at the top end of that. Probably more weighted toward remaining integration costs.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay, and then my second question has to do with revenue growth in aggregate in the secondary markets in the quarter, 1.9%. It was probably a little bit more muted than I would have expected at this point in the cycle for those types of markets. What are your thoughts around the dynamics of that growth rate? What you are seeing in the revenue management system relative to occupancy balance? What's really behind that 1.9% number in your mind?","Tom Grimes","David, I think it is, at this point in the cycle, though, larger markets tend to be more affected by supply and the secondary markets more by jobs creation. We think 2014 is going to be a much improved year for jobs improvement. However if you notice, the first quarter numbers, weather both precipitation here and cool in the northern half of our portfolio slowed job growth a little bit. But I think that's the key thing that we need going forward. We are optimistic we will see it later on in 2014.","Eric Bolton","If you look at the ratios of the job growth to supply, the numbers are still pretty compelling for the secondary market segment as a whole. As I mentioned, the segment, frankly, weighted down a little bit by Memphis' performance. Memphis, the market here, just the job market here, just really hasn't shown much recovery but I think that we think as the beginning of the latter part of year, we will see better performance out of Memphis. Columbus, Georgia was another market where we got a large property, a little over 1,000 units there that weighed on performance for that segment. But we think that broadly speaking, we will see some left later this year, but we have always - - this is still what I would consider to be a pretty healthy portion of the cycle for apartment fundamentals in the secondary markets relative to our large markets. We will always continue to struggle, keep up just a little bit but I think we will see that GAAP begin to narrow later this year.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay, and then just my final question on that theme, Eric, is with regard to Atlanta, which is still posting pretty good numbers despite lots of concerns around supply. Would you say that those markets are benefiting from the strong employment growth still or are there other factors there at work?","Eric Bolton","I think Atlanta's market's land is pretty good just as the job growth there is.","Tom Grimes","However, (inaudible) on jobs there and renewals there are going out. We are getting healthy rent growth rate with renewals at almost 8% and new leases frankly doing a little bit better than that at almost all 11%. So Atlanta, we are pretty optimistic on going forward.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. Thanks for the detail.","Operator","Then we will take our next question from Ryan Bennett with Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead.","Ryan Bennett - Zelman and Associates","Hi. Good morning, guys. Just following up on your comments on April's new move-in and renewal trends. I am just curious what you are seeing or what you are sending out on renewals over the next couple of months now?","Eric Bolton","Yes. Sure. Renewals are going out at for April, they went out at 7.4%, May 7.9%, June 8% and July 8.2%.","Ryan Bennett - Zelman and Associates","Got it, and then just digging on the market level and looking at Raleigh in particular here in the quarter, kind of what has been the momentum during the first quarter and into April? What do you expect there in the peak leasing season?","Eric Bolton","Yes. Raleigh is one who had -- you have got to back up to the second half last year, when Raleigh, where they had jobs to completions in 2013 were roughly 3:1 and most of that was backended. So we are working off a little bit of a supply hangover. It improves in this year to more of a 7:1 ratio, which is healthy but we need to work through those. New lease rates are up about 1.2%. But renewals are hanging there at 6%. So I think Raleigh will be under pressure for a little while and work itself out of it later in the year.","Ryan Bennett - Zelman and Associates","Got it. Thanks. And one last question, just on the redevelopment front. Are you guys still on track in terms of the Colonial assets that you had positioned for redevelopment later this year?","Eric Bolton","Yes, absolutely. We are feeling good about that. We have got all the properties scoped. We have got units executed in our markets. We have got an additional, to what was in the release, an additional 400 units in process. This I would really expect to ramp up as we move into the busier summer season where we have more lease expiration sitting and where we are right on target there. Very excited about that.","Ryan Bennett - Zelman and Associates","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And we will take the next question from Paula Poskon with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Eric Bolton","Hi, Paula.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","I wanted to ask a question about the expected synergies with the CLP integration. Would you say, Eric, that you are realizing those synergies either faster or more strongly than you had anticipated?","Eric Bolton","I wouldn't say it's any faster than what we expected. I will say that we think that the opportunity is bigger than what we initially had thought, particularly as Tom was just alluding to some of the redevelopment opportunity, but we really believe that on the revenue side, some of the opportunities surrounding management of LRO and how we go about that, I think we really need to get into the busy summer leasing season to really begin to see a lot of that benefit come through. And as we get into Q3 and Q4 in particular, that's where we think we will see some opportunities more reflected in the numbers.","On the expense side, I think that it's about like we expect a lot of the contracts, a lot of the rework of things that we identified early on have been completed. What we really are shooting to do it get this final step completed with the systems integration which we will wrap up this month. I think from that point just everything becomes a little bit easier from an executions perspective. So we really think that as get in to the good busy summer season in the back after this year, which is what we have always expected, we always expected a bit of a ramp up to take place this year and that certainly continues to be what we are experiencing.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Thanks. And any further thoughts about the Vegas portfolio?","Tom Grimes","No, we need to get it a little fuller. To be honest with you, Paula, I think we have got opportunity there. We have got a good team in place but we have got one property that's holding us back a little bit that needs to be addressed.","Eric Bolton","In terms of your questions, broader in terms of our continued desire to stay and so forth. Frankly we are going to just continue to monitor that market this year. We are not of any mind to do anything different. Not looking to add there at this moment, but we certainly like the two assets that we have got. As Tom mentioned, we think that there is an opportunity, from an operating perspective, that we are going to address over the course of this year and we will probably make a decision later this year as to what we want to do there going forward.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Great. Thanks. And then just finally, I wanted to dig in a little bit to your comment, Eric, about the move-outs to home ownership dropped significantly. Were the trends there pretty even across your markets? Or were there some markets that really jumped out at you?","Eric Bolton","Paula, it was surprisingly even, frankly I was spending some time reviewing that and it's the same in primary as it is in secondary, or they are large as it is in secondary and there is no one market driving it. It is really across the board in the quarter.","Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thanks. That's all I have.","Operator","We will take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning out there.","Eric Bolton","Good morning.","Tom Grimes","Hi, Haendel.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Would you guys talk a bit about the development lease-ups? The projects appear to be leasing up a bit ahead of expectations, which looks like some of the reasons for the upside this quarter. Can you talk a bit about the market demand and also if any concessions are involved?","Eric Bolton","Haendel, I would say, we are on track in aggregate and really right where we want to be as far as pricing goes. I mean we plan for concessions and the markets and we are on target for those pricing goals, just to get us leased up. You may have noticed the Northern Virginia properties, we just pushed back a little bit on the quarter of stabilization by quarter, and the way we look at that is we expect three months over 90 days occupancy to consider it exposed. So honestly if you miss by one day, by one unit, you push back. I don't think there is anything to worry about in that area. We are right on track on that.","Tom Grimes","I would tell you in recap, Fredericksburg is a little sluggish, Charlotte is doing better than we expected, the Orlando properties are right on targets, on balance. It is reconciling to pretty much what we had expected.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you for that. Could you also talk a bit more about the eight properties, Eric, you mentioned you are marking them for sale. Are you marking them individually? As a group? Are there any portfolio buyers out there and would you consider perhaps selling them sooner for maybe a little less to move back, getting them done quicker?","Eric Bolton","Well, I mean, I will certainly say, we have seen a ton of interest. We have got one group that we been talking with that was interested in several of them but, by and large, we have found the best execution to occur sort of selling retail as opposed to looking for a wholesale buyer and we ultimately believe we harvest the best value that way. But high level of interest situation in which we are selling one in Macon, Georgia year. We had a huge level of interest, 20 some odd bids came in with a number of them, nine to 10 of them, at better than what we were expecting. So it's a pretty healthy market out there and we feel comfortable with the volume that we have got. Obviously, we are trying to remain sensitive to thinking about the balance sheet and coverage ratios and of course we were working recycling out of a lot of commercial properties this year as well, which has a fairly dilutive impact. So I think we feel pretty good about the volume that we have gotten teed up this year. We probably will see them sell a little faster than we expected over the course of this year, but we are pretty optimistic with what we have been seeing in the way of interest.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Following up on that. I don't know if you disclose or if you are willing to, but can you discuss perhaps some of the markets, some of the nature of the assets? Are they more legacy Mid-America, Colonial, the older assets? Can you talk a bit more about any general commentary on the state of the eight assets?","Eric Bolton","They are a mix of both large and secondary markets and they are mix of both legacy MAA and legacy CLP. Frankly, our approach is simply to take those assets that we believe that we are seeing generating the sort of the lowest AFFO operating margin that we have in the portfolio and looking to recycle that capital into more productive investments. It's the same approach we have been taking for the last couple of years. So when we completed our merger with Colonial, we put the entire portfolio together and peeled off the bottom 10 or so that we felt like had the lowest margin growth prospects associated with it. Again, it's AFFO after CapEx and typically what that translates into are obviously older assets. So average age is going to be 20, 25 years old, in some cases even older. As it so happens, a lot of the history, particularly on the legacy MAA side, the way this company was formed grew, a lot of the older assets tend to be in some of the more tertiary markets within the secondary market component of the portfolio. So that just happens to be where we are seeing more disposition activity occur. But on balance, I would say, probably at this point of what we are selling 60% or so of it is coming out of secondary markets and the balance out of the larger markets. It is all older and that's the profile.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","Okay and one more if I may. Can you talk a bit about the multifamily financing environment from the agency's and bank's perspective? There had been some talk of fears that Fannie and Freddie were potentially going to curtail here a bit, but they recently conveyed the desire to be leaders in financing here, in light of the heightened competition from banks, LifeCos, et cetera. Can you talk a bit about that?","Eric Bolton","I would tell you that what we are selling and talking to the buyers, both agencies are pretty active and we are seeing, particularly, Freddie being pretty active and they are -- I know a lot the buyers, again, that we are talking with are talking to both agencies and finding a lot of receptivity to their financing needs.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jeff Gaston with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead. Jeff Gaston, your line is open. Please check your mute function.","Jeff Gaston - KeyBanc Capital","Good morning, guys.","Eric Bolton","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Gaston - KeyBanc Capital","I was wondering if you could provide a little detail about the split between the legacy Mid-America portfolio performance versus the Colonial Properties? And also, do you still expect a list from the Colonial Properties in the second half?","Tom Grimes","Yes. A short answer is yes to both. We did see a little stronger revenue performance in the legacy CLP side, primarily driven by improvements in fees and delinquency and reimbursement. So that was relatively quick and we do feel like, as Eric mentioned earlier, there is an opportunity for us as we move into the year to smooth out some of the volatility that occurred around the merger in terms of occupancy and we feel like there is a repricing opportunity going forward.","Jeff Gaston - KeyBanc Capital","Great, and then you saw pretty significant outperformance as far as G&A and the property management expenses in 1Q. Could you give us a sense of what the proper run rate for the year would be?","Al Campbell","Yes this is Al, Jeff. I would say, we had a little favorability in it in the first quarter about $0.01 per share that we talked about, but that was a few items that were bonuses we talked about, health insurance and professional fees were a little lower in the first quarter than we thought. I think the run rate, with the projections for the full year, we took it down about $1 million, if you saw in our guidance and that's about right for full-year. So I think the run rate was pretty close, a little lower than we had started with in our guidance last quarter.","Jeff Gaston - KeyBanc Capital","Could you give us a sense as far as what it might be for G&A versus the property management?","Al Campbell","Really, I don't have that. We typically project that in total in the portfolio. Let me see if I can pull that detail for you. It has got to be pretty close to the run rate that we had in the first quarter in terms of the split. It's a pretty representative split, is what I am saying.","Jeff Gaston - KeyBanc Capital","Okay. All right. That's helpful. That is all my questions. Thanks a lot guys.","Al Campbell","Thanks. Jeff.","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning, guys. First question, just, Eric, the lease numbers, the renewal and new lease numbers you gave, were those lease-over-lease or those year-to-date, I mean, year-over-year?","Eric Bolton","Well, the way we give our numbers, when we talk about new lease rates, that's year-over-year, because it really supports and drives the overall revenue performance. So new lease rates being up in April, 3.1%, that's year-over-year. When we talk about renewals, we are talking about what's the rent increase we gave our existing customer. So it's really more of a lease-over-lease, if you will. So the 7:1 that I quoted for April was the existing customers who stayed with us by paying 7.1% more.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Anything on the other income side pushing through this year that we should expect above trend growth?","Eric Bolton","No, not really. Not that I can point to right now. All the other associated fees and so forth are performing pretty much in line with what we expected.","Al Campbell","There are some, obviously, in fees and other things related to the synergies and opportunities we expect in the Colonial portfolio as a part of that.","Eric Bolton","We got that all built it up in our forecast.","Al Campbell","Built in our forecast. Yes.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That's helpful. Second question. Al, it looked like you had some good success on the land sale front there. Obviously, one of the components to driving that accretion, you guys have talked about, is eliminating the non-income producing assets. Of the land that sits there today, how much do you expect you can move in 2013 at this point versus how much is going to take a little bit more blocking and tackling in 2015 and 2016?","Al Campbell","Majority of the dispositions this year were from operating commercial, Mike. We focus on that first, as we talked about and we had about $150 million in dispositions in total, about $130 million or so of that is expected to be the commercial, which we did $80 million in the first quarter as you saw. So we expect a little bit more of the remaining of the year. So I think what you will see is us have a lot more focus on those land parcels in 2015 and 2016 as we move forward.","Tom Grimes","I would tell you, Mike, that roughly, call it 35% to 40% of it is multifamily related sites and we think that that will get pushed through reasonably quickly. I would say, likely before the end of the year. Some of the other is a little bit more difficult. It's remaining retail outparcels. There is a single-family component of parcel down in Gulf Shores that's fairly sizable that will probably take a little more time. I think that, well, the lion's share will be gone by the end of this year, I expect but what's left will probably take a couple of years.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Al, still expecting the bond offering mid-year?","Al Campbell","That's our plan. It will depend on the balance sheet for that, obviously. As you can see, we have about $450 million in debt maturities about midyear. So our plan now is if things go well, assess the public markets and take care of that and good news is, we have seen very good market activity over the last few months. So our expectations for rate have actually improved a little bit since the fourth quarter. So we look forward to that.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, and finally Eric, you touched upon the acquisition market being a bit more challenging. A lot of competition. Can you just talk about pricing in the primary versus secondary markets and any changes you had seen in the last, call it, 90 days?","Eric Bolton","There has really been a lot of change in the last 90 days. It is still very intense. We are seeing assets of the kind of quality that we are looking to buy, trading 4.5% to 5% in some of the larger markets, and frankly not much higher than that in some of the secondary markets in which we are still buying in, Charleston and San Antonio and Jacksonville and some of these other markets. We are still seeing newer assets very much in the 5% to 5.25% range. So I will put the spread at maybe 25, perhaps as much as 50 basis points, but broadly it's been that way for about the last year. So I think that with the fundamentals continue to remain fairly strong and of course rates being where they are, I think it's going to take a more significant rise in interest rates before you will see any really cap rate movement. The interest is pretty darn high right now.","Michael Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets","That's all from me, guys. Thank you.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","We will take our next question from Buck Horne with Raymond James and Associates. Please go ahead.","Buck Horne - Raymond James and Associates","Hi. Good morning, guys. I know this has been asked a little bit. You kind of danced around it. But I just want to understand the renewal numbers a little bit more clearly because it seems like those are really strong renewal growth targets that you guys are getting. Are you getting more aggressive with the price increases this spring? And how much is this change in the move-outs to buy a home affecting your desire to push pricing this spring?","Tom Grimes","Really the pricing decision on how aggressively push has less to do about what we think is happening in the home buying market and what our exposure and what are fundamentals are, and right now, they are good and we are with our yield management practices just jumping all over that. That's kind of the push point but repeat your question a little bit, I want to make sure I am staying on point. I got distracted by the home buying point.","Buck Horne - Raymond James and Associates","I am just wondering, combining the two data points, to me, is really striking that you saw such a sharp decline year-over-year in the move-outs, and you have got such strong and accelerating renewal notices going out. I am kind of wondering if the two are playing together? Or is there something just more structural about the Colonial portfolio that's allowing you to push pricing a little bit more aggressively? Just understanding.","Tom Grimes","Sure. It's a combination of both. Frankly, we feel pretty good about where the markets are going just in terms of overall supply and demand and where our exposure is at this point. Really, its more of a forward-look that we are making on those pricing that we have quoted, and I think they had a similar system, but with a different approach. In that we see the opportunity to do some repricing, and are taking advantage of that opportunity.","Eric Bolton","And I think, Buck, this is just following on with what Tom is saying. The performance is not really related in our way of looking at it and thinking about it to the reasons for move-out. As Tom mentioned, really, our approach to managing renewals is a function of, obviously looking at what the market is doing, looking at what our exposure is and that gets back to how you define your tolerance levels and how you operate LRO and we have always taken an approach to try to keep a lower level of volatility in terms of our exposure settings and the lower level of volatility as we get in from a lease expiration management perspective. What we think that that enables one to do is ultimately be a little bit more aggressive on pricing. So by taking some of the volatility that we felt like was existing within the former legacy CLP portfolio, we think that that's going to manifest itself in much more stronger pricing performance, particularly as we get into latter part of this year. That's where a lot of the lift comes from. It really has nothing to do with move-out reasons.","Buck Horne - Raymond James and Associates","I understood. Thank you. Secondly, I was wondering if you could drill down a little bit more on the Texas markets, and noting that there has just been such tremendous job growth and demand in Texas, but there is also quite a bit of new supply that is getting underway in most of the major markets but it seems like some of that supply maybe more concentrated in certain submarkets and I want to understand how you view the supply pressure in the Texas areas relative to your portfolio? Are you seeing any signs that supply is going to be more of an impact? Or is it a less of an impact in the Texas markets where you guys are positioned?","Tom Grimes","Sure, Buck, in Dallas and Houston, I think we feel very good about where those markets are and a ton of that construction coming on in Dallas is in the uptown market, which had limited exposure too. On the Austin front, we are really monitoring supply, but with the jobs engine has been able to absorb it pretty well in Austin and we are optimistic about how it's doing and it is 6% new lease growth and 8.6% on the renewals. So we are watching Austin and feel pretty good about Dallas and Houston.","Buck Horne - Raymond James and Associates","Thank you, guys.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Buck.","Operator","We will take our next question from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","First question, just around Colonial and some of the questions that were asked earlier. In regards to the synergies, it does sound like things are moving along pretty well just from the cost perspective. Trying to understand the other pieces in regards to, again, not purchases in bulk, the ability to kind of push Colonial rent a little bit more aggressively versus what Colonial was doing before. How are those parts are kind of coming together, and when would we kind of expect to start to see the benefits of that showing up in the numbers?","Eric Bolton","I was talking to the guidance portion of it. I think what you see is, majority of that's built in the second and third quarter and the fourth quarter, Tayo because in terms of allowing the revenue side, you needed to see the lease come due and there has to be an opportunity there and have time to go through all the contracts. So if you look at the guidance, I think what you will see is, we had anticipated all along accelerated growth in both revenues and NOI in the second, third and in to the fourth quarter.","Tom Grimes","And then those almost the same thing on the expense side, Tayo. We are a business that does most of its volume over the next four months or so and the benefits of the way we have structured the company and the pricing opportunities that we have going and just sort of the efficiencies that we are driving in terms of how we turn units, those will begin to manifest themselves in mid-second and early third quarter.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Okay, that's helpful. Then just on the transactions that were done during the quarter. I may have missed it, but did you give any cap rate information on the commercial asset sales?","Al Campbell","We did. We can give it. We had 8.25%, 8.5% cap rate range on $80 million that we sold. You have got to understand there was that it was a mall asset and office asset there combined. And that's the combined cap rate. I think to say that the mall is older asset, it was probably higher cap rate, but they averaged.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Okay, that's helpful. Then the third question. Some of the smaller markets you are in where you only have one or two assets. I know there had been some conversation earlier on about potentially exiting those markets because of lack of synergies. Just kind of curious where that stands? And if we should be expecting some of that, going forward.","Eric Bolton","Tayo, this is Eric. Absolutely. I think, as I alluded to earlier, we are primarily driven by a desire to cycle capital where we believe the after CapEx AFFO margin likely is lower and likely to not be as strong going forward. It just so happens again that that happens to me and some of our more tertiary markets where we also happen to have some efficiency. So we will be exiting some more of markets this year. We exited a number of them last year. We think over the course, in due course, over the next couple of years as we continue this recycling effort targeting on the parameters that I described, a consequence of that will be fewer and fewer of these tertiary markets within the portfolio.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Have you specifically identified which markets you are going to get out of yet? Or are you still in the process of evaluating that?","Eric Bolton","Well, have identified what we are planning to sell this year, but beyond that we got it but we are not prepared to disclose that now, but you will more of that over the next couple years.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Great. Thank you. Good quarter.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Tayo.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We will take our next question from Dave Bragg with Green Street. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Dave Bragg - Green Street","Thank you. Good morning. Eric, I wanted to follow up on the comments that you made regarding the transaction market and the last three year observations of private market buyer underwriting, are they accepting or underwriting to lower IRRs than they were a couple of years ago? Or generally speaking, are they looking for the recent period of above average NOI growth to continue for the next few years?","Eric Bolton","Dave, it's hard to know for sure. My guess is that the IRR requirements, IRR expectations have moderated a little bit from where they were a couple years ago. I expect that's probably part of it. But where we find just huge levels of interest are some of the older assets where there is presumably an opportunity for some sort of value add or some sort of redevelopment play that that they can dial into their modeling and ultimately cobble together a higher forward-looking NOI performance and ultimately cobble together an IRR to be frankly, whatever it needs to be. So I think that these value add opportunities, these 10, 12 or even older 15, 20 year old assets offer just a lot of opportunity to get pretty creative in terms of how you think about creating value. So I think there is some of that going on, but I do believe that probably IRRs have moderated just a little bit but as I alluded to, we are seeing a huge level of interest and these are all very sophisticated buyers, lot of your institutional capital behind them and great track records of having closed a lot of transactions over the last couple of years.","Dave Bragg - Green Street","Thank you for that. Regarding your revenue growth guidance and perhaps you discussed this last quarter and we missed it, but when we look at the revenue growth guidance range of 3.5% to 4.5%, do you have the same expectations for the MAA and Colonial Portfolios? Or do you have higher expectations for one of the two","Eric Bolton","I will give you the summary. I would talk and give you some details on how, Dave, but I think obviously we have a little higher expectations for Colonial because we need to capture those synergies both in terms of pricing and capture stronger property performance to not repeat the volatility of last year. Some of the things we talked about in occupancy and pricing in the second, third quarter. So we clearly have a stronger expectation for Colonial portfolio.","Tom Grimes","I would echo that but it's an opportunity in price and occupancy in the third quarter, second and third quarter and then we have got further opportunities on both portfolios with fees and new opportunities, ideas that we have either added to the Colonial platform or brought from the Colonial platform to ours.","Dave Bragg - Green Street","Okay. So just roughly speaking, at the midpoint, would it be somewhere around 4.5% for Colonial and 3.5% for MAA? Or is it not that wide?","Eric Bolton","Probably not quite that wide but you are getting close to that range that we are taking. When you look at the overall guidance for the year, if we put out 3.1% in the first quarter and the midpoint is 4%, it is going to take something close to that to get that. So that's pretty close.","Tom Grimes","But the performance differential between the two is quite.","Eric Bolton","It's a 100 basis. I will call it more like 50 to 60 basis points.","Dave Bragg - Green Street","Understood. That's helpful. My last question is just very specific to the new move-in gains. We think about it slightly differently. What was the increase on new move-ins as compared to the tenant that departed?","Tom Grimes","Using Eric's numbers, it was 2.2%, Dave. So 3.1% on a year-over-year basis, 2.2% on a lease-over-lease for April new lease rate.","Dave Bragg - Green Street","Sorry, Tom. I was really looking for the first quarter.","Tom Grimes","Okay. The first quarter, it was 3% on a year-over-year basis and negative 1.1% on a quarter basis, being weaker in January and strengthening through March.","Dave Bragg - Green Street","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","I am showing no further questions. So I will turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.","Eric Bolton","No further comments from us.

The outperformace was driven by solid operating results with same-store NOI growing 5.8% as compared to prior year.","Tom will walk you through more specifics surrounding pricing and the factors driving revenue performance. But overall, we continue to enjoy a favorable leasing environment as job growth and strong demand across our markets are more than offsetting new supply deliveries.","Continued progress and harvesting opportunities coming out of our merger with Colonial is also contributing to operating momentum. The lift in performance we captured in the back half of last year from a number of operating improvements and scale benefits are continuing to generate solid year-over-year results.","All aspects of our operations are now fully consolidated on to one platform and we're looking forward to continuing to improve and fine tune several processes that we believe will generate further lift in operating margin.","The balance sheet remains in a strong position and we expect to see coverage metrics continue to improve over the course of the year. In his comments, Al will recap more details but we are particularly pleased with the progress in growing the unencumbered asset base with the higher level of asset sales and growing free cash flow, our overall debt level as a percentage of gross assets is declining and is also further strengthening the balance sheet.","As recapped in yesterday's earnings release, we had very busy quarter with transactions. Including a group of properties that were sold earlier this week, we've completed the sale of 18 properties since the first of the year. We have an additional three properties on the contract and are expecting to close on those sales later in the summer.","As we have outlined in last quarters earnings release, we believe that market conditions and the transaction markets supported and expedited executing of our plans to exit this 21 properties in smaller secondary markets.","We are very pleased with the execution and an average age to 25 years and located exclusively in smaller markets this group of 18 properties that has been sold has an average rent that is 21% below our same-store portfolio average.","Based on trailing 12-month NOI, total capital spending averaging approximately 1200 per unit and a 4% management fee, we captured a 5.6% cap rate on the sale of these properties.","Going forward, as we've been doing for the past few years we will continue to consider opportunities to recycle capital from properties in markets where we believe we can reinvest to capture more attractive long-term value but it's worth noting, that with the dispositions being completed this year.","In addition to the significant volume of dispositions and capital recycling completed over the past few years, we've now sold over 11,000 units since 2010. As a result, you can expect us to execute our capital recycling on more of a match funding basis going forward and exiting an additional 11 markets this year we have now repositioned the portfolio for stronger and more efficient execution.","I\u2019d like to point out that as a result of this capital recycling along with a number of other improvements we\u2019ve made to both the operating and financing platforms for both the legacy MAA and CLP portfolios, we've seen MAA same-store NOI margin over the last five years improve 430 basis points.","When considering capital spending of both recurring and revenue enhancing items, the same-store NOI margin has improved 550 basis points since its calendar year 2010.","On the acquisitions front, we continue to underwrite a number of new opportunities and deal flow remains high, but extremely competitive. As we move further into the new supply delivery cycle, I continue to believe that we\u2019ll see more investment opportunities that meet our long established investment hurdles.","As noted in yesterday's earnings release, during the quarter we started a Phase II expansion of our property in Fredericksburg Virginia and are currently planning to also start additional expansions of properties we own in Orlando and in Charleston.","We also remain active with discussions with developers on several opportunities to acquire properties on a pre-developed or lease up status.","In summary, we like the momentum we\u2019re seeing and believe that the benefits being harvested from our merger coupled with the capital recycling we completed further supports a more efficient operation and higher internal growth profile.","The balance sheet is well positioned and we remain poised, but disciplined to continue to capture growth opportunities that we feel are likely to increase as we move further into the cycle.","That's all I have in prepared comments. And I'll now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Grimes","Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. Our 5% revenue growth was driven by a strong average fiscal occupancy of 95.6%, up 60 basis points from the prior year coupled with average rent per unit growth of 3.9% and good fee performance.","April trends continue to be encouraging. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacant plus all notices for a 60 day period is just 8.3%. This is down 130 basis points from the same time last year.","Our blended year-over-year pricing for April was up 6%, which is 200 basis points higher than this time last year. While expenses were better than we expected, there are few timing notes on the expense lines.","Our personnel and marketing expenses reflect timing and congruities related to the discontinuation of legacy CLP programs last year. This affects first quarter comparisons only. We expect both lines to be below 3% for the full year.","The benefits of our strong operating platform on a legacy CLP communities continues to pay dividends. The more robust approach of our revenue management team has grown rents at CLP communities more than 150 basis points higher than their market peers. Our system customizations that allow for fees and collections to be automatically build on the CLP platform has improved delinquency and fee collections for the quarter.","We\u2019re excited about our new repair and maintenance inventory process. This new initiative - with this new initiative our vendor stocks and replenishes are onsite shops with their owned inventory. We then purchase the inventory when it\u2019s used by our teams. This maximizes our scale discounts and the speed of service to the resident.","It minimizes the amount of time our team spends on procurement and increases efficiency onsite. This process gives us the right part at the right cost at the right time. This is another example of how our scale and operating sophistication creates value for our residents and our shareholders.","On the market front, vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results in places like Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, and Tampa. In the secondary markets, which have lower supply pressure we're benefiting from accelerating job growth and this group Charleston, Greenville, and Savannah stand out. Jacksonville's 4% revenue growth is also notable.","Further illustrating the demand of that market is our newly developed 220 Riverside project. We delivered our first units last week in that 294 unit community, is already 58% pre-leased with rents above pro forma.","We expect our four communities in Memphis to show year-over-year improvement as the last year plays out - as the year plays out and job growth builds. We\u2019re in very good shape in Houston, but continue monitoring our portfolio closely and we will remain sensitive to any changes and demand.","During the quarter, Houston generated 6.6% revenue on rent growth, turnover for the quarter was down 8%. For the month of April, Houston's average physical occupancy was 96.1% and year-over-year blended rents for April were up 7.7%.","It was at this time last year that the heavy lifting of our system integration improvements began. The year later, we\u2019re in a different place. Our platform is fully integrated, our people are having fun with the new systems, and the benefits of the merger been harvested.","I'm excited about what our teams have accomplished thus far and looking forward to what's to come.","Now turn the call over to Al.","Albert Campbell","Okay, thank you Tom, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll provide some additional commentary on the company's first quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then the expectations for the remainder of the year.","FFO for the first quarter was $105.2 million or $1.34 per share. Core FFO, which excludes certain non-cash and non-routine items was $95.6 million or $1.32 per share, as compared to $89.5 million or $1.21 per share for the prior year. And this core FFO per share performance was $0.03 above the midpoint of our previous guidance and represents a 9.1% growth over the prior year.","Core AFFO for the first quarter was $94.6 million or $1.19 per share producing a solid coverage over our $0.77 per share quarterly dividend. Strong results from our same-store portfolio as discussed by Tom produced the majority of the favorability to our forecast as both our revenues and expenses were slightly favorable to projections.","Performance from our lease up properties also progressed as planned and our overhead and interest expenses were essentially inline with the expectations for the quarter. Our G&A expenses are little front loaded this year reflecting the timing of certain items, but we expect this to normalize over the course of the year and we remain very confident in our projection for combined G&A and property management expenses of $56.5 million to $58.5 million for the full year fully reflected by the synergies captured from the Colonial merger.","During the first quarter we acquired one 298 units luxury properties for $46.5 million and we sold four older properties for combined [Audio Gap] as we sold an additional 14 communities for combined gross proceeds of $180 million, which we\u2019ll use to pay down our line of credit during the second quarter.","We also continue construction on the two properties under development at year end and we began construction on a Phase II expansion at an existing community located in Fredericksburg Virginia.","We funded $5 million of construction cost during the first quarter and we expect to fund an additional $25.5 million to complete these three projects. Our current plans anticipate $50 million to $60 million of total construction spending for 2015 just based on additional expansion opportunities as well.","We prepared for the planned assets sales as well as to continue improving our balance sheet. During the first quarter we paid off a $116 million of secured Fannie Mae debt, as well as an additional $15.2 million single mortgage.","We incurred $3.4 million of debt extinguishment charges related to these payoffs, but the vast majority of this expense was non-cash write-offs or deferred financing cost. We also have about $315 million of debt maturities remaining for the year primarily occurring in the fourth quarter. And as mentioned before, we currently plan to utilize the public bond markets to refinance this later this year.","The average interest rate for the majority of these maturities is well above 5%, which is projected produced on fairly significant interest rate savings giving current markets.","At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet remains in great shape, our total debt to market capital is 36.1%. Our fixed charge coverage ratio was [Audio Gap], 70% of our assets were now encumbered, which is a record for the company and over 92% of our debt is fixed or hedged against rising interest rates. And given the level of asset sales and projected internal cash flow, our current plans for the year do not include new equity.","At quarter end, we had over $335 million of total cash and credit available under Atlanta credit supporting our liquidity. We expect to end the year with our leverage on a net gross asset basis to be about 41% down from the 42%, - 42.6% at the end of 2014.","Finally we are maintaining our current guidance for core FFO and AFFO for the full year. We were encouraged by the first core performance from our same-store portfolio as we continue to capture benefits from the Colonial merger.","But as mentioned in our last call, we do expect tougher comparisons in the back half of this year as post-merger more normalized quarters began compared periods of synergy capture last year.","We feel good about our current operating momentum but given that the bulk of our leasing activity and significant transaction activity, are ahead of us for this year, we will wait to visit guidance with our second quarter earnings report.","As a reminder, our core FFO is projected to be 5.09 to 5.33 per share or 5.21 at the mid-point based on average shares and units outstanding we\u2019re about 79.5 million. Core AFFO is projected to be 4.43 to 4.67 per share or 4.55 at the mid-point, which is a 6.3% increase over 2014.","The major components of this guidance are outlined in our supplemental data packets that accompanied our press release and also I will point out that we had some additional details regarding our operating expenses to our supplemental disclosures this quarter which is on page S3. And so, we hope you find this helpful.","That's all I have, and I'll now turn the call back over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Al. Before opening the lines for questions, I want to extent my thanks and appreciation for the hard work and excellent service our associates working on site and our properties provide for our residents.","Our company culture is based on a strong service oriented mindset for both those who directly serve our residents and those of us who support them in our corporate and regional positions.","As a result of this focus, MAA will be recognized later today as first among apartment management companies across the country as having the best online reputation based on an independent online power ranking survey conducted by J Turner Research. This recognition follows our designation earlier this year as having the best online reputation among the publicly traded apartment rates.","This recognition speaks to both our team's dedication to serving our residents, as well as to the strength and sophistication of our operating platform.","That's all we have in the way prepared comments. So Leo, I am going to turn it back to you for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Rob Stevenson of Janney.","Rob Stevenson","Good morning, guys. Al, what drove the tweaks in the third and fourth quarter guidance today versus what you knew first week of February or so?","Albert Campbell","Hi Rob. It's really timing of items. As we mentioned in the comments, we feel good about our full year guidance reaffirm that, we'll readdress that in the second quarter call. Surely timing of items and I will say primarily transaction activity the biggest unknown at this point really is more the transaction activity. We sold a lot of assets. Obviously, we have plan in our forecast to put that capital back to work throughout the year. So, that timing of that changed a little bit, causing the most of that.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And them Tom, can you talk about where new and renewals were, sort of, month-by-month on the trend there? And then, sort of, are there any markets where you are seeing very big gaps between those or where you are seeing the biggest gaps?","Tom Grimes","Rob it was pretty consistent across the board on a year over year basis. New leases were 56, renewals 57, blended 57. For April it's 63, 56 and 60 and then looking forward May 75 and we were \u2013 offers went out at 75, we got 68 in June 75, 61 at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gaurav Mehta of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Gaurav Mehta","Thanks, good morning. Just a couple of questions on your same-store numbers. If I look at your NOI it's 5.8% for 1Q and then you just gave the numbers for new and renewals, which seems encouraging and I know you mentioned that you are expecting tougher comps towards the second half of the year but going from 5.8% to 3% to 4% guidance it seems, like quite a bit of slow down. So outside of tough comps, is there anything else you are looking at?","Eric Bolton","Not really. I think that \u2013 it's again what we are facing is reality that a lot of the improvements that we begin to capture in our operating metrics out of the Colonial portfolio really began to show up in the back half of last year as well as some lift that we got from some scale benefits and we are working a lot of contracts. So, we will be comparing against those comps.","All that improvement, all that lift of course, is permitted if you will, but just on a year-over-year basis the comps get little bit more challenging. And to be honest with you too, I think that we are carrying fairly strong occupancy at this point and we were carrying fairly strong occupancy in the back half of last year.","And so, lift on a year-over-year basis and effective occupancy becomes pretty challenged. And there is some assumptions that if the economy continues to improve and we begin to see that employment markets continue to show recovery, I think it's also reasonable to assume, there may be a little pick up and turnover that begins to take place.","So, those are all the various variables that I think one has to think through over the back half of this year. We don't certainly see anything materially weakening and you are right, all the trends that we are seeing right now are pretty encouraging but we still got long way to go and that's really gets us to where we feel pretty automate that we already hold tight at this point and then readdress it as we get to the end of the summer.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. And my follow up question is on transactions where you sold assets for economic cap rate of 5.6%, as you look to deploy that capital towards acquisition, what kind of cap rates are you targeting?","Eric Bolton","Well, I mean most of what we are seeing today, we are seeing economic cap rates that would be 5 to 5.5, frankly pretty tight spread. Most of what we are targeting, of course, is newly built brand new so the CapEx requirements are fairly minor and are low.","And so, based on our hurdles and the criteria that we use is we think about deploying capital, the spread would be fairly narrow to what we sold.","Gaurav Mehta","All right. Thank you. That's all I had.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital.","John Kim","Thank you. I guess my first question is on the economic cap rate of 5.6%. This is I think what was previously characterized as an AFFO yield, correct?","Al Campbell","We talked about that a lot on our previous call John, we talked about our FFO yield and then the cash flow cap rate. I think we did discuss the cash flow cap rate which is our new [indiscernible] for a moment.","Trailing 12 months actual NOI, minus of 4% managed fee and then minus to actual CapEx on this portfolio which is Eric mentioned is common. So, it's about $1,200 a unit. And that's how that calculated. I think we did mention at our previous call, there was some discussion about it, NOI yield versus the cash flow, the cash flow obviously is what we feel is important, that's what you are selling to an investor and we thought that was a very good outcome.","John Kim","What was the NOI yield?","Al Campbell","The NOI yield was \u2013 NOI basically was close to 8%.","John Kim","Okay. And my final question is on the performance versus - of the core versus your secondary markets. As noticed, it widened out with this period, is this really showing that having scale in your markets drives the NOI growth? And can you remind us what the balance of core versus secondary markets is ideal for you and under which timeframe?","Eric Bolton","Let me take the later part of the question and maybe Tom can pick the first part. I would tell you that today we are sitting roughly around 60%, what we refer to as large markets, and 40% referred to as secondary markets. And that\u2019s really kind of the portfolio strategy allocation that we are really after [Audio Gap] it's not the way we think about it.","We are after certain portfolio mix. We feel like we have that now and then, of course, what's happening in the secondary markets, broadly speaking is, that we are seeing things starting to pick up and improve there. And Tom, you want to - ","Tom Grimes","At 3.7% year-over-year revenue growth along with 1% in sequential revenue growth which attracts the large market group pretty well, we are encouraged with the trends that we are seeing. And then furthermore based on the recent recap of job growth released by the VLS, just recently comparing Q1 of this year to Q1 of last year in the large markets, they moved up by 40 basis points and our secondary markets about 120 basis points So we\u2019re sort of encouraged with the revenue on and the jobs picture looking forward in this group.","Eric Bolton","And the secondary markets generally continue to not see much in the way of supply pressure, not nearly as aggressive did you see in the larger market. So a combination, we always felt that as we get further into the economic recovery that these secondary markets would begin to show their improved strength and that\u2019s we think that\u2019s what we\u2019re starting to see at this point.","John Kim","Thank you.","Eric Bolton","Thank you, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim of Zelman & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about some of the comments in terms of the second half of the year in terms of just being having concerned whether turnover raises or just slowing based on the, I can see levels there but if you\u2019re looking at the trends in terms of renewals for May and June, are you seeing anything different in terms of the behavior of tenants in terms of percentage renewing at this point and or is that anything leading to that for this, in terms of the second half of the year or is it more just overall caution?","Eric Bolton","We\u2019re not seeing anything on from marketing leasing, the market fundamentals or leasing fundamentals that causes us concern, I mean occupancies are strong as Tom outlined, rent trends are strong, turnover remains low, so there is nothing from an operating perspective or market perspective that gives us pass at this point.","I think what we\u2019re just the point we\u2019re trying to make here is that, we\u2019ve got tougher comps coming out, we\u2019ve got both in terms of the benefits we got last year from some of the benefits are coming out of the merger and we were fairly full occupancy towards the back half of last year and so I think the only thing that would cause and so going above and beyond those two sort of improvements last year is going to be challenging because we\u2019re still carrying very strong occupancy and we\u2019re looking at if you call frictional vacancy a little bit and thinking about things we can do to sort of improve and minimize further downtime between turns and things of that nature.","So on the margin we still think there is some opportunities along those lines on occupancy as well as in the operating platform but fundamentally a lot of the benefits and that we got over the back half of last year presents some challenging comps this year.","And the only other thing I would tell you, that causes us to think that, it\u2019s time to sort of stick to what we think is going to happen at this point of our guidance is the fact that if the employment market continues to show recovery and we continue to see the job markets show recovery, I think that, it\u2019s reasonable to expect that the turnover may pickup just a little bit, that\u2019s typically what happens and that\u2019s okay, I mean where the demand side of the equation is very strong and our move outs to rent increase continues to not be worry some trend.","And so little pick up in turnover is not something that worries us, now that the fact is it make cause vacancy to move up slight amount is a consequence of that but we\u2019re preparing for that and we think we\u2019ve got a good chance to minimize that but that\u2019s, just the context of what we\u2019re sort of working with here that causes us to think that we need to get through kind of the summer leasing season and take a look at where we are and at that point, consider whether or not we\u2019ll be making revisions to our current guidance.","Dan Oppenheim","Got it, okay and then I guess secondly then in terms of the acquisitions and had that one in Kansas City in the first quarter, clearly you\u2019re well on your way to selling the multi family community to 233 million sold out of this week, as you think about buying the communities. Are you more cautious in the ability to buy based on having discipline in terms of looking for the right yields in those given the competition in the markets right now.","Eric Bolton","Well, certainly the market is very competitive, but I continue to believe that as we get later in the cycle and more the new products comes online, we typically see that point developers and equity partners become a little bit more likely that want to monetize your profit soon or rather than later.","It\u2019s lease up and depending on the locations can become little bit more challenging and you throw on top of that, the prospect of rising interest rates or highest cost of capital and I think the motivation to monetize profits from some of these developers grows even more and so I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re likely looking at conditions weakening to a point where the environment becomes the buyers markets by any means but the ability to source better buying opportunities, I think thus improve slightly and with our execution capabilities as a buyer, we think that that nets out to more opportunity as we get later into the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley.","Haendel St. Juste","Hi, good morning guys. So would you talk a bit more about the price the demand for the assets you\u2019re selling, do the pricing exceed your expectations, what would the type of the buyer that showed up, the definite demand whether any re-trading and was there a portfolio premium or perhaps discount in the negotiation for the price?","Eric Bolton","Well, I think that, I mean this is a group that we\u2019ve known for a while, we sold some properties to them last year, they have proven themselves as being a very credible buyers able to execute very well.","And so we \u2013 and so we\u2019re going to look at our disposition plans for the year, we had conversations with them as well as few other groups and felt like that we would probably achieve better execution and better net returns for our shareholders at approaching this on a sort of a bulk basis transaction portfolio if you will.","And so that\u2019s the way we went at it and this buyer that is a private equity vary credible representing institutional capital that we talked to and they were interested in everything we had to sell for the year and so we began conversations with them and, no there was no retreading, we gave them an exclusive opportunity and frankly the numbers came in better than we expected and so we were pretty pleased overall with how it turned out.","Al Campbell","I add that because I think that Fannie and Freddie have widened up their spreads by I think 40 basis points over, since the start of the year, I\u2019m just curious that might have be playing any part in your conversations with potentially interested parties for your assets.","Eric Bolton","Okay. Think about, when they increase their spreads the treasure rate also came down and the other side of that to help that as well, I think Haendel but in various comments that, we didn\u2019t feel that in this transaction. ","Al Campbell","No, not at all and I know that, the buyer for these assets is using Freddie financing and so, they were pretty pleased with, I know they moved early this year to lock in their rates and we do feel that, there was reason to move sooner rather than later on these disposition plans for all those reasons and so we glad we got it done.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay, and then for the three end of contract wondering if you can talk a bit about how much, talk about absolute dollars perhaps cap rates are they pretty similar to what you sold already and may be markets if you wish?","Eric Bolton","Well, the assets that we have are in two other smaller markets, we\u2019ve got another and another asset in Memphis, we\u2019ll be exiting two more smaller markets as a consequence of these last three sales, prefer not to get into pricing at this point. But it\u2019s going to be very much along with what we\u2019ve been doing.","Al Campbell","And the volume will pretty much complete our guidance expectations for the years, that gives you the remaining dollars.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Lesnick of Capital One.","Tom Lesnick","Hi, thanks for taking my questions, I heard you mentioned that strengthening job market in some of your secondary markets but I\u2019m just curious is there any evidence and otherwise of an uptick in wage growth in any of the secondary markets, are you seeing less sensitivity from the rent increases?","Eric Bolton","We have not seen much sensitivity to rent increases from resonance that move outs for rent increases remain roughly flat and then our rent to income ratio has held steady at about 16.5% as we\u2019ve gotten through. So something is the correlation between the increases in rents is being supported by increases in wages looking at that ratio.","Tom Lesnick","Okay, nice and then just a bigger picture question, Eric, I know you guys are just getting through the integration but just given recent deal activity and consolidation in the apartment sector that there is still several pure plays of these department entities both public and private still out there, are you guys amicable to further deal activity, what\u2019s your mindset as you come through the entire problem stays turns out right now.","Eric Bolton","Well, I\u2019m not going to speculate on M&A activity overall but I do believe that our focus is just continuing to strengthen our earnings platform through executing on the strategy that we\u2019ve laid our and we\u2019re excited about the trends that we\u2019re seeing and what\u2019s being accomplished.","Having said that I mean yeah I mean we\u2019re always we talk to folks all the time and we\u2019re always interested in exploring a new investment opportunities. And so we remain in the market.","And we\u2019re obviously learned a lot through the process with Colonial, we feel very good about the platform that we have in place and we\u2019re glad to see the dust settle little bit and we\u2019re perfectly content to continue refining what we\u2019ve got and improving what we\u2019ve got.","But we\u2019re also interested, always open to other ideas and opportunities. So we\u2019ll see what the future holds.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities.","Rich Anderson","Thanks good morning.","Eric Bolton","Hi Rich.","Al Campbell","Good morning, Rich.","Rich Anderson","So the last three remaining are apparently much larger assets if it\u2019s three assets under million or so. Is there anything about the size and assuming I have that right, is there anything about the size of the assets that\u2019s making at slower processes as it to that same private equity buyer?","Al Campbell","It\u2019s with the same buyer, and no I mean there is nothing in particular about the size that\u2019s making an challenge, we just staged these things to accommodate their needs and they\u2019re all under contract and we\u2019re pretty confident it will happen but yeah you\u2019re right I mean the one of them in particular is large community over 1000 units. So but no complications per se that I can point to you.","Rich Anderson","Okay and then some people are asking whether or not you should be raising your guidance and you\u2019re talking about the tough back half comps, but maybe if I think about little bit differently do you think you executed even faster than you thought you might have going in and hence earlier than expected dispositions maybe weighs on your FFO growth more than you thought. Is that a rationale line of thinking?","Al Campbell","Well I think there\u2019s some truth to that I think that\u2019s part of it, but I think it\u2019s really the uncertainty surrounding acquisitions more than anything that causes us to be reluctant to jump on any kind of increase at this point.","I mean we felt like that that the value opportunity, the value creation opportunity associated with expediting as quickly as we could on the dispositions made sense. And even if the risk of pressuring earnings a little more than we expected this year we think it was the right thing to do long-term from a value perspective.","And the acquisitions as I said earlier I mean we\u2019re talking to lot of people about lot of different ideas right now and a lot of different opportunities. It\u2019s competitive and the thing that\u2019s easy to do right now is lose your discipline and we\u2019re not going to do that.","And so we\u2019re going to remain patient, I\u2019m encouraged with the deal flow, I\u2019m encouraged with the activity that we see taking place in our transactions team. And we\u2019re having lot of conversations and there\u2019s lot of reason to be optimistic.","But I can\u2019t be certain and so we just think at this point be a little bit cautious on our ability to put the money to work and hopefully we\u2019ll have something good to say later this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky of RBC.","Michael Salinsky","Good morning guys.","Eric Bolton","Good morning.","Michael Salinsky","Eric where you see the better opportunities currently either primary or secondary and as you\u2019re underwriting growth rates on transactions to-date. How does the growth rate being underwritten for a primary market, compared with secondary market just at this point of cycle?","Eric Bolton","Well I\u2019ll tell you the buying opportunities are pretty competitive across the Board, I mean we\u2019ve been looking at transactions down the South Florida, Atlanta, Phoenix, based on what we believe is very reasonable, not conservative by any means underwriting deals trading at sub-5 cap rates.","We\u2019ve just lost on a couple of deals in secondary markets like Kansas City and San Antonio foreign capital buyers sub-5 cap rates and so it\u2019s pretty aggressive across the Board and I think that it\u2019s for us what we\u2019re finding more opportunity with right now is talking with developers on deals that are either getting ready to get started or they\u2019re in lease up.","And I think that there is some evidence building that folks were getting a little bit more anxious to go ahead as I said in my comments to monetize their profits that they\u2019ve got and we\u2019re looking of course to bring brand new product into the portfolio on something less than a full retail price.","And that\u2019s where we find those opportunities generally is at this point of cycles with developers who are in the early stages of development and\/or lease up and we\u2019re comfortable taking on the lease up risk. ","And that gets us to that question you\u2019re asking about sort of rent growth. And of course it varies in underwriting, it varies a lot by market obviously, but I would tell you that we\u2019re probably a little bit more cautious in our rent growth forecast in today than where we were say a year ago or two years ago I just feel like we\u2019re little further into the cycle.","I think that supply continues to not be a worry some trend at this point relative to the demand side of the equation. But I would not be as aggressive today in underwriting as I was a year or two ago.","Michael Salinsky","That\u2019s helpful. And just thinking little along the same lines there as you mentioned development potential, see potential buying out and take on lease up risk. What\u2019s the right spread today I think you mentioned a 5 to 5.5 cap rate.","What\u2019s the right spread on property where you will take lease up responsibility versus a ground up to justify the other risk particularly at this point of cycle?","Eric Bolton","Yes it could be 100 to 150 basis points is generally what we\u2019re looking at and I guess again it varies somewhat by specific opportunity and other metrics, but we\u2019re looking for 100 to 150 basis point spread generally.","Michael Salinsky","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Omotayo Okusanya","Yes good morning two quick ones from me. The first one I may have missed this but could you give us a sense of just your general outlook for Texas at this point just kind of given all the oil and gas concerns?","Al Campbell","Sure Tayo, the Texas in general I just batted around by market is Houston is performing admirably for us at this point, the feedback we get from our folks on the ground is makes us one to monitor closely the oil and gas jobs were having affect in greater Houston, we\u2019re not seeing that affected our properties at the moment.","But we remain attuned to them, Austin continues to move on along and do very well we\u2019re excited about it honestly and it seems to be managing a new supply well, which tends to be focused more on the Downtown, central Austin area.","And then Dallas and Fort Worth, Fort Worth honestly little more encouraged than Dallas, but both are good. Dallas just has heavy supply in Uptown moving up to a Plano, which affects just probably three of our properties in the Medical District and little new construction around Las Colinas.","But we\u2019re still optimistic about say Texas in general, the oil and gas concerns in Houston are benefits to those other markets who are paying less at the pump.","Omotayo Okusanya","And that\u2019s helpful. And then just in regards to asset sales going forward and I know you\u2019re planning to do stuff in a more match funded basis going forward. But could you just talk to us especially in the secondary markets about just how deep the buyer pool is there.","I mean you\u2019re doing a lot with this one private equity shop, but kind of who else is missing around and what are they kind of and in general don\u2019t know just how strong is the market in those secondary markets where you\u2019re looking to sell?","Eric Bolton","Yes I would tell you it\u2019s very strong, I was alluding to some of the pricing that we\u2019re seeing recently on some transactions in Kansas City and in San Antonio, but we get calls all the time from folks who are looking deploy capital in secondary markets and multi-family real estate and these are smaller buyers to institutional buyers along lines of who are selling till today.","So it\u2019s quite strong, I mean and we\u2019re of course - Fannie and Freddie and the agency financing is wide open for secondary markets as well. And so I think that as a consequence of exiting these 11 markets this year that I would characterize smaller, more tertiary in nature than most of the residual secondary markets that we have left over, I would think that the buyer approval for any future sales that we may have would be a strong or stronger than what we\u2019re seeing right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","Good morning guys. Question, on second half of the year just given what you're saying with the expense growth comps, as well as possibly flat to slightly down occupancy, the revenue growth, and the NOI growth is going to have mostly come from rent growth. Can you kind of quantify how ROI renovations you\u2019ve done since Colonial acquisition may kind of help boost revenues? And then also whether many turnover they are expecting in the second half of the year, whether you look at that as an opportunity to maybe get into the units and tune things up to get better rents?","Eric Bolton","Drew we did about 2000 units on the Colonial side last year and we will do about similar for a total of 4000. So on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re going to be doing about the same, so the comparative bump is not materially there. If we do units sooner, which were running a little bit ahead, we will do that but all in all it\u2019s about 20 basis points of revenue bump that will come from the redevelopment program.","Now we're also mid-way, really early in the roll-out, very early in the roll out of our washer and dryer program and it works very similar to our redevelopment program being essentially adding washer dryers to the mix, to the unit and charging additional fee.","We test that, we run that, just like we do the innovated program, that could generate about an extra half million dollars in the back half of the year.","Drew Babin","Okay. I appreciate the detail. And then on - lastly just on Raleigh and then kind of Florida in general markets where the rent growth has been kind of below average for different portfolio, just maybe talk about Raleigh and how a supply maybe not - supply growth may or may not be trailing off there. And can you just about Florida, there is always some supply in Florida, it is not always the highest quality supply but what do you think is underpinning some of the marginal weakness in multiple Florida markets?","Eric Bolton","I'll start with Raleigh and what I would tell you Drew is obviously we \u2013 that's been a high sales growth market - a high delivery market for a while, it's been specifically high in that Brier Creek area which we have high exposure to.","We are pretty encouraged that that is stabilizing and we like our rent trends so far in Raleigh and we like where we\u2019re going. Just to give you an idea, average occupancy in Raleigh right now is 95.6, exposures is just 8.1. That is down 260 basis points from the prior year. And April blended rents were 3.8.","So honestly we feel like our portfolio on Raleigh is rebounding now. I'm pleased to continue.","On the Florida side, honestly we\u2019re pretty excited with what Jacksonville, and Orlando and Tampa are doing right now and feel pretty good about them going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Segall of Green Street.","David Segall","Hello. I was just curious on the developments. Do you have any sense of why was the stabilization date delayed by a quarter for both Riverside and Bellevue. And also why the budget increased slightly since last quarter?","Eric Bolton","I will address - in Bellevue we had some weather delays over the winter that pushed us back a little bit but everything is on track at this point and so just some weather delays. In Jacksonville, we just ran - the developer ran into some construction delays that were just fairly minor in nature but in an effort to just be sure that we had the property at a point where we were comfortable allowing people to move in, we just pushed delivery back to just a tad.","And as Tom mentioned, our preleasing is going extremely well there and so we are delivering units there starting I guess next week, and move-ins are starting next week but the properties are already 58% preleased. So with returns and expectations on both of those deals are very much intact.","Tom Grimes","The increase in the cost, I\u2019ll just give you little color on that is really primarily capitalized taxes and the interest because of the slight delays Eric mentioned and obviously on IRR basis that's the same cash as we had expected, it is no difference, it doesn\u2019t impact the returns.","David Segall","Great. And do you have a sense of the expected yield on the Fredericksburg expansion?","Tom Grimes","Probably about 6 to 6.5 on that expansion which is kind of a wholesale price as we talked about, as Eric talked about of course we look to capture not a full development yield but pretty close.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi it's, [indiscernible] with Jordan. Just wanted to touch on CapEx for a moment, you guys mentioned on the dispositions, CapEx is running in about 1200 per unit. In the first quarter it looks like CapEx was little over $10 million, I'm not sure what that was on a per unit basis but just curious what you\u2019re expecting on the residual portfolio from a CapEx perspective?","Tom Grimes","For the full year, we expect just over 900 to 915 a unit for the same-store portfolio. The first quarter CapEx was a little below the run rate for the year but on the $52 million recurrings that we expect for the full year, so you can do the math on that.","Eric Bolton","915 inclusive of - people have different definitions of what CapEx is but that includes both what we refer to or often people call both recurring and revenue enhancing. So that\u2019s an all in number if you will and 900 to 915 for the remainder of the portfolio.","Tom Grimes","For recurring, we expect about $52 million for the full year, so you can back into what is remaining for the last three quarters.","Jordan Sadler","It's Jordan here with [indiscernible]. I had a question regarding the gains reported during the quarter, a big number $134 million on the steps that teed up and I suspect there is going to be something incremental one, what's the total number expected for the year and then what are the plans for those gains as you see it now, are we going to 10.31 and then I\u2019ll go from there?","Tom Grimes","Those are book gains, not tax gains, I will start with there, but we do expect significant tax gains that are sort in line with those numbers. We do expect to have more gains as we sell that remaining tranche in the second quarter or early in the third quarter when it occurs.","And obviously we don\u2019t expect a special dividend or anything like that related to it because we do plan to use both [indiscernible] and other tax planning techniques or strategies to cover that. So we are not concerned about any dividend issues or things along that line?","Jordan Sadler","And so as it relates to - so what do you think the total gains will look like either book or taxable however you want to present this, I suspect that taxable would be higher than book, but that's just a guess.","Tom Grimes","Tax gains will probably somewhere in the 225 to 250 range. And as we mentioned we have strategies that we expect [indiscernible] and other strategies to have all that cover but that's what we expect.","Operator","Our next question comes from Buck Horne of Raymond James.","Buck Horne","Good morning. Thanks for the time here. Going back to the supply picture question. Just, I mean it's pretty strong acceleration in some markets that have been notable for the amount of new deliveries that have been coming to them whether it's Austin, Charlotte, Houston those types of markets. You've spoken to this a little bit, but I guess what I'm trying understand is to what extent do you think the portfolio is kind of insulated from that supply pressure given you made the bulk of deliveries going to urban core product and I guess the real question is, are you seeing any signs that the developers are extending out into the suburbs and to your areas? Do you think that, that might add to supply pressure going forward for your portfolio?","Tom Grimes","Buck, of course it varies a lot by market but broadly speaking I think you\u2019re right and where most of the supply pressures are happening in some of those markets that you mentioned are in more or sort of urban core area and candidly that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing the buying opportunities that we\u2019re talking to folks about and those markets are in those urban core areas and I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see most of the - to the extent that the supply creates pressures on rent growth and any of these sub markets that's where it is going to be.","And so that\u2019s where we are hunting for opportunities right now. But I think that a lot of our existing product in some of these larger markets are in some of the more suburban locations as Thomas, Michigan, Austin, in Houston, in Dallas, and in Fort Worth and Charlotte I mean the trends are pretty good, we\u2019re talking about Raleigh there earlier Brier Creek is a high end sub market area carry their holding up.","They've got a little bit of supply last year and we\u2019re little weak last year but the trends are pretty encouraging this year. And so I do think that as we get into this later part of the cycle where supply continues to come in, and I mean right now the demand is strong and we\u2019re not concerned with any of the trends that we\u2019re seeing and of course you\u2019re never concerned until you are concerned.","And I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to be the supply side of the equation. It\u2019s going to really disrupt the train if you will, I think one day something will happen on the demand side and things will start to slow and that\u2019s where you will run into some more those of moderation in terms of our ability to push rents.","I don\u2019t see that happening anytime soon but that is typically the way it happens and that\u2019s why we feel like it\u2019s important to keep a presence in some of these smaller secondary markets that we\u2019re in because they tend to not see the supply pressure and they don\u2019t tend to get as out of balance if you will at any point and we think that it\u2019s an important part of protecting sort of the full cycle profile that we\u2019re after.","So, at this point I mean we\u2019re still not seeing anything on the supply side, it causes us any real worry and wherever there maybe, little pockets here there generally where we are not but I think that's also going to create some buying opportunities for us.","Buck Horne","Very helpful. And just real quick, and any signs in the turnover ratios for move-outs due to buying or renting single family homes, anything noticeable there and the turnover is slow, but any color you can provide on that is helpful.","Tom Grimes","Buck it went from - buying house went from 18.7 to 18.8 of move-out, I mean it\u2019s just flat and it\u2019s not moving and it\u2019s staying low honestly, same on move-outs to renting.","Eric Bolton","Yes, move-outs to renting is constitutes about little over 7% of our move-out right now and for 20 years this has been in the 5% to 7% range. So it is - we just continue to not worry about single family housing either for sale or for rent product is being a pressure point for us.","To the extent that the single family housing market starts to show some meaningful recovery, I think that happens only because the employment markets are getting continued stronger and I think that works in our favor as well.","Operator","This concludes our Q&A session. I would like to return the call to Eric Bolton, for any concluding remarks.","Eric Bolton","No further comments from us. If you have got follow up questions please call us and we will see everyone at NAREIT. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Welcome to the MAA Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 01, 2018.","I\u2019d like now to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA.","Tim Argo","Thank you, Savanna, and good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Tom Grimes, our COO, and Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and our \u201834 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call will be available on our website.","During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Tim and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call this morning. Overall, same-store and FFO performances for the fourth quarter were in line with our expectations. Leasing fundamentals and results reflect higher levels of new supply primarily impacting the higher in price point properties, offsetting some of the supply pressure at our higher price locations has been the steady results captured from our more moderate price properties located mostly in suburban, submarkets in a number of our secondary markets.","MAA\u2019s diversified and balanced portfolio strategy is performing, as we would expect at this point in the cycle. As we consider 2018, we believe the year will unfold initially with leasing performance much in line with what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of quarters, as new supply continues to come online.","However, we continue to believe that based on moderating trends for the permitting of new construction, that we are nearing the trough for this cycle, and with continued good job growth we expect to capture improving pricing trends as we enter the peak leasing season.","Tom will highlight more details in his comments, and while is of course very early in the year, performance in January is in line with what we expected. January results continued with strong occupancy. In fact, daily occupancy in January across the same-store portfolio was 40 basis points ahead of the same point last year.","Importantly, this strong occupancy provides the support needed for positive pricing traction, and we\u2019re encouraged that effective pricing in January across the same-store portfolio was slightly ahead of the growth rate in January of last year.","Our long-established strategy built around a goal of optimizing results over the full cycle continues to deliver solid downside protection to MAA\u2019s earnings stream. And with the strengthening of the balance sheet that we\u2019ve accomplished over the past few years, we\u2019re confident not only in the solid support for our various coverage ratios, but importantly we\u2019re also well positioned for any compelling investment opportunities that might emerge over the coming year.","We continue to feel that our focus on the strong job growth Sunbelt region offers the best opportunity for capturing the superior full cycle results that we\u2019re after, the continued strengthening of the economy and the growing appeal of the more affordable region and markets where we focus shareholder capital continue to support our strategy for long-term value creation.","Our development pipeline also continues to deliver new earnings growth at attractive yields. And while both our development portfolio and lease up properties represent a drag on earnings in 2018 with almost 2,500 units, this pipeline will become increasingly productive in 2019.","We have a number of other development opportunities that we're currently underwriting on both existing land sites we own as well as additional new opportunities and we\u2019d expect to see a couple of new projects or so get underway late this year or early 2019.","As described in our earnings release during the fourth quarter, we closed on the new acquisition in Nashville in the very appealing West End submarket near Downtown. The transaction is typical of the acquisitions we've made over the past few years namely a property that had previously been under contract, actually in this case, a couple of different times with a seller that was highly motivated and with a very short close window. We were successful in performing for the seller and closing the acquisition the last week of 2017.","We have several other opportunities under review, but pricing and competition does still remain very robust. Final steps and activities surrounding the full integration of the MAA and post operating platforms are underway and we expect to be fully consolidated on the same operating systems and platform later this year.","We're making significant progress on the redevelopment opportunities within the legacy post portfolio and our team plans to accelerate activity on this opportunity in 2018. We continue to feel very good about each of the variables we've previously discussed that drive the long-term value proposition associated with the post-merger. Before associated with Post merger.","Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work and efforts surrounding the integration that has been completed today in merging MAA and Post. You\u2019ve accomplished a lot and great progress has been made. The MAA platform continues to build strength.","The long-term value proposition offered by our strategy, the strengthening of our platform and the commitment our team has in generating value for those served by MAA is compelling. We look forward to executing on the growing opportunities in front of us during 2018.","That\u2019s all I have in the way of prepared comments, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.","Tom Grimes","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our operating performance came in as expected. Revenues for the fourth quarter were 1.8% over the prior year with 96.2% average daily occupancy and 1.7% effective rent growth. Expenses increased just 1.3% over the prior year and NOI increased by 2.2%.","Looking at revenues, revenue drivers by portfolio in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year, the legacy MAA portfolio generated revenue growth of 2.6% with 96.3% average daily occupancy and effective rent growth of 2.4%. The legacy Post portfolio had slightly negative revenue growth with 95.8% average daily occupancy and flat effective rent growth.","The slight improvement in overall year-over-year revenue growth rate from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was a result of the steadily improving occupancy in the legacy Post portfolio.","Expenses continue to be a bright spot for both portfolios. While it takes time for the improvements and revenue management practices and pricing to show up in our revenues, our programs to more aggressively manage operating expenses have shown more immediate results.","Including real estate taxes which were up 5.7%, overall expenses for the same-store portfolio were up just 1.3% for the quarter. That was driven by improvements in personnel, repair and maintenance as well as property and casualty insurance. We still have room to run with our expense management programs on the post-portfolio and expect continued progress in 2018.","Our operating disciplines are now fully in place and at the current run rate, the savings will continue. January results show the benefit of our consolidated platform. Overall same-store average daily occupancy in January is 96.3%, which is 40 basis points higher than the prior year.","This is driven by 50-basis points year-over-year improvement in the legacy post portfolio. Overall, same-store January blended lease-over-lease rates are up 1%, which is 10 basis points better than the blended rents in January of last year.","Within the legacy post portfolio, blended rents in January up -- were up 0.4% and continue to lag the performance of the legacy MAA portfolio, where blended rents were up 1.3%. Encouragingly however, blended rents within the legacy portfolio in January were up a 130 basis points from the blended rents in January of the prior year.","While we are facing higher supply pressures in the post sub-markets, the improvements in our operating practices at the legacy post locations are allowing us to gain ground on year-over-year pricing trends.","Looking forward, our renewal trends are solid across the same-store portfolio. January lease renewals were up 5.4% with February and March renewal transactions, thus far capturing 5.3% growth. Supply will continue to pressure our new leases, while the jobs to completion ratio improves from 6% to 1% in 2017 to 7% to 1% in 2018, the benefit is likely to be felt in the back half of the year.","Deliveries for 2018 are front loaded with our markets seen 52,000 deliveries in the first quarter, declining each quarter to about half that amount in the fourth quarter. It is important to remember then in 2017 deliveries were lowest in the fourth quarter \u2013 in the first quarter and peaked in the fourth quarter set another way.","The fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018 marked a high point of deliveries in our markets. Job growth is expected to remain robust in our markets at over 2% versus the national average. Permitting is also improving in our markets down 4% versus the same time last year. Dallas and Austin are facing the most pressure.","In 2018, we expect 23,000 deliveries for Dallas and in Austin, we expect 7,000 deliveries. We're encouraged that job growth has remained strong in both markets. Dallas job growth was at 2.3% in 2017 and expected to stay at that strong level. Austin job growth was 1.6% in 2017 and this year in 2017 this and expected to grow to 2.1% in 2018.","While elevated supply levels moderated rent growth, we're seeing good results \u2013 a good rent growth in many markets. Fort Worth, Raleigh, Phoenix and Richmond stood out for the group. Renter demand remained steady and move outs by our current residents continue to remain low.","Move outs for overall same-store portfolio were down 6% for the quarter. Move outs to home buying and move outs to home renting were down 10% down 10% and 9% respectively. On a 12 -- on a rolling 12-month basis, turnover dropped to 50.1%.","As you know the majority of the legacy post locations are in inner loop areas that are seeing the most supply, while this new supply puts pressure on the newer product it creates opportunity on the older product in these excellent locations. There are 13,000 legacy post units that have compelling redevelopment opportunities.","We can make these great locations more competitive by updating the product. We have room to raise the rents and still be well below the rates of the new product coming online. Momentum is building on the redevelopment program across the legacy post portfolio. Through 2017, we have completed 1,700 units. On average, we\u2019re spending $8,600 in getting a rent increase that\u2019s 12% more than a comparable non-redeveloped unit.","For the total portfolio during 2017, we completed over 8,300 interior unit upgrades. On Legacy MAA portfolio, we continue to have a robust redevelopment pipeline of 10,000 to 15,000 units. On a combined basis, with the legacy post portfolio, our total redevelopment pipeline now stands in the neighborhood of 25,000 units.","As you can tell from that release, our active lease-up communities are performing well. Leasing has gone better than expected at Charlotte, in Midtown and Nashville and it stabilized in the fourth quarter ahead of our original schedule.","We are actively leasing Post at Afton Oaks in Houston which will stabilize on schedule this quarter. Our remaining pipeline of lease-up properties at Denton II, Post South Lamar II, Post Midtown and Post River North, and Alcon West End and are all on track to stabilize on schedule.","2017 was a year of significant change for our organization. We started 2017 with two completely different operating platforms and teams. We are pleased the bulk of the integration work of the post-portfolio is now behind us.","We are starting 2018 with a much more aligned and cohesive operating platform and team. We are looking forward to continuing to capture value creation opportunities on both the revenue and expense sides of the equation as we finalize full integration activities in 2018. Al?","Al Campbell","Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. I'm up for some additional commentary on the company's fourth quarter and full your earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally on initial guidance for 2018. Net income available for common shareholders was a $1.08 per diluted common share for the quarter.","FFO for the quarter was a $1.50 per share. Fourth quarter performance includes $0.03 per share as of a non-cash income from the valuation of the embedded derivative related to the per shares issued in the post-merger, and excluding the impact of this embedded derivative earnings results for the fourth quarter were essentially in line with our expectations.","Net income available for common shareholders was $2.86 per share for the full year of 2017. FFO for the full year was $5.94 per share, which includes $0.07 of non-cash income related to the per share valuation offset by a $0.17 per share of merger and integration calls during the year. AFFO for the full year was $5.30 per share, which is for the healthy 66% payout \u2013 dividend payout ratio well below the sector average.","During the fourth quarter, we acquired one community for $72 million and sold two communities for $97 million and in gross proceeds completing our capital recycling plans for the full year. Total book gains of $68 million were recognized related to these dispositions during the fourth quarter.","For the full year, we acquired two communities for a combined total investment of $134 million and sold five communities for combined gross proceeds of a $186 million, which produced an average 15% leveraged IRR for this position portfolio. These sales also produced $127 million recorded book gains and a $132 million of combined tax gains for the year, which were deferred with 1031(b) transactions were covered with other tax planning methods, eliminating any special dividend requirement for the year.","During the fourth quarter, we completed two development communities on plan. Both were expansions on \u2013 up current communities located in Austin and Kansas City, which are now included in our lease-up portfolio.","During the quarter, we also funded $28 million of additional development costs, bringing total development funding for the year to $170 million. Our development pipeline at year-end now contains three communities with the total estimated cost of $214 million, which only $46 million remains to be funded at year-end.","We expect NOI yields to average 6.3% on these development communities, when it's completed and stabilized. Our lease-up portfolio now contains five communities, totaling 1,538 units, including the community acquired in lease-up during the fourth quarter with average occupancy for the group of 62.5% at quarter end. We expect to stabilize one of the communities in the first quarter of 2018, three during the second half of the year, and the final community early next year.","Our balance sheet remains in great shape at year-end during the fourth quarter. We paid off $130 million of secured debt as well as $80 million of maturing unsecured notes with our line of credit. And at quarter end our leverage as defined by our bond coverage was only 3.32%, while our net debt was just over five times recurring EBITDA.","At quarter end, 83% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates with well out of maturities averaging 4.7 years. We also had almost $600 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility.","Finally, we are providing initial earnings guidance for 2018 with the release, detailed in our supplemental information package. We\u2019re providing guidance for net income for diluted common share, which is reconciled the FFO and AFFO in the supplement. We're also providing AFFO in the supplement.","We\u2019re also providing guidance and other key business metrics expected to drive performance for 2018, a number of which were outlined in our recent Investor Day presentation provided at NAREIT. Net income per diluted common share is projected to be $1.78 to $2.08 for the full year 2018, and FFO is projected to be $5.85 to $6.15 per share or $6 per share at the midpoint, which includes $0.08 per share of final merger and the integration costs related to the post-merger.","AFFO was projected to be $5.24 to $5.54 per share or $5.39 at the midpoint. The primary driver of 2018 performance is same-store NOI growth which is projected to be 2% to 2.5% for the full year based on 1.75% to 2.25% revenue growth and 1.5% to 2.5% operating expense growth.","Our revenue projections include continued strong occupancy levels through 2018, ranging 95.75% to 96.25%, combined with projected average blended rental pricing on new leases and renewals in the 2.75% range for the full year.","We expect revenue performance to begin the year near the bottom of the range and improve over the course of the year as we expect supply pressure to moderate. We generally expect modest growth in operating expenses for 2018 with real estate taxes continuing to the only area expected pressure and well below the price level growth, real estate taxes are expected to increase 3.5% to 4.5% range for the year.","We project acquisition volume to range between $300 million and $350 million for the full year including several lease-up deals. And given the significant recycling of assets over the last several years, we aren\u2019t currently planning for any dispositions in 2018. We expect to end 2018 with our leverage around 34% on a net debt to gross assets basis well within our long-term range.","Also, another important consideration for 2018 is our projected average effective interest rate range of 3.8% to 4% which is about 45 basis points to 50 basis points above the prior year at midpoint, which represents about $0.18 per share impact to our earnings.","Nearly, half of this projected increase is impact of rising short-term interest rates on our value rate debt, based on three interest rate increasing by the Fed over the course of 2017, in our projection of three more during 2018.","Declining interest capitalization, as we complete the construction of our development pipeline, produces another portion of the increase about a quarter, with declining mark-to-market adjustment related to the debt acquired from the Colonial and Post mergers producing the remaining portion of an increase for 2019.","Our guidance also assumes to incur final integration costs to $8 million to $10 million, as we complete our systems integrations related to the recent Post merger. And that our totally gross overhead costs, which is a G&A and property management expenses combined will range between $89.5 million to $92.5 million, fully reflecting our planned $20 million of overhead synergies, as compared to the combined standalone company calls projected for 2018.","Although we expect continued volatility related to the valuation of the preferred shares and acquired with the post-merger, our projections do not include any valuation adjustments as these adjustments are both non-cash and real impractical to accurately predict.","So that\u2019s all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Savannah, we will now turn the call back over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Eric 2017 was disappointing with the same-store revenue guidance cuts in and ultimate nets, and so when you went through the guidance and budget process this year, do they\u2019ve been changed and what were the lessons learned from 2017?","Eric Bolton","Well, you know, Nick what I would tell you is that as we started last year in 2017, we knew that supply levels were going to be picking up. And they did pick up, as Tom alluded to, peaking in the fourth quarter of 2017.","I think the thing that surprised us a little bit was that we thought that it would peak frankly a little bit earlier in the year and the delays that took place worked against us a little bit.","And then, as the delays occurred and more of this lease-up activity was pushed into the fourth quarter, which as you know, a very slow period of time for leasing. The concession activity proved to be much more aggressive as a consequence of that.","And so, market conditions were more negatively impacted particularly on the pricing angle as a consequence of some of those delays and the seasonality factor that I alluded to.","And so, I think as we think about 2018, we're encouraged as Tom pointed out that there's pretty clear evidence that the supply trends are going to moderate based on the fact that Q1 of this year we're in right now is by far the highest and by the time we get into the year it's half.","So, the question becomes are you going to have more delays? We think there could be more delays, but we're still optimistic that in terms of delays and delivery, but we're still optimistic that as we get to the summer season which is really as you know the peak time for rent growth that we are going to see more moderate pricing or more moderate pressure from the new supply than we did last year.","And so, I think that though this is all predicated of course on the assumption that job growth continues to hold up. And we think that that\u2019s an assumption, that\u2019s a pretty safe bet on the markets that we are in and industries in the country.","So, I give that perspective just in terms of sort of market fundamentals, the supply dynamics and the differences between 2017 and 2018. But the other thing that I think is important to appreciate is the big difference between 2017 and 2018 is that this time last year literally we had just closed the Post transaction.","And we were facing you know a year of essentially operating on two completely different systems and platforms. I think it\u2019s, particularly as it relates to the Post portfolio, it\u2019s important to appreciate the fact that we were dealing also with a tremendous amount of on-site personnel transitions that were taking place.","There was over the course of the first three months last year, we essentially saw a transition of well over half of the managers on-site in the Legacy Post portfolio.","So, that activity if you will it\u2019s hard to put a number on it, but it certainly played into some of the challenges for 2017. The good news is as we start in 2018, we\u2019re in a very solid position. Our teams are set. We\u2019ve got -- while we\u2019ve got a little bit more systems integration work left to complete, we are much more aligned in terms of approach and practices than we\u2019ve ever been.","So, I think as we start this year, we\u2019re feeling much, much more secure in terms of where we are, in terms of market fundamentals certainly in a much more comfortable position from an execution perspective.","And you know that\u2019s a long answer to your question there, but that\u2019s how we kind of look at that's a long answer to your question, but that's how we kind of look at it.","Nick Joseph","No, I appreciate it. But given the elevated supply and I guess the risk of further delays, I mean, what gives you the confidence to increase the rent growth assumptions from what you've laid out in November? It feels like if anything after last year you'd rather be a little conservative to start off the year.","Eric Bolton","Well, a couple of things; one is the fact that we're starting in such a strong occupancy position, actually slightly higher than last year our exposure which is a combination of our vacancy plus our 60 day move out notices that we have is lower.","And so that obviously solid occupancy is important to getting the pricing traction and we're in a better position now than we were this time last year. Having said that, the other thing that we're comforted by is, we have the revenue management platform if you will fully implemented under sort of the practices and approach that we take across the legacy post portfolio.","And so, with that system in place, the stability and staffing I mentioned that \u2013 and the strong occupancy that puts us in a position. Now, having said all that Nick, let me -- I'm just being honest about it as we get into the busy season, we'll see how things play out. There's certainly no guarantee that -- I can't, I mean we're assuming that the job growth in demand side will be there. There's really no reason to believe it won't be.","We -- I\u2019d certainly think there's probably likely to be some delays take place, but we think that in terms of new delivery and some of it may bleed over into the summer.","But having said that, having a little bit more leasing, our supply issues in the summer when leasing activity is elevated is a much better time to have it than in the winter as I talked about is what we saw in the fourth quarter and a little bit in this first quarter.","So, there is a lot of influences here, a lot of factors, but we think that work \u2013 we feel good that the overall expectation that rent growth improves over the course of this year, particularly as we get into the busy season into the back half of this year is a reasonable assumption to make.","Nick Joseph","Thanks for all the color.","Eric Bolton","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird & Company. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Drew Babin","Good morning.","Eric Bolton","Good morning, Drew.","Drew Babin","Question on same property NOI emergence, I'm looking at 2017 over 2016, it looks like the blended portfolio margins increased about 20 basis points and if you \u2013 kind of midpoint of the guidance for 2018, it looks like maybe in the best case it\u2019s another 20 basis points or so.","Are margins approximately where you envisioned them being at this point with the post-merger? And I guess if you include property management expenses in the calculation, would the margins look quite a bit better than what I just described?","Al Campbell","Let me start with that, Drew. This is Al. I think no, I think they\u2019re not where they are that we think they will be ultimately. I think what we expect and we have outlined in our forecast for 2018 some continued capture of expense performance, we are 2% of the midpoint of our guidance there with taxes, so going up 4% at midpoint.","So, there is certainly some continued benefit from that, but we think there is more to go, maybe little bit more expenses, but really more on revenue through the redevelopment pipeline as we talked about it will take a couple of years. We\u2019ve got \u2013 as Tom talked about, we got 13,000 units of inventory there.","So, it will take two years, three years to really work through that. So that will be a meaningful impact. And so, I think there are other things in revenue that we\u2019ll see more as markets improve and we really put more that on the tables, I see. So that\u2019s not \u2013 so we don\u2019t expect that we're at where we're going to be ultimately with those margins, they will improve really more as you move into 2019.","Drew Babin","Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly on the external growth environment, it seems like the market remains very tight for new opportunities. I guess, it\u2019d be helpful, if you talk about the state-wide field expectations on your four-queue acquisition?","And then I guess a broader question you know I guess kind of what's the trade-off between the benefits of potentially in A minus credit rating and the interest savings that might result from that vis-\u00e0-vis up taking your leverage a little bit should some acquisition opportunities that make sense come down the pipe. What are the internal conversations around that been like?","Eric Bolton","Well. I'll talk a little bit about the environment \u2013 transaction environment and the deal in the fourth quarter. And Al can talk about the balance sheet. I you know, I'll tell you Drew, I mean you know we are seeing more transacting \u2013 transaction activity at this point than we did this time last year.","We've got quite a few deals under review at this point. We have you know our guidance of $300 million to $350 million. I mean I can tell you, I mean it\u2019s certainly no guarantee it\u2019ll close, it's in due diligence. But we have you know contracts on deals that probably get us to about a third of that of that way already.","So, we are seeing more activity. And I'm optimistic that this year is going to yield a little bit more you know better buying opportunities than what we've seen. And answer to your other question, generally, I can tell you that you know between the disposition proceeds, we generated last year we carried into this year between the free cash flow that we\u2019re generating as you know and in our assumptions, we\u2019re not assuming any equity issue this year.","We haven\u2019t been in the equity markets in quite some time and so see no expectation to do that. So, if we execute the plan that we have laid out, our leverage will move up just a tad as a consequence to that, if the acquisition environment is even better than we expect and the volume is higher than we have forecast and we\u2019re successful in that regard, then will have to have that conversation about the metrics on the balance sheet. Our coverage ratio, coverage ratios are very, very strong, better \u2013 payout ratio is better than the sector average.","So, we\u2019ve got a fair amount of room to execute some external growth without worrying about any additional capital and without worrying about any sort of pressures on our current ratings. We like the flexibility we have right now and I think that that pretty well defines \u2013 we think we\u2019re in a good spot right now and any notion that we need to work to take our rating up another notch is not something we\u2019re actively thinking about right now.","Drew Babin","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Rich Anderson","Thanks. Good morning team. So, if I can just carry on with that conversation real quickly. So, the acquisition pipeline then becomes a bit more accretive, I would assume since you\u2019re going to find it \u2013 funded with debt and free cash flow instead of dispositions going forward. So, that\u2019s good.","Can you quantify how accretive $300 million of acquisitions that\u2019s good. Can you quantify how accretive $300 million of acquisitions might be for a full year or is that not successful?","Eric Bolton","Well, I\u2019d say it gets a little bit difficult only in the sense that we don't know at this point how leased up if you will those particular assets will be I mean\u2026","Rich Anderson","Okay.","Eric Bolton","On a fully stabilized basis, it becomes pretty accretive, but where we're finding our best place right now are some of the deals that are not quite stabilized, so it gets a little bit more difficult to pull that.","Rich Anderson","Understood. Okay. And then Tom, you mentioned, I think you said 52,000 units of deliveries in the first quarter in your markets, is that right?","Eric Bolton","That's correct.","Rich Anderson","So, if you were to sort of aggregate the whole year, I know it's trending down, but is it about \u2013 is it over 100,000 units of deliveries, if you were to look at the entirety of the year?","Eric Bolton","Yeah. So, it\u2019s a 154,000 deliveries, down about 4% from 2017.","Rich Anderson","Okay. 154,000. And if you would kind of look at the national picture, I don't know if 350,000 units or something like that is about right in your mind, but so you're accounting for newer markets about a third of the supply in the United States, is that kind of in the ballpark out of 25 or 30 markets that you guys traffic in?","Eric Bolton","Oh, that sounds reasonable, Rich. I'm not looking at the overall number, but that sounds appropriate.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And I guess, the question \u2013 excuse me, for the siren in the background. The question is, what has been the history? Maybe, this is a bigger broader question for Eric. What has been the history of the Sunbelt world in terms of the total national supply picture? Is a third kind of been the number for a long time, is it been higher or lower than that and where do you see it going?","Eric Bolton","I think historically it's been the Southeast Sunbelt markets. If you look at percentages in the one of the lines we\u2019re talking about, I would tell you long-term historically has been higher.","Rich Anderson","Okay.","Eric Bolton","I think that we've \u2013 we've sort of been in a different paradigm in the last two years to three years and with some of the more overbuilt markets being some of the markets that five, six, seven years ago, we used to think we're a high barrier.","And so, I think the dynamic, that paradigm has changed a good bit, and as a consequence of that, I think I would argue that a lot of these -- there are no more high barrier markets in a way. I think supply can happen anywhere.","And I think that from our perspective, we've always dealt with supply, worry, supply, risk, and thus ultimately, I believe the best way to capture the performance that we're looking for over a long period of time, is just be deployed in front of demand and we pay more attention to the demand side of the equation, we give the supply side of the equation, its due respect through active diversification and balance in various sub markets and price points, but at least that's how we think about it.","Rich Anderson","Great color. Thanks, guys.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Rich.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi. Good morning. I was just curious, if you could talk a little bit about the specific markets that you're most optimistic about and would expect to be towards the higher end of guidance or above that range? And then any markets that you're concerned that, that could be negative this year from a revenue growth perspective?","Eric Bolton","Sure, Austin. The three that, jump out on the positive side or Jacksonville, Florida, Orlando, and Phoenix, all three of those have some level of supply but great job growth, and jobs to completions ratios are in line and doing pretty well.","So, those are -- those we would expect sort of to lead. On the concerning side, I would tell you Austin and Dallas are the ones that we have the most concern about. Austin actually sees supply go down a little bit next year, but it's still relatively higher rate at 3% of inventory and in Dallas will \u2013 it goes up slightly on supply. And those are the two that we are probably most engaged on.","Austin Wurschmidt","Do you expect Austin or Dallas to produce negative revenue growth in 2018?","Eric Bolton","I think that is positive -- possible, but it would be closer to flat where it's been now.","Austin Wurschmidt","No, that's helpful. Thanks. And then I'm just curious how you're expecting the trend in new and renewal lease rates throughout the year? You've maintained a fairly wide spread between new and renewal lease rate growth. So, what's kind of the expectation moving forward?","Eric Bolton","Austin, I can tell you what is kind of built in the forecasts, and Tom maybe can add some color there. But what we would expect in general it's in our pricing guidance is in our revenue guidance is for renewals to continue essentially as they did in 2017, they were in the 5% to 6% range here, and they will continue strong performance there.","And the new pricing would be the area that we would see the improvement that would take our pricing to two in a quarter two and three quarters to 2.5 at the midpoint. And I would say probably a larger percentage that would come from the Post side of portfolio as there's opportunity for improvement in that this year as we move into the year and we see supply wane as we're talking about our expectations on the back half of the year, but Tom would have some more color...","Tom Grimes","Yeah. No, I just echo Al\u2019s comments, we would \u2013 we\u2019ve seen renewal rates stay steady in the 5%, 5.5% range, expect that to continue where you\u2019ll see -- the gap, if you will, is absolutely widest this time here, it will close as we go into the busier summer season and demand picks up and then we should also as that backend supply outlines that also gives us an opportunity on new leases as well.","Austin Wurschmidt","Fair enough. But you wouldn\u2019t expect new leases to close a significant gap based on the $2.25 to $2.75 that you\u2019ve kind of assumed for blended lease rate pricing, is that fair?","Eric Bolton","That is fair.","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay. And then lastly, just getting one question on the funding side. Are you assuming acquisitions are funded on the line or any capital, anything on the debt side that you\u2019re assuming from an issuance perspective?","Eric Bolton","Yeah. It\u2019s a great question, Austin. We definitely \u2013 we have a $1 billion credit facility, $600 million right now, we definitely, in the short-term, plan to fund activity on the line and as the year progresses, we\u2019ll have \u2013 we have planned bond activity to take that lying down.","We\u2019d like to keep that below half bar at any given time, so that tells you that we\u2019ll play a bond deal probably early in the mid-part of the year and then as we move into the year, we\u2019ll look at what\u2019s on our line and make a decision at that time as well.","So, we do have some planned bond activity in the year to knock that line down. And I would take you into the market there, you\u2019re probably somewhere \u2013 we would probably focus on 10-year and for modeling perspective, I put in probably 4% something that maybe just south of that.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Al.","Operator","And we can go next to Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Conor Wagner","Thank you. Good morning.","Eric Bolton","Good morning.","Conor Wagner","Tom, could you give us a little color on what you\u2019re seeing in Houston and D.C.? And then, you guys have solutions for those markets this year?","Tom Grimes","Sure. To start with Houston, Houston, that was a market that inner loop, we were seeing pretty consistently two months free suburban one month free, let's call it, a late second quarter, early third quarter, and it's tightened up significantly. Occupancies continue to stay strong.","Suburban, we are not offering concessions, inner loop, we have all of our assets stabilized there now, so we don't have anything in lease-up. We are noticing that some of the lease ups might equal \u2013 might offer a month free in specific places and depending on sort of our exposure and fore plan and proximity that we might match it. But across the board, it is \u2013 it's pretty reasonable.","And so, moving on to D.C., I think job growth is I would say in the acceptable range. I think what we're mostly optimistic about in D.C. is sort of execution opportunity, we've got a good team up there, but a lot of redevelopment opportunity, continued low hanging fruit, just as they learn the expense programs are doing a really fine job on that.","And I think we're encouraged by D.C. The fundamentals aren\u2019t there for it to perform like Orlando or Jackson or Phoenix, but it may perform a little better than expected.","Conor Wagner","Great. Thank you.","Eric Bolton","Thank you.","Operator","And we can go next to Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Trent Trujillo","Hi. Good morning. This is Trent Trujillo here on for Nick. So, you touched on Dallas early in the call. I was just curious both looking at Atlanta and Dallas are two of your largest market and both are expected to see heightened supply in 2018, so if you could possibly provide a framework on how you\u2019re looking at these two markets in terms of fundamentals and operational expectations and trends throughout the year, that would be appreciated.","Eric Bolton","Yeah. Sure, Nick. As far as deliveries on Dallas, it will peak like everything else on deliveries in the first quarter. But the supply falls off at a less dramatic rate, let's say, than the overall portfolio. We're seeing some encouraging signs in January there, whereas you know most of Dallas was at four to eight weeks. [Audio Gap] areas are going to be something that we wrestle with most of the year.","Moving on to Atlanta, most of that supply is focused sort of in that Peachtree Road Corridor running from North Avenue in Peachtree, sort of Midtown area, up through Brookwood to Buckhead and Brookhaven. But they are currently short term on Atlanta, concessions are doing a little bit better.","And we've seen a half a month to a month there, that spread in Atlanta follows more the company spread in terms of how deliveries are being brought to the market. And then the suburban Atlanta stuff is pretty solid.","Trent Trujillo","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. Just one quick additional question. On expenses, it looks like real estate tax growth by itself pretty much gets the low end of the range. So how are you thinking about the other components of OpEx?","Eric Bolton","Pretty much all the other components are in modest growth. We haven't -- we have -- expecting significant pressure near the areas, personnel marketing, and other areas of modest growth. So, taxes is the really only area, the midpoint of the entire guidance combined is 2% only area that 4% of midpoint puts a little pressure. Remember that\u2019s a third of the \u2013 little bit a third of your total expense.","Al Campbell","And Austin, our R&M cost, which our total maintenance expense cost, which I would consider maintenance personnel plus all expenses related to maintenance. On the Post portfolio, we've improved it by 10% to 15%.","They're still running about 20% higher than MAA for the year, and we've \u2013 we\u2019ll have continued improvement there as they continue to refine their practices, they're doing a good job. We like where the run rate is right now, and that alone is going to provide some relief to the tax number.","Eric Bolton","Obviously, there's some negative numbers on those other line items too.","Al Campbell","I said another way, to make the math work.","Eric Bolton","Exactly.","Trent Trujillo","Okay. Sure. I appreciate the color. Thank you very much for taking the questions.","Operator","And we can go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Kim","Thanks. Good morning. Your average effective rent per unit of $1,170 per month, increased year-over-year, but it declined sequentially. I realize some of this is due to seasonality, but I was wondering if that sequential decline came as a surprise to you?","Eric Bolton","No, I mean John just real quick. I mean you know the math as well as I do, you come in with a certain ARU and then you re-price with concessions in the fourth quarter, it pulls it down. I don't think that's that out of phenomenon for us.","John Kim","So, just to clarify that the same-store revenue guidance that you have for this year of 2% that will translate pretty much directly to 2% average rent growth? I\u2019m just wondering if there is any other property income or other items that may change\u2026","Eric Bolton","We would expect property income to grow roughly in line with that revenue. So, we expect it to not have a material impact up or down, so that pricing should be the pricing, the carrying in plus the pricing we\u2019re getting for 2018 blended should be the primary drivers of revenues.","Al Campbell","Yeah. Our effective rent growth is expected to be right around that 2% number.","John Kim","Okay. And concessions, do you think they will be peaked or they will peak in the first quarter in line with the supply delivery peak?","Eric Bolton","That is what we would expect.","John Kim","Okay. And then a question on your secondary market performance that's been stronger than your primary market in the last couple of quarters, it sounds like you're not necessarily focused on acquiring in these markets, but I just wanted to clarify this to get your thoughts on that?","Eric Bolton","I would tell you John that we are focused on those markets for additional growth. We continue to like a number of those smaller markets or there are some that we wouldn't expand in.","But there's quite a few of them that we would and what we have found is frankly, the environment, the competitive environment for deploying capital as it has been every bit is aggressive in markets like Charleston and Savannah, in Greenville South Carolina as it has been in some of the larger markets like Atlanta and Dallas. But no, we absolutely are committed to continuing to maintain the broad portfolio profile that we have today.","John Kim","And is that where you're seeing some of the time sensitive sellers?","Eric Bolton","No, it can happen anywhere. The two properties that we acquired last year happened to both be in Nashville and both had that sensitivity associated with it. But we can run into that kind of scenario frankly anywhere.","John Kim","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Dennis McGill with Zelmand and Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Dennis McGill","Hi. Thank you, guys. Good morning. First question continuing on that \u2013 the latest acquisition in Nashville, but the supplemental has that built in 2015. So, I just wanted you to clarify sort of the timing of that, I don't know if that's maybe the start, but just maybe in the lifecycle of that.","And then any additional color you have on how that came about whether that was brought to you or you\u2019re seeking these out more on year-over-year terms?","Eric Bolton","Well, I think that it probably commenced construction at that 2015 timeframe not because frankly it's not stabilized yet. What happened with that particular deal, it was part of the Port City sort of scenario that's unfolding and we heard about the deal early last year, it came to market, we toured it.","We didn't really \u2013 we underwrote it, and didn't really get involved in the process. It went on the contract at roughly 10% more than we had underwrote the deal. Then it went under \u2013 fell out of contract went under contract with another \u2013 and this happened in July went under contract again sometime in September, October timeframe with another potential buyer at a price point that was still 5% higher than what we felt was a good price.","And so, it then subsequently fell out, and they called us in late November, early December highly motivated to get it done and get it done by year end and that\u2019s what we did.","Dennis McGill","Okay. I mean, that\u2019s helpful. Second question, just as it relates to overall supply. I think you talk to sort of the delivery pipeline slowing at the end of this year and what we've seen in a lot of the projections of the national numbers is that the delay in supply being pushed out is also being complemented by more supply being found.","So, it's not a zero-sum game as far as timing goes. How do you get your arms around just the piece of supply that's call it chad or whatever you'd like to call it that just isn't in those numbers, it tends to get found over time? How do you get confident that that's fully captured in the numbers?","Eric Bolton","Well, I mean, in thinking about putting our forecast together, I mean, first of all, we actually see supply delivery peaking in the first quarter of this year, it's actually slightly higher first quarter this year than it was in the fourth quarter of last year and some of that is the slippage that we've talked about previously.","But I think as we think about looking at supply pressure, I mean, we kind of go at it both from a top-down and a bottom-up approach. And you know we look at a lot of the same forecast for supply that everyone else looks at in market studies and other things that we have access to build up our expectations at a portfolio level.","But then of course, we in putting together our property budgets, I mean, we know what's happening in the neighborhoods every property manager, I can promise she knows what new property is likely to come online in 2018 and we have that dialed into our expectations to some level on.","And so, there\u2019s no if you will at a high-level, I think it\u2019s always possible to have a project or two or more not make \u2013 not get into the data, but at the property manager level, I can promise you, they know what is under construction within any kind of proximity to their property.","Dennis McGill","That's helpful. And then, just lastly on the post transaction, you get a full year now under your belt. How would that year compared to the underwriting that was done during due diligence at the time of the pricing and any positives or negatives that you call out relative to the initial expectations?","Eric Bolton","Well, I would tell you that the supply pressure and the performance in 2017 out of the legacy post portfolio was weaker than we would have expected. No question about it. But obviously, we did not execute this merger with a goal towards maximizing opportunity of value in 2017. It's a much longer horizon associated with it.","Having said that, if you go back and look at some of our prior presentations, you\u2019ll see the merger value proposition atomized out in pretty definitive detail, and you'll notice that in most cases almost every case, those various line items that derive that we think is going to drive value out of this transaction are expected to become increasingly evident in 2018 and 2019 and some of even beyond 2019.","So, the only things that I can point to right, rather that we know that we've captured some immediate value on is on the financing side and on the balance sheet side, we got immediately upgraded by the agencies when we announced the deal.","The other thing I would tell you that has been faster than we expected as Tom alluded to some of the operating expense efficiencies that we've captured some of those things happened faster in 2017 than we expected, so we got better performance on that side of the equation.","And as Tom alluded to, we got more to go. The redevelopment opportunity, out of the merger frankly, the redevelopment opportunity within the post assets was actually bigger than we thought it was going to be. And if you look at the sort of the outlook on the value proposition such as redevelopment that we published, it\u2019s the time of the merger announcement versus where we were rather and you\u2019ll see that opportunity has grown.","So, net-net, over the next three or four years, I mean the value proposition from this merger is very much intact. And frankly, a little bit bigger than we thought it was going to be, it\u2019s just little slower coming online than perhaps, we would have thought as a consequence of some of the supply pressure that has come online this year, peaking, we think early this year and but we still feel very, very good about, about the transaction.","Dennis McGill","The thing about it from a cash flow standpoint year one would have been slightly below or below where you underwrote, but the overall cash flow stream would have been higher\u2026","Eric Bolton","Correct.","Dennis McGill","Or would stand higher today.","Eric Bolton","Correct.","Dennis McGill","Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Rob Stevenson","Good morning, guys. Al, just you have answered the same-store expense question I guess a couple of different ways. But another way to look at it is, the \u2013 so at the 2% midpoint, how much higher would that be without the expense savings out of post that you\u2019re recognizing in there?","Al Campbell","Rob, it\u2019s hard to -- I haven\u2019t got that math in front of me, but I would, I would -- somewhere in the range of 50 basis points to 75 basis points kind of range and just let me give a little more color on some of the performance. I probably didn\u2019t do a good job on the first question, but yeah, there are some items that we are getting some, continue get some negatives.","If you look at 2% performance with continued 4% on real estate taxes with, which is just over 30-year portfolio, still stronger performance, up above 1.8% year in 2017. And so, we\u2019re definitely continuing to get some synergies from R&M and some other areas maybe -- and one area is insurance I should bring in. We are -- our renewal is July 1.","We had a very good renewal in 2017, had a reduction in expenses and we expect that we project in this year's renewal in 2018 to have an increase, but the net effect for the year is still reduction. So, all those things together bring us to that 2% and I think probably without some of the things we\u2019ve talked about 50 basis points maybe 75 basis points higher.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And does that \u2013 then that includes the changes that you guys have made at Post on the personnel side that savings?","Al Campbell","Yes.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. So, I mean, another way to think about it I guess is, are you guys seeing upward pressure within the core Mid-America portfolio on wages at the property level, but sort of saving it by reducing headcount at the Post properties, is that accurate?","Al Campbell","No. No. I mean \u2013 frankly both portfolios have been in pretty good shape on the \u2013 on that line item and our folks have been thoughtful about how they spend their dollars on site and the \u2013 the Post portfolio has made it better, it\u2019s not covering up a weakness in the Mid-America side.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. So, you're not really seeing any material increase in wages at the property level like some of your \u2013 some of your peers are talking about 5% increases in wages at the property level, which obviously is another big component of the same store expense load?","Al Campbell","Our forecast includes and we have plans in place 2.5%, 3% range for that.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Perfect. And then Eric, how\u2019s the board thinking about I mean read to that a tough whatever you want to call it three months, six months, nine months, 12 months here, the stock is after sort of peaking up around 110 is now another bad day, tomorrow could push you guys under 90.","How do you -- how does the board sort of thinking about you know share repurchases and possibly selling additional assets. You don\u2019t have any dispositions in your guidance as of yet, but if the stock continues to get weak or weaker, you know is that plausible alternative for you guys or is that still not enough of a discount to utilize capital for that?","Eric Bolton","No, we very much think about it, Rob. And you know obviously at some level of discount to value that becomes a compelling use of capital, compelling in the sense that it\u2019s more compelling than any other alternative that might be presenting itself, whether that be acquiring other properties or starting new developments.","So, we\u2019re very aware of the math, certainly understand the concept. We\u2019ve bought shares back in our history. We have an active program up right now fully authorized. And so, it\u2019s something that we will continue to monitor, but business becomes what\u2019s the best use of proceeds. And of course, with us now at a point of generating you know close to $100 million \u2013 around a $100 million of free cash flow, you know it becomes something that we certainly think about.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","And we can go next to John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead, your line is open. John Guinee, your line is open. Please check your mute function. All right. We can go next to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Tayo Okusanya","Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Just two questions for me. The first one is focused on post properties. Again, you guys closed the merger in December last year, so we're well over a year into this. I do understand and see the merger related expenses dropping in 2018 versus 2017, but still curious about the $8 million or so you expect to spend in 2018 by exactly what does that comprise of?","Al Campbell","Tayo, this is Albert. That is the final portions of integrating our systems and putting our two systems platform together. I think we talked about a bit in our Investor Day that \u2013 that our people and our platforms and our policies and practices have been fully aligned and in great shape.","Really 2017, as we get to the middle part to 2017 what we did with our systems we had two platforms we\u2019re operating. We allowed them to stay apart during the busy season of 2017 really to go ahead and jump on some of the synergies and get our people in our processes gathering.","So that causes virtually all related to the finalizing the systems platform, it will be rolling, we've got all the planning, all the designing, all the testing, and all of that stuff is done, and we're rolling that new system combined platform out through the middle half of this year.","And so, the majority of that costs will fall of $8 million to $10 million in the first two quarters, maybe a little bit trailing in the back part of you, but that's what that is virtually all related to and how you see it fall for the year.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay. And if that spend pretty even throughout the year, is that kind of very first half we did and then any kind of sales off?","Al Campbell","Very first half weighted and telling off in the third and fourth quarters.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay. That's helpful. Then the second question, I had was around expenses. Your GNE combined with your property management expense, roughly about $86 million in 2017, but in 2018, it is projected to increase to $91 million and that also includes all the expected synergies from the Post transaction. So, I\u2019m kind of wondering you've got the synergies, but yet that number is still going up year-over-year?","Al Campbell","Yeah. I think a big part of that is as the capitalized cost overhead for our development, and that's why we kind of in our supplemental data in the guidance we laid out a gross and a net title to help with that.","So, bottom line when you're looking at the \u2013 P&L and you put those two G&A and overhead together for 2017 and compare that to our guidance of the net number in 2018, it's about a 6%, 6.5% growth, $2.5 million or so of development overhead is or less is being capitalized in 2018, because we finished the large part of that portfolio.","So, if we take that out it's about a 4% growth which is in line or below the sector average of overhead growth for many years. But the main point I want to make is if you really the reason we put gross in it is because really the number that we are focused on is gross, which is a cash flow for this company that produces the value.","And so, we laid out a plan with the merger to capture $20 million in savings of the two companies standalone, their overhead numbers projected for 2018 to say $20 million off that number. And so, that gross line that we've established in our guidance there does that \u2013 fully does that. And so that's the target we've been focused on, and we feel good about that number, we\u2019ve laid out for 2018.","Tayo Okusanya","So, let me just make so -- I get this. So, the gross number which is \u2013 yeah, the gross number the midpoint of the gross number is about $91 million, total overhead gross of capitalized development overhead is about $91 million.","Al Campbell","Correct. ","Eric Bolton","But again in 2017, that number was $86 million.","Al Campbell","No, no, no, what you\u2019re going to see here that the earnings statement is that net number. So, the midpoint of what you should expect on your modeling on G&A and overhead combined for 2018 is that is the midpoint of that net number.","just below that 87.75 and 90.75 tie them.","Tayo Okusanya","Got you. Okay, okay. And that\u2019s the 4% year-over-year increase you were talking about versus 2017, and both years 2017 and 2018 are inclusive of $20 million of synergy?","Al Campbell","2018 is inclusive of $20 million, 2017 is -- yeah, most of it was in 2017. But 2018 is fully inclusive of it.","Tayo Okusanya","There\u2019s still something I\u2019m not following but I'll take this offline...","Eric Bolton","Let\u2019s, why don\u2019t we take this offline after the call. Tayo we\u2019ll get with you, and get and work through the math.","Tayo Okusanya","Okay. Thank you.","Eric Bolton","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Michael Lewis with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Lewis","Great thanks. I wanted to circle all the way back to the very first question you answered about the same-store revenue guidance. So, you did 1.8% in 4Q, 2.1% for the year, and your range is one and three quarters to 2.75. It looks optically a little bit optimistic and I realize what you said about supply, but I would imagine even first quarter supply, you\u2019ll be competing with those units well until into the summer, even if they don\u2019t get push back.","So, I\u2019m just curious how you stress your model and kind of got comfortable with especially the low end of that guidance range that I think a lot of people may look at, and say you know these guys might have to cut this later in the year?","Eric Bolton","Well, go ahead. I mean, I think that ultimately what we have done is look at the expect, -- with the expectation that a lot of the pressure that we saw on 2017\u2019s results was a function of slippage of units into the weak fourth quarter leasing season and therefore the concession activity that took place of impacting effective pricing was ultimately a lot weaker as a consequence of that.","As we think about 2018 you\u2019re right and that you\u2019ll see some of this lease up going on now taking place in Q2, Q3 but the good news is that the pipeline is quickly falling away based on everything that we\u2019ve been able to see.","And with us starting at a higher occupancy position this year versus where we were at this time last year that gives us, and as I said earlier, us now in a position of having the sort of revenue management platform sort of fully dialed in versus not dialed in on the Post portfolio at all this time last year we just start in a much stronger position.","And so, it\u2019s a combination of we think the market fundamentals are going to work more in our favor as the year plays out versus last year where the market fundamentals were getting worse as we got leading into the weaker part of the year and we have kind of just the opposite scenario from \u2013 in terms of market fundamentals this year.","And then secondly, as I say, the platform is just in a better position \u2013 much better position as we started the year. Occupancy is in a stronger position including the legacy Post portfolio occupancy. So, when you just put all those factors together it leads us to sort of where we are. But as I say and I said earlier, this is all predicated on an assumption that the demand side equation holds up there is no reason to believe that that is unlikely to occur.","So, we\u2019re optimistic that these markets are going to continue to So, we\u2019re optimistic that these markets are going to continue to yield the level of demand that we\u2019re anticipating and as a consequence, we think we will get to where we\u2019ve outlined.","Michael Lewis","And if I'll ask my second question about the legacy Post portfolio, obviously, the negative revenue. I\u2019m wondering, it\u2019s fair to think what\u2019s left still that you do there besides just getting helped out by supply easing in the cycle helping you?","Is there anything kind of I don't know what the word is transitory reason or something that's easily fixed like being on the new platform or the changes you've had to make in personnel? And along those lines too, do you think there's a significant amount of units there that might need CapEx to be competitive beyond just the units you see opportunities to renovate?","Eric Bolton","Yeah. So, I'll take quick run of that. The quick easy pops on the Post portfolio, in terms of performance opportunity right now we\u2019re running 50 basis points ahead on occupancy and we'll have that opportunity over last year, we'll have that opportunity for early part of the year.","The redevelopment opportunity, which I would say is more offensive in nature to make the units more competitive, that is \u2013 we'll probably double that volume this year versus last. And that's an enormous opportunity, that's \u2013 that is offensive in nature. The properties themselves are in great shape.","And then thirdly, there are sort of some curb appeal opportunities there both on the landscape in the physical building that aren\u2019t increasing the dollars that we're spending, but we're getting more bank for buck on the dollars that we're spending.","And then in addition to the revenue management platform, that Eric touched on earlier, we\u2019re starting the year with a team that\u2019s really familiar with the properties, knows their ins and outs, understands submarkets. And this time last year, we were still learning that and everybody is sort of on the same page. Those things give me good hope. I\u2019m optimistic about what the Post portfolio can do in 2018 despite the fact of the market conditions.","Michael Lewis","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Carol Kemple","Good morning. On acquisitions for the year, it sounds like you all have a good pipeline right now. For modeling purposes, do you think it\u2019s better to spread it out evenly or do you think it will be more front end or back end loaded?","Eric Bolton","Probably, spread fairly evenly over the year. We have a couple of opportunities that we think are pretty strong in the first half of the year, but I think I will spread a portion over the back as well, so fairly evenly.","Carol Kemple","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Eric Bolton","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Buck Horne","Hey, thanks guys, long call. I\u2019ll try to be brief. Just going to the renewal rate increases you guys are pushing through, I just wanted to get a feel for your confidence level and that you can maintain your very low resident turnover ratios with still pushing through those 5% renewal increases this year? And maybe related to that, do you feel like your recurring CapEx budget for this year may need to go up to maintain those renewals?","Eric Bolton","No, I don\u2019t think so, Buck. Where we feel like there is an opportunity to improve the product and get an incrementally higher rate, we\u2019re renovating those units and that opportunity. And there is generally very little transaction involved with renewal and CapEx spending. Generally, they're making the decision based on their lifestyle at the time in the service and the value that we've created with them.","And our teams are near obsessive in terms of how they work to serve our residents and capture that. And so, you know our sense is that the \u2013 this 5.5%, 5% to 5.5% will hold steady early into the first quarter, where we're seeing that hold just fine. And it held up through frankly the tougher fourth quarter as well.","Buck Horne","Okay. Thanks. And just a couple of quick market updates that I think maybe just to cover the all the bases. But just thinking, how do you think the year plays in terms of supply pressure in Charlotte and Tampa in particular?","Eric Bolton","In Charlotte, it is mostly focused on the \u2013 and in the sort of uptown, downtown area and south end if you will. And so that is \u2013 it\u2019s about 3,500 units that\u2019ll come in in the first quarter and it drops to 782 by the fourth quarter. So pretty significant fall off you know in sort of a linear fashion there.","And then in Tampa, you know Tampa is actually we're seeing jobs to completions in Tampa and you know this well is jumping from five, four to nine there. So, with Tampa it doesn't have a huge supply, a lot of that is channel side. But that's a market that has the potential to upside \u2013 to have a stronger upside back half of the year than the company norm.","Buck Horne","Wonderful. Thanks for the call. Appreciate it.","Eric Bolton","You bet. Thank you, Bob.","Tom Grimes","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. And we can go next to Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it's Michael Bill, I'm here in with Nick. Eric, I sort of here with Nick. Eric, I sort of want to just come back in sort of evaluate where in the last 13 months, 14 months have been and clearly what was consistent missed expectations.","And I dial back to August 3, 2016, when you announced the Post-merger and one of the big things that you were talking about back then was different than Colonial, and I think I remember I asked this question about what gives you the confidence of not having any sort of the same recurring issues that happened when you did that merger, and you made a big deal about being on the same type of systems that you've done that before that you're well tested.","And now, what we're hearing is a lot of excuses about why 2017 was more challenging, right, you cut your same-store guidance twice last year and you still fell below what was the most recent cut that you gave with three quarter or third quarter results.","You sort of blame a little bit of Post, you're blaming supply that was delayed, but I assume with supplies delayed that would have helped you earlier in the year when you cut twice. So, I'm just trying to put it all this together and hear a little bit more of effectively an apology of the performance.","Eric Bolton","Mike, I mean, I would tell you that we put together the outlook for 2017, based on the information and the insights that we had on expected supply dynamics, and I think that what -- I mean, going back to the Colonial scenario, I mean that was a completely different set of circumstances and so forth, and now we can get into more detail on that.","But I think as far as 2017 is concerned, we've we wound up seeing the leasing conditions deteriorate more so in the back half of the year and in particular than we expected. And we started getting increasing visibility on that by you know April, May timeframe as projects that were supposed to be at least mark.","And we knew that as a consequence of that, that the leasing would be taking, the lease up activity will be increasingly taking place in a weaker part of the year.","And so, when you get in that kind of scenario, what you\u2019re faced with is okay well how aggressive are the developers likely to get in terms of their concession practices and so forth and you know, we don\u2019t have as good a visibility on that, because you know we don\u2019t know what sort of financing arrangement any given developer has.","And we don\u2019t have any perspective \u2013 as given a perspective on exactly our insight as to you know what kind of pressure they\u2019re going to have to get leased up sooner rather than later.","And so, as a consequence of that, we just saw a concession practices in particularly some of the, you know sub markets like uptown in Dallas get a lot more aggressive. As a consequence of those delivery delays happening and creating more pressure in the back half of the year and the slower leasing season.","So, it is what it is. I wish we had you know it could have had greater visibility on that. But when we started with guidance and in January of 2017, but it turned out the way, the way it did. The only other thing that I would add to this that you know I think probably did surprise us a little bit and fueled some of the weakness in 2017 is when we look at post situation late 2016 and early 2017, we looked at their occupancy, we looked at some of their revenue management practices, we saw a big opportunity.","And we continue to feel very good about that opportunity. To be candid with you, what I was surprised by was how weak some of the onsite leadership was.","And as a consequence of that, what we did not underwrite and what happened is, we wound up having to replace over half the post property managers. And as you may know, when you go through that kind of transition, everything just kind of slows, everything just \u2013 it\u2019s a little harder to get down than you would have thought.","And so, if there's any variable that I'll point to, that really was a surprise, it\u2019s that. One other thing I'll also add though is important to remember is that, the original FFO guidance that we gave for 2017 was $5.82. The report that we just gave is $5.94. Take out $0.07 for this mark-to-market on the preferred $5.80. So, we beat our original FFO guidance for 2017.","Michael Bilerman","Right. Okay. Getting to a number is how you get to a number rather than the number itself, right. So, if we think about even 2018, holding more cash on the line of credit, which doesn't cost too much, you know levering up a little bit potentially doing some accretive acquisitions. The quality of that accretion is not as strong as the quality of operations, right.","And if you think about your operations you started for 2017 at 3.25% same-store NOI, that dropped to 3% in the first quarter, it was held flat in the second quarter results in the summer, where arguably you should have had a better perspective of some of the supply and then, it was dropped 75 basis points at two in the quarter in the third quarter.","And you came out at nearly in mid-November without any sort of update to 2017 and 2017 just fell to 2% to 2.11% 15 basis points below where you thought it was in late October. And so that's a pretty meaningful divergence when all of your apartment peers have generally met or beat their original expectations.","Eric Bolton","Well, what I can tell you is our markets, a lot of our markets solve the supply pressure later than some of the other markets. And this time last year, two years ago, we're come at a lot of supply pressure in other markets. So, the market dynamics got worse in our markets and for our portfolio particularly with Allison and Dallas, and it had the effect it did.","Tom Grimes","Let me add too on the fourth quarter performance, from our perspective, Mike, we didn't miss our fourth quarter performance in revenue. We got the expectations we had, we got there in a different way, we built occupancy a little bit, because concessions were coming down and we thought that was the right thing to do to allow those concessions to build strength for our platform to get better pricing performance in 2018.","And so that's what we did, and that's what we built in our forecast with increased pricing in 2.25%, 2.75%, compared to what we talked about at NAREIT. But from our perspective, we didn't miss the fourth quarter from what we talked about where we outlined our guidance and talked about in November.","Michael Bilerman","Right. Your revenue guidance was you had brought it down to 2% to 2.5% to 2.25% in the midpoint you came in at 2.11%, 2.10%, so that would fall.","Eric Bolton","You cannot range, from my expectation, we never said that our performance was exactly on the midpoint. We have a range and we have a range and we \u2013 and our expectations that drove that guidance and drove the earnings was in line with what we talked about.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll go ahead and turn it back over to you Tim.","Tom Grimes","Thanks, Savannah. We have no further comments. Appreciate everybody joining the call. We\u2019ll talk to you soon.","Operator","And this does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you everyone for your participation.

Eric Bolton","Thanks, Leslie, and good morning, everyone. Before getting into a discussion about our results for the quarter, I do want to provide a quick update on progress surrounding our merger with Colonial Properties. As Leslie mentioned, we are in the SEC review process of the joint proxy statement and prospectus. We expect to have the definitive proxy mailed out to shareholders as soon as that process is complete. We do continue to believe that we will be able to close the transaction sometime in September.","At this point, we are all well into preparations for the integration of the 2 operating platforms. We anticipate having all the appropriate transaction, execution and reporting task up and running on a consolidated basis at closing.","As outlined in our earlier announcement, we expect the full systems integration process will take place over the course of the next 18 months. Our management team is in full consolidation planning and execution mode and we remain comfortable with the earlier assumptions made surrounding synergy gains and the various benefits to be derived from this combination, which were outlined in our prior announcements and presented at the Navy conference back in June.","Assuming the transaction closes as expected, when we release our third quarter results, we will be in a position to provide an updated earnings outlook for 2013 on a combined company basis. The key takeaways from this morning's call are that we continue to feel good about the projections provided at the time we announced the merger on June 3 and that integration work is fully underway and proceeding very well.","Assuming we're able to close our merger sometime during September, our reported results for the quarter and for full year 2013 will obviously have a number of merger-related and one-time transactions included. The overall merger transaction will be recorded as an acquisition for accounting purposes, which, depending on the exact timing of the close, will potentially require the inclusion of MAA standalone results for a portion of the third quarter with combined results for the remainder of the quarter. MAA will record acquired assets at market value and incur a significant portion of the total expected deal cost on the closing date. We intend to provide you with clear communication of the details with our third quarter release, which will be following the expected closing date of the merger.","I also want to take a moment to offer my thanks and appreciation to our hard-working associates at both MAA and Colonial. As with most merger transactions, there has been a significant amount of work going on, a lot of late nights and some tough personnel decisions in connection with putting the 2 organizations together, while also, of course, staying focused on taking care of our existing residents, properties and operations.","Tom Lowder and his management team have been terrific to work with through this process, and we look forward to completing the merger and executing on a successful integration. I want to thank all of our associates at both MAA and Colonial for their hard work and service to our residents, to our shareholders and to each other.","And with that brief update on the merger, I'll now turn my comments to a discussion of the quarter's results. As detailed in yesterday's earnings release, operating performance reflects continued solid leasing conditions across the portfolio, same-store physical occupancy at the end of the quarter at 96%, slightly ahead of last year. Average effective rent for the quarter increased 4.1% as compared to the prior year and grew 1.2% on a sequential quarter basis. Resident turnover remains low with our 12-month turn rate through the second quarter at 57.2%, up slightly from 56.5% at the same point last year.","Move-outs associated with buying a house generate 20% of our turnover through the first half of this year, which is fairly consistent with last year at 19%. Move-outs associated with renting a house continues to not generate any meaningful pressure, driving only 6.8% of our move-outs year-to-date, which is also fairly consistent with what we've experienced over the past several quarters. Move-outs due to the amount of rent increase we're asking have moved down slightly from last year at 12% of our move-outs year-to-date, as compared to 13% last year.","We continue to be encouraged by the steady growth in rents. With our revenue growth year-to-date at 4.6% and based on the full year revenue guidance of 5% to 6%, we obviously expect that current pricing trends will continue over the second half of the year. As expected at this point in the cycle, the Large Markets segment of the portfolio continues to deliver better pricing performance when compared to the Secondary Markets segment. Austin, Houston, National, delivered some of our best results in the second quarter.","We continue to believe that forecasted new supply across our portfolio is unlikely to mature a [indiscernible] in leasing conditions over the next several quarters. The Texas markets continue to enjoy healthy employment conditions and should absorb the new supply coming on line without meaningful deterioration in pricing trends. The outlet for new job growth and new supply across our large tier markets in 2014 remains healthy at almost 8:1, well ahead of what is needed to generate positive absorption and drive what we believe will be continued solid rent growth, exceeding long-term averages.","And as employment trends continued to improve across our secondary markets, we're excited about strengthening leasing prospects and rent growth from this segment of the portfolio as well. As we've commented in the past, our secondary markets generally tend to not be as exposed to supply pressure and we believe bring a stabilizing influence to the overall portfolio's performance as new development ramps up in this phase of the cycle.","Leasing at our 4 new lease up properties continues to go well and was slightly ahead of our forecast. We've been particularly pleased with leasing pace at our Phase 2 lease up at 1225 South Church Street in Charlotte after having received the last of the 210 units in April, the property is already 98% leased and almost 80% occupied. This is very strong leasing and well ahead of our pro forma expectations. We expect to stabilize all 4 lease up projects around year end.","We'll remain active with capital recycling plans, with 4 properties sold during the quarter and 2 properties acquired. From all that we've seen, cap rates haven't moved in the past few months and investor appetite for our apartment real estate in both large and secondary markets remain strong.","That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. And now I will turn the call over to Al. Al?","Albert M. Campbell","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide a few comments on the company's second quarter results, balance sheet activity for the quarter and on our updated view of premerger guidance.","Core FFO for the quarter, which excludes the $5.7 million in merger-related costs was $56.6 million or $1.27 per share, which is $0.05 above the midpoint of previous guidance and 12% above the prior year. Year-to-date, core FFO in the same basis was $111.8 million or $2.53 per share, which was 13% above the prior year. Same-store NOI guidance of 5.5% for the quarter was in line with our expectations and has continued strong occupancy and pricing strength supported total revenue growth of 4.4% for the quarter. Same-store operating expenses increased 2.9% for the quarter, with property taxes and insurance producing the largest portion of the increase. And operating expenses for the quarter, excluding taxes and insurance, increased only 1.4%. Year-to-date, same-store NOI increased 6.6%, based on a 4.6% increase in revenues and a 1.7% increase in operating expenses.","We expect continued solid revenue growth over the remainder of the year, with only slight moderation in the fourth quarter. Operating expense growth over the remainder of the year will be impacted by real estate taxes due to challenging prior year comparisons. Credits recorded in the back half of the prior year produced only about 1.5% growth in real estate taxes, resulting in tough comparisons over the next 2 quarters, as compared to the last year.","Our performance and FFO results for the second quarter was mainly produced by recent development communities leasing and ahead of plan, revised timing of financing transactions and lower than projected G&A cost for the quarter. These items combined to produce about $0.04 per share of favorability for the second quarter, with an additional $0.01 per share coming from gains of settlement of casualty claims, which are included in FFO, per NAREIT's definition.","During the second quarter, we acquired 2 communities, one community was acquired from Mid-America Multi-family Fund I, which was the only remaining community in the fund and that fund is now closed. The second community was purchased during lease up and was 72% occupied when acquired. The gross combined purchase price for both communities was $71.1 million, including an $18.3 million loan relating to the Fund I community, which was assumed by the company.","We also sold 4 communities during the second quarter, for total gross proceeds of $74 million. The 4 communities averaged 23 years of age and were sold for a blended cap rate of 6.6%, that's based on in-place NOI after a 4% management fee and $350 per unit CapEx reserve. And also these sales represented an exit from 2 secondary markets for the company, Athens, Georgia and Melbourne, Florida.","Progress on the company's developed pipeline continued during the second quarter with one community being completed and moving into the lease up growth. We now have 2 communities remaining under construction, with an expected total cost of $73.8 million for 564 units, of which $36 million remains to be funded.","We funded a total of $8.6 million of development costs in the second quarter and expect an additional $25 million to be funded over the remainder of the year.","We also have 4 communities remaining in lease up, 3 developed by MAA and the one recently acquired. These 4 communities were 82% occupied on a combined basis at the end of the quarter and we expect 3 of these communities to be fully stabilized by the fourth quarter, with the final community projected to be stabilized in the first quarter of next year.","We completed a number of key balance sheet plans during the second quarter. During May, we entered foreign interest rate swap contracts to effectively lock the rate on $150 million of our bond financing plan for later this year. Our time improved, fortunately, as we were able to complete the trades before the recent rise in Treasury rates. And given the expected timing of the pending merger, we now expect our bond offering will occur late third quarter or early fourth quarter this year.","Also, after quarter end, we've received commitments from our bank group for a new upsized, unsecured credit facility. The new facility will provide initial borrowing capacity of $500 million with expansion capacity of up to $800 million.","New facility reflects current or improved market pricing and provides the company for liquidity and growth necessary to support the planned larger company. Closing of the new facility is expected over the next couple of weeks.","Our balance sheet ended the quarter in growth position. The company leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 43.2%. Total debt was 6.3x EBITDA and MAA's fixed charge coverage ratio defined as EBITDA to interest expense was a solid 4.2x.","At the end of the quarter, 88% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates over the next 4 years and our total average interest rate was 3.5%. We plan to increase the duration of our interest rate maturities over the long term, with a long-term bond financing plan later this year.","Finally, given the second quarter performance, we're increasing our FFO guidance for the year. We're now projecting stand-alone FFO, excluding the merger related cost, to be $4.83 to $5.03 per share, which is $4.93 at the midpoint. This range represents a $0.06 per share increase over the midpoint of previous guidance.","We're maintaining our same-store guidance, which continues to project solid pricing performance and stable occupancy, supporting 4% to 5% revenue growth for the full year. We expect operating expenses over the remainder of the year to increase 3% to 4% in total, with real estate taxes producing the primary expense pressure for the year as mentioned before.","Given the pending merger, we now expect timing of funding transactions primarily to planned bond transaction to produce about $0.01 per share of additional favorability that is now expected to occur a bit later than previously planned.","AFFO for the full year on a stand-alone basis and before merger-related cost is now expected to be $4.21 to $4.41 per share. And our current annual dividend rate is $2.78 per share.","And that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Howard, I'll turn the call over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Al, just a question for you sort of looking into '14, the focus in the last couple of years relative to the capital structure has been distancing the company from the GSEs and moving towards an unsecured rating. What do you think your top goals will be after the merger relative to balance sheet activities?","Albert M. Campbell","I think we'll see -- you'll see us have a balanced approach is a simple answer to that, David. And we're very proud of where we've come with our balance sheet and we've certainly achieved very good metrics that take us to the bond market this year. We feel like we'll be able to execute our inaugural offering in good position. And so you'll see us, over time, obviously continue to support that platform. But over the long term, continued commitment to our partners to have maximum access to capital will be our plan. So hopefully that answers your question, as to what you're looking for.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","If we start to see rates kind of -- spreads widen a little bit into the end of the year, do you think that would cause you to sort of take any kind of different direction relative to that approach?","Albert M. Campbell","Well, I'll say a couple of things to that. One is on the deal we're affecting -- doing this year, we've already locked in about half of it, we're fortunate with the trades that we did, as mentioned earlier. And where the market is right now, David, I would say that unsecured debt is probably -- it's inside of agency right now. We would probably -- if we did a deal a day, you're probably talking about 4.5% all-in costs. And I think if we did a similar agency deal today, you're probably talking about 4.75% for a 10-year deal, on both of those. So I think you would see us just continue to have a balanced approach, maybe taking, tactically, over time, the best solution at the time, but making sure that we keep our appropriate metrics in balance with what our plans are.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Is there a reason you don't consider [indiscernible] at this point, given your scale and kind of where yields are, would that be an attractive option in a rising rate environment?","Albert M. Campbell","I'll think what we look at it is that given the cost of debt and equity right now, that seems to be the best for our combined cost structure right now. Having said that, if we had a reason to ramp up our development pipeline in some way because of opportunities we had or some other things in our funding change, we would look at that. But I think, right now, debt and equity are our primary sources.","H. Eric Bolton","Certainly, David, we've been in the preferred market in years past. And if conditions weren't going back, we'll certainly do that.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","It seems like if you think about your cost of capital going up in the next couple of years and you can lock in a slice of it at a relatively attractive yield into perpetuity, it might be a nice option.","Albert M. Campbell","There's certainly a lot of demand for that in the marketplace, David.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Yes. And then my only other question, and forgive me if you touched on this, I'm still sort of struggling with the dynamics of the same-store guidance change and I sort of either, I guess, the sort of the changes either imply revenues are a little bit lower to hit the same midpoint as NOI or you're targeting the same revenues, but maybe NOI is going to come in a little bit lower? I guess, maybe help me through some of that dynamics in that range?","Albert M. Campbell","Right, okay. If you take a look at what we've done for the first 6 months, David, revenue's are about 4 6, expenses are 1 7, NOI's 6 6. And if you then compare that to what we have guidance for the full year, we have revenues of 4 to 5. So the midpoint of that is 4.5. So we expect revenues to continue to be solid and maybe that's implying a slight moderation in the fourth quarter, which we've talked about all year. On expenses, I think that's the key. We've had 1.7% increase first part of the year. And the implied guidance is 3.5%. And so, as I talked about, the pressure there is really real estate taxes. We have taxes, we believe, will increase 6% to 7% for the full year. You got to remember though, they're a quarter of operating expenses. And then on top of that this year, we have some challenging comparisons in taxes from the prior year. And the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year, we had some credits, we had some favorable appeals and had some valuations that came in better than we expected. So we had some credits in the back half of last year, making this year's back half a tough comparison for taxes. So, that's really the story of what's going on.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rob Stevenson from Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Al, just to touch a little bit on the -- more on the property tax issue. When you're sitting here today and once you get past the back end of the year with these big increases, is the expectation that the year-over-year growth starts to moderate on the property taxes. I mean in most of your municipalities, are you up to as much fair value or you think that there's probably still more room to run either on the assessment or the mileage rate in some of these areas?","Albert M. Campbell","I think a good way to think about that, Rob, is looking at taxes over the long term. If you look at the last 6 years and you add them all to get an average, including this year, which is 6% to 7% growth, taxes have only -- that's less than 2% growth somewhere around 1 8, 1 9, and 1 7. Eric's got the number there. But -- so I mean long term, its -- we definitely expect it to be in that range. I think this year we and everyone expected the pressure particularly from tax -- particularly from the strong markets where there's been a lot of growth coming online. You may continue to see that a little bit over 2014, but you would expect over the next few years of that to kind of move into more of a normal band.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay and when you look at the colonial portfolio, is that located in anywhere that's behind the times on the property tax issue. In other words, are there big jumps left there or are they move through things just like you have over the last couple of years?","Albert M. Campbell","I think you'll see they'd move through pretty close to us. And as they report today, and as you talk to them, I'm sure that you're seeing similar in taxes this year and probably have similar expectations going forward. And as we blend the portfolios, we don't see any major differences in the trends that we've seen.","H. Eric Bolton","Yes, they're still very similar footprints.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","All right. And then given the move in interest rates, does it have you guys -- you guys have done about half year disposition expectation for the year? Any inclinations given the interest rate sensitivity, probably, on some of your assets that you would probably want to sell of expediting that and raising that capital sooner rather than later?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, I mean, we're constantly looking at it, Rob. But we're pretty pleased with what we've been able to accomplish. We've -- as mentioned so far, we've got several others under contract right now and we are obviously in the process of taking a broader look at the combined portfolio and disposition plans. And I think that we will look at expediting perhaps a little bit more next year. But obviously we're also having to lay a lot of different crosscurrents here. But I think that, broadly speaking, we continue to believe that a steady, disciplined approach to recycling capital is the right approach. And we've demonstrated over the years, a clear ability to exit these secondary markets when it made sense because of where we were with the asset. And Fannie and Freddie continued to demonstrate a high degree of willingness to finance a lot of these assets. And so while we're going to continue to keep -- we certainly have a more aggressive posture in cycling this year than we've ever had. And we'll likely keep the same pace up, I would suspect, over the next year.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","And then, Al, help me understand, if I think about the 1 27 in the second quarter and maybe there's a couple of pennies of sort of nonrecurring stuff in there, then you've got the headwinds from the property taxes and you've just sold $70-some million of income producing assets, and so there's some level of drag from second quarter to third quarter on a core basis. But what would have to happen for you guys to fall all the way down from 1 27 into the 1 16, 1 15, 1 18 sort of range, what is the major driver of the bottom end of the range for both the third and fourth quarters?","Albert M. Campbell","Well, I think -- just to -- one thing, before the major drivers of that to help understand the third and fourth a bit, Rob, is third quarter has historically had its high level of operating expenses. It's the hot summer months and so that is -- if you go back and look, that has been in terms of FFO per share, that has shown volatility in the past and I think you'll see that again this year. In the fourth quarter, what you're going to see is because of our deal volume, we've moved a lot of that in the fourth quarter, we expect a lot of that to close in the fourth quarter. You have acquisition expenses there. And then we've put our deal further back in the year and so when we do the $350 million deal or whatever size we end up making it, we'll be taking our fixed rate debt from 88% fixed to about 93% fixed. So you'll feel that impact in the fourth quarter. So that right off the bat. And I think the major thing that could happen to push us to the bottom or at the top of that range really is significant changes in timing of these transactions, primarily dispositions and acquisitions and the big change in there. And obviously, fundamentals could change, occupancy changes would have a big impact. But I think acquisitions would be the biggest.","H. Eric Bolton","I would tell you, Rob, the biggest variability is the transaction timing that Al's mentioning. I mean we feel pretty good about the operating metrics and the trends there. It's the variability and the timing of transactions that really is the hardest thing to pin down and what drives the need for the range that we have.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","And then just lastly, what's the current expectation for the stabilized yield on the development pipeline?","Albert M. Campbell","About 7.5 to 8 now, Rob.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rich Anderson from BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The stock is weak today and I guess maybe that has something to do with decelerating, I'm not condoning the move, but decelerating same-store in the second half shouldn't be a big surprise, but I guess it is. But the other thing is, Colonial is reporting, I know you're not commenting on them, but they produced 4.3% same-store revenue growth for the second quarter. Some might view that as distracted with the merger and all of that sort of stuff. But let's put that issue aside. I mean do you think that there is a kind of, do the 2 companies have a difference in theory about running property operations and do you think that you, MAA, could eke out more performance in that portfolio, putting aside the synergies and everything else, do you think that you're doing something differently that you can apply there?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, Rich, I mean, that's all to be more fully explored and demonstrated. I mean we are really into the weeds right now on putting the 2 platforms together and we will have a lot more to say about that particular subject after we sort of get the merger closed and we get into projecting 2014 and Q4 2013. But let me also just say that on this notion of decelerating fundamentals. It really, I just want to highlight the fact, we're talking about real estate taxes. Revenues are absolutely hanging in there. We absolutely feel good about the trend that we've posted so far this year and we'll continue to hold up. Revenues aren't moderating, expenses aren't going up with the exception of one line item and that's real estate taxes. And that happens to be because we had a tough prior year comparison because of a bunch of credits took last year, so...","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","If I said decelerating fundamentals, I didn't mean to say that, I meant decelerating internal growth and that's what I meant. And I'm in the camp that, it looks great, so you're preaching to the choir. But let me just ask you just once more on Colonial, did the 4.3% same-store revenue growth, was that in line with your expectations this quarter?","H. Eric Bolton","We didn't have expectations, we didn't define expectations. I will say this, Rich, I mean, clearly, it's been a busy period over the last 60 days since we've announced this transaction. And it's had a lot of focus from both companies. And it has been in some ways a trying time because we're having to put the 2 organizations together. And as I mentioned in my comments, there's a tough personnel decisions that come from that. So to assume or conclude that perhaps there was some pressure on the quarter as a result of all these other stuff going on, is not an unreasonable assumption to make.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You mentioned earlier on the call that 20% of your turn was from people buying homes, 6.8% was people to go and rent a home and those were kind of in line with expectations. They kind of do sound a little bit higher than I thought, but maybe can you put that into context with what -- where it has peaked in the past? I don't think you've ever seen move-outs to buy a rental home as high as -- close to 7%, have you?","H. Eric Bolton","Well let me -- I'm going to give you just a perspective on this real quick and then I'm going to let Tom answer your question more specifically. But just to give you some context, this time last year, turnover associated with moving out to buying a home was running at around 19.6% or so. So it's been steady for the last couple of years. And move-outs to rent were 6% last year. We're at 6.8% now. So there's no noticeable trend that causes us any concern at this point. And then specific to your point, Tom?","Thomas L. Grimes","And, Rich, this builds on fundamentals a bit. The peak was March 2007 where move-outs to home buying were 33.4% of total turns. Important to note, I think, at that time, that our effective rent growth was 4.9%. And we believe that in the Sun Belt that a healthy home building industry and a healthy economy leads to people buying houses, people getting jobs and people renting plenty of apartments.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then last question is on development. Obviously, Colonial brings an increased development pipeline to the table for you. I'm curious, I mean, I think you've addressed this, but I'm wondering if your thought process has changed a little bit on the longevity of your development strategy, is this going to be kind of Michael Jordan playing baseball or trying to give it a shot and then go back to basketball? Or are you going to stay with development for a while and make it a bigger part of your asset base?","H. Eric Bolton","The short answer is, we're not going to change our strategy, Rich. I continue to believe very much that we, first of all, want to be sure we have a platform by which we can direct capital into brand-new product, to-be-built product. But having said that, in this region of the country, I continue to believe that if a cycle is sort of a 6-year cycle that maybe there's a year to 2, where it makes sense to take on the risk of being the developer ourself. But we continue to believe that the bulk of the cycle in an effort to find opportunities to deploy capital in new construction and new development, that the best way to do that is be an opportunistic buyer of that. And we will bring the development team of Colonial on to our platform, which we're excited about because they are going to continue to be able to help us to work with developers to find opportunities to come in and provide capital, provide an opportunity for them to exit that development on a basis they find attractive, on a basis that we find very attractive. And ultimately, I believe, find ways to deploy capital and brand-new product that yields very, very close to what it would be if we were the developer ourself, but doing so without the risk on our balance sheet.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And just lastly on that, do you have a number of how big development will be as a percentage of your assets when you combine the company, and what your comfort level is longer term?","H. Eric Bolton","I would say $200 million to $250 million or close to a $9 billion balance sheet.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","That's your comfort level or that's...","Albert M. Campbell","That's about where we would go.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from the line of Karin Ford from KeyBanc Capital.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you guys could provide us with some July trends on rent and occupancy and what's happened since the end of 2Q?","H. Eric Bolton","Sure, Karin. July looked good, occupancy's still strong at 96%. Traffic was up 4.6%. And our asking rents on new lease prices was at 4.3%, which is really the best we've seen it this year.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","What about your renewal notices, what type of levels are you seeing further out?","H. Eric Bolton","Looking forward to the -- for the rest of the -- sort of out through October, is we're sending close to 6 and we're getting about 5 4 on that.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Next question is just on Texas. I heard your comments earlier about you don't feel like supply is really been hitting results there. Just taking a look at a market like Dallas, where year-over-year revenue growth slowed about 200 basis points from 1Q to 2Q. I just want to understand -- reconcile those two things and comments from some of your peers that a market like Dallas is starting to get impacted from -- by new supply and why do you think your portfolio is being insulated, if it is.","H. Eric Bolton","Karin, I don't think we mean to imply that new supply has no factor or bearing on a permanent pricing or the market. But I think what we're really trying to say is places like Dallas that are seen -- that have very healthy economy and are seeing some influx of new construction that job growth is at a point where fundamentals are still very, very good. And while there are some moderation to it, it is not the beginning of the end for a market like Dallas.","Albert M. Campbell","I would tell you, Karin, that one of the metrics that you hear talked about a lot, that we focused on a lot as well is sort of this comparison of jobs to new supply coming into a given market. And at least the information that we have from initial metrics and moodys.com and so forth suggest that in 2013 that, that metric is roughly around 10:1 jobs to every new unit. And in 2014 that jumps to 11:1. So -- and if equilibrium is around 5:1 or perhaps 6:1, clearly Dallas is showing a little moderation, but it's still going to be better than average and better than historical long-term run rate and we feel good about it.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then, just a last final question just on the mechanics of guidance. It looked like you guys had lowered expense growth guidance, about 50 basis points between 1Q and 2Q, but the other 2 components, revenue and NOI, stayed the same. I just -- was there any other -- was there any reason why NOI growth stayed the same even though you moved expenses down a little bit?","H. Eric Bolton","Not really. I mean that wasn't a significant change in that expense, Karin. And so we were not perfectly on the midpoint one way or the other that may move us to right on the midpoint of 5 on NOI somewhere closer to it. We're maybe a little above it before, but nothing significant.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Eric, you touched a little bit upon the acquisition market and disposition market. Can give us a sense of pricing? I mean we've seen a pretty big move in the -- from Fannie and Freddie rates over the last 90 days, is that impacting pricing in the secondary markets? And also, as you look out to the acquisition pipeline what's kind of your -- what should we expect in terms of pricing and what's kind of your expectation when we start to see some upward movement in cap rates?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, I mean, so far it hasn't really transitioned into the actual -- the cap rate market as far as we can see. And we continue to see deals in this past quarter that we were losing in the large markets that were trading somewhere between 4.5 to low 5 range. And the secondary market trading anywhere from 5 to 5.5 range for the kind of product that we're looking to buy. And so while NOIs are remaining pretty healthy, investor appetite is certainly very healthy despite the fact that interest rates have moved up a little bit, it hasn't really translated into any material -- certainly, material change in cap rates. We haven't really seen any change whatsoever, continue to -- in the properties that we're taking the market to sell, older properties in some of these secondary markets. I mean, they're moving fine and we've sold 4 properties so far this year at an average cap rate of 6 8. This is a 25-year-old product in small market. So no real change.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a second question, as a bigger picture question. As you looked across your markets, obviously supply ramping, when do you expect supply across your markets to peak? And then given that we've seen a little bit of backup in the multifamily housing start numbers here, what's kind of the expectation for peak supply across your markets?","H. Eric Bolton","I think it's going to be 2015, late 2014 and then sort of first half of 2015 .","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just a follow up to that is how are you managing accordingly? I mean, is it -- is there an apprehension starting new developments and focusing more so in acquisitions? And can we see a reacceleration in development than in '15?","H. Eric Bolton","Yes, I think this -- we're not planning to ramp up any more development, that's for sure. We think the best thing to do is be in a position to be on the sidelines ready to buy some of this product that gets delivered in late '14 and '15. That probably doesn't pencil out as well as a lot of people were hoping. And I think that it very well could be that by late 2015, 2016 that getting back into traditional development for a couple of years may make sense, we'll have to look at it at that point in time, but that's how we're preparing for it.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question. Eric, you mentioned that move-out to renting remained consistent in the 7% range, relatively unchanged in the last couple of quarters. But there continues to be a substantial amount of buying from the institutions in the Sun Belt markets. And it does take some time, 3, 4, 5 months for the homes to be renovated and rented. So I'm curious if you think the 7% is a bit of a ceiling? And how much higher do you think that number could go up?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, I don't think it goes a whole lot higher, Haendel. I mean maybe it goes to 7.5% or something, I don't know. I continue to believe, very much, though, that people make a decision on renting a home versus renting an apartment based on a lifestyle decision. And I think that a lot of people who are interested in renting these homes are folks who are previous homeowners become accustomed to that lifestyle and want that kind of product. The people that we're renting to by and large are sort of young professionals. And they're really not wanting that kind of a lifestyle. So I think that -- my point is -- the point I was trying to make in my call, or comments earlier, is our long-term run rate for many, many years was somewhere in the 4% to 5% range. We saw it kind of move up to 6% -- to 7% in the last year. So I just don't see it moving a whole lot more than that.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You also mentioned that you think the U.S. Texas markets should be able to absorb the supply fairly well. Curious as to your view on the supply versus job dynamics in some of your Southeast markets, places like Charlotte, Raleigh, et cetera.","Albert M. Campbell","Now, Charlotte looks well-suited for it. Raleigh is one that's been a little bit of a surprise for us. It's at 5:1 ratio right now. And frankly, we would expect it to be a little bit softer. But it has worked very well. We've got an effective rent growth of close to 5% there and it's chugging along. I think the interesting dynamic on this is really job growth coming in 2014 for our Southeast secondary markets. And that they will begin to come to the table a little more aggressively as job growth really picks up in 2014.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One last one. You talked about no real change in buyer underwriting or cap rates here in the last 60 days. Curious if you're seeing any change -- or I guess no real change in cap rates, but I'm curious if you're seeing any change in buyer underwriting. And if so, how much of that has that changed?","H. Eric Bolton","Not for what we've seen, no real change. I think that we track all the deals that we don't get and try to understand as best we can what was it that the buyer that got the deal from us. Were they willing to accept a lower return? Or were they forecasting higher rent growth, what? Just what was it and we obviously can't get into all those. We don't get all that information. But I -- we haven't -- I mean, I think that to some degree it's probably people getting a little bit if their debt cost to capital cost are moving up a little bit and all things being equal the IRRs being the same requirements and so forth, I just assume they're being a little bit more aggressive on exit cap assumptions or rent growth assumptions or something, I don't know. But I think that broadly, the investor appetite just remains so high for this product type in both large and secondary markets that they're covering the difference somehow.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from the line of David Bragg from Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","My questions have been answered.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I'm showing no additional audio questions at this time.

Thank you for participating in the MAA First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin.","Tim Argo","Thank you, Lindy. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, Senior VP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO.","Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday\u2019s press release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results.","These reports, along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call, will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.","When we reach the question-and-answer portion of the call, I would ask for everyone to please limit their questions to no more than two in order to give everyone ample opportunity to participate. Should you have additional questions, please re-renter the queue or you are certainly welcome to follow-up with us after we conclude the call. Thank you.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Tim. As detailed in our earnings release, MAA started 2016 with solid first quarter operating results that were ahead of expectations. Average daily physical occupancy at 96.2% and effective rent growth at 4.5% drove same-store revenues higher than forecasted. We expect the solid momentum in leasing across our portfolio to continue over the balance of the year.","As Tom will outline in his comments, in the first quarter, our properties continue to post low resident turnover, strong occupancy, and captured solid pricing performance. Importantly, we enter the busy summer leasing season with the portfolio well-positioned to take advantage of the favorable leasing conditions. Given the strong start to the year, we have raised the midpoint of our earnings guidance for core FFO for the full-year to $5.81 per share.","Investor interest in apartment real estate remains high across our markets and we continue to find the acquisition environment challenging with pricing reflecting strong demand from private and institutional buyers. Cap rates continue to hold up, despite a higher volume of new supply coming into the market. Our deal flow and transaction pipeline is more robust than we\u2019ve seen over the last of couple of years and we\u2019re certainly underwriting a higher volume of opportunity.","We continue to believe that as we work later into the cycle, we will find more opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria. Until then, we plan to remain disciplined and deploy capital only when we are comfortable with the value proposition and earnings accretion to be captured.","As Al will recap, our balance sheet is in a very strong position and we continue to build capacity for future growth. As noted in our earnings release, Moody\u2019s recently moved MAA\u2019s current Baa2 rating to a positive outlook. We believe our established record of producing steady value growth and strong operating performance coupled with credit and coverage metrics that are stronger than any point in our company history has MAA well-positioned to continue to build our long-term competitive advantages across our footprint.","After several years of strong operating performance, questions surrounding the sustainability of the current leasing environment is certainly a hot topic. Based on what we are experiencing across our portfolio, which is diversified across urban, inner loop, suburban and satellite city submarket locations in both large and secondary markets, demand does not appear to be weakening and all indications are that we will continue to capture good leasing velocity over the next few quarters.","Conversations with a number of developers suggest that construction financing is becoming increasingly harder to secure and those pressures coupled with higher land and construction costs are raising the bar to justify new starts. It\u2019s worth noting that new construction permitting across our markets is down so far this year compared to the trends we\u2019ve seen over the last two years.","We continue to believe that new supply trends are unlikely to materially disrupt the positive momentum for apartment leasing within our submarkets. Across our portfolio, the outlook for the ratio of new job growth to new apartment deliveries actually improves in 2017 as compared to this year.","And while our crystal ball is certainly no better than anyone else\u2019s, I do still believe our business retains cyclical patterns, it\u2019s difficult to see any sort of near-term significant deterioration of leasing fundamentals. While our occupancy comparisons get tougher in the back-half of the year, given the essentially full occupancy status of the portfolio last year, the rent trends remained encouraging.","So overall, our focus for the balance of the year remains centered on taking full advantage of the great operating fundamentals to drive earnings and build platform strength and capacity, while remaining very active in the transaction market and disciplined in our assessment of new growth opportunities.","Before turning the call over to Tom, I do want to thank our MAA associates for their focus and efforts in preparing for the upcoming busy summer leasing season. You have the portfolio well-positioned and I very much appreciate all of your hard work and great results. Tom?","Thomas Grimes","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter NOI performance of 7.1% was driven by revenue growth of 5.5% over the prior year and 1.1% sequentially. We have good momentum in rents and saw effective rents increase 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average physical occupancy contributed 60 basis of revenue growth over the prior year.","Overall, expenses remain in line, up just 2.9%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry leading initiatives, such as our vendor owned inventory shops stocking program, which will be completed this year have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check. April demand trends continue the positive momentum. Average physical occupancy of 96.2%, ran 40 basis points ahead of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period is just 8.2%, in line with the same time last year. April blended rents on a lease-over-lease basis are up 4.8%. Occupancy exposure and pricing are all in good shape, as we head into our summer leasing season.","On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results of 5.9%. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Atlanta and Charlotte. The secondary markets achieved 4.6% revenue growth. In these markets, we are benefiting from improved job growth, as well as a sophisticated operating platform that has competitive advantages across our footprint in markets. Revenue growth in Charleston, Greenville, Savannah and Jacksonville stood out.","As mentioned above, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy, rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry bead is Houston, which represents just 3.5% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market.","Move-outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 4.4% over the prior year and turnover remained low at 52.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Move-outs to home buying were down 4.6%. Move-outs to home rentals were also down 14% and represent less than 7% of our total move-outs. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupancy, again paid off, the decrease in average days vacant between occupants for the quarter helped drive the first quarter average physical occupancy to 96.2%.","During the quarter, we completed over 1,400 interior unit upgrades. We expect the redevelopment \u2013 we expect to redevelop approximately 5,000 units this year. As a reminder on average, we spend about $4,500 per unit and receive an average rent increase of $95 over a comparable non-renovated unit. This generates a year one cash return of well over 20%. Our active lease-up communities are performing well.","You will notice in the supplemental data that we completed the construction of Station Square at Cosner\u2019s Corner II during the quarter. It\u2019s currently 94.2% occupied and due to the stronger than expected lease-up, we\u2019ve moved the stabilization date forward one quarter to the third quarter of 2016. Cityscape at Market Center II is leasing well. They are 84% leased and expected to stabilize on schedule in the third quarter of this year. We are off to a solid start and are well-positioned, as we head into the summer leasing season. Al?","Albert Campbell","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll provide some additional commentary on company\u2019s first quarter earnings performance, balance sheet position, and then finally on revised earnings guidance for 2016. Core FFO, which excludes certain non-cash and non-routine items was $1.44 per share for the quarter, which represents a 9% increase over the prior year. And this performance was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance.","The strong performance for the quarter was primarily produced by favorable property revenues, which was broad based, average occupancy, average effective rents, fees and collections were all slightly better than expectations for the quarter producing about two-thirds of the favorability. Operating expenses, interest and G&A expenses combined to produce the remainder of the favorability.","During the first quarter, we acquired one new community located in Fredericksburg, Virginia for a total investment of $61 million, which was stabilized on acquisition. We also sold one commercial property during the first quarter, Colonial Promenade Nord du Lac located in Covington, Louisiana, which included both operating retail and land parcels. Total proceeds for this disposition were $33.2 million and we recorded a total gain on sale of $2.4 million related to the transaction. Also, this property represented the final wholly owned operating commercial assets acquired from Colonial.","During the quarter, we completed the construction of one new community Station Square at Cosner\u2019s Corner Phase II, located in Fredericksburg, which remains in lease-up and was 78% occupied at quarter end. We have four communities, all Phase II expansions remaining under development at the end of the quarter. We funded an additional $13 million of construction costs during the quarter and expect to fund about $63 million to complete the current development communities over the next year or so. We continue to expect NOI yields in a 7% to 7.5% range for these communities, once completed and stabilized. We also invested $6.2 million in our interior redevelopment program during the first quarter, capturing rent increases of 9% above non-renovated units.","Our balance sheet remains in great shape. As Eric mentioned during the quarter, Moody\u2019s affirmed MAA\u2019s unsecured debt rating of Baa2 and revised the outlook on the company to positive from stable. Now two of the three primary rating agencies have a positive outlook on MAA, which further exhibits the strength of our balance sheet. At quarter end, our leverage defined as net debt to gross assets was 40.7%, and defined as total debt to market cap was 29.7%.","Our recurring EBITDA covered our fixed charges of 4.2 times. At quarter end, 93% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates, at an average effective rate of just 3.7%, with well laddered maturities averaging 4.6 years. We also had over $645 million of total cash and credit available at quarter end, providing flexibility.","And finally, as Erik mentioned, we are revising our earnings guidance for 2016 with this release. We are increasing our core FFO projection by $0.03 per share at the midpoint to reflect both the strength of the first quarter results and also the offsetting impact of revised transaction volume and timing. Core FFO is now projected to be $5.71 to $5.91 per share, or $5.81 at the midpoint, based on average shares and units outstanding of about 79.6 million. Core AFFO is projected to be $5.01 to $5.21 per share, or $5.11 per share at the midpoint.","You may notice in our release, that we introduced one additional metric this quarter, Funds Available for Distribution or FAD, which represents core FFO less all capital spending, including discretionary items such as redevelopment and revenue enhancing capital, as well as corporate and casualty loss expenditures. The intention is to show the overall strength of our earnings and cash flow.","For the full-year, we expect our FAD or FFO less all internal CapEx to be sufficient to cover our total annual dividend with $90 million to $95 million remaining for investment or to build capacity for future growth. We are maintaining our guidance range for same-store NOI for the full-year, along with the other components of previous guidance with the one exception, our projected acquisition volume, which we now expect to be between $250 million and $350 million for the year.","Our current plans do not includes any need for new equity during 2016 and we now expect to end the year with our leverage about 130 basis points below the 2015 year end levels.","So that\u2019s all we have in the way for prepared comments. So Lindy, we\u2019ll now turn the call over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. Just on the investment side, at the beginning of the year you talked about match funding acquisitions with dispositions and cash flow. Given that you\u2019ve dialed back the acquisition assumption here a bit, what are plans with the excess proceeds now?","Eric Bolton","Well, at this point, we continue to believe that we will be able to put some money to work later this year. We do have a group of properties teed up for disposition that we will look at later this year for possible sale. But it really comes down to finding an attractive use of capital right now, which is, as I alluded to is tough. But I can tell you, we closed the one deal earlier this year, we\u2019ve got a couple of other properties that are currently under contract going through due diligence.","So we continue to believe that as we get later in the year, that we may find more opportunities. But we just felt like, given where we were with the transaction volume so far this year that \u2013 and based on our earlier assumptions that pulled back just a tad from what we initially had thought was the right thing to do. But we\u2019ll see how the year plays out.","Austin Wurschmidt","Are you still assuming a ratable sort of acquisition activity through the year, or do you expect it to be front or back-end loaded?","Thomas Grimes","We have been expecting really more toward the back-half of the year starting in July through the rest of the year. Usually, as Eric mentioned, the activity picks up, as people are playing for their portfolios for the year. So we have sort of evenly July through the rest of the year a deal a month for six months. I mean, there is no magic to that, that\u2019s just what we\u2019ve assumed and we believe that\u2019s the right thing to do right now.","Austin Wurschmidt","Thanks for the detail. And then just last one from me, just based on the heavy lifting you\u2019ve done on the sell side, I mean, would you say you are more biased on the sell, or to sell additional assets or pull back, given how strong the transaction market is? And would you consider selling more, I guess, to reduce leverage?","Eric Bolton","No, at this point, we\u2019ve really accomplished a lot of the repositioning we were after with the portfolio. And so we don\u2019t have any sort of strategic agenda surrounding repositioning the portfolio at this point, other than a plan to just every year look at opportunity to pull capital out of to say 10 or 15 assets where we feel like the future growth prospects are not as robust as we could perhaps achieve with another alternative investment.","And so it\u2019s really now at a point where we\u2019re just looking for a steady recycling program and really more focused on match funding that process, and looking to keep the balance sheet strong, the coverage metric strong as we continue to just build portfolio strength through this sort of steady recycling effort going forward.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great, thanks for taking my questions.","Eric Bolton","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about, where same-store is trending relative to initial guidance, recognizing you didn\u2019t change it, but 1Q results were ahead of expectations, you now have April as well and some clarity in two renewals at least for May and June?","Albert Campbell","Let me give you a little color on that, Nick. That\u2019s a great question on our guidance change. So the summary of it is we\u2019ve raised guidance FFO for the year $0.03 in total. That\u2019s comprised of really two things. We did add $0.06 per share to our operating performance, that\u2019s about same-store and non-same-store, which both are doing well.","There\u2019s some several lease-up committees in non-same-store. And so for that sort of it was in the first quarter and then so we haven\u2019t increased that part of the year $0.02 and that\u2019s really continued similar trends that we have, pricing of 4.5% continued very full occupancy of 96.2% on average, carrying through the year as we have projected on the fundamentals.","But albeit at a little bit higher level, I mean occupancy level and the rent levels are coming off the Q1 performance was a little bit higher. That $0.06 has been offset by the change in volume and the timing of the transactions we talked about that that offsets that and takes $0.03 of that back for the year, that\u2019s where the net $0.03 comes from. And so, we\u2019ve maintained our same-store guidance range for the year, but obviously doing the math on that. We\u2019re not at the midpoint. We\u2019re moving toward the top part of that range now.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Sorry, go ahead.","Albert Campbell","I was just going to say, well obviously as we get more activity in leasing and real estate taxes and of some of the big arms, we\u2019ll take a look at that in the second quarter.","Nick Joseph","Right, and then in terms of the occupancy comment, you said basically flat at 96.2%. Do you expect any variance between the quarters or should we expect pretty flat occupancy quarter-to-quarter?","Albert Campbell","We\u2019re assuming it\u2019s pretty to hold, I mean it\u2019s full at 96.2% right now and we expect to hold that through the year now. And the comps for prior year as we talked about, they\u2019ll get a little more challenging in the remaining three quarters of the year. I think last year Q2 was around 96.1%, Q3 was higher 96.5%, 96.6% maybe and the last quarter was 96.1% or 96.2%. So what we would expect is to hold 96.2% through the year and drop the pricing to 4% to 4.5% as we talked about and that will come fall to the bottom line of NOI.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And just the last question, the spread between the large and the secondary markets narrowed in the first quarter from what we saw in 2015. Do you expect that to continue to narrow?","Eric Bolton","Yes, I think at this point, we feel like it will tighten as things go by, but we wouldn\u2019t expect secondary markets to start outperforming the large markets. Right now large, job growth is so good and the situation is stable, that we would expect those to continue to lead the way for us.","Nick Joseph","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Robert Stevenson","Hi, good morning, guys. Given your commentary around acquisitions and given where you started delivering more in the development pipeline, what\u2019s the sort of shadow pipeline that you have in terms of back half of 2016 starts or 2017 starts and how active are you out there looking for land or partners to do development projects with?","Eric Bolton","We\u2019re pretty active talking to a lot of people. I will say this, I mean, our model and our strategy is not to bank land and so we\u2019re not a true developer in the sense that we\u2019re going to go out and look for land and go through zoning processes and go through the process that one typically has to go through from a full development perspective.","Our model is really built around, looking for using the relationships that we\u2019ve got to work with developers that perhaps have if you will, projects ready to go or looking to tie up an opportunity that we find particularly attractive and essentially go at it on a pre-purchase basis.","We\u2019re having a lot of those kind of conversations right now. Obviously at this point in the cycle, we\u2019re being pretty careful with our underwriting and our assumptions. We\u2019ve looked at a number of them since so far this year and frankly just couldn\u2019t get comfortable pulling the trigger on a number of deals believing that the \u2013 what the developer was anticipating in terms of rent levels and rent growth, we couldn\u2019t get comfortable with it. But yes, we\u2019re looking a lot of things right now. We\u2019ll see what the back half of the year holds.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then, I mean, given the commentary around acquisition is being difficult, et cetera, with this free cash flow, I mean is there the ability to pull forward some of your redevelopment opportunities and get to them faster than you otherwise would have with the additional capital allowing you to drive rental rate higher in the interim?","Thomas Grimes","Yes. I mean Rob there is always the opportunity to do more, but there is not an opportunity to do it better. We really want to be very disciplined in our approach of allocating capital in that area, and what we want -- this is an area where it\u2019s very easy to look out with rose colored glasses and what we\u2019re trying to do is turn a unit and redevelop it and make sure that a another unit is matched next to it. So that we know that the market is telling us that we\u2019re getting that return that we\u2019re telling you all that we have the return. So we\u2019ll remain pretty methodical on that and we\u2019re comfortable with our current pace and feel good about that.","Robert Stevenson","Okay and then Tom, realizing that it\u2019s only 3.5% of your portfolio, can you sort of talk about what you\u2019re seeing in Houston and is it certain submarkets there that are really getting hit hardest or is it just general malaise across the entire market?","Eric Bolton","No. I mean I will tell you. Houston during the quarter at 1.4% and we are a little more out of the inner loop if you will. I think the suburbs are holding up reasonably well. We have one community in the energy corridor and it\u2019s a hair lower. But as a group we\u2019re holding on to 96% occupancy. Turnover there is down 4.4%, delinquency trends are better and exposure is at 9%, which is little higher than the company average, but it\u2019s hanging in there. Well, hanging in there is a wrong word, but it\u2019s pretty consistent across the Board.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then Al, what was the cap rate on the acquisition in the first quarter?","Albert Campbell","It was about -- I\u2019ll give you through the NOI yield was just over 6%, 6.1% and the cap rate, which is an economic was about 5.75%, 5.80%.","Robert Stevenson","All right, thanks guys.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.","John Kim","Thanks. In your large markets, the expense growth was actually higher sequentially than it was year-over-year, I imagine a lot of that was due to taxes. But did this come in ahead of your expectations and is there a concern that expense growth might come in at the high-end of your guidance range?","Albert Campbell","John, I\u2019ll give you some of this, and Tom might have some on this as well. But no, I mean the tax \u2013 there tends to be a lot of volatility sequentially on expenses, particularly from Q4, Q1 and you put your finger on taxes, is a big issue. Lot of times you have favorable appeals or final results coming in at the end of the prior year.","And then in the next year, you\u2019re starting with taxes, which are a quarter of your operating expenses or more and you\u2019re starting on a full run rate for the year. So that created a lot of volatility that is one significant point that that\u2019s probably the trend across. Maybe, Tom you may add?","Thomas Grimes","No and also, I mean John, that\u2019s the point. I think we\u2019re quite confident in our ability to manage expenses and guidelines for the rest of the year on those items.","John Kim","Okay. And then, I think Tom you mentioned that move-outs were low this period. What do you attribute this to and is this sustainable?","Thomas Grimes","It is not just sustainable. It\u2019s been going on for probably four straight years that we\u2019ve seen declining turnover numbers. The driver again this year was the reduction in home buying, where folks continue to appreciate the flexibility of leasing a home, job transfer is the other reason for moving, and it stayed fairly steady. But it\u2019s really home buying that\u2019s pushing the change.","Eric Bolton","Typically John I\u2019d tell you that, what I think probably causes turnover to materially start to move up, frankly, as we start to see the economy start to heat up. Because as Tom alluded to the two biggest factors that create turnover, are people leaving us to buy a house or they\u2019re -- which is actually the number two reason.","The number one reason, people leave us is because of a change in their employment and a job transfer and things of that nature. And what we typically see is, when the economy starts to really get even more robust, turnover can pick-up a little bit. But of course with that improving economic environment, it also continues to create more demand for our product. And so we tend to think that as we see maybe a little pressure on turnover expenses that we likely will capture it in more robust rent growth, if we do in fact see material pick-up and turnover begin to occur.","John Kim","So would you characterize the employment growth as moderate and not very strong right now in your market?","Eric Bolton","Yes, I would say it\u2019s better than \u2013 a little better than moderate, but we\u2019ve seen it stronger, that\u2019s for sure. I think it\u2019s in pretty good position right now and of course we\u2019re seeing people stay in our apartments longer than they ever have and lease terms have lengthened out, a good bit. So we \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see anything right now that\u2019s going to materially change the turnover pattern absent a major change in sort of economic conditions.","John Kim","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Rich Anderson","Thanks. Good morning, great quarter. So even though you\u2019re not saying it, anyone who is kind of listening to this call is probably expecting a same-store guidance increase next quarter, and I could appreciate you holding off and doing that this early in the year.","But what would have \u2013 what would it take for you to have to reiterate your 4% or 5% same-store NOI growth? And I\u2019ll just tell you, we put in 4% average same-store NOI growth for the remaining three quarters of the year to get you just below 5% for the full-year. You said you\u2019re confidence \u2013 confident in expense control. So it\u2019s hard to imagine it won\u2019t go up, but I\u2019m just curious what has to happen for it to stay the same?","Albert Campbell","Well, I think you put your finger on it Rich, and your math is, I would agree with that in terms of expectations for the remainder of the year. And I think what we\u2019re betting on or expecting is to continue stay very cool in occupancy 96.2% through the year and then have pricing growth of 4% to 4.5% that would be little above the midpoint on that that continues to go out well.","And if those things occur, I think we\u2019re confident that that the math that you indicated and the position range is correct. So we would have -- it would have to be a fall off in occupancy and rents as we push through the year. Obviously expenses, it could be as well, but I think we\u2019re more confident in the historical and current control events.","Eric Bolton","I think the two biggest line items are, the year-over-year change in occupancy and the year-over-year change in real estate taxes, and I think both of those line items get a lot more clarity over the next three months and I think that that\u2019s really what it comes down to. The rent trends are there\u2026","Albert Campbell","Yes.","Eric Bolton","And as long as we don\u2019t see any volatility beyond what we anticipate in terms of performance on occupancy we\u2019ll be good. And of course we don\u2019t really get good clarity on real estate taxes until really late in summer.","Albert Campbell","Yes.","Rich Anderson","So you\u2019re saying the occupancy and taxes become more \u2013 there is more clarity because they become more difficult comps?","Eric Bolton","No, just because we get more information. We have obviously more of our leases expiring in the busy summer months than we typically do in the winter months. And so reprising and releasing those units with that greater level of lease expiration activity, that\u2019s a point of volatility, if you will. And then as I mentioned, we won\u2019t see clarity on real estate taxes until late Q2 or early Q3.","Rich Anderson","Okay. And then can you comment on some of your Florida markets, in particular Orlando was really strong. And the reason why I\u2019m asking about that specific market is, because others have been pointing to Florida as an area of strength, but I\u2019m not so sure how long that will stay intact. And so I\u2019m wondering if those are areas where you might consider pruning as long as it\u2019s really hot and just a comment under long-term prognosis of your plan in Florida, in some of your key Florida markets?","Thomas Grimes","I will take the performance side of things. To us, Florida is moving along nicely and we expect that to continue. There is not a sign, early sign that a slowdown is coming in Orlando, Tampa or Jacksonville or South Florida for that matter. So we feel like those frankly were a little behind the Texas markets and Atlanta coming on board strongly. So we feel like they\u2019ve got ways to run on that one.","Rich Anderson","Okay, great. Thank you.","Thomas Grimes","Thanks Rick.","Operator","And our next question comes from Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Drew Babin","Good morning.","Eric Bolton","Good morning Drew.","Drew Babin","A quick question on your ROI CapEx projects related to Colonial. Now that some of those properties are now in their second year post renovation, is there any clarity on what year two cash flow yields may look like on those properties? Is it likely to look a lot like year one or is there some kind of diminishing benefit to the renovations?","Albert Campbell","I\u2019ll just give an overall stroke on that Drew and not on a property \u2013 project-by-project basis. But one thing you\u2019ll notice in our guidance this year is that our cash flow growth is partly built on the fact that our recurring CapEx needs go down a little bit this year. And that\u2019s planned and expected, and it\u2019s a good part of our growth story. And so as we bought Colonial and we worked through some of those issues and had a little higher recurring CapEx for 2014, a little bit in 2015.","And so 2016 is a better place to be to, kind of, touch on some of your comments, I don\u2019t have a property by property or project by project, I think, we look at it as overall portfolio at this point. But it certainly reflects the points that you\u2019re making.","Drew Babin","Okay, thank you. And then secondly on the Fredericksburg acquisition, I think you mentioned that it was $61 million. I mean, looking in supplemental to the year-to-date NOI of $300,000, I\u2019m just curious, is there a renovation that was just completed? You said it was acquired and stabilized, so I\u2019m just hoping to kind of square away where the cap rates come from?","Albert Campbell","That\u2019s just one month, that thing was bought, but really had one month of operation, call it March. And so $300,000 really just represented that one month, Drew, so you wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. That was really there to provide you the ability to pull that out for NAB building purposes, if you wanted to. And so, you can \u2013 you would have to get a full-year run rate that\u2019s accurate, which we can provide for you offline, if we need to.","Drew Babin","Right, okay. I just thought that was a quarterly number which would\u2026","Albert Campbell","Yes, you could take that really times 12 probably and get close.","Drew Babin","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ivy Zelman","Thanks for taking my question, guys, I appreciate it. If you are thinking about maybe the next few years and strategically some of the biggest opportunities that you are excited about and then maybe where you would be the most challenged and most concerned, I know you don\u2019t have a crystal ball on the economy, but as you think about it just from a competitive perspective, or where you feel that there is the greatest challenges versus the greatest opportunity, just to see how you guys are thinking about? Thanks.","Eric Bolton","Well, Ivy, this is Eric. I would tell you that, I\u2019m more excited about sort of the next four or five years and I can ever remember. We think we have the \u2013 both the platform and the balance sheet in such a strong position that as the opportunity unfolds over the next four or five years, I think that the opportunity for us to capture new growth \u2013 new value, if you will, is going to get better.","I think that the thing that I think you have to think about is that, at some point over the next four or five years interest rates will probably start to move up a little bit. I think, we all hope, of course, the economy continues to move along, but it is cyclical. And while we\u2019ve had some great performance dynamics over the last four or five years, it probably does moderate at some point over the next four or five years. And as a consequence of rising rates and as a consequence of perhaps reaching more normalized sort of trends from an operating perspective, I think our competitive advantages in the markets where we focus are capital growth.","And I think our ability to create value versus what these markets are what \u2013 versus what people typically associate with these markets grows. And at the end of the day, what we are attempting to do is find a way to take shareholder capital and create a competitive advantage for, both in terms of how we are able to deploy capital and then how we are able to operate those investments once we make them. And I think both of those things get better for us over the next four or five years.","Ivy Zelman","That is extremely helpful. And I think the value add and what you are doing to drive the cash flow is very impressive. So congratulations, guys. Thank you.","Eric Bolton","Thank you.","Albert Campbell","Thanks, Ivy.","Operator","And our next question comes from Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Neil Malkin","Good morning, gentlemen. Nice quarter.","Eric Bolton","Hi, Neil.","Neil Malkin","First question, we\u2019ve been hearing some rhetoric that now that the supply is probably peaking particularly in urban markets, now that comparatively land and pricing are more advantageous in the suburban areas. Are you seeing any early indications that supply maybe getting a little bit more elevated in some of your suburban markets that it performed well?","Eric Bolton","No, really not, Neil. I mean, I think that the pressures on construction costs, the pressures on land costs, those pressures continue to exist in the suburban locations as much as they do in the urban locations. And I would tell you, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, I mean, we see permitting next \u2013 so far this year is down significantly from what it\u2019s been for the last two years, 40% to 50% down. And so \u2013 and when you look at sort of the expectation of deliveries and contrast that against expected job growth, next year looks stronger than this year.","So, we haven\u2019t seen any evidence suggesting that supply issues that have \u2013 the supply that has been creating more issues in some of these more core markets in urban \u2013 heavy urban oriented locations is now going to migrate to the suburbs, we certainly see no evidence of that at this point.","Neil Malkin","Okay. Great, thanks. And then, on the \u2013 just considering supply is elevated, are you seeing more opportunities to acquire developments that are at the end of completion, or in lease-up currently, or is pricing just a little bit too aggressive for you?","Eric Bolton","Well, that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s \u2013 I do think that that\u2019s where the biggest window of opportunity will continue to grow is those projects \u2013 new projects that are in the midst of lease-up. That is the point of sort of maximum pressure from a development perspective is, when you get to that point where most of all the units have been delivered, you are no longer in a position to be capitalizing a lot of the cost, you\u2019re still in the lease-up mode, but yet you haven\u2019t reached stabilization or break-even, if you will. Usually you are late in the term of the construction financing. And if you are not getting the rents and\/or so lease-up is not growing as fast as you thought it would, that\u2019s where the most pressure is created.","And frankly, that\u2019s where we think the better buying opportunities will continue to emerge. Now, we\u2019ve seen some of those, but we\u2019ve also seen some very aggressive investors willing to come in and make some what we feel to be some very, very aggressive assumptions and buy on that basis, which we are not going to do. But I do think that as we get later in the cycle and later this year into next year and a lot of the supply continues to come online, I think, there could be some better buying opportunities.","Neil Malkin","Okay, great. And then last for me, can you talk about what new leasing renewal rates came in the first quarter and then how you are kind of seeing them trend into second quarter?","Albert Campbell","Yes, sure. On a lease-over-lease basis, blended was 3.8% [ph] for the first quarter and April, it pulled up to 4.8%.","Neil Malkin","And that\u2019s blended in April?","Albert Campbell","Yes, that\u2019s blended.","Neil Malkin","All right. Thank you, guys. Nice quarter again.","Eric Bolton","Yes.","Albert Campbell","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from Conor Wagner with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Conor Wagner","Good morning.","Eric Bolton","Good morning, Conor.","Conor Wagner","In the acquisition market, are you seeing aggressive bidding across quality type and across markets? Are there any either quality types, or markets that are lagging behind?","Eric Bolton","To be honest with you, I mean, we are not looking at what I would consider to be a lot of B assets or even lower C assets, so I can\u2019t really opine on that. But from a \u2013 we continue to see the higher quality assets\u2019 pricing being pretty aggressive. And that\u2019s the same, whether it is a large market or whether it\u2019s more a secondary market, we\u2019ve seen some very aggressive pricing in places like Charleston, Greenville even Kansas City, we\u2019ve seen comparable in many cases to what we see take place in a Dallas or Atlanta, even still Houston.","I mean, we\u2019ve seen some assets based on our underwriting trade at sub 5 cap rates in Houston. So I think it\u2019s again for the higher quality assets, which is what we tend to focus on from an acquisitions perspective.","Conor Wagner","But then on the disposition market, are you seeing the aggressive bid for their lower quality assets that you are looking to sell?","Eric Bolton","Well, we are about to get into the market on that front. But I mean all the indications are that we will see pretty good pricing relative to \u2013 similar to what we got last year would be our expectation, as we start to look at that side.","Conor Wagner","Thank you. And then on the redevelopment opportunities, are those focused in 2016 and any particular markets or is that spread evenly across the portfolio?","Thomas Grimes","No, it tends to focus and I\u2019m going off the cuff here, but it is \u2013 it\u2019s Charlotte, Raleigh, Charleston, Savannah, Orlando those are the drivers.","Conor Wagner","Great, thank you, very much.","Thomas Grimes","Opportunity, there is some level, pretty much across the portfolio.","Conor Wagner","Awesome, thank you.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Conor.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Lesnick, with Capital One. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Lesnick","Great. Good morning, everyone. I guess first you guys have been increasing your asset allocation to Fredericksburg over the last several quarters. Obviously some of your peers have exposure to DC, but being that\u2019s more in sell than Fredericksburg, what are you seeing in kind of the suburban Northern Virginia market, and what\u2019s your outlook on that area for the next couple of years?","Thomas Grimes","It\u2019s in full recovery mode, Tom. It is a kind of a pleasure to walk recently both the two assets that were developed and have the Phase II are right on 95% corridor, and doing quite well. The Cobblestone Square project is unique. It is literally built right in the \u2013 Fredericksburg, it\u2019s one of those great satellite cities and its sort of core is historic district that\u2019s very vibrant. We are right in the middle of that and very, very high demand from DC jobs. They\u2019re walking distance to rail line and we\u2019re seeing a positive rent growth, good occupancy, well exposure and demand on those three assets. So I feel good about the future of Fredericksburg.","Tom Lesnick","That\u2019s very helpful. And then I guess, following-up on some comments earlier about the transaction market generally. As you guys just kind of seen a narrowing between large and secondary markets in terms of operating fundamentals, I know obviously some of your secondary markets don\u2019t have as many trades, but across the entire spectrum, are you guys seeing a narrowing of cap rates between the large and secondary markets as well?","Eric Bolton","It\u2019s been pretty consistent for the last year. So Tom, I would put the spread with the difference of roughly around 50 basis points and it\u2019s been that way. I mean, if you go back a couple of years ago, it was probably closer to 75 basis points or maybe a little bit more than that, but what we saw over \u2013 starting a little over a year ago, was just as the cap rates and the opportunities in the larger markets became so expensive, we saw capital getting more aggressive in the secondary market. So that spread in today is 50 basis points or less and depending on the quality of the asset and the location, I mean they can be almost right on top of each other frankly in some of these secondary markets.","Tom Lesnick","Got it. Would you expect that spread to continue to narrow or kind of stay the same?","Eric Bolton","There is nothing that we\u2019re seeing right now suggesting that it\u2019s going to gap out and spread. I mean, we continue to see a lot of investor interest in both large and secondary markets. I think that, if you began to see a meaningful increase in interest rates, you could begin to see it spread a little bit, but the fundamentals being as strong as they are, investor interest in this space being as strong as it is, there\u2019s certainly nothing to suggest near-term that we\u2019re going to see any real change in cap rates from what we see.","Tom Lesnick","I appreciate it. Nice quarter guys.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Tom, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Buck Horne","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Most of my questions are answered, I just got one more. With the $90 million of kind of call it free cash flow, you guys are expecting to generate on annual basis. As you sit here today, could you rank for us \u2013 how you think about the options or how to use the incremental free cash flow you\u2019re spinning off, I mean, whether that\u2019s dividend increase or debt reduction or acquisition, how do you think about potential uses of that free cash?","Eric Bolton","Well, our most accretive use of capital right now is frankly our redevelopment program and we\u2019re going to \u2013 as Tom alluded to earlier, we\u2019re going to push that agenda as appropriately as we can. But if we push it too hard, we start to compromise the return. So \u2013 but absent that, I mean Buck I mean, frankly we\u2019re comfortable with having the impact of the free cash flow for the moment at least showing up and just building balance sheet strength.","And as Al alluded to, based on everything that we\u2019ve got right now in our projections, we\u2019ll see debt-to-gross assets decline another 150 basis points this year. That\u2019s on top of comparable level of decline that we got last year. So I think this is a point where that discipline is important. And it always is important, but particularly right now. And if we wind up just not being able to put as much money out from an external growth perspective, and if you will, building capacity for the future opportunities I mean, that\u2019s okay at some level.","I mean, we\u2019re at a point right now where \u2013 we feel like our sort of annual long-term earnings growth rate for the \u2013 from a cash flow perspective is approaching around 6% or so. We raised the dividend about 6% last quarter or last \u2013 for this year if you will and I\u2019ve always believed that, you want to sort of get the platform into position where you can compound cash flow and compound dividend growth sort of a comparable rates.","So for the moment, we\u2019re just perfectly content to stay very active in the transaction market, stay disciplined and if the net result is, we\u2019re just building balance sheet strength capacity for the future as a fall out or a residual result, that\u2019s okay, we\u2019re good with that.","Buck Horne","Okay, thanks, very helpful. And just back to the cap rate question, I think you spent some time talking about the spreads between large and secondary. But just can you quantify for us, just generally what absolute level you\u2019re seeing in \u2013 for Class A assets in some of your markets?","Eric Bolton","Well, I can tell you in Class A assets in some of the larger markets are going to be 5%. We\u2019ve seen some go well below 5%, 4.5%. I would tell you that in the secondary market, a high-quality assets going to probably be 5% to maybe 5.25%. But a lot of them I mean, we\u2019re seeing a lot of stuff right around 5% in both large and secondary markets.","Buck Horne","Perfect, thanks very much.","Eric Bolton","You, bet. Thanks Buck.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Drew Babin with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Drew Babin","Hi, just a very quick follow-up and somewhat following on Buck\u2019s question. In an environment where there seems to be a bid for every type of asset, obviously property tax assessments have been catching up rapidly in CBD areas, do you see any risk of more kind of secondary markets, and maybe haven\u2019t seen the assessment to creep up as much yet, maybe at least directionally catching up to some degree?","Thomas Grimes","Don\u2019t really see any pressure of that right now Drew. As we talked about Florida, Texas and Florida, that they\u2019re most aggressive, so no direct pressure on that. I mean other areas in our portfolio, pretty modest to normalized growth expectations. And obviously, we\u2019ll get more information on that in the second quarter of this year.","Drew Babin","Okay, thank you.","Eric Bolton","Okay.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the program back to our speakers for closing remarks.","Eric Bolton","Thank you for joining us. And that\u2019s all we have today and we will see everyone at NAREIT.

Welcome to the MAA Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the companies will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, January 30th, 2020.","I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. Please go ahead.","Tim Argo","Thank you, Priscilla. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are; Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Rob DelPriore, our General Counsel; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Brad Hill, Executive Vice President and Head of Transactions.","Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I would like to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday\u2019s earnings release and our \u201834 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results.","These reports along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Tim and good morning. Our first \u2013 fourth quarter results were better than expected has improved rent growth and record low resident turnover continue to drive positive trends and overall revenue performance. Over the course of last year, we focused on an opportunity to prioritize rent growth and push that agenda throughout the year. As a result, we carry good pricing momentum into the New Year.","Based on our updated analysis, we do now expect that the overall level of new supply deliveries in 2020 will run higher than in 2019. This will of course vary by market. As has been routinely commented on, the majority of the new supply continues to be higher end product at a high price point.","Based on our detailed submarket analysis, it\u2019s important to note that the new supply forecasted to deliver in our markets in 2020 will be at rents that on average will be 25% higher than the rent across our properties in the same submarkets.","While we are certainly not immune to the impact of new supply, we see this pricing gap is generating good long-term opportunity, the price point of our portfolio, the quality of our locations, the diversified nature of our submarkets, the strength of our operating platform and a number of new initiatives that we are rolling out in 2020, along with the pricing momentum that was built in calendar year 2019 will continue to support steady growth in NOI over the coming year.","One of the benefits surrounding the new and higher price product delivering into the market is the expanding redevelopment opportunity created at a number of our properties. The price spread between the new supply and the existing rents that our properties creates opportunity to upgrade and still off \u2013 offer attractive value to our leasing prospects, while also generating a very accretive use of shareholder capital.","Our property upgrade and repositioning pipeline will expand in 2020, supporting above market rent growth at a number of locations over the next couple of years. We continue to find select opportunities to capture disciplined new external growth. We began the year with our new development pipeline at 2,100 units, representing $490 million in new investment. In addition, we have 640 new units undergoing initial lease-up, representing $146 million in additional new investment.","We did close on one new acquisition in Q4, consistent with the transactions we executed on over the past few years, this was a newly built property undergoing initial lease-up, we partially match funded the acquisition with new equity issue through our ATM program, thereby retaining plenty of growth capacity and protection for the balance sheet.","So in summary, our Sunbelt markets continue to capture great demand. MAA\u2019s portfolio is uniquely balanced and well positioned across the region to capture this demand. Our redevelopment and new development pipelines are growing. Emerging new technologies and products will also support further NOI growth and the balance sheet is in a great position with ample capacity to jump on compelling opportunities. I want to thank our team of associates here at MAA for a great year of performance in 2019 and we look forward to another year progress in 2020.","I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Grimes","Thank you Eric and good morning, everyone. Our operating performance for the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations with the steady demand for apartments and our enhanced platform, we\u2019ve continued momentum in rent growth and strong average daily occupancy. Same-store effective rent growth per unit increased 4.3% for the quarter, this is the seventh straight quarter of year-over-year improving ERU growth. As a result, our year-over-year same-store revenue growth was 4.1%, the highest it\u2019s been since 2016. Effective rent per unit increased 60 basis points sequential \u2013 sequentially.","Revenue performance was led by a steady momentum in blended new and renewal lease over lease pricing, up 2.6% for the quarter, which is a 100 basis points better than this time last year. In addition, average daily occupancy during the quarter remained strong at 95.7%.","As we wrap up January average daily occupancy is still strong at 95.5% and compares to 96% in January of last year. Our 60-day exposure which is all vacant units and notices through a 60-day period is just 7.2%, 10 basis points better than this time last year.","Looking forward as Eric mentioned, our overall supply in our markets is expected to increase expected increase in 2020. The Dallas, Houston and Savannah markets are expected to be the most challenging, based on our pricing progress last year, along with current rent and exposure trends, we expect our leading revenue markets to be Phoenix, Raleigh, Austin and Nashville.","Of course, the new supply creates an opportunity for a redevelopment platform. In addition to our kitchen and bath program, we\u2019re underway with an amenity upgrade program at 10 communities, there\u2019s $20 million to $25 million investment in 2020, it\u2019s primarily focused on legacy post assets, where the product was built in [excellent] [ph] locations, and new supply continues to push the rent of the submarket up. In these cases, we can update leasing centers, hallways and common areas create shared workspaces, outdoor gathering areas and rooftop decks to allow us to increase rent, while still offering compelling value in these submarkets.","Our technology platform also continues to expand. Our overhaul \u2013 overhauled operating system and new website has contributed to our ability to attract, engage and create value for our residents. Our tests on smart homes have gone well. The technology was installed in 15 communities with minimal disruption has been well received by our residents. We expect to install 24,000 smart home units in 2020.","Our high speed internet access initiative is deploying and will be a contributor to 2020 NOI growth. We\u2019re also exploring a range of AI chat, customer resource management and prospect engagement tools. We\u2019re pleased with the progress our teams made in 2019 and greatly appreciate their efforts, with a solid base of earned in rent growth as we head into 2020 and are excited about the opportunities ahead. Brad?","Brad Hill","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll provide brief comments on what we are seeing in the transaction market, as well as on our transaction activity at Q4. As you\u2019re all aware, the transaction market continues to be extremely competitive with record levels of liquidity and demand for multifamily properties.","Given the favorable migration and job growth trends that exist in our region of the country, investor demand for multifamily properties within our footprint continues to be robust, leading to deep better pools, aggressive pricing and compressed cap rates. Reflecting the positive job growth and strong demand, we expect supply to increase in 2020.","This increased level of supply should continue to support a historically high level of acquisition and pre-purchase deal flow. We remain disciplined in our capital deployment decisions and Al and his team have our balance sheet in great shape, allowing us to respond to compelling investment opportunities as they materialize.","As we\u2019ve done in the past, we\u2019ll continue to focus our acquisition efforts on new lease-ups. In Q4, we closed on the acquisition of The Greene in downtown Greenville, South Carolina. This was a recently completed asset, involving a developer and equity provider we\u2019ve worked within the past. The asset was still in its initial lease-up with the equity requiring a certain and quick close by year end. We were able to execute on the acquisition at a stabilized market cap rate of 5.1%.","In 2020, we\u2019ll also continue to pursue pre-purchase opportunities. As a reminder, this is a program where we partner with good developers that have access to great real estate. We bring the capital to debenture in return \u2013 and in return, we get access to an asset at a reduced basis with a clear path to a 100% ownership at stabilization. This program allows us to selectively pick well located, to be built assets, while minimizing our overall development risk.","In Q4, we closed and started construction on a 264 unit pre-purchase located nine miles southwest of downtown Orlando, in a very desirable high income, Dr. Phillips area. And finally in Q4, we took advantage of strong investor demand and pricing and sold all 5 of our assets and exited the Little Rock Arkansas market.","We had over 25 qualified bidders offer on these properties. We achieved good pricing for this non-core market with 24-year old properties, equating to a 5.4% market cap rate. We will continue to selectively prune our portfolio on an ongoing basis and we\u2019ll have more to say about our specific 2020 disposition plans in coming quarters.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Al.","Al Campbell","Thank you, Brad and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll provide some brief commentary on the company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings performance, major financing activity and then finally on our initial guidance for 2020.","Reported FFO per share of $1.68 for the fourth quarter was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our guidance with majority of this outperformance produced by property NOI as both operating revenues and expenses were favorable to expectations for the quarter.","FFO per share was $6.55 for the full year, which included several items considered unusual and not core to our business such as the market-to-market valuation of our preferred shares and gains on sales of land parcels. Excluding these non-core items, FFO for the full year would have been $6.26 per share. As to discuss more in a moment, we are providing earnings guidance for 2020 on a core FFO basis, which we believe will help provide a clear picture of performance.","We\u2019re active on the financing front during the fourth quarter as we issued $300 million of new public bonds. We also retired $170 million of unsecured loans and $17 million of debt \u2013 additional secured debt. The effective interest rate of the new bonds will be 3.1% over 10 years, after considering the interest rate hedges related to the financings.","We ended the year with 98.4% of our debt fixed with an average duration of almost 8 years which is a record for the company. During the fourth quarter, we also issued $20 million in new equity through our ATM program, essentially match funding a portion of the Greenville property acquisition mentioned my Brad.","Finally, we are providing initial earnings guidance for 2020 with the release, which is detailed in our Supplemental Information package. Providing guidance for net income per diluted common share, which is reconciled at FFO, core FFO and core AFFO in the supplement. Core FFO for the full year 2020 is projected to be $6.38 to $6.62 per share or $6.50 per share at the midpoint. The definition of core FFO including a description of the items considered non-core can be found in our supplemental package.","The primary driver of 2020 earnings performance, the same-store NOI growth, which is projected to be 3.5% at the midpoint. Effective rent growth for the year is expected to be around 3.7% produced by 2020 lease-up release blended rental pricing growth of 3.4% at the midpoint, combined with the 2019 blended rental pricing of 4.4% achieved. This pricing combined with a slight decrease in average occupancy to 95.8% average for the year, brings projected total rental revenue to the 3.5% range.","Fees and other income items combined or projected to add an additional 20 basis points to 25 basis points to revenue growth for the year, with the primary driver being a 55 basis points contribution from the Double Play bulk internet program, which is partially offset by other fees and reimbursement items which are projected to remain essentially flat for 2020, primarily due to slightly lower occupancy. These items combined to produce our total same-store revenue growth expectation of 3.75% for 2020 at the midpoint.","Same-store operating expenses will continue to have some pressure from real estate taxes and insurance costs for the year and we\u2019ll also have the additional expenses related to the Double Play bulk internet program which is recorded on a gross basis. These items combined to produce projected same-store expense growth a 4.25% for the full year at the midpoint.","The forecast also assumes a modest increase in overall \u2013 of overhead cost just below 3% for the year and continue to use of our ATM program to essentially match fund expected acquisitions for the year with $80 million of new equity issuance projected of course, assuming we find accretive uses of capital during the year.","And that\u2019s all we have in the way of prepared comments, Priscilla. So now we\u2019ll turn the call back over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question today from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi. Good morning, everybody. Brad, you mentioned supply is increasing in your markets in 2020, which I presume is off of your kind of detailed supply analysis. Could you quantify that thought and tell us which of your top markets have seen the biggest increases or decreases?","Tom Grimes","Hey \u2013 Austin, it\u2019s Tom, I\u2019m going to jump in. where, we really think that we\u2019ll see the most pressure from new supply is in Dallas primarily it\u2019ll continue to be challenged, but we\u2019re \u2013 but it\u2019s \u2013 that supplies coming in at 45% above our market \u2013 our [technical difficulty].","And then I think we would expect that Houston, Savannah and Charleston will soften over time as supply comes online, but feel like we\u2019ve got you know, Phoenix and Raleigh will probably lead the pack in terms of performance and we\u2019ve also got strong momentum in the face of elevated supply with Austin, Atlanta and Nashville.","Brad Hill","And Austin real quick just to clarify when Tom says its supplies coming in at 45% on top of us that\u2019s a rent gap between what we have in place with new supply that\u2019s coming in is about 45% higher in rent than what our assets are.","Austin Wurschmidt","Yeah, that makes sense. And then what\u2019s the supply sort of for the overall portfolio? What are kind of the numbers when you compare what it was in 2019 and what you\u2019re expecting for this year?","Tom Grimes","Yeah. So if you look at our radius, supply as a percent of inventory, we\u2019ll \u2013 this 2019 was about 1% of supply delivered and this year, it\u2019ll be 1.6% in 2020.","Austin Wurschmidt","Got it. Thank you for that. And then kind of going back to the clarification on the rent for units being delivered versus what\u2019s in place. Eric, you kind of highlighted that you know, across the overall portfolio, I think you said 25%. How does that 25% compared to the last two years to three years of where new supply was coming in versus you know, where your portfolio was at the time?","Tom Grimes","I don\u2019t have those numbers right in front of me, Austin, but we reviewed them and it\u2019s very similar to what it is this year.","Eric Bolton","I think as construction costs continue to escalate \u2013 our land costs continue to escalate, I think if you go back over the last several years, you\u2019re going to find that that gap is going up. Certainly the rise in cost of construction is accelerating at a pace faster than unit growth is accelerating. So, I think if you go back over the last several years, you\u2019ll find that that gap is probably spread somewhat.","Austin Wurschmidt","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for the time.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Neil Malkin with Capital One. Your line is open.","Neil Malkin","Hey. Good morning, guys. First question on the operating expense side. Talked about implementing technology through several of the assets and units across your portfolio. I\u2019m wondering if any of that is also pressuring operating expenses or is all that being capitalized? And then what are your expectations for payroll and insurance growth in 2020?","Al Campbell","Let me make sure I\u2019m understanding, can you tell me what you \u2013 in the first portion, what expenditures were you talking about specifically, Neil, to make sure I\u2019m clear?","Neil Malkin","Yeah, yeah. So the elevated operating expenses, because yours mostly related to the bulk internet program, but I thought you\u2019re also implementing a smart home technology package. Are those \u2013","Al Campbell","Okay. Okay, I know I got it. Yes, we are and a majority of that is capital. So just give you a little breakdown of the expenses. I think the midpoint as we talked about was 4.25% growth for the year and about 65 basis points that is related to the bulk internet program. And then, you have real estate taxes which are a third of our expenses as probably another 60 basis points. So if you strip all of that out, the other items, personnel, R&M, utilities, all those things are growing together about 3% for the year.","Tim Argo","You know, Neil, I\u2019ll add to that you mentioned specifically insurance, we\u2019re expecting you know probably low double-digit increase for insurance program which will renew in July.","Neil Malkin","Okay, great. You know recently there has been some pretty strong homebuilder confidence. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing that you know, play out in any way or anecdotally in terms of the people who are moving out of, they\u2019re moving out to home purchase, and\/or if the builders are you know, starting to focus more on at the entry level homes or still the sort of higher price point homes?","Tom Grimes","No, we\u2019ve not seen the folks move out for entry level homes, in fact, move out to home buying was down 10% this quarter, and that\u2019s part of what continues to drive our turnover down.","Neil Malkin","Okay, I guess last one for me, can you just talk about what cap rates have done? Just talk about maybe in your top five markets you know, over the last maybe 6 months for you know, A and versus B product?","Brad Hill","Yeah. Hey, Neil this is Brad. You know, I\u2019d say just broadly speaking, cap rates just continued to decline. I mean, certainly the demand for multifamily, if you heard anything about the NMHC Conference last week, where attendance was up record levels. So I think the demand for multifamily assets continues to be very, very strong.","And you know, every indication we have and you know, from selling properties to be very, very active in the acquisition market and the numbers we\u2019re seeing in cap rates continue to come down. And I\u2019d say the gap between As and Bs continues to compress and you know, we don\u2019t \u2013 we certainly don\u2019t see anything changing you know, the liquidity in the market that\u2019s really driving that at this point.","Neil Malkin","Thank you, guys, very much.","Brad Hill","Thanks Neil.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Nick Joseph with Citi. Your line is open.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. I hope you can give a little more color on the bulk internet program. In terms of the contracts with the providers, how long are those typically and then from a rental perspective, do all units need to opt into the program or is there an opportunity to opt in or opt out?","Tom Grimes","No. On the first when there, 5 year to 7 year contracts depends on the provider and we\u2019ve got the option to opt out for 3 years I believe but don\u2019t hold me into that, Nick. On the \u2013 as the rollout goes, all residents participate in it. And when we did this, you know, we had the bulk cable program for a while, we decided to add high speed internet access.","When we did that, we looked at our market and who\u2019s already subscribing for high speed internet access and 80% of our residents are already paying for the speed that we\u2019re providing or less. So it\u2019s an upgrade and they\u2019re paying less through us for that. Part of the reason that our results were a little better than we expected in the fourth quarter is, Nick, we really assume that would roll in on new leases on renewals, but the number of existing residents that chose to opt in mid lease was higher than we expected.","Nick Joseph","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe to that point, where are you in terms of the rollout? And then how long will it take to be fully deployed?","Tom Grimes","We have one provider done and the next provider underway, and I would think we\u2019d be deployed by May \u2013 fully deployed by May, with some carryover the benefit, of course in the 2020, because they\u2019ll ramp up from there.","Nick Joseph","Right, thank you.","Tom Grimes","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","John Kim","Thank you. Tom, in your prepared remarks you mentioned current occupancy is at 95.5%, which is 50 basis points lower than last year. Can you just comment on how concerned you are that occupancy may come in at the low end of your guidance or potentially lower than that given new supply?","Tom Grimes","No, [technical difficulty] as you will have noticed for the last year, we\u2019ve really felt like and continue to feel that with demand, the way that it is now is the time to raise rents and build our effective occupancy and that is the basis for which our steady rent growth from quarter-to-quarter and the growth that we\u2019ve seen throughout the year is built. And we\u2019re willing to give up a little bit of occupancy on that though, 95.5%, very solid from our perspective.","But we feel pretty good about that this time of the year I\u2019ll expect it to be a little lower than I would expect that you\u2019ll see that climb as the year goes on, but we\u2019re certainly not going to be shooting for 96.2% to 96.4% you know, we\u2019re very happy in the range that we\u2019re in and it\u2019s starting right where we thought it would.","John Kim","And can you provide commentary on how you see job growth or other demand drivers in your markets this year versus last year?","Tom Grimes","Yeah. I mean, job growth, we see no slowdown at this point. And the \u2013 you know, we continue to see interest in the Sunbelt and in migration trends, renewal rates continue to stay in the 6% to 7% range right now. So we\u2019d anticipate those coming down a bit this year. But right now, demand is very strong and for that reason, we\u2019ll continue to prioritize rent growth.","John Kim","Okay. And then your development pipeline increased to $490 million this quarter. Can you just comment on how big you feel comfortable with the pipeline is going forward? And are you developing at any different spec as far as adding smart home technology or any new technology as part of the development program?","Eric Bolton","This is Eric, John. I \u2013 you know, we\u2019re very comfortable where the development pipeline is at this point. I mean, we\u2019ve established the tolerance that we felt very comfortable with, the 3% to 4% of enterprise value, which should put the pipeline tolerance, if you will, at $500 million to $700 million. So at $490 million we\u2019re pretty comfortable with where it is at this point.","We have several other projects that we\u2019re working on now, if you will, in a predevelopment sense, that we will start anything else this year. We do have a couple of land sites that we either own or tied up, but I suspect it will be early \u201821 before we\u2019ll get those projects going. So we\u2019re very comfortable with where the pipeline is at this point. And yes, as this new product is being developed, the smart home technology and a lot of the new technology services and products that Tom has alluded to, they were certainly a part of you know, what we build going forward.","John Kim","Great, thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Bank. Your line is open.","Zach Silverberg","Hi, Zach Silverberg here with Haendel. Just a quick follow-up on John\u2019s question. How do you guys view new development yields against IRRs and how do they turn against IRRs compared to acquisitions?","Eric Bolton","You know, we\u2019re generally seeing right now that our stabilized yields out of our development are somewhere in the 100 basis points to 125 basis points higher than what we are capturing on the acquisitions as Brad alluded to The Greene, the deal we bought in Greenville stabilized yield that just over 5%. We\u2019re seeing our stable \u2013 our projected stabilized yields on our development pipeline right now trending anywhere from 6% to 6.5%. So you know, call it a 100 basis points, 125 basis points spread.","Zach Silverberg","All right, thanks. And could you provide an update on the quarter and year-to-date leased rates between those legacy post portfolio and the MAA portfolio? And is there any extra opportunity that we should view this year between the two of them?","Tom Grimes","Yeah, we do \u2013 or I do not have that information in front of me, we\u2019ve largely narrowed that gap or that gap is narrowed, to be honest with you and differences between post and Mid America assets in the same submarket are negligible. Now going forward as I touched on with our redevelopment program and amenity upgrade, we do still have opportunities in those very strong locations to update the exterior and amenity packages there, and that is more of a 2021 impact that we\u2019ll see from the work that we do \u2013","Eric Bolton","Tom is referring to the post \u2013 the legacy post locations for the upgrades, so we\u2019ll probably see more robust rent growth emerge out of the post, but it\u2019s more a function of the upgrade as opposed to market differences.","Zach Silverberg","All right, that\u2019s all for me. Thanks for the time guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open.","Rob Stevenson","Good morning, guys. Tom, so same-store revenue guidance is 3.25% to 4.25%. What do you expect \u2013 where are you expecting your top markets to come out? Where are you expecting the bottom performers to come out? What\u2019s the sort of spread that under \u2013 underpins that 3.75% midpoint?","Tom Grimes","I mean, Rob, [technical difficulty] that range to be on a blended basis, the top markets in that \u2013 probably in that for 4%, 4.5% range and the bottom markets in the 2%, 2.5% something like that. I\u2019m estimating that to be honest with you, but that\u2019s rough feedback.","Rob Stevenson","Okay, so nobody is sort of close to flat or even negative or anything. It\u2019s all sort of at least 1%, 1.5% positive at the bottom end?","Tom Grimes","Correct. I think on a blended basis, we would expect to get a full year traction and not have many people go backwards.","Eric Bolton","And Rob, I\u2019ll tell you, you know, this is Eric. I mean, to some degree, the opportunity that we carry from 2019 into 2020, because of the focus on prioritization, on rent growth, it really puts us in a much better position to work through some of the supply pressures in these markets in 2020 and really enables us to avoid any the real weak performance metrics that you might \u2013 that you know, you were alluding to as a possibility. I think that, you know, we knew we\u2019re heading into this year that we likely would see some moderation or some sort occur and that was part of the reason behind the logic of focusing so intently on the rent growth last year, which really helps us this year.","Rob Stevenson","Where are you guys \u2013 on that topic I mean, how are you guys thinking about turnover for 2020 I mean, it was only 47% last year. I mean, are you anticipating it being sort of flattish, are you expecting more contraction, some re-expansion there? And how big of a benefit is that to you if it stays low from an earnings standpoint?","Tom Grimes","Yeah, as far as our expectation, we expect it to be up slightly, we don\u2019t see any fundamental changes coming across the board, but it is, you know, honestly hard to assume that it will continue to drop, and that plays into our earnings forecast really minimally at this point, Al may add some color.","Al Campbell","If you look at what we\u2019ve got done then for occupancy, we\u2019ve given ourselves about 15 basis points decline, there\u2019s a little bit of increase in turnover applied and but nothing significant I would say.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And did I hear you guys correctly that you\u2019re going to do 24,000 smart home unit installs in 2020?","Tom Grimes","That is correct, Rob.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And what is the cost for that? How much you\u2019re doing per unit?","Tom Grimes","The average cost on that is $1,300 on the install and that gives you locks, thermostat, two lights, two moisture system sensors and an interactive flat panel display that\u2019s the resident interface as well as their app.","Al Campbell","And it\u2019s more things that\u2019s it\u2019s important I think and doing your model, Rob, there the smart home program plus the amenity redevelopments that Tom has talked about we\u2019re investing about $60 million in capital this year in that, which is very strong returns, but a lot of that will begin to come more strongly in 2021.","Rob Stevenson","Okay, so I mean, in terms of units, though, that you redevelop in 2020, you know, instead of being 6,000 is that going to be wrapped up or is that going to be separate? So in other words, are you going from essentially 6,000 to 7,500 a unit on the redevelopment or I assume there might be some sort of cost savings if you\u2019ve got to open up walls and do whatever anyway, but I mean, is that going to be wrapped up into a higher redevelopment per unit cost for the you know, whatever number of units you do redevelopment, interior or full scale redevelopment on?","Tom Grimes","Sure. And a lot of those programs are separate. And the reason that they are separate is because the timing is different in them. And if you remember on the kitchen and bath redevelopment, we do that on turn, when we install smart homes, we go in and we do the whole property at one time and then move people on to the product. So those programs are independent of one another.","Al Campbell","And that\u2019s really why I mentioned them, Rob, this is Al, if you think about it, the program that we\u2019ve done for many years into your redevelopment part we\u2019ll continue along at basically the same pace call it, 7 \u2013 7,000 to 8,000 units at you know, 5,000 to 6000 per unit spinning on that and that\u2019s been the same level and that\u2019ll have a contribution to earnings growth.","On top of that, are the two programs that Tom was mentioning, the amenity redevelopment and of course, the smart home and those together about an additional $60 million that are great investments that have begun to pay off more in 2020 and that was really a point as we model it to help you lay that in right.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then just last one for me, Al. Property taxes especially elevated any specific markets?","Al Campbell","You know continues to be the same with tenders flow. I mean, what we have this year, when the beginning in the year you don\u2019t know a lot, we\u2019ll go back to that, Rob and what we do know is about a third of our portfolio is a revaluation year, we continue to expect pressure in Florida, Texas, maybe North Carolina a little bit this year. So we dial that in and so we know overall, we do expect our costs to come down a little bit, you know, the 4% to 5% range is 4.5% midpoint is about 50 basis points down.","And also, you know, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about some of the changes in Texas, the new law changes hard to know where that\u2019s going to play out over the next few years. We don\u2019t yet know how that\u2019s going to affect both millage rates or valuations. So we dialed in what we think we\u2019re going to have and over time, we\u2019re hopeful that line begins to come down a bit, that 4.5% in 2020 is our expectation.","Rob Stevenson","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Hardik Goel","Hey guys, how are you? Thanks for taking my question here. I actually wanted to touch upon supply again. The way we look at it, it doesn\u2019t seem to be as impactful as maybe you\u2019ve mentioned. Beyond Dallas and Houston, the two markets that you\u2019ve highlighted, can you give us a sense for supply and your, you know, maybe secondary, tertiary markets and how that\u2019s shaping up?","Tom Grimes","Sure, probably the market with the secondary group with the largest impact is probably Charleston moving from 2.3% as a percent of inventory to 4.8%. Now we\u2019re a little encouraged by that, because the \u2013 where the supply has been, where it lines up to our A assets is in Mount Pleasant and the Mount Pleasant moratoriums have finally taken an effect. And so while Charleston has seen higher, that supply has moved to the Upper Peninsula area, which is as you know is across the Ravenel Bridge from Mount Pleasant.","So we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re a little bit optimistic there. But again, you know, we see Charlotte at 2.5% to 3.7%, others in the secondary market on our \u2013 Greenville goes from 2.1% of supply to 2.3%. So, not a lot of change. They\u2019re probably the other market that has the biggest increased delta between 19 to 20 years in Savannah, Georgia you know, in 2019, they delivered 3% of the existing supply \u2013 market supply into the market in 2020 that jumps to 7%.","Now you recognize, Savannah is only 2% of our same-store NOI so it\u2019s not a huge impact, but it\u2019s kind of hit or miss you know, somewhere up a little bit, somewhere up or more than others, but because of the diversified nature of our capital across these particularly secondary markets, you know, we \u2013 it\u2019s not particularly significant, but you know it varies a bit by market.","Hardik Goel","And just one quick follow-up, could you share the new and renewal for the quarter?","Tom Grimes","Yeah, sure. The new for the quarter was 90 basis points down renewal 7% blended 2.6%, which is a 100 basis points better than last year.","Hardik Goel","Thanks. That\u2019s all.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question today from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Your line is open.","Rich Anderson","Hey, thanks. Good morning.","Eric Bolton","Hey, Rich.","Rich Anderson","So last year, your same-store growth sort of cadence, kind of climbed over the course of the year from 2.5% on the NOI line to 5% to end the year out in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m wondering if that means sort of a mirror image in 2020 where, you know, you start the year somewhat stronger than you end it on the basis of, you know, increasingly tougher comps?","Eric Bolton","Well, I mean, certainly I think the prior year comparisons will be a little bit more challenging for us this year. A lot of the momentum that we had last year was a function of our, you know, clear focus that we had that going into last year about focusing on rent growth, you know, at the expense of a low occupancy give up, and that momentum you know, built over the course of the year.","So, I think that and which is really helping us this year as we carry a lot of that momentum that baked in, if you will, into 2020. We do think that as a result of some of the supply issues in a number of markets that our lease over lease pricing, if you will, the more current pricing that\u2019s occurring in 2020 will be off a little bit from the trends that we saw in 2019, but a combination of the, you know, the carry forward that we have from last year and the, you know, the plans that we have this year still offer up you know, a blended lease over lease pricing performance for 2020 at 3.4%.","So, you know, we think you know that\u2019s off a little bit from last year, but 3.4% of blended pricing performance in 2020 in the face of some of the supply pressures that we see on these markets, we feel pretty good about that actually. And still a strong occupancy that we think will capture as well. So, you know, I think these markets continue to show resiliency because of the strong demand in our portfolio in particular, because of the diversified nature of the markets that we\u2019re in.","Al Campbell","I\u2019ll just add to give the how that\u2019s slated into our projections to support that what Eric was saying is, all quarters and this year is going to be a little more stable just because of where we are. And all quarters are sort of in that 3.5% to 4% revenue range for the year and so second and third quarter maybe a little bit higher, but it\u2019s \u2013 there all in that range much more stable.","Eric Bolton","I\u2019ll add one point even though that blended pricing is a little bit lower in \u201820 as the smart home and the bulk internet start to take hold, it helps the back half of the year a little more than certainly the first half.","Rich Anderson","Okay, great, thanks. In terms of the external growth sort of projections for this year obviously more on the acquisitions. How much of that is sort of just pre-purchase opportunity? And how much of that is cost to capital that\u2019s making deals work a bit more easily in 2020 versus previous years?","Eric Bolton","Well, I mean, we think that it\u2019s more likely than not that the vast majority of the acquisitions that we do will be some pre-purchases of things to be built. We may \u2013 particularly as you get towards the back half of the year, we see the opportunity set improve a little bit for buying lease-up deals as we get closer to a year end and developers or owners get a little bit more motivated, get some things done.","But, you know, certainly, you know, our cost to capital has improved and it does at the margin, generate a little bit more flexibility in this regard. But at the end of the day, I mean, we\u2019re really driven by, you know, can we deploy the capital and create a stabilized yield on that investment, that\u2019s going to be accretive to our existing earnings profile. And that\u2019s what really drives our mindset.","We pay attention obviously to our cost to capital, but just the idea that you know that there is all of a sudden, a better spread opportunity in and of itself is not what compels us to go out and start putting money to work. We want to be sure we\u2019re adding earning assets they\u2019re going to be accretive to the existing earnings profile of the company.","Rich Anderson","So declining cost to capital doesn\u2019t mean you know, you\u2019re willing to take a lower yield or does it influence your underwriting?","Eric Bolton","No, it really doesn\u2019t. We \u2013 we do not want to, you know, begin to just take on a bunch of lower yielding investments, just simply because the cost to capital is adjusted as it has. We\u2019re trying to compile a long-term earnings growth profile for the company and we\u2019re trying to protect that long-term earnings growth profile, and just adding a bunch of low-earning investments, because our cost to capital happens to be where it is, you know, really runs counter to that long-term objective.","Rich Anderson","Well, and you say lower cap rates sometimes lead to higher growth in the second year of ownership, but that\u2019s just and I think another observation. Anyway, last question for me, I appreciate the positive wrap or you\u2019re putting around the supply, which you know, it makes sense to me in terms of premium relative to where your rents are, but clearly it rather not be the case, right? I mean, this is making the best of a not so great situation from a supply perspective, with concessions that can be offered newer product and a strong job market, people might have a willingness to you know, to entertain optionality. So in your mind, while you see some opportunity out of the supply picture, what is the risk though, that this could you know, actually have be more damaging when you consider that the health of job markets in your you know, neck of the woods?","Eric Bolton","Well, certainly, I think the supply picture and the supply pressure, you know, as \u2013 and talked about, it does create some short-term pressure and as evidenced in our guidance. I mean, we assume that our lease over lease pricing in 2020 on a blended basis runs about 100 basis points below 2019. So there\u2019s no question that you get into these heavier supply scenarios, particularly where there\u2019s leasing concessions coming into the market, that there are some short-term pressure generated.","And as I mentioned, that can vary quite a bit by market and in a bigger market like a Dallas, you know, you\u2019re going to see more pressure than you are in a smaller market like a Greenville, South Carolina and that\u2019s why we tend to be very focused in our efforts to deploy capital across the region in both large and secondary markets in an effort to something you\u2019ll remember, Rich in an effort to get our full cycle performance profile that we\u2019re after.","So you know, I certainly acknowledge and we do that there is going to be some near-term pressure from some of the supply we\u2019ve got that dialed in, we think appropriately into our guidance. But I will tell you, the fact that there\u2019s a lot of this new high price product that\u2019s coming into our locations. We think that long-term that\u2019s a good thing, it says good things about our neighborhoods, it says good things about the value of the real estate in those neighborhoods, and it creates the opportunities that we alluded to, to continue over the next few years to get some not only good rent growth because of the improvement we\u2019re making in the assets, but also great returns on our capital. This is the most accretive use of money that we have right now as this redevelopment initiatives. So, you know, yeah, we\u2019ll deal with a little short-term pressure, but the long-term value play is pretty darn attractive.","Rich Anderson","Got you. Thanks, Eric. Thanks, team.","Eric Bolton","You bet.","Tim Argo","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Drew Babin with Baird. Your line is open.","Drew Babin","Good morning. A quick follow-on question to Rob\u2019s question earlier on the Texas tax revenue caps. It sounds to me like that is not baked into your same-store expense guidance range at all. It seems like you know, maybe a longer-term benefit. Is that true or is there any kind of directional benefit that\u2019s beginning to influence guidance there?","Al Campbell","No I mean I think we dial in what we think it\u2019s going to be our best estimate at this point, Drew I mean, you know, the cap is not at a taxpayer level, it is at the market level and so I think there still some things to be worked out exactly how that\u2019s going to play to each individual asset, the valuation and the millage rates that in the year for all of the markets.","So we dial in what we think it\u2019s going to be and I think \u2013 what we would say is, over time, hopefully those walls are helpful in restraining the \u2013 perhaps the rows of taxes in Texas, and that\u2019s hard to say taxes in Texas, but, but I think in the short-term is yet to be seen exactly what it\u2019s going to play out and it\u2019s the best when we put our best estimate on that.","Drew Babin","Okay, and one follow-up on the same-store revenue build up, the blended leasing spreads from \u201919, blended leasing spread in guidance, marrying that with the occupancy guide and Double Play impact it would seem like the revenue build up goes towards the high end of guidance, which I would surmise, there\u2019s maybe some other ancillary type items that may be a little flattered and dragging on that which you know, that was a trend kind of throughout 2019 as well. Can you talk about what kind of the growth in other, aside from the Double Play? What was that other income growth in \u201819? What will it be in \u201820? And is there anything going on in that to kind of drive new other income you know, in the 2021, anything else you\u2019re kind of doing?","Al Campbell","I think the easiest way to do that, quickest way to maybe, Drew is to just say talk about what our growth would have been, our guidance would have been without assuming the bulk internet program this year. And we would have had, you know, mid quarter range somewhere around 3.2% growth revenues, 3.6% for operating expenses, and 3% for NOI and then so you have the bulk internet program on top of that.","And so \u2013 so that can kind of help beat on. I think the 3.2% on revenue is a combination of the rents that we put on the table this year. The 3.4% blended lease that we expect to get combined with what we did last year, that\u2019s helpful, giving up a little bit on occupancy, 15 basis points or so.","Then the other fee income items other than the bulk internet you know, the reimbursement items and trash test fee, other items they\u2019re effectively flat with last year essentially, which, you know, your growth rate would move a little bit, get you down to that 3.2% expectation for the year. And then on expenses, we talked about 3.6% and really everything but real estate taxes would have been about 3%. So I hope that\u2019s helpful and gives you what you\u2019re looking for.","Drew Babin","Okay, and it sounds like the Double Play program is being implemented kind of fairly rapidly and so the benefits will be kind of mostly in 2020. Is there anything else you\u2019re doing on the other income side that might help \u201821 kind of coming off of that \u201820 comp, any other additional you know apartment fees, things like that anything else kind of in the hopper that\u2019s being worked on or the technology element, you know, might that move the needle as well?","Eric Bolton","Well I would tell you that a lot of the Double Play, I mean, we\u2019re going to roll it out over the course first half this year, but I really think the full year benefit will be more next year.","Tom Grimes","It\u2019s about half this year and half next year, because while we deploy it, and will be deployed in May, residents have to sign up for when they do on lease and renewal.","Eric Bolton","I think that that\u2019s going to build up over this year and we\u2019ll see more benefit in 2021. The other thing, though, that Al alluded to, and we talked about here is this repositioning effort that we\u2019re doing with Double Play and with the more enhanced amenity upgrades. What\u2019s happening is we\u2019re investing a lot of that capital this year, this calendar year 2020 in the real rent growth that fund that will actually emerge in 2021. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s a play here. A lot of that benefit will play out next year, not this year.","Drew Babin","Okay, that\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Rick Skidmore","Good morning. Thank you. Eric, you mentioned in your prepared comments some new initiatives in 2020, perhaps I missed the number, but can you \u2013 perhaps speak to what those new initiatives are that you\u2019re focused on in 2020?","Eric Bolton","Well, you know, Tom can jump in here. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 now it\u2019s bulk \u2013 Double Play initiative, the high speed internet program that we\u2019re rolling out was what I was referencing, we got the more the smart home technology implementation that we\u2019re going to be rolling out this year.","And then as I was just mentioning, we\u2019ve got some repositioning opportunities with some of the legacy post assets that will be rolling out this year, and are working on this year, and as I was just mentioning, you know, and then as Tom alluded to, there\u2019s some other new technologies, the AI chat, some other things that were, you know, self-touring and other things that we\u2019ll be testing out later this year. We don\u2019t really expect any impact this year, but we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate those programs for possible implementation in 2021.","Rick Skidmore","Great, thank you.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Rick.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.","John Pawlowski","Hey, thanks. Maybe just a follow-up to your response to Drew\u2019s question. So it sounds like if the rollout for the Double Play internet goes as expected, the NOI contribution or the NOI lift in 2021 is greater than the 50 bps in 2020? Is that accurate?","Al Campbell","More comparable, I would say. I mean, we\u2019re rolling out, there\u2019s two phases of program, two major providers that we\u2019re doing it in 2020, you know, we\u2019ll have a full layer of one of those providers building the second one. So I would say probably something \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t increase, it might be something comparable.","Eric Bolton","Yeah, I think equal, maybe slightly a little less since we\u2019ve got the biggest provider in line now and we\u2019re working on the rest of the portfolio.","John Pawlowski","Okay. And then Tom, listening to your comments on which markets do you think will lead the pack and which markets may lag? Is it a fair read that your \u2013 as an aggregate the smaller or secondary markets will be below average in terms of same-store revenue growth?","Tom Grimes","I don\u2019t \u2013 well I don\u2019t have them split exactly that way. But we\u2019ve got you know, some encouraging places on both sides of that \u2013 on both sides of that equation. So I think we are probably the runaway leaders are Phoenix and Raleigh but I\u2019ll tell you Birmingham, Huntsville and play \u2013 and Memphis have been pretty solid players for us and we would expect that to continue.","John Pawlowski","Okay, and then final one for me if I could sneak it in there. DC revenue growth has been accelerating nicely for you \u2013 for you last few quarters and then slowed meaningfully this quarter. So is there anything idiosyncratic this quarter that hit the DC market or the fundamental slowing in your eyes in the market?","Tom Grimes","We don\u2019t believe the fundamentals are slowing. It\u2019s really a comparison between the prior year, the two quarters. So last quarter \u2013 in the third quarter, we had a 30 basis point occupancy comparison tailwind that juiced revenues a little bit. And this quarter in the fourth quarter of \u201918 we were at 96.6%, and we\u2019re 96% this go around. So we had a 60 basis point headwind.","John Pawlowski","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question today from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.","Aaron Wolf","Hey guys, good morning. This is Aaron Wolf for John. Two quick questions. Can you provide any detail on the price per unit on the Greenville asset that you recently acquired and also on the Little Rock, Arkansas portfolio?","Brad Hill","Yeah, so this is Brad here. Let me get the details of that up in front of me. So the price per unit on the Greenville deal. Excuse me. Want to make sure I get you the right number there. So that was [268,000] [ph] a unit for the Greenville deal, which as we said a moment ago was a 5.1% cap rate on that asset. And then I\u2019m sorry, your second question?","Aaron Wolf","Little Rock. Little Rock.","Brad Hill","Yeah, so our Little Rock assets we sold, the total price there was just under [150,000] [ph] [technical difficulty] it was 109,000 a unit.","Aaron Wolf","Okay, great. Thank you. And one last helpful and one last for me you may have disclosed this already. I apologize if you did, but the average share price on the ATM activity in the quarter?","Al Campbell","You can get from the press release, the proceeds and the shares that\u2019s around $136 a share I believe what that will come to.","Aaron Wolf","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Brad Hill","Thank you.","Al Campbell","Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude our Q&A session for today as well as our call.

Welcome to the MAA First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, April 27, 2017. ","I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Argo","Thank you, Jessica. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I would like to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. ","Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the safe harbor language included in yesterday\u2019s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. FFO results for the quarter were ahead of our expectations as property operating expenses, interest expense and merger and integration costs all came in lower than expected. While leasing conditions across most markets reflect varying degrees of moderation as a result of increased levels of new supply, we continue to see strong demand across our markets with high resident retention and MAA\u2019s balanced portfolio continues to capture solid results. We also terrific start with integration activities in our merger with Post Properties. The early results and improved operating efficiency and NOI margin enhancement are very encouraging.","In the first quarter, our operating team was able to improve the NOI margin within the Legacy Post same-store portfolio 130 basis points as compared to prior year. Our initial efforts on the revenue side were focused on stabilizing occupancy, lowering exposure and reconciling practices associated with lease renewal pricing. During the quarter, our Asset Management Group was also completed the retooling of key market data within our revenue management system associated with each of the Legacy Post Properties. And as a result, we had into peak leasing season well positioned to optimize on pricing performance. ","Our operating teams have also captured some early wins on the expense side equation with renegotiated pricing and new contracts. We have much more left to accomplish and opportunity to harvest, but we\u2019re certainly encouraged with early trends and the longer term opportunities to be captured in our merger with Post. Our unit interior redevelopment program had a record first quarter performance with over 1,500 units redeveloped significant rent bumps and attractive long-term prospects that Tom will outline in his comments. ","During the first quarter, substantial work was completed in initially scoping out this effort at a number of the legacy Post Properties and, as Tom will outline, the early indications are very promising. We expect to see this activity ramp up quite a bit at the legacy Post locations over the course of this year and throughout 2018.","Al will walk you through our update of FFO guidance, but we\u2019re encouraged with the start to the year. And while we did make some offsetting adjustments to same store revenue and expense performance assumptions, we continue to be comfortable with our initial guidance for same-store NOI or said another way, we are reaffirming our original same store NOI guidance of 3% to 3.5% growth over the prior year. ","With continued steady employment trends coupled with MAA\u2019s diversified and balanced portfolio approach, and with the upside we expect the capture from enhanced operating efficiencies and margin improvement especially within the legacy Post portfolio, we are optimistic about our ability to drive NOI results as outlined in our guidance for the balance of the year. Good progress continues with our lease-up and new development pipelines and we look forward to getting those properties fully earnings productive over the next several quarters.","As noted in our earnings release, we did make one acquisition during the quarter. It\u2019s an opportunity very much in line with the investments that we\u2019ve captured over the past couple of years, which was a newly developed property in its initial lease-up that had fallen out of contract earlier. The transaction market and pricing continues to be competitive as we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years and we will continue to be patient and disciplined in navigating through the pipeline of opportunities being presented.","We are off to a great start for the year, and I appreciate the great results are being generated by our MAA associates as we deliver today, while also building for tomorrow. ","That\u2019s all I have in my prepared comments. I will now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Grimes","Thanks, Eric, and good morning to everyone. Our first quarter same store NOI performance of 3.6 was driven by revenue growth of 2.8% over the prior year and strong expense control. The top line was driven by rent growth as all in place effective rents increased 2.9% from the prior year. All leases signed during the quarter were up of 1.3%. But we\u2019ve seen some persistent weakness through the first quarter on new lease pricing. So let\u2019s just jump into that area first.","For the same store portfolio, new lease rates on a lease-over-lease basis were down 3.2% for the quarter. As expected, the submarkets incurring higher levels of supply bore the brunt of the pressure on capturing new residents during the slower winter months. We expect new lease pricing will remain challenged in a number of locations over the first -- over the next few quarters, as the new supply pipeline fully delivers. But we expect to see some improvement, as we move into the more favorable leasing season.","Encouragingly, leasing velocity has picked up and new lease pricing has improved by 190 basis points from April month-to-date as compared to the first quarter. In addition, as Eric touched on, we\u2019ve completed most of the foundational work associated with repopulating our revenue management system with updated data from the legacy Post locations and with improved occupancy and exposure positioning. We are where we should be heading into the summer. ","Renewals for the combined portfolio were still strong for the quarter at 6.1%. Renewal signed for MAA remained robust at 6.6%. Post renewal rates responded well under the MAA pricing approach. In January, they were up 4%; in February, 4.7%; March they increased to 5.4%; and so far in April, they\u2019re coming in at 5.7%. For perspective, renewals sign on the Post assets for April last year were up 4.8%. ","As a result, blended rents have improved 120 basis points from 1.3% in the first quarter to 2.5% April month-to-date. Occupancy exposure trends are strong across the board. April month-to-date average daily physical occupancy of 96% matches our very strong April of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for 60-day period is just 7.9%, which is better than last year. The strength in this area gives us a solid foundation as we had into the busier season. ","On the market front, revenues in Phoenix, Raleigh, National and Jacksonville stood out from the group. In addition, it\u2019s worth noting the effective rent growth coming from markets like Charleston, Richmond and Memphis were all above 4%. In both portfolios, Houston remains our only market level worry bead and represents just 3.5% of our NOI. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. Currently, our combined Houston markets daily occupancy is 96.2% and 60-day exposure is just 7.6%. Expense performance was solid led by few early wins in the Post portfolio. ","As a result of the improved scale, our national account pricing improved in both portfolios, but it was more impactful in the Post results. In addition, the renegotiation of end market contract services such as interior paint vendor improved cleaning and services aided the Post results. The increased sale also improved the pricing of our casualty insurance. Driven by this expense performance, the NOI margin on the Post portfolio increased 130 basis points from the quarter, from the first quarter of last year.","Rental demand remains steady and our current residents continue to choose to stay with us. Move-outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 2.2% over the prior year and turnover dropped again to a low 15.5% on a rolling 12-month basis. Move-outs to home buying and move-outs to home renting remain consistent at 20% and 6% of move-outs. As you know, much of the Post product is in interloop areas that are seeing the most supply. While this puts pressure on the newer product and creates opportunity on the well located older product. There are 13,000 Post units that are in very good interloop locations that have compelling redevelopment opportunities. We can make these great locations more competitive by updating the product. ","We have room to, we will have room to raise rents and still be well below the rates of the new product coming online. The early response to the Post redevelopment is impressive. At this point in our redevelopment, units are pre-leasing based only on the description of the units provided by our onsite teams or mostly on the description based by our onsite teams. Through April month-to-date, we have completed 80 units, but we\u2019ve already leased 152 units on the Post communities. Given the quality of the locations, the redevelopment opportunities more significant. On average, we\u2019re spending $8,600 and getting a rent increase that is 10% more on comparable and non-redeveloped units. ","As Eric mentioned, we\u2019re just getting started. We originally plan on doing 1,700 units in the Post portfolio. However, if the response to the product remains strong through our busier season, we all have the opportunity to exceed this amount. ","For the full MAA portfolio during the quarter, we completed over 1,500 interior unit upgrades on legacy MAA. Our redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remains robust and on a combined basis, our total redevelopment pipeline is in the neighborhood of 30,000 units.","As you can tell from the release, our active lease-up communities are performing well. We moved the stabilization date for innovation, 1201 Midtown in Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes Phase II up a quarter and moved Post Parkside at Wade back a quarter. These timing differences are minimal and do not have an impact on our return assumptions. ","Our new acquisition community in Nashville is on track and residents in Fountainhead in Phoenix and Innovation in Greenville will stabilize on schedule in the second quarter. We\u2019re pleased with our progress thus far in the Post merger and remain confident in the opportunities ahead to create value by continuing to reconcile practices between these two companies. Al?","Al Campbell","Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll provide some additional commentary on company\u2019s first quarter earnings performance, the balance sheet activity and then finally on guidance for the remainder of 2017.","Net income available for common shareholders were $0.36 per diluted common share for the quarter. FFO for the quarter was $1.46 per share, which was $0.08 per share about the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. We were encouraged by the solid first quarter performance but the results included some noise related to the nature and timing of several items, which should be considered in the revised expectations for remainder in the year. ","I\u2019ll provide a little more color in a moment. But in summary, $0.03 per share is related to favorable operating performance for the quarter, same store, non-same store combined. An additional $0.03 per share is related to lower-than-expected integration and the interest cost combined for the quarter. And, finally, the quarter included $0.02 per share of non-cash income related to a required mark-to-market adjustments of an embedded derivatives.","About two thirds of the favorable operating performance of $0.02 per share was related to the combined adjusted same store portfolio, primarily due to operating expense performance. With the remaining penny per share related to the non-same store portfolio as lease-up development and commercial properties outperformed a little bit better than expected for the quarter.","As mentioned, integration and interest cost together produced another $0.03 per share of favorability for the quarter, a portion of which is timing related. We remain confident in our full year projection ranges for each of these items. ","And then, finally, the first quarter results include the $0.02 per share of non-cash income from the embedded derivative related to the preferred shares acquired in the Post merger. In short, accounting rules required that we bifurcate and assumed embedded derivative related to the call options on the shares. The derivative must be recorded as an asset and mark-to-market each period through earnings. While also trading during the first quarter produced a sizable non-cash adjustment, which compares no real economic benefit and will potentially reverse at some point over the remainder of the year. And I will outline our revised guidance for the remainder of the year in just a moment.","During the first quarter, we acquired a new developed committee located in Nashville for $62.5 million, which was in lease-up when acquired and about 77% occupied at quarter end. We also funded an additional $62.5 million of development cost during the quarter. We completed the construction of two development committee slightly ahead of schedule during the quarter, leading seven communities in our current development pipeline with an expected total cost of just over $505 million, of which all but the $129 million is already have been fund. ","During the quarter, Moody\u2019s Investors Services upgraded our investment-grade rating to Baa1 and stable, which reflects the strength of our balance sheet and brings all of our ratings, Moody\u2019s, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch to the third level investment grade. We expect to use these ratings this year as we plan to access the bond markets refinance maturities and to pay down our credit line.","At quarter end, our leverage to bond and debt-to-total assets for our public bond covenants was 31.4% and encumbered assets were over 80% of gross assets. We also had over $460 million of combined cash and capacity under our credit facility to provide protection and support for our business plans. ","And finally, we revised our earnings guidance for the full year to reflect the first quarter performance and update expectations for the remainder of the year. We\u2019re updating guidance for net income per diluted common share which is reconcile to updated FFO and AFFO guidance in the supplement. Net income per diluted common share is now projected to be 254, 274 for the full year 2017, reflected update expectation of gains on planned disposition properties. FFO is now projected to be 574 to 594 per share or 584 at the midpoint, which includes $0.15 per share of merger and integration cost for the full year. AFFO is projected to be 515 to 534 per share or 525 at the midpoint. ","We are maintaining our overall expectation for combined adjusted same store NOI growth for the year in the 3% to 3.5% range. We now expect this to be produced by revenue growth in the 3.2% range and expense growth in the 2.5% to 3.5% range. In summary, we are increasing our FFO guidance for the full year by $0.02 per share. This is produced by the strong Q1 performance at 8%, $0.08 per share performance above our guidance as mentioned earlier. Combined with revised expectations for several items which offset $0.06 of this favorable performance remainder of the year. ","First we expect volatility from the derivative accounting to reverse the $0.02 of non-cash income of the remainder year. Also we now expect our acquisitions to be a little later in the year and to provide more lease-up opportunities, which cost an additional $0.02 per share and initial 2017 but we expect to be more accretive and value productive over the longer term.","In addition, revised guidance for real estate taxes, now expected to grow 5.5% to 6.5% renew per share over the remainder of the year. And, finally, though our integration cost per penny per share favorable in Q1, we expect our total integration costs for the year to be in line with our original estimates ship in the penny per share to the remainder of the year. Our guidance for acquisition and disposition volumes, development investments and total merger and integration costs for the full year remains unchanged. We also remain on track to capture full 20 million of overhead synergies on a run rate by year-end. And we expect to continue capturing additional NOI opportunities included in our forecast, primarily in the latter part of this year as operating practices and platforms become [indiscernible].","So that\u2019s all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Jessica, we\u2019ll now turn the call back to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please go ahead. ","Nick Joseph","Thanks. Wonder if you could provide what same-store revenue for the first quarter was with the MAA legacy portfolio and the Post legacy portfolio?","Tom Grimes","Sure Nick. This is Tom. In the, so for revenue expense NOI and ARU for those revenue, revenue was 1.3 for Post and MAA was 3.3. ","Nick Joseph","Thanks. And then just in terms of reduction of same-store revenue growth. What drove that lower? Was that specific markets? Was it the Post legacy portfolio was it more broad-based, if you could just provide a little more color there?","Al Campbell","Nick, this is Al. That was really primarily related to new lease pricing as Tom mentioned in his comments. What we\u2019ve seen in the early part of the year was new lease pricing and seasonally as it is negative beginning the year and begin in the 3% down range. But the other side of that is renewals were very strong. They were 6% over. And so what we had our forecast with expectation as we move in the March, move into the digital leasing season, the new lease price will begin to improve in the state; down the 3% range lower than we expected. Good news is as move into April, as Tom mentioned, we are seeing significant change and it did, and we did see the trends about to more than what we thought.","Eric Bolton","Nick, this is Eric. I\u2019ll also add that, I mean the other thing, if you look at just the Post portfolio and the performance on new lease pricing in Q1, I would really characterize the performance by two things that went on. One is obviously that -- those are the submarkets where supply pressures are the greatest, and that was clearly evident. ","But, secondly, we also made a conscious decision in Q1 to focus our efforts on the Post portfolio towards stabilizing certain variables and positioning that portfolio for a more robust level of performance in the more important summer leasing season. So namely what we did as we focused on pulling exposure down, improving occupancy and, importantly, repopulating our LRO revenue management system with all the correct and updated data that was frankly lacking and so we\u2019ve got all that accomplished in the first quarter. And as a consequence of that, we think that, that portfolio is a much stronger position as we head into, frankly, the more busier important season of the summer. The challenge you have is that when you do re-price some leases in that first quarter, I mean you kind of carry them over the quarters two and three. And so as we -- but we thought that was the right trade-off to make, and we certainly think that the benefits are going to begin really show up latter -- in later this year despite clearly there being more supply pressure in those markets, the submarkets. We think that there is real opportunity as the year plays out.","Nick Joseph ","Thanks. And just finally in terms of the new same-store revenue range, first quarter is obviously at the low end of that. So there is assumed acceleration throughout the year. Can you walk through the assumptions that are underlying that new range in terms of occupancy and doing under a lease rate growth? How you would expect same-store revenue to trend on a quarterly basis throughout the year?","Al Campbell ","Nick, this is Al. The basis of for that is really, we expect the legacy MAA portfolio to be strong in that initial 3% to 3.5% pricing range and to be for a stable through the year in revenue performance. But what you have as you had -- the Post portfolio came on board at lower point and we expect that to increase over the year, as we capture those opportunities for improvement that Eric mentioned and so that will continue and probably intensify in the third and fourth quarter. And so on our total performance for the adjusted combined portfolio, you will see continued slight improvement through the year primarily in third and fourth quarter making up that 2.8% to 3.2% range for the year. Than the net result is just not to be lost and as we tweaked the midpoint by 25 basis points, and we think that it\u2019s a fairly modest adjustment, but we think it was a right long-term decision to make.","Operator","And we will go next to Drew Babin with Baird & Company. Please go ahead.","Drew Babin","On some of the more CBD focused REIT for earning calls. So far this quarter and there has been some talk about elevated supply levels kind of looking at the national data. Looking a bit worse kind of into the end of \u201817 and into \u201818 and so just missing some of that data is being more kind of Sunbelt oriented and getting more suburban. And I guess, my question is are you seeing that and as you compete with new supply, is it mostly the product that just now having these Post assets that is generally more urban or are you starting to see more supply in kind of the MAA legacy suburban markets.","Al Campbell","There are two points on that one is we are seeing permitting trends in our markets across the portfolio -- combined portfolio, permitting is down 10% so far this year as compared to last year. When we look at deliveries forecast, based on the information we have for \u201818 versus \u201817, they are down.","So we think that there is growing evidence based on permitting trends and forecast for deliveries, coupled with all the other information that we get from developers we talk to regarding construction costs and financing challenges so on and so forth, to believe that \u201818 is certainly not likely to be worse than \u201817 from a supply perspective. So, yes, I offer that first. ","Secondly, I mean clearly right now it\u2019s the higher price point more urban-oriented locations where the supply is more evident. And we don\u2019t see anything sort of indicating that there is a shift a foot to all certain developers redirecting their efforts on suburban locations and abandoning their urban locations. There is no evidence to support that and we certainly aren\u2019t seeing it based on our markets and what we monitor. ","So we think that \u201818 is shaping up to be based, it\u2019s early and these things can change, of course. But based on everything, we have to work with right now, there is a lot of evidence that \u201818 deliveries or will be lower than \u201817 deliveries. And assuming the economy continues to show progress, when you look at the ratio of jobs to deliveries, \u201818 is projected to be slightly better than \u201817. ","Drew Babin","That\u2019s very helpful. And then on the acquisition side, it sounds like things are a little slow to come along and it\u2019s the general trend is pricing obviously pretty broadly. Do you anticipate any catalyst or trigger we should look to, maybe if not this year, probably more the next year again what you see more merchant builders looking to sell properties become value add opportunities for you? What is your view the catalyst for more of that become to market and could potentially be portfolio of assets like that?","Al Campbell","Well, I think that, I would read too much into Q1, but just because it tends to be a slower transaction quarter anyway. We tend to do much more, get busier and get more opportunity or deals that going to contract, the first part of the year fallout and we tend to be more successful in the back half of the year. Having said that, catalyst, I think it\u2019s going to be, just as we get later in the cycle, later this year, maybe event to the next year, some of these lease-ups that are underway or perhaps there is more of them out there now than there has been historically. ","We think that creates some level of pressure. It certainly creates pressure on some of these lease-up in terms of pricing that we\u2019re hoping to get lease-up that we\u2019re hoping to achieve. And if you throw a little prospect of rising interest rates on top of that, collectively that may start to create the catalyst that creates more compelling buy opportunities. Having said that, we certainly see, as I mentioned in my opening comments. We certainly see or lot of investor interest that still pretty strong out there for multi-family. ","So we haven\u2019t really seen as a cap rates that move a little bit. I would suggest that maybe the number of people at the table putting bids and maybe down slightly from what we saw a year or two ago. But the people that are there are still pretty aggressive overall. And so, we\u2019re staying patient. But I think this is we get later this year into next year, there may be little bit more opportunity that makes sense for us.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Mike Lewis with Suntrust. Please go ahead. ","Mike Lewis","On the same-store revenue, I understand there is the supply pressure in the Post portfolio where little more than you expected. April is coming back. But you can make up all that, so you want to head and lower the guidance a little bit. But productivity confidence after 2.8% same-store revenue growth in 1Q, that you could do 2.8% to 3.2% for the full year when it seems like we\u2019re in this several quarters in a row of kind of decelerating growth. Is it -- maybe it\u2019s some easier comps in the Post portfolio, maybe it\u2019s supply tailing off, just kind of what gave you comfort there?","Al Campbell","Well, first of all, we weren\u2019t surprised by anything in the first quarter. We elected to make a conscious decision to, as we got into the Post portfolio, and remember when we closed on it in early December, but as we got into it, what we believe that the thing to do was to really position the portfolio for stronger performance in the busier summer leasing season. Having said that, what gives us confidence that we will see some pickup is frankly, we\u2019re heading into the busier summer leasing season where leasing velocity and demand tends to really pick-up. And we think that, that coupled with candidly, what we do see are some comparisons in the Post performance from last year, and the way that we executive with LRO, supply pressures notwithstanding, we think that getting to that midpoint of the range the we revised 2% or 3% is something that we feel pretty confident. And having said that, as Tom mentioned, I mean in his comments, I mean the progress that we\u2019ve seen on renewal pricing in the Post portfolio is pretty impressive. And recognizing that we\u2019re renewing a bigger component of our portfolio than we ever have, that\u2019s helpful.","And so I think that there is a lot of trends that -- one other thing as I think it\u2019s important that not to get lost in all this, because when you look at the Post portfolio, not could be lost in sort of the opportunity that we\u2019re underwriting here, is recognizing with that portfolio prior to the close of our merger was carrying an average rent level that was 44% higher than legacy MAA, 44% higher rent. But yes, we were capturing a 100 basis points higher NOI margin. We think that spells opportunity.","Mike Lewis","Thanks. My second question. Some of that I guess as a whole of the smaller markets are lagging a little bit, some particularly. Is there a trend going on there? Maybe jobs moving to larger markets more? Are you starting to see some supply pressures in some of the smaller markets?","Eric Bolton","No, if you look at the key driver of sort of performance in that, the secondary markets, 2.9% effective rent growth, the large markets 2.9% effective job growth. If you look on the NOI side, you do see a trade-off that\u2019s primarily expense driven and it relates to a prior year comparison when we received their credit last year that didn\u2019t reoccur this year. So we\u2019re pleased with where the revenue trends are in those areas, and believe places like Charleston just keep drawing jobs, building airplanes, building trucks, and building more of those, and it\u2019s encouraging to see these secondary markets performance closing the gap.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Tom Lesnick from with Capital One. Please go ahead.","Tom Lesnick","I guess first, looking at Houston, the same-store year-over-year comps stood out once again this quarter. Just wondering how we should think about that same-store performance through the year. And then the second question on Houston. Historically, that\u2019s been one of the larger markets with respect to moving out to purchase a home for you guys. Just wondering how that metric is trending for that market right now?","Al Campbell","Sure. When you think about Houston, we want you to think about it is 3.5% of our net operating income first. And then what I would say is, with the Post merger, we picked up more or exposure really in the same-store group for the first time in interloop and had some significant stabilizing to do there and the trends are improving their both in terms of occupancy exposure and asking rents. But we don\u2019t see Houston coming out of the woods this year. On home buying, it\u2019s been in line with our other groups. It\u2019s not booming on home buying and it\u2019s not well under, it\u2019s running about 20%.","Tom Lesnick","Got it. And is there any bifurcation in performance between more infill properties in Houston as opposed to the ones outside the loops?","Al Campbell","Yes. Both have pressure, but interloop pressure is larger.","Tom Lesnick","That\u2019s helpful. And then final one from me. Turning to redevelopment for a second, I appreciate the detail you gave every quarter with respect to the increase in rent from the redevelopment units. How is that trending on the Post units relative to the MAA units historically?","Al Campbell","It\u2019s about a 10% bump versus, let\u2019s say 9%. But it\u2019s larger dollar figures on the whole risk spending. The Post locations are just spectacular. I mean we\u2019re little gave you about it. And with that we\u2019ve got people building high-rises next door to us that gives us the freedom to go in and put in brand in most of them and do a little bit more robust and like an $8,000 innovate, we\u2019re getting $150 improvement versus probably an $80 redevelopment and $90 improvement. So significant.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. ","Rich Anderson","So if I can just double down that last question. If you\u2019re spending more money on the Post redevelopments and getting a 10% return and you\u2019re getting 9% on a lesser amount of money in the MAA, why is the Post opportunity a better option? ","Eric Bolton","Well, we\u2019re not saying it\u2019s a better option? What we\u2019re saying is that the submarket and in the competition set that we\u2019re competing with supports an ability to invest. And frankly, in those locations, we have to spend a little bit more on the improvement, but we\u2019re getting commentary at higher level of rent bump as a consequence of the higher investment that we\u2019re making and ultimately the IRR, if you will, is very comparable to what we\u2019re see between both\u2026","Al Campbell","Sorry. Its larger in terms of, the numbers are larger and the opportunity as a percent of the portfolio is larger.","Tom Grimes","Well said, we are excited that we able to put out more capital at very strong returns in general. That helps our value production.","Rich Anderson","I get that. Anything you can get a 10% return on is good business. But what is the average, if it\u2019s 8,600 for unit on Post, what is it -- what gets you 9% on an MAA, what\u2019s that number?","Eric Bolton","Closer to 4,400.","Rich Anderson","Okay, all right. Got it. So next question, if I could be maybe a little whack, cynical here. The expense outperformance in the first quarter or maybe this is just me talking, offered the opportunity for you to introduce a new revenue range that, let\u2019s say, is easier to be, this year. I mean is that just too diabolical of a way of thinking about this?","Al Campbell","I\u2019ll just -- what we as Eric mentioned earlier, what we\u2019re trying to do with that is because we saw those new lease pricing trends go a little further into Q1 at the range they were than we expected, that have some impact in the future as our leases re-price, so we\u2019re just dialing at in Richard we\u2019re going to do that. That we were very excited to see as we got in the expense side contract opportunity that were glad than we saw, so we were very glad to see the offset, but really they are unrelated.","Eric Bolton","You give us more diabolical credit than we deserve.","Rich Anderson","And then last question, maybe for Eric. You offering the call from the story from MAA has been this full cycle story, when you look at the sign curve of your full cycle and kind of that is less downside comparable upside. You know that story. Does the introduction of Dallas and Atlanta kind of disrupt this so-called full cycle opportunity. You would think it would. Those are bold bracket type markets. So you\u2019re giving up some of that in exchange for this, sort of, synergy story?","Eric Bolton","I don\u2019t think so, Rich. We think that ultimately what drives our full-cycle performance profile, if first is really the focus on the region that we\u2019re in, that I would argue offers some of the best job growth dynamics and ultimately demand dynamics for our product over the full-cycle. I think that the best way to manage through a down cycle is to really be well diversified and to have a very strong operating platform, and we think that with the combination of Post into our portfolio that in a lot of ways we further diversified who we are, while we certainly are in a lot of the same markets, we\u2019re in different submarkets I -- and I would certainly argue that with adding Post 20,000 plus units to our existing 80,000 units, I would say it probably definitely adds more performance upside in a strong part of the cycle, early part of the cycle. I don\u2019t -- it\u2019s hard to argue just at a very high level that it may not weaken a little bit, the downside part. But we don\u2019t -- protection if you will, but we don\u2019t think so. So we\u2019ve got as a consequence of still retaining a strong level of diversification in both inner loop and suburban and also being very well balanced now between, sort of, A and B price product and candidly having an operating platform that just keeps getting stronger and stronger and the balance sheet that keeps getting stronger and stronger, we think that the protection, if you will, during the down part of the cycle is the stronger and since it has ever been. And arguably, I would suggest that we may have improved our up-cycle or our product cycle performance profile a little.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","John Kim","Thank you. It\u2019s only been a couple of quarters since integration, but looking at NOI margins it actually declined sequentially during the first quarter. So I\u2019m wondering what gives you the comfort that you could improve it this year and is that really stated goal for 2017?","Eric Bolton","Well, it is the stated goal, but first of all, it\u2019s not two quarters, it is four months. Second of all, we think that the margin enhancement opportunity, as I said a moment ago, just if you step back and just remember that this Post portfolio is a portfolio that was carrying 44% higher average rent but yet MAA was getting 100 basis points higher NOI margin. There\u2019s just a lot of opportunity, a lot of different places. And what, and so if you look at December, the month of December and look at first quarter, you have seasonal factors are going on there. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that comparison. It\u2019s more of a seasonal trend. I think as the year plays out and you can start to really get seasonal, take some of the seasonality out of the equation, you start we looking at year-over-year or comparable quarters year-over-year. I think that\u2019s where you will really start to see some evidence of margin enhancement.","John Kim","But you think we\u2019ll be able to see beginning in the second quarter versus fourth quarter based on the leases you signed so far?","Eric Bolton","Well, I mean we saw margin improvements in the Post.","Tom Grimes","130.","Eric Bolton","As you move into the third quarter you will start seeing it more as we, third and four for cash majority of those synergies for the year. So more heavily in those that period, John, I would say.","Tom Grimes","I think important to look year-over-year we improve the margins of total same-store about 60 basis points and for the whole portfolio 130 on the other side of the portfolio.","John Kim","Okay. The gap between new and renewal leases, I know you\u2019re expecting that to condense a little bit. But I\u2019m just wondering if that 800 basis point spread is the widest you\u2019ve seen?","Tom Grimes","It is probably the widest we\u2019ve seen in this cycle, but it is always widest at this time of the year. The gap gets wider and the slower winter months and then it tightens in the summer months.","Operator","And we will go next to Conor Wagner with Green Street. Please go ahead. ","Conor Wagner","Tom, where was overall renewals in April. I know you are in the Post portfolio, but for the combined portfolio, please?","Tom Grimes","Sure. Renewals for the group was, in April was 64.","Conor Wagner","Great. Thank you. And then Eric, if you could tell me what you are thinking about the development platform and possibly adding some land to it. If you guys are exploring those opportunities?","Eric Bolton","Con, we are exploring them. We haven\u2019t really done anything at this point in terms of any commitments. The only thing that I suspect that we will get started this year is an expansion of community that we owned in Charleston that we closed on in December of last year that has a Phase II component to it. But we are, David and his team are pretty active out looking for opportunity at the moment. We haven\u2019t really committed anything at this point. If we defined a very compelling site with an opportunity to get that site productive pretty quickly and it all make sense given where we are in the cycle, we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to pull the trigger on it. But I think that one of the things going forward that will be very sensitive to as development is never going to be a huge part of who we are even if today at just over $500 million pipeline, it\u2019s still constitutes about 3% to 3.5% of enterprise value. We think it will probably -- we would like to keep it in that range. So we\u2019ll never -- we never see it approaching -- I don\u2019t think we will ever see approaching 6%, 7%, 8% of who we are in terms of enterprise value. Secondly, one of the things that we\u2019re going to be very focused on is ensuring that if any land position is taken, that it\u2019s something that we\u2019re confident we can get productive in short order within 12 to 18 months kind of time frame. Banking a bunch of capital in the balance sheet that is -- it\u2019s not, sort of what we do. So that -- those principles sort of guide how we move forward.","Conor Wagner","Okay, thank you. And then maybe as it seems, if you guys has to comment briefly on operating trends you see into the D.C. market?","Tom Grimes","Operating trends on the D.C. market are positive. I think you know Ron and the team there are a stable good bunch. And I think we see steady improvement in that area and are thrilled with the redevelopment opportunity. So I think strengthening is how I would characterize that improving.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Gaurav Mehta","So can you talk about the improvement in new and a lease growth in April versus first quarter. I was wondering if you could comment on in which market do you seeing that improvement?","Tom Grimes","Yes, sure, Gaurav. When we look on a seasonal basis, it\u2019s a really following the trend with the sharpest improvement in those areas where Post and MAA overlap. So with the upswing, it is Atlanta, Dallas, Orlando, Tampa, where we\u2019ve seen sort of the biggest changes.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. And I guess, in your prepared remarks in regards to Post portfolio you also mentioned a focus on loading exposure to certain market. I was wondering if you could comment on what\u2019s the timing on selling assets in of those markets Atlanta and Dallas where you plan to lower exposure?","Eric Bolton","Well, we have targeted in our guidance 125 million, 175 million of dispositions this year. We are about to come to market fairly soon with that group. There is some Dallas, Atlanta in that group. But we\u2019re going to be approaching that in a fairly sort of study fashioned. We will -- we do have a goal over the next two to three years to pull down our exposure in Dallas and Atlanta just to really get the portfolio allocation where we are more comfortable with it. But there is no immediate plan to do anything radical in terms of a major shift. You will see that the steady work down over the next two or three years.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. ","Austin Wurschmidt ","Just wanted to touch. You mentioned that the new lease rates, softening lease rates drove the reduction and same-store revenue. But got the sense that renewals were also a little bit stronger than you expected, and I was wondering if that\u2019s offset any bit of softness in new lease rates at all?","Al Campbell","Renewals were about where we expected them. In Austin I think we expected to be able to make improvement on the Post side and then America side has been solid in that 6% to 6.5% range for some time.","Eric Bolton","What we roughly expect and going forward new lease pricing will improve into positive and the renewals will remain strong.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then could you just a break down how, what you expect renewals to come in for MAA and Post into May and June?","Eric Bolton","Sure. They are, we\u2019ve got Post continues its improvement from May to 59. Mid-America continues above 6. June is a little early to tell, but I want expect those trends to continue.","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay. Thanks for the detail. And then you talked about a lot of the NOI synergies that you expect to capture in 2017 from Post is being in back half weighted. I just wondered if you\u2019re still comfortable with that 4 million to 5 million that you had previously underwritten.","Eric Bolton","We\u2019re absolutely to that and we are comfortable with that. And we were very encouraged to the first quarter that we had a little quicker start on the expenses that we have thought, that\u2019s even add to that curve. But a large part of that still going to be in the back half of the year as we really begin to compound the revenue improvements somebody\u2019s things that Eric and Tom will talk about in the third and fourth quarter.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thanks. And then can you just remind us again of when you expect the transition onto a single revenue management platform?","Al Campbell","We have transitioned the revenue management platform. Work got done in the first quarter or on one system.","Austin Wurschmidt","Is that mentioned or sooner than anticipated, correct?","Eric Bolton","No, again the revenue management component of it is, was went as planned.","Al Campbell","It\u2019s more the back office accounting and then also the property management system that is where the leases are contained separately. Other all system kind of sits on top of that. Its own function and that is combined and working well.","Eric Bolton","And that transition is really just an upgrade in systems that gets early fourth quarter or early first next year.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Robert Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead. Your line is open. ","Robert Stevenson ","Eric, are you talked a couple of times during the call on the upside that you guys expect on the NOI margin from the Post assets. Beyond that, what\u2019s the biggest upside out of Post going forward today, if you start the clock today that you expect to achieve?","Eric Bolton","Well, certainly the combined balance sheet of the two companies has certainly resulted in a much stronger consolidated balance sheet and we, as Al mentioned, will be approaching the bond market later this year as a consequence of putting the two companies together. As you recall, when we closed the merger, S&P upgraded us to the third run of investor grade that day. Moody\u2019s did so recently. And we sliced off a fair amount of interest expense on an annual basis just as a consequence already and we think going forward that will continue to pay some benefits. ","I would tell you that other than the NOI opportunity, the redevelopment opportunity is quite significant and as Tom mentioned in his comments, that is proving to be, just I think that opportunity is going to be bigger, far better than we ever really imagined it would be. So we\u2019re very excited about what we see happening there. And that\u2019s something that will play out frankly over the next three or four years. And beyond that then I would tell you was one of the benefits of putting the Post platform with MAA was frankly just another opportunity to deploy capital in accretive manner through new development. And at this point in the cycle, we\u2019re being pretty careful about any commitments in terms of cranking up anymore new development. But we\u2019ve certainly again believe that, that platform supported by our operating platform and balance sheet is going to be another component of long-term value creation that we\u2019re very attracted to.","Robert Stevenson ","Okay. And when you guys look at supply, not just in an overall market or submarket, but supply and that should directly impact your assets or especially the Post assets given the sort of more urban nature of that. Are there any markets or submarkets where you think that the worst is yet to come from a supply standpoint in terms of lease-up concession, etcetera, that is going to sort of push down rental rate growth within the Post portfolio?","Eric Bolton","Not that you\u2019re not already aware of, Rob. I mean that sort of bucket core door is seeing the expected level of supply come onboard. Same with uptown in Charlotte and inner loop Dallas, let\u2019s say. But, I think largely, we were beginning -- we felt that and we will continue to and then it improves in \u201818.","Al Campbell","The only market I would add that worth monitoring is Dallas. I think that Dallas inner loop area is getting a fair amount. So we will keep an eye on that one. But I would agree. I think all of the others are there is no reason to expect that it is going to deteriorate from where it is today.","Tom Grimes","And then Houston drops in half again and Nashville drops off by 3,000 units. There are some bright spots out there as well.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then Tom, while you were talking earlier about the weakness in new leases in the Post portfolio. Was that concentrated in a couple of assets that we\u2019re facing some supply issues, was that fairly widespread. How would you sort of characterize that? Is that a submarket, market or just a portfolio sort of issue at this point?","Tom Grimes","It was fairly widespread. It was sort of probably weakest in Houston the gap wise and then strongest places like Tampa or D.C.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then last one for Al, I think that I heard you say something about $0.01 impact on property taxes. Was that sort of positive or the negative side and the remainder of \u201817?","Al Campbell","That was to the negative side unfortunately on that and I think but really what that is as we just moved our range to 5.5% to 6.5% with 50 basis points increase and we still feel good about the expectations for tax rates and the valuations. It\u2019s really more related to as we get information get into it. We think we may have little less favorability on appeals that we\u2019re making that will fall into favorable results in \u201817 from \u201816 than we had in 15 to \u201816 and so we feel like overtime into it, as we go forward, tax rates will continue to moderate a little bit, but in \u201817 we have a little bit of noise.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. How we reconcile that and so if property taxes are roughly at third of the expenses load and those are going -- you are revising that upward, but then you\u2019re taking same-store expenses, same-store expense guidance down for the year, what overwhelms the increase in property taxes, where are you seeing the benefits to be able to lower the same-store expense guidance?","Al Campbell","Benefits that we\u2019re seeing in getting earlier on some of the synergy opportunities have been really, really good, Rob. And so we\u2019ve been able to get into contracts with contract labors and our vendors and insurance pricing have been able to get favorability early than we expected, maybe little more than we expected and so that more than offset that pretty increase in real-estate taxes and expenses.","Operator","And we will go next to Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Omotayo Okusanya","Two questions from me. The first one around the reduction in the same-store revenue guidance. The new rental rate that was again trending negative in the first quarter. Again you kind of mentioned that part of the whole process of why you are signing leases at those rates was the kind of setup to go into the spring leasing season. But I guess, I\u2019m trying to understand a little bit, how exactly those benefits you go into the spring leasing season, if you sign the lease and that tenant is going to be in there for at least a year?","Al Campbell","Well, it basically if in the first quarter, let\u2019s just say that over the course of the year, you have 100% of your leases to renew, or to, or 100% of units to reprice. In the first quarter you\u2019re going to reprice, I don\u2019t know, 20% of them, 18% of them. In the second and third quarter, you\u2019re going to reprice 65%, 70% of them. And so we would rather reprice or be in a position, stronger position to reprice when you\u2019re going to be repricing a higher percent of your portfolio over the course of the year. So you can, if you will, sacrifice a little pricing on a smaller portion of the portfolio in order to gain more robust pricing on a bigger percent of the portfolio in the second and third quarter and net-net for the year come out with the better results.","Tom Grimes","I mean, you\u2019ve got there. I mean all of the pricing a lot of them, if you will, is driven by exposure. And what Eric was saying, we improve the exposure on the Post assets by 190 basis points and it\u2019s now 7.2%, going into that season and that pushes the rates up on more people more aggressively.","Omotayo Okusanya","Okay. I think I got to understand that. But I guess the backdrop of rising supply in some of the key markets, how confident are you that, again that upside in pricing that you want in the spring will actually happen as again you have more supply in the market. Isn\u2019t that kind of what\u2019s putting more pressure on the new rental rates?","Eric Bolton","But you also have more leasing velocity that takes place in the summer months as well. If you go demand picks up, but in the summer months versus the winter months.","Al Campbell","And we believe there is a non-market opportunity there. Going back to Eric\u2019s point about the margin, we feel like there is rent gap to close based on the progress that we\u2019re making on a renewal side of Post and where we look at where those units are price in the market that and when you add in redevelopment, that we can grow the Post new lease trends is greater than market opportunity.","Omotayo Okusanya","That\u2019s helpful. And then just also on the same-store OpEx for 1Q. You saw a much bigger decline in your larger markets versus just smaller markets. Does that have anything to do with just the fact that you have more of an overlap of the Post properties in the larger markets and some other synergies we\u2019ll driving that versus the smaller markets?","Al Campbell","Yes, that\u2019s a fair point.","Tom Grimes","That\u2019s correct.","Operator","And we will go next to Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets.","Neil Malkin","Eric, I think in the last call you talked about stricter lending standards making it more difficult not only in general for incremental supply to occur this cycle but because of that, more lending would be focused toward the more certain or more highly thought after urban markets and would actually have even more beneficial impact to your Sunbelt markets with less construction financing happening there. Are you still confident in that? Are you still seeing that? Or are you seeing a willingness of banks to lend for to you for construction financing in your market?","Eric Bolton","Well, all I can really speak to is our Sunbelt markets in the Southeast. What I can tell you is yes. I mean all of the developers that we talked to continue to indicate that financing for construction projects is becoming more difficult to achieve. More equity required, lower loan to values, requiring them to either introduce more equity into the transaction and or bring in some sort of mezzanine financing to bridge their funding needs net-net, putting pressure on returns. And so, I think that evidence is starting to manifest itself, as I mentioned earlier, permits so far this year are down 10% versus where they were last year. And when you look at the current pipeline and deliveries that we know are going to come online as we headed into the next year, known deliveries are down next year from what we\u2019re seeing this year. So I continue to believe that there is a likelihood that we are likely to see the worst of the supply pressure this year. Things can change, as I said earlier. But based on everything that we\u2019ve got visibility on right now, there is nothing that causes us to believe that supply pressures are headed towards in acceleration in 2018.","Neil Malkin","And then can you talk about your pipeline or opportunities that for recently completed or in leased up properties?","Eric Bolton","Well, it\u2019s -- we are looking at a lot of things right now. And we continue to have -- I think more opportunities are being brought online in terms of development and lease-up is underway. And I think just as we get later in the year, the opportunities become more compelling, because we often see in the first, let\u2019s call it six months of the year, that people that plan to sell tend to get out there and market their opportunities broadly to the market. And often we see a lot of deals go under contract in early part of the year that for a host of reasons don\u2019t get close, and then as we get into Q3 and Q4, the opportunities often come back because they fall out of contracts. So we just tend to be much more successful in leveraging our execution capabilities and all cash acquisition capabilities and to sort of the value that were looking for in the back half of the year. And so as supply does sort of come online increasingly over the course of this year and we get into that busy season where, I think a lot of people are counting on a lot of good things happening. Undoubtedly, there is going to be, I think more opportunities that will become available later this year. So we\u2019re going to be patient and see. I mean, we\u2019re given sort of the scale that we have, the balance sheet that we have and the focus that we have on this region. We know the deals and in most cases everybody wants us looking at the deals. And our pipeline is fairly active right now. But we are being patient.","Neil Malkin","Okay, great. And last one from me. Can you talk about the Post properties in terms of how things are going on the ground? I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s probably some turnover from leasing or property managers, maybe to had some impact on the first quarter. How that\u2019s going, how that\u2019s transitioning, do you feel comfortable that you had everything in place, kind of all the potential issues that\u2019s [indiscernible] if any?","Eric Bolton","The answer is yes. So we think that we\u2019ve got everything settled here at this point. These things are hard. I mean they\u2019re just tough. And you\u2019ve got two organizations, very proud. Post around for 40 years and quite a legacy and there is a lot of emotion in all of this. And so you sort of have the challenge to work through initially. Secondly, frankly, we just, at the property level and frankly at the corporate level, we approach the business in philosophically in some ways and in fact procedurally different. And as a consequence of those differences, we have different expectations for different positions. They may be called the same thing in both companies, but our expectations and the accountabilities that we establish in some cases were different. ","And so with those two factors, you have some people that sort of adjust and you have some people that don\u2019t adjust. And frankly you have some people that are in positions that ultimately we conclude they are unlikely to be able to be a good fit for that position given sort of the way we expect the position to perform and so changes are made. So yes, we made again a conscious decision to address all that ASAP and we have made a conscious decision to address all that in the winter slower leasing season. And I would tell you at this point we are set. We feel like, I mean we\u2019ve got a great team of folks in place. We\u2019ve got all of the, sort of the onsite leadership stabilized and we think we\u2019re in a great position as we had into the summer months now.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. ","Q - Dennis McGill","Just going back to new lease growth in the first quarter, the negative 3%. Just back into that the impact on the guidance. Is it about 200 basis points worse than what you would have thought going in the quarter?","Al Campbell","You\u2019re talking about for Q1?","Q - Dennis McGill","Q1, right, the negative 3% on new leases.","Al Campbell","Yes. The expectation was more at the end of the quarter in March. I mean, we expect to be in that range in the early part of the quarter. We expected the new lease pricing to improve and as we move in the March and that was the expectation that was different. ","Q - Dennis McGill","So the 3% negative was fairly consistent through the quarter, is that what you are seeing?","Al Campbell","In April, just to follow-up with your point. In April, as Tom said, we did see about 200, ","190 basis points swing in that. We usually see that in March a little earlier with those points.","Q - Dennis McGill","Yes. ","Al Campbell","The range is correct. We uses in March and we saw in April and we have [indiscernible] to our guidance.","Q - Dennis McGill","Okay. And then as you think about just the impact within the quarter and compare where you ended up versus what you might have thought at the beginning of the quarter, what do you think drove the stepped-up competition. I would assume you have your arms around which products are around you and come into markets. So is there anything in particular you can put your finger on that would have cause either yourself or developers and you get more competitive?","Al Campbell","No, not really. I think that -- I mean again it\u2019s -- I think we were focused on not only the market conditions but the other sort of thing that we alluded to is that -- we had we made a conscious decision to address what we felt like were some weakness in exposure and occupancy levels that we wanted to get addressed and before we head into that busier season, And I think also, as Tom alluded to, we also made a conscious decision to really focus on renewal practices in a very aggressive way in the first quarter and we\u2019ve seen great results as a consequence to that. So I think that what we\u2019re talking about here is a balance as a fairly modest level of adjustment, 25 basis points in terms of a midpoint adjustment on revenue expectations. It really just gives us back to, we just -- I think the supply levels broadly have just put into the slower leasing season of the first quarter combined to just create a little later in the quarter pickup in pricing trends, on new lease pricing than what we typically see. And as Al alluded to, April was a significant jump in improvement and we usually see that earlier in the first quarter and so just a little later as a consequence of supply terms.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questions and I will turn it back over to you, Mr. Argo.","Tim Argo","Thank you.

Thank you for participating in the MAA Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.","At this time, we would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Argo, you may begin.","Timothy Argo","Thank you, Erika. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO.","Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday's press release and our 1934 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results.","These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.","When we reach the question-and-answer portion of the call, I would ask for everyone to please limit their questions to no more than two in order to give everyone ample opportunity to participate. Should you have additional questions, please re-renter the queue or you're certainly welcome to follow-up with us after we conclude the call.","Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Tim, and we appreciate everyone joining us this morning. MAA posted strong second quarter results with same store NOI increasing 7.5% over the prior year, generating core FFO per share of a $1.36 which is a record performance for the company.","I\u2019ll tribute the strong results to three factors. First, the demand for apartment housing is strong across our high growth region. The steady improvement and employment conditions coupled with the surge and new renter household formations are more than offsetting to higher levels of new supply. We feel that our approach is diversifying capital across a number of markets in the high growth Sunbelt region coupled with also diversifying the portfolio across suburban inner loop and a growing number of more urban locations provides a more balanced platform that is better positioned for deflecting new supply pressure.","This is worth noting that the 5.3% revenue growth captured this quarter from our secondary market segment of the portfolio, is the strongest performance we\u2019ve seen since of third quarter of 2011 and we\u2019re encouraged with the trends that we\u2019re seeing.","Secondly, our strong Q2 performance reflects various opportunities and synergies harvested from our merger with Colonial Properties. The 60 basis point improvement in same store NOI margin reflects improvements in revenue management practices and unit turn efficiencies within the legacy Colonial portfolio as well as a number of opportunities driven by the largest scale of the company.","As we\u2019ve noted for the last couple of quarters, now that we\u2019ve completed a full year harvesting merger related operating benefits and while there are still some additional opportunities left to squeeze, there will be some year-over-year moderation for merger lift taking place over the back half of this year. However, it\u2019s important to note as outlined in our earnings guidance, we certainly expect to sustain the merger benefits that had been captured to date and retained a momentum in both improved occupancy levels and pricing trends that have been achieved.","And thirdly, our strong Q2 results and positive momentum reflect the growing benefits of these significant capital recycling that we\u2019ve accomplished over the past few years. It is worth noting that MAA\u2019s same store NOI margin after routine capital spending has improved 570 basis points over the past five years.","As we steadily recycle capital from some of our older investments and to newer and higher cash flow margin properties, which has also resulted in recycling capital into markets providing better long-term growth prospects and opportunity for enhanced operating efficiency. We\u2019ve made a meaningful improvement in the cash flow growth prospects of our same store portfolio.","So balance, it was a good quarter. But more importantly the trends that drove the great results are variables that we expect to hold on to and further improve. On the transaction front, our activities so far this year clearly reflects the environment that favors harvesting value from non-core investments while requiring a lot of patience and discipline on the capital redeployment side of the equation. The pricing achieved on our planned asset sales for the year exceeded our expectations and resulted in strong investment returns for shareholder capital.","During the second quarter we initiated two new development projects in Orlando and in Charleston which are highly accretive expansions of existing communities. We closed our two new acquisitions located in Scottsdale and Richmond. The transaction market continues to be very active and we\u2019re underwriting quite a few deals. However, our client properties on a basis that meet our investment hurdles remains a challenge. We continue to see some pretty aggressive pricing paid on both stabilized and pre-stabilized properties with new development opportunities also reclaim increasingly optimistic or aggressive assumptions.","Accordingly, as noted in our updated guidance, we\u2019ve lowered our anticipated acquisition fine for this year. I continue to believe that we\u2019ll see some increasing opportunities for redeploying capital on an attractive basis as we\u2019ve moved later into the cycle. Meanwhile, we will continue to stick to our disciplines and actively work to market looking for the unique opportunities that set our parameters.","In summary, we like where the portfolios now positioned and believe that we are well balanced to take advantage of the favorable leasing conditions across our high growth region. The operating platform is strong, more efficient and are propping to asset management team is performing at a high level. Our redevelopment program continues to deliver strong value growth, and a pipeline with new development and leased up properties will generate attractive new growth in 2016.","The balance sheets in a strong position and we\u2019re excited about what I believe will be increasing opportunities to capture new growth as we work into 2016.","That\u2019s all I have in the way of comments, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom for update on operating as well.","Thomas Grimes","Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. Our record results were driven by an increase in revenue per occupied unit of 5.3% up to a $1,100 and a 100 basis point increase in average physical occupancy. July trends continue to be steady. Our 60-day exposure which is current vacant, plus all notices for a 60-day period is just 7.1%, down a 130 basis points from the same time last year. July blended rents on a lease-over-lease basis from 5.6% or 20 basis points better than the same time last year.","The great results for the quarter did pressure our personnel expenses is more of our property teams are on track to meet their performance based compensation targets. Personnel costs less [indiscernible] were up just 3.7%. Property taxes also pressured expenses up 7% as municipalities particularly in Texas were aggressive in their valuations.","The benefits of our strong operating platform on the legacy Colonial communities continues to pay dividends. The more robust approach of our revenue management practices has allowed the Colonial communities to capture rent growth of more than a 180 basis points above their market peers. Our long-term focus on average [indiscernible] to this group plus the portfolio average down 20% for the quarter and to 22.8 days for the month of June.","On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results. In this group 11 of our 13 markets had at least 6% revenue growth. Large market leaders included Atlanta, Orlando, Austin and Raleigh. The secondary markets which have lower supply pressure achieved 5.3% revenue growth. In these markets we also benefited from improved job growth, the Colonial operating improvements as well as the advantage of a robust re-operating platform in markets that don\u2019t see many recap our platform.","Notably secondary market performance included Charleston, Savannah, Granville and Jacksonville.","Turnover for the same store portfolio was again down for the quarter by 2.4%, on a 12 month rolling basis, it\u2019s a low 53.6%. Move outs to home buying were just a 19.5% well below the historic norms and move outs to home rentals were down 14.5% and represent less than 8% of total move outs. Year-to-date we\u2019ve completed 2,400 redevelopment units, 1,400 on the legacy Colonial communities. We\u2019re on pace to renovate 4,000 units again this year and expect the mix to continue to favor the Colonial portfolio.","As a reminder, on average we spent approximately $4,300 per unit and receive a $95 rent increase over a comparable non-renovated unit which generates a year-one cash return of over 20%.","As mentioned on our last call, we mentioned to you that we ranked as the number one REIT and online customer service reputation by J Turner Research. During the second quarter the same organization rated the top 50 operators and multi-family units in United States. We earned a number one rating in that group as well. The focus on the customers not a new idea at MAA, this is a result of our sophisticated customer service approach as well as our long-term cultural focus on creating a home for our residents rather than just a place to live.","We feel the results speak volumes about our team\u2019s ability to create value for our customers which is one of the key drivers of our ability to deliver steady long-term performance for our shareholders.","Al?","Albert Campbell","Okay, thank you Tom, and good morning, everyone. Off about some additional commentary on the company\u2019s second quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and on our rise got us for the full year. FFO for the second quarter was $112.4 million or $1.41 per share, and core FFO which excludes certain non-cash and non-routine items was $118 million or $1.36 per shares, that\u2019s compared to $93.9 million or $1.18 per share for the prior year, which is $0.07 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance and represents a 15% growth over the prior year.","Recurring capital expenditures for the quarter were $21.9 million or $0.28 per share, which produced core AFFO for the second quarter $86.1 million or $1.8 per share compared to quarterly dividend of $0.77 per share which is strong coverage.","As Tom discussed, we were pleased with the strong operating performance for the quarter which produced the majority of the favorability to our forecast as pricing, occupancy levels and fee income are above our quarterly projects. During the second quarter we acquired two new communities for a combined purchase price of $111.3 million, bringing our total acquisition investment for the full year today to approximately $158 million for three new properties.","During the second quarter we also sold 14 of our communities for growth proceeds of $180 million and recorded book gains of about $105 million. Immediately following the end of the quarter with closing [Audio Gap] traditional of our communities. For gross communities of $121 million and expect to record additional book gains approximately $54 million during the third quarter.","These sales complete our full year disposition plans with 21 properties averaging 25 years of age being sold for $354.3 million, representing a 5.8% economic cap rate based on last 12 months NOI with a 4% management fee and actual CapEx. And notably this cap rate is only 30 basis points above the expected stabilize cap rate on the three new properties acquired thus far this year.","We also continue to make progress on our development plans during the quarter. We completed the construction of an expansion of a community located in Nashville and as Eric mentioned, we began construction on two additional expansion opportunities in Charleston and in Orlando. The total construction costs for these four communities currently under development as expected to be about $119 million of which only $64 million remains to funded at quarter end.","We have three communities totaling 799 units currently in lease-up with average occupancy of 76.6% at quarter end and we expect all three of these communities to be stabilized by the first quarter of 2016.","At the end of the second quarter, our balance sheet remain in great shape. Our total debt to market cap was 37%, our fixed coverage ratio was over four times and our net debt to recur EBITDA declined to six times. Over 70% of our assets are encumber and over 92% of fixed or heads against rising interest rates.","We have about 300 main of debt maturing later this year, primarily in the fourth quarter which we currently expect to refinance with unsecured senior nodes. And anticipation with this financing, we have pretty large interest rate on about a $100 million of these maturities using forward interest rate swaps.","We expect proceeds from acquisition \u2013 asset sales, excuse me, with the additional $80 million to $85 million of internal free cash flow produced this year to fully fund our acquisition and development needs. Our current plan do not occurred [indiscernible] this year, at quarter end, we had over $360 million of total cash and credit available under our line of credit supporting our liquidity, and we expect in the year with our leveraged and it\u2019s net debt to gross assets between 41% and 42%, below the 42.6% recorded at the end of 2014.","And finally, due to strong operating performance and capture of the benefits from the Colonial merger of the first half of the year, we are raising our guidance for core FFO and AFFO for the full year. We\u2019re now projecting core FFO for the full year to be $5.25 to $5.41 per share or $5.33 from midpoint, representing a 6.8% growth over the prior year. Core AFFO is now projected to be $4.60 to $4.76 per share or $4.68 at the midpoint representing a 9.3% growth from the prior year. And notably, the expected AFFO growth rate is 250 basis points higher than FFO growth rate and will begin to see the asset recycling and program impact of our capital spending for the year.","Same store NOI is now projected to be a 4.5% to 5.5% for the year, based on revenue growth with 4.5% to 5.5% and expense growth of 4% to 5%.","So that\u2019s all we have in the way for prepared comments. So Eric, we\u2019ll take the call back to you for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to side of Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hey good morning. Just touching on the guidance little bit, with the \u2013 you guys have walked in 5.7% growth year-to-date and where are you standing in terms of versus the full year the 4.5% to 5.5%, you\u2019re tracking ahead of that and I know that comps get more difficult in the back half of the year but with occupancy in the high 96% range and the blended rate growth of 5.6%, I mean is there something that you\u2019re seeing in July or further out that is concerning or that you think that there could be some significant deceleration in the second half of the year?","Albert Campbell","Austin, this is Al, I\u2019ll take the first part of that per share, and the poor thing here is to know what are guidance is, we\u2019re actually not projecting a deceleration in the back half of the year. And what you\u2019ll see as you looked to the numbers are really, we\u2019re projecting strong pricing performance, continued to stabile occupancy at last year\u2019s level which was very high call it 95%, 96% range. And then really just hitting the impact of the tougher comps, from the first half and back half of last year, and so that\u2019s really what\u2019s underscoring the guidance. And then matter of fact, do the math you\u2019ll look at pricing at 4% to 5% - 4.5% for the back half.","Austin Wurschmidt","What do you guys sending out in terms of renewal offers? And where is occupancy as of the end of July?","Thomas Grimes","So, it\u2019s Tom, Austin. The average physical occupancy through July is 96.3% and for August we got 6% except and September 5.2%, October is a little too early to talk about at this point.","Albert Campbell","And I would just add just systematically here, the point is, is that the moment that we\u2019re seeing we expect that to continue. We don\u2019t anticipate any sort of deceleration taking place. The tougher comps is solely the issue here that would suggest or implied some weaker performance if you will over the back half of the year, on a year-over-year basis only. I mean the strong trends that we\u2019re seeing we certainly expect those to continue and as Tom just pointed out, occupancy remains very strong, turnover remains very low and your rent growth is very much in line with what we\u2019ve been seeing, is just that the back half of last year\u2019s win, the lift really began to be harvested out of our merger and so the comps just get little tougher. And that\u2019s all that took play here.","Thomas Grimes","And primarily in occupancy and fee marginal lifts.","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay. And then second question, just vis-a-via your comments about development underwriting becoming a bit more difficult. How comfortable are you guys with ground up development today and is it something that you\u2019re considering beyond the two expansion opportunities that you announced this quarter?","Eric Bolton","We continued to talk to numbers of developers as I think, I mean we\u2019re not really a development company ourselves. So our approach has always been to find arrangements, partnerships if you will where we could work with the developer to bring out a ground an opportunity that we\u2019ve feel like would make sense for us. We\u2019re looking at lot of deals right now but I would just tell you that with most of the deals that we\u2019ve been seeing the lease-up assumptions that we feel comfortable that underwriting to given other supply that we see coming into the market is not creating the kind of returns on cap where that we feel good with right now.","So, it\u2019s tough to make those numbers to work as it is to make deals \u2013 make sense for us right now on the buy side. Typically where we\u2019re finding our best opportunities as represented in the three deals that we\u2019ve done thus far this year are situations where the properties are in some state of lease-up. And it maybe a local developer, regional developer that is anxious to put capital out and get going on another project or there is some sort of financing pressure that\u2019s building. And that\u2019s typically where we\u2019re finding our best buying opportunities right now, best deployment opportunities as deals that are in lease-up.","We\u2019re talking and we\u2019ll continue to look at development deals but we\u2019re being pretty cautious about it right now.","Austin Wurschmidt","So in terms of you starting or commencing a ground up development that\u2019s unlikely, you\u2019re more focused on looking at potential acquisition opportunities that are in lease-up.","Eric Bolton","That\u2019s we\u2019re finding our best opportunity, I would tell you that we may find an opportunity for ground up development later this year. We\u2019re looking at several \u2013 I\u2019m not sure I would say it\u2019s unlikely, but I would say it\u2019s going to be \u2013 there is a challenge to it. The deals we\u2019ve looked at thus far have not comment without force.","Austin Wurschmidt","Great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from the side of Gaurav Mehta from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Gaurav Mehta","Hi, good morning. Eric, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about strong operating trends further improved. Can you elaborate on that, is that \u2013 does that mean that you expect the quarter growth trajectory to continue for the next couple of years or just more color on that?","Eric Bolton","Well, I think that the further improvement comment was really applied to really all three aspects of sort of the factors that I felt like really propelled our performance this quarter. I mean we still see some more lift that we think will squeeze out of our merger with Colonial, particularly in the redevelopment or rehab effort on unit interior renovation, much of our focus now is on the Colonial portfolio, legacy Colonial portfolio for that effort.","We continue to see some opportunity with renters insurance and some other things that fee programs that we\u2019re rolling out. Certainly the market fundamentals broadly continue to suggest that we\u2019re actually going to \u2013 if you look at sort of job growth to supply projections, most markets that we\u2019re looking at look to be stronger next year as compared to this year. And we think that as we continue to harvest the opportunity or the redeployment of capital this year in some of these lease-up deals that we\u2019re going to continue to see a boost in next year\u2019s performance from those deals as well.","So, there is a number of things that all suggest to us that further improvement is likely in the card for us.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay. And my second question is on commercial and land sales, it seems like you guys reduced the guidance for 2015. Can you comment on that?","Eric Bolton","Yeah, we had one retail asset that it was a legacy Colonial property that fell out of contract in the second quarter, and we\u2019ve juts opted to sort of pull back on that deal at this point. And we\u2019ve got some things that we\u2019re working on at the property, so we think stabilize it, enhance value and we may look it bringing that back to market at some point in the future, but we just decided when the deal fell out to just pull back on it and that\u2019s really all that\u2019s happened. There is just one asset is what we\u2019re talking about, so it\u2019s a fairly insignificant part of the balance sheet overall.","Gaurav Mehta","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Eric Bolton","You bet.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the side of Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please go ahead.","Robert Stevenson","Good morning, guys.","Eric Bolton","Hey Rob.","Robert Stevenson","Eric, I mean given the success in pricing on the year-to-date dispositions, what \u2013 and these \u2013 I had conversation with the board about it putting another $100 million, $200 million of the bottom to your assets out for sale and monetizing them today?","Eric Bolton","Yeah Rob, it is, I mean it\u2019s something we talked about a lot. I would tell you, I mean we feel pretty good about where we have the portfolio at this point, I mean it\u2019s important to recognize that over the last five years we\u2019ve sold almost 50 properties of our 13,000 apartments. We have made a massive amount of sort of repositioning of the portfolio over the last five years and of course, this was a big year for us. And with the sales that had been consummated this year we really like where we\u2019ve got the portfolio, so we don\u2019t feel any pressure if you will to accelerate or do anything other than as we move forward now. And we\u2019re perfectly content to \u2013 continue to own and operate the existing portfolio for some time.","Having said that, we\u2019re always going to be looking at opportunities to cycle capital and continue to improve the growth profile, the company or the portfolio. But we\u2019re at a point now where I feel like that sort of matched funding the dispositions with redeployment opportunity is something we\u2019re little bit more sensitive to right now. We don\u2019t feel \u2013 we sort of discounted that worry a little bit over the past couple of years in an effort to just harvest the opportunity to cycle it out at pretty good pricing in this very low interest rate and low cap rate environment.","And so we feel pretty good with what we\u2019ve got right now, we\u2019re going to be a little bit more focused on looking at match funding going funding, of course, it\u2019s tough to put money out right now. So we\u2019re going to, as opportunities and the market comes our way from an acquisition\u2019s perspective that may create an opportunity to recycle little bit more later this year and to next year but we\u2019re pretty set with where we are right now.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And then question for Tom, I mean Houston, I mean people [Audio Gap] worried about falling energy prices and all of the supply that\u2019s coming online in that market and been looking for the cracks and the fall. I mean is it \u2013 when I look at your results I know they\u2019re pretty good, I don\u2019t know with Houston, I mean is it high on the expense side but revenue seems to be doing decently. Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing in that market that\u2019s causing you any concern as you think about the back half of this year and into 2016?","Thomas Grimes","I mean, I agree with what you said there Rob, and sometimes the performance of a market on sort of rent growth especially at 06\/06 is [indiscernible] looking because it\u2019s reflective of the re-pricing that we\u2019ve done over the past year or so. It is something that we\u2019re monitoring, it\u2019s 3% of our portfolio but turnover for the quarter there was down. What I would tell you is, we expect to maintain occupancy levels around 95% but expect rents to soften a bit. New rents are already flat there and renewal acceptances are coming back in the 3.5% range.","So, given the slowdown in jobs and the steady supply there that\u2019s how on our list of worrying markets.","Eric Bolton","I would tell you Rob, I mean I think to suggest that there is not, I mean there is going to be moderation in Houston there is just no question. I think we see it coming and we\u2019re going to continue to watch it but as Tom mentioned, it\u2019s only 3% of our NOI so it\u2019s not a big worry beat for us per se but that\u2019s the market that I think you\u2019ve got to see softness, more softness over the next several quarters.","Robert Stevenson","Okay. And specifically on the expense side there, would that just property taxes when you\u2019re looking at the year-to-date numbers?","Albert Campbell","Right, that\u2019s absolutely right. I mean all those taxes came out aggressive as we kind of alluded to in our press release. Houston unbelievably was one of the most aggressive and the poor thing there is, you fight of all these, Houston we\u2019re not done fighting, it\u2019s some of the other places we\u2019ve completed, we\u2019ve kind of gotten some of the winds and know we\u2019re going to lose. Houston, we still have some to go, it is high right and hopefully we\u2019ll work on that but that\u2019s the point for expenses.","Robert Stevenson","All right, thanks guys.","Eric Bolton","Thank you, Rob.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from the side of Omotayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","George Notter","Yeah hey guys. This is actually George on for Omotayo. Just wondering if you can just comment on the acquisition environmental, so in terms of the buyers that are out there, is there any change in the financing environment for the buyers of some of the properties in the treasury markets?","Eric Bolton","No, I don\u2019t think there is any real change other than potentially just capital willing to take a little lower rate of return. I mean the financing environment is very strong, these are institutional buyers that are involved in acquiring these assets that we\u2019ve sold. Agency financing being used in all cases and then looking at deals that we\u2019ve been chasing in the market place that have gone to someone else. Again, these are all institutional buyers, in many cases again using agency financing.","So I would tell you there has been no real change per se other than just I feel like that there is probably a little bit more aggressive of underwriting taking place today versus a year ago. And I think at some level those probably are returns on capital that are trending lower and people are willing to accept that today versus where they were a year ago.","George Notter","Okay. And then just on development front in what you guys are sort of hearing in your markets, is there assume it can change in development costs and is it harder for people to get labor to do builds?","Eric Bolton","Well, from the developers that we talk to, yes. We hear that land cost and labor cost continue to be a challenge and I think that it is hopefully going to create some level of discipline in terms of the amount of supply that ultimately will be brought to market because the deals are just getting a little bit harder to pencil out. What we\u2019re finding is that the yields and the margins in these deals are starting to go down a little bit, someone willing to be a lot more aggressive on the lease-up assumptions and the pricing assumptions because the cost have gone up.","And so people would just getting increasingly aggressive on lease-up and pricing and with supply coming into number of these markets, depending on the submarket situation some of the underwriting that would be required to make the numbers work, or things that we just didn\u2019t get comfortable with and backed away from most of the deals that we\u2019ve been looking at.","Thomas Grimes","And to support Eric\u2019s comments just a little, in 2015 in our markets we expect 94,700 units to be delivered. In 2016 we expect 95,500 units to be delivered, so where it\u2019s flattening out with that.","George Notter","All right, thanks guys.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, George.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the side of Greg [indiscernible] with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys, how are you doing?","Eric Bolton","Hey, Greg.","Unidentified Analyst","So my first one is, how much of your acquisition volume in the range of the year do you think will be stabilized versus the recently delivered on a stabilized stuff you\u2019re talking about, where you see the best opportunity? And then what are the return hurdles and underwriting assumptions you\u2019ve used when you underrate the un-stabilized comp product?","Eric Bolton","Well, I would tell you overwhelmingly we would expect the acquisitions to be non-stabilized deals, that\u2019s where to find the best opportunity. And I have no reason to believe at this point that, I mean we\u2019re looking at several other deals right now that are all either non-stabilized or just approaching it stabilize. So it\u2019s \u2013 I think that overwhelming is still going to be that. And the assumptions of course vary quite a bit by market, I mean what we underwrote in Scottsdale, Arizona is going to be a lot different than what we assume to Richmond, Virginia but it\u2019s going to vary quite a bit. But in terms of return requirements, I mean we typically are looking for deals that are going to create stabilized yields, NOI yields approaching six, returns on capital, 10 are better is generally what we\u2019re looking at.","And it\u2019s hard to find the deals out there that meet those criteria right now but, what where we\u2019re finding it is again in these non-stabilized deals or in the case of as an example to the properties that we\u2019ve acquired this year in every single case they were under contract previously and they came back to us. And so that\u2019s my comment about requiring a lot of patience right now, that\u2019s where it takes.","Albert Campbell","And just to add in the forecasting, we\u2019ve \u2013 our acquisition assumptions for the rest year pretty low for the backend of the year. So if we\u2019re not able to close those deals of share, really it won\u2019t have a big impact in the forecast, maybe half a penny or so more 2016 will be the fall.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then I mean you guys have talked obviously in your prepared remarks about how strong the momentum is, fundamentals are great. So as the years progressed, have you guys become willing at all the lower the cap rate hurdles or the return profiles you\u2019re looking for to get acquisitions done given that things are fundamentally so strong and looks like the cycle may or less or longer than people\u2019s thought?","Eric Bolton","No, the answer is no.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Eric Bolton","Our cost to capital in our share price is a big part of that obviously, so no, we\u2019re not lowering our return [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","All right, that\u2019s good to hear. And then just one more follow-up, in the event that you can\u2019t get all the acquisitions done you\u2019re hoping to back half of the year would you considering doing a stock buyback instead?","Eric Bolton","It depends on where our share price is. I mean every time we get ready to deploy capital out we have to ask ourselves is this the best use for that money. And if instead of acquiring an existing lease-up or something could be built and looking at that as an investment alternative versus buying our own portfolio, what sort of return expectations do we have out of our existing portfolio. So it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve done share buyback in the past, we know what we understand the concept, we have a program in place and something we look at all the time.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, great. Thanks guys.","Eric Bolton","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to the side of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","John Kim","Thank you. I was going to ask if you can venture an estimate that you could share with us on what you think the value of your portfolio is on a per unit basis. This is all mid context of your acquiring at a 180,000 per unit, developing at a 147,000 per unit, selling at 69,000 per unit but these are all relatively small compared to your overall portfolio?","Eric Bolton","Well, I mean we don\u2019t publish an NAV. I would tell you that at $77, $78 a share I don\u2019t know where we are today right now, but it\u2019s $77, $78 a share that\u2019s based on our math that\u2019s an imply cap rate of around 5.8%, 5.9% economic cap rate. And considering that we just sold 21 properties 25 years of age in treasury markets at an economic cap rate of 5.8%, I mean clearly we think there is some upsides there. And so in terms of the per unit cost that works out to right now at about or around a 110,000, 115,000 units somewhere in that range in terms of the implied price per unit.","John Kim","And what you\u2019re seeing in the market is I would mention higher than that?","Eric Bolton","Oh yeah, absolutely.","John Kim","Okay. Also wanted to ask for just some clarification on the increase in same store expenses for the year. I can understand same store revenue increasing because the rents are going up but the same store expenses seems like a pretty big increase, realizing a part of that is tax driven but what are the other components of that higher?","Albert Campbell","John, this is Al, I\u2019ll give you color on that. Taxes are biggest piece of that for sure as the line of share, I mean you got remember it\u2019s over third of our expenses. And so we\u2019ve talked about that a little bit pressure from Texas and Florida, it was little more than we have thought going into the year, so we raise our guidance there for 100 basis points or real estate taxes. I think the other largest piece is really personnel and that\u2019s really we had a very good performance in the first half of the year, and certainly [indiscernible] paying our folks for the very good performance. But those are two biggest things and without personnel I think \u2013 without the incentive cost to personnel\u2026","Eric Bolton","3.7.","Albert Campbell","3.7, so it\u2019s not a significant pressure for me other than the good news that we\u2019ve had. So those are two primary items.","John Kim","What about repair and maintenance, are you expensing some more given the [indiscernible]?","Eric Bolton","I mean at our NIM we had 1% tick-up and moves-ins and that changed a little bit but our cost per move is still basically the same.","Albert Campbell","The other areas are pretty much a normalized growth rate.","Eric Bolton","2% to 3% on everything else, it\u2019s really real estate taxes, it\u2019s the big issue and incentive compensation but we\u2019re getting that more than paid back on the top line. So from a margin perspective where the pressure is, is taxes.","John Kim","Okay, thank you.","Albert Campbell","Okay, thanks John.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from the side of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Richard Anderson","Thanks, good morning. So, on the guidance, how much of the increase to 2015 was basically just a roll forward of the outperformance in the second quarter and how much if any, did you adjust third and fourth quarter because of the performance \u2013 the outperformance in the second quarter?","Albert Campbell","Well, Rich, this is Al, I\u2019ll just give you the highlights of that. We obviously raised guidance $0.12, $0.07 comes from the second quarter so we added five to the back half of the year from our previous guidance, I think three in the third quarter, two in the fourth quarter. And so there we certainly, some of that was carry forward of that momentum, I mean it\u2019s underwritten as we said, we\u2019ve had strong pricing, that strong pricing will continue, will be 4% to 4.5% through the back half year and occupancy very stable, basically flat, the last year it was very high.","If you remember, if you go back a year we really started capturing strong occupancy in the back half of last year, so our compassions on that will be a little more challenging, we\u2019ll have that marginal lift but those are the drivers of that forecast in that increase.","Richard Anderson","Okay. So, I mean my logic is, if you beat by \u2013 increase by $0.12, $0.07 in the second quarter and you added $0.03 to the third quarter then you should be able to beat by $0.04 when reported three months from now, right?","Albert Campbell","Well I\u2019ll tell you, let me [indiscernible] the overall arching point I think is really one of the take years, we\u2019re certainly not saying the back half is going to decelerate it anyway. But one of the big thing to understand about the performance in the first half of this year, if we really got strong performance on a marginal lift from occupancy and fees from the Colonial portfolio really rung out the synergies there.","So that was a part of the first half performance that really \u2013 we\u2019ll hold that gain, we\u2019ll hold that water level in the tank but we certainly will have a tougher year-over-year comp going forward to think about it in the projections.","Eric Bolton","Rich, I mean we feel good about the back half of the year forecast and the $0.05 that\u2019s implied lift and the improvement in our original forecast. But we still got \u2013 the Q3 is a big quarter, I mean we still got a lot of leasing to do, there is still some more tax bills to come in and we don\u2019t really have good clarity on yet. So, there is still some wildcards out there but we feel good about the forecast we got.","Richard Anderson","Okay. And my second question is, having sold $350 million of assets, is there any kind of sense of obligation I guess to almost have to redeploy that capital. You kind of put yourself in a position where you had to and in the midst of a very competitive market and new supply coming in. And I guess that my question is, has it crossed your mind at all to just lot \u2013 really significantly reduce your acquisition activity, and maybe even consider a special dividend if you had to.","Thomas Grimes","Well, I will say this Rich. The one thing we won\u2019t do is just put money out because we need to put money out. And if every single deal that we take a look at, we\u2019ve edit it pretty thoroughly, we discuss it pretty actively with our board of directors and we\u2019re very disciplined on every dollar we put out. And it very well maybe that we won\u2019t buy anything else this year, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case, and I\u2019m optimistic given the volume of opportunities that we\u2019re looking at that in fact we will do some more acquisitions but it\u2019s hard, no question about it.","Having said that, if we wind up at the end of the year not putting any more capital out and we just wind up strengthening the balance sheet and getting ready for what I believe is going to be some great buying opportunities later this year and into 2016. We\u2019re perfectly content to have that happen. We think we\u2019ll be able to avoid any kind of special dividend requirement this year but we\u2019ve got enough sort of 1031 shield opportunities to cover that this year. But there is certainly no pressure that we are feeling at all to just put the money out because we sold all these assets, and we\u2019ll see what the future holds.","Richard Anderson","So, why you think there\u2019ll be better opportunities in 2016 to acquire versus now?","Thomas Grimes","Because there is got to be more product coming in, more new product coming into the market place, more lease-up stress is the consequence of that. We likely are going to be looking at higher interest rates, we\u2019re going to be looking at developers and capital probably more interest than they\u2019re not. I mean as you know, a lot of these development deals that take place in the Southeast, the ones that we bought this year are all kind of smaller regional, developers, players they don\u2019t build these things with the intent of owning them for very long. And they\u2019re all about getting in and getting out.","And I think getting \u2013 as volume picks up, interest rates pick up I think the getting out becomes a little bit \u2013 people get a little bit more nervous about it. And so I just think that, we\u2019ve been through this \u2013 I\u2019ve been here for 21 years, we\u2019ve been to periods of time where putting money out is hard. And we\u2019ve always stuck to our discipline during those periods, we\u2019ve never put it out and we\u2019ve always then win and it\u2019s always cycle through that we\u2019ve been running to some great buying opportunities, and I feel that that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going to happen here.","Richard Anderson","Got you. Thank you.","Albert Campbell","Thanks, Rich.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from the side of Dan Oppenheim from Zelman & Associates.","Dan Oppenheim","Thanks very much. Just staying on those acquisitions for a second, with both West Creek and Skysong buying those near 80% occupancy and there is still some lease-up to do but now tremendous amount given your comment in terms of potentially more supply coming from lease-up strips next year but also your generally bullish outlook in terms of the demand environment. Would you look to potentially get better stabilized yields and buying assets over the coming time if they were below 80%, maybe if you look at Skysong with the innovation center there, should see pretty strong demand there at Scottsdale, what would you think?","Eric Bolton","Yeah, I think that if you get into opportunities where the project is either just coming out of the ground and leasing has just started, usually our yield opportunities are better, are higher. And so I think that we very well may find situations later this year and next year where the yield opportunities actually going to be better than what we\u2019ve done so far this year. It\u2019s hard to say but I think that there is reason to believe that that\u2019s likely to be the case.","Dan Oppenheim","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our question from the side of [indiscernible] from Green Sheet. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning.","Eric Bolton","Good morning, [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","So you mentioned earlier Eric in your opening comments the desire to be a little bit more inner loop and more urban. Will that \u2013 is that something that you\u2019re going to look for in your acquisitions or it\u2019ll be more acquiring when it comes to market?","Eric Bolton","Well, to a large degree it\u2019s more acquiring what comes to market, it just happens that that\u2019s where a lot of the opportunity is, that\u2019s where as you know, a lot of the development has been going on and I think that\u2019s where some of the greatest stress is likely to be over the next couple of years. And just as a consequence of being opportunistic in our buying we think that we likely will see more opportunities in the inner loop or urban areas.","And we\u2019re \u2013 we would like to see some of that happen and get a little bit more balance in the portfolio. At the end of the day, what we\u2019re really \u2013 as I said in my earlier comments, we\u2019re really all about trying to have a very balance portfolio of investments in an effort to sort of whether all various points of the cycle. And I think that obviously we\u2019ve had a heavier weight towards more suburban locations historically, but if you look at some of the deal \u2013 really over the last three or four years much increasingly much more of a product has been were urban oriented, inner loop oriented. And I think that that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to continue to see more opportunity.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you. And then given the success that you highlighted with the Colonial portfolio and getting the synergies and the revenue management, how do you think about future portfolio opportunities?","Eric Bolton","We would be interested in those opportunities if they make sense for us. I mean we talked to lot of folks and we do look at opportunities from time-to-time and historically lot of things we\u2019ve looked at is not either been product quality or the market mix that would make sense for us but we certainly are \u2013 we\u2019ve learned a lot through this process that we went through the last two and a half years or so and we feel very comfortable and confident executing on another portfolio transaction should the opportunity present itself.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you very much.","Eric Bolton","You bet.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from the side of Drew Babin from Robert W. Baird.","Drew Babin","Good morning, guys. Great quarter.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Drew.","Albert Campbell","Good morning, Drew. Thanks.","Drew Babin","Question on dispositions, considering that you\u2019re selling your non-core, more treasury assets [indiscernible] cap rated, it\u2019s not inconceivable to me that the cap rates on \u2013 not your best assets but maybe a little up the quality spectrum could go perceivably in the low 5s or something like that. With selling slightly better assets the cap rates like that possibly the repurchase stock be anything that you would consider?","Eric Bolton","Well, again I think that we\u2019re at a point right now where we are scratching and clawing and finding what we feel like are some pretty good investment opportunities in the deals, in the expansions and so forth that we\u2019ve talked about that where we\u2019ve put out money this year. And I think that the opportunities for, perhaps even better yields and returns are on the horizon. We\u2019re very comfortable with the portfolio we have today, and so I mean we\u2019re going to continue to look at it Drew, and think about what\u2019s the right sort of plan to continue to improve the quality of the portfolio, but as I say we feel pretty good with what we\u2019ve got right now.","And so, commencing some effort right now to just continue to sell off a bunch of assets in an effort to buy back stock is not \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem justified right now, it doesn\u2019t seem warranted. I think that conditions may change that would cause the math to differ from what it is and we may very well go in a different direction but right now, we\u2019re just going to continue to be patient with putting capital out and see where we get to. And meanwhile continue to harvest the value out of the existing portfolio that we have, and continue to put forth what we believe is likely to be pretty good core effort for growth.","Drew Babin","Portfolio improvement, obviously some of your assets with \u2013 and it\u2019s up for CapEx needs are around the door now. And as you go forward, I mean is there any way you can quantify your maintenance CapEx spend per unit and where that may go next year relative to this year on a percentage basis?","Albert Campbell","I think this year recurring capital is $600 to $650 per unit and I think that obviously reflects some of the assets we sell this year. Likely it\u2019ll maintain around that $600 unit range as we continue to invest what we need in our portfolio. Overtime it is conceived that would come down as we continue to put new rack that\u2026","Eric Bolton","That came down from last year\u2019s same store group change.","Albert Campbell","Yes, that\u2019s a good point, it did come down from last year. And so we would expect that general trends to continue probably slowly as we continue to recycle though, Drew.","Drew Babin","Great, thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from the side of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Please go ahead, sir.","Buck Horne","Hey, thanks. I wanted to go back to the comment about the portfolio mix, the urban loop discussion versus suburban and I was wondering if you could just help us quantify where the portfolio stands today in terms of what you would consider, how much NOI is coming from urban core versus suburban and then ideally what would you like the longer term or ideal mix of that urban versus suburban to look like?","Eric Bolton","Well, today I mean I would put it at close to suburban locations I\u2019ll put probably 60%, 65%, inner loop probably in the 20% range and more traditional urban as a balance. But there is not a specific goal per se, I mean for the \u2013 it really starts with where are the best opportunities to deploy cap and create it\u2019s best return on capital and I just believe that some of the better buying opportunities are going to be in some of the more urban locations over the next couple of years, because that\u2019s where all the supply is largely coming out online.","I think it\u2019s also important to recognize that in a lot of these Southeast markets in particular, some of the more attractive apartment submarkets are in these suburban locations and I can \u2013 I mean that\u2019s where a lot of the employment base presides. You\u2019ve tend to see a lot newer retail, newer entertainment, restaurant venues and high quality product some of the better school systems. And so I think that we like having a very healthy sort of suburban component to our portfolio given the region of the country we do business in, because that\u2019s where people want to live and that\u2019s where some of the best apartments, submarkets exists.","So, I think that on overtime just as a consequence of looking for the better investment opportunities I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see our suburban mix going a little down to close to 50%, and the inner loop and the urban sort of split 25% of piece and that probably be a pretty good mix, and I think that that\u2019s I would be surprised to see there is trend in that direction but I think it\u2019s important to \u2013 there is not a specific target for the portfolio as a whole as much as it\u2019s more of a market driven kind of an analysis.","Buck Horne","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, just going to an affordability kind of question, no offense that Charleston [indiscernible] over the world but you don\u2019t quite generate the same level of income as you would out in Southern California or the Bay Area. So, how do you think about the rent increases you guys are generating and how are you seeing the rent income ratio as trend and how much further do you think you can keep saying aggressive on price before you run into some affordability issues?","Eric Bolton","Yeah. I think affordability in the country is an issue and it certainly is to agree in our market but on a comparative basis, we have a long way to run. So probably in 2011 Buck, we peaked at our rent income ratio at about 18.5% and I think the national average is closer to 30%. It\u2019s dropped since then and frankly there is not really much of a trend, it\u2019s just sort of balance between 17% and 18%.","Given the turnovers at in all time low move-outs to rent increases are low, and as a steady stream of people willing to move in, I just don\u2019t worry about it much on this point, but at a social level it\u2019s a point of concern, but as a \u2013 it\u2019s an issue that our company is dealing with well at this point. Our markets are handling very well.","Buck Horne","Okay, thank you. Great quarter.","Eric Bolton","Sure. Thanks, Buck.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from the side of John Benda from National Securities. John, your line is open.","John Benda","Hey, good morning [indiscernible].","Eric Bolton","Hey John, good morning.","John Benda","So just a really quick question for you, can you guys talk about the current expansion opportunities in your distant portfolio, maybe for assets that were \u2013 that kind of came online in 7, 8, 9 and going to downturn and then the second phase it starts to roll out. Is that a big opportunity for you?","Eric Bolton","We have a few more \u2013 I put maybe a handful of additional opportunities but not much. We\u2019ve capture most of that. We\u2019re always, we\u2019re looking at a couple of acquisitions right now that has some expansion components to it but most of that has been captured at this point.","John Benda","Okay, and then just secondly, who you\u2019re seeing as the main sellers when you\u2019re looking at [indiscernible]? There is a lot of banks \u2013 is the banks finally unloading ROE that they put back and kind of waited your turn around before they have to take the mark on there or?","Eric Bolton","No, it\u2019s really small regional developers or smaller regional or local developers is typically who we\u2019re dealing with. On the acquisition front really I can\u2019t think of anything that we\u2019ve acquired the last five years, it\u2019s been bought out of a foreclosure or bankruptcy or anything of that nature. So it\u2019s really just small developers, private equity that kind of thing.","John Benda","All right, thank you very much.","Eric Bolton","Yeah.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from the side of Carol Kemple from Hilliard W.L. Lyons. Please go ahead.","Carol Kemple","Good morning.","Eric Bolton","Hey Carol.","Albert Campbell","Hey Carol.","Carol Kemple","I noticed your property management expenses dropped year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Was there anything specific or should that be a good run rate going forward?","Thomas Grimes","I think the important thing to notice there, there is some noise year-over-year given the merger and all the things we had gone on from IT cost and inner changes and all those things I think Carol, if we\u2019re to point to capture on that and if you look at property management expenses and the G&A, we think of that as overhead together, we combine those buckets together in our minds and our projects and think about it. Those two lines together, the year-to-date run rate you\u2019re seeing is right on for the year. And so if you take that year-to-date run rate those two double it, you\u2019ll come up right at the midpoint of our guidance for overhead which is our property management and G&A for the year.","So we\u2019re right on track, that\u2019s fully inclusive of capturing all the $25 million in same synergies that we talked about over the last year or two. And so it\u2019s on track and we feel good about that.","Carol Kemple","Okay, thanks.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Carol.","Operator","And at this time, we do have no further questions.","Eric Bolton ","All right, well thank you very much for being on the call this morning.

And thank you for participating in the MAA Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.","At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Tim Argo, SVP of Finance. You may begin, Mr. Argo.","Tim Argo","Thank you, Aaron. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO.","Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, Company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections.","We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday\u2019s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments, and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call will be available on our website.","During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eric.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Thanks, Tim. And appreciate everyone being on our call this morning. Second quarter results reflect good momentum on pricing, with same-store rents increasing 3.1% over the prior year. Revenue results largely reflect the impact of this pricing momentum with some offset from slightly higher vacancy losses compared against last year\u2019s strong performance, as well as lower transaction fees resulting from reduced resident turnover during the quarter.","At the end of the quarter, physical occupancy was a solid 95.7% and slightly ahead of last year\u2019s 95.6%. As a result of the strong occupancy position at quarter end in July, average daily occupancy within the same-store portfolio has run 35 to 40 basis points higher than last year.","And importantly, pricing momentum continued in July, with new lease rents increasing 4.1% year-over-year and renewal rents increasing an average of 5.8%. We\u2019re encouraged with the pricing trends and the resulting revenue outlook for the back half of the year.","As expected, same-store operating expenses were under some pressure for the quarter due to timing differences versus prior year from landscaping expenses, as well as a continued rise in real estate taxes reflecting higher valuation trends.","Other expense line items during Q2 were generally in line to slightly better than we had forecast, with some favorability in performance capture due to lower resident turnover, which was down 7% as compared to last year.","Pricing and revenue performance in a few of our secondary markets lagged performance elsewhere across the portfolio, as a combination of weaker job growth trends and tough prior-year occupancy comparisons, pressured performance in Memphis, Birmingham, Jacksonville and San Antonio. Solid results were achieved in Charleston, Savannah and Greenville.","Generally, the secondary market segment of the portfolio continues to avoid the higher new supply trends that we see in a number of our larger markets. But we need to capture a stronger lift in the broader economy and employment conditions for several of these secondary markets to capture more robust rent growth.","Within our large-tier market segment of the portfolio, as expected, Raleigh was our weakest performer as the market their works through some new supply deliveries. We continue to feel good about the long-term prospects in Raleigh and expect we\u2019ll see supply pressures peak this year and better pricing trends emerge in 2015. Strong revenue results from Nashville, Charlotte, and our Texas markets contributed to solid performance for the large-tier market segment of the portfolio.","As outlined in the earnings release, given the performance trends we saw in the second quarter and in July, we have adjusted our forecast assumptions for revenues and expenses, which are expected to generate a solid growth NOI in the 4% to 4.5% range for the full year.","Our team was very busy during the second quarter, wrapping up the consolidation of the MAA and Colonial operating systems platforms. We\u2019re now fully operational on the same property management, asset management and management reporting systems.","After closing our merger in October, we felt the best opportunity for capturing the full benefit surrounding synergy and scale was to get both companies and back-office operations fully consolidated as quickly as possible and prior to the busy summer leasing season.","It took quite a bit of focus and a lot of extra hours during the second quarter. I\u2019m proud of the work accomplished by our folks and really appreciate their hard work. With the vast majority of the integration work and risk now behind us, we\u2019re fully focused on harvesting the various operational opportunities surrounding our merger.","Our new development pipeline continues to lease-up very well. During the second quarter, we wrapped up construction on the projects in Charlotte and in Orlando, leaving our projects in Nashville and Jacksonville as the only remaining construction actively underway. We expect to begin initial occupancy at these two properties later this year.","Leasing continues to go well on our lease-up portfolio, and we expect to achieve full stabilization of the majority of these units by the end of this year with full earnings production in 2015. We continued to make good progress on selling the remaining non-core properties that were acquired as part of our merger with Colonial. We\u2019re in final due diligence with several buyers and expect to close on the sale of two more properties during the third quarter.","We\u2019re also busy during the quarter with capital recycling, as planned dispositions for several of our older apartment properties were completed in the second quarter and in July. We currently have two additional apartment properties located in Mobile, Alabama under contract to sell and expect to complete those dispositions during the third quarter.","We continue to look at quite a bit of acquisition opportunity. But as discussed last quarter, a lot of investor interest and favorable interest rates makes the buying market very competitive. Properties involving pre-stabilized new development are where we\u2019ve seen the greatest increase in deal flow, and I expect this area of the transaction market will remain fairly active for the next year or so. As noted in our earnings release, we closed on two such transactions during the second quarter and are currently looking at several other opportunities.","AI will recap for you the successful bond transaction that was executed during the quarter and summarize where we are with our balance sheet. We feel very good about where the balance sheet is at this point and expect that as the new development and lease-up pipelines become fully productive, we will continue to see strengthening coverage ratios and continued expansion of our unencumbered asset base.","In summary, we\u2019re encouraged with the performance outlook for the balance of the year from the same-store portfolio and expect to deliver \u2013 we will continue to capture solid NOI growth for the full year.","Our new development and lease-up pipelines are becoming increasingly productive and we look for meaningful contribution from this component of the balance sheet in 2015. We\u2019re making good progress on stock and capital from the non-core assets acquired in the Colonial acquisition, and are optimistic that we will capture attractive new investment opportunities for this capital.","With the heavy lifting of the merger and back-office integration now complete, we\u2019re excited to be focused on harvesting the full value surrounding our merger. The balance sheet is in a strong position, and we expect to see further strengthening as the development pipeline and capital recycling from non-core assets continue.","Market conditions support our plans for a higher level of capital recycling within our stabilized portfolio of properties. And we expect to continue that over the next several quarters, mindful of maintaining coverage ratios and our strong balance sheet metrics.","That\u2019s all the way I have in comments. And Al, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.","Albert M. Campbell III","Okay. Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll provide some additional commentary on the Company\u2019s second quarter earnings performance, the balance sheet activity and finally on updated earnings guidance for the year.","FFO for the quarter was $95.5 million, or $1.20 per share. Core FFO, which excludes non-routine items, primarily the merger and integration costs and the fair market value adjustment for debt assumed, was $93.9 million or $1.18 per share, which was within our guidance range and $0.03 per share below the midpoint. About $0.02 per share of the variance is related to same-store NOI, with another penny per share related to earlier-than-expected timing of our bond issuance during the second quarter.","As Eric mentioned, rent pricing trends remained good and in line with our expectations during the second quarter. But we carried about 35 basis points lower effective occupancy than projected, generating about a penny per share variance to the midpoint of our guidance.","Fee revenue was also lower than expected for the quarter, as transaction and termination fees were below projections, generating another penny per share of variance.","We made a decision during the quarter to execute our planned bond financing almost a month earlier than initially projected in order to take advantage of the favorable market conditions and timing. The transaction proved very successful as we issued 10-year bonds at a 3.75% coupon and upsized the deal to $400 million from $350 million originally planned. But the earlier-than-planned timing cost about a penny per share in the second quarter as we carried more debt than forecasted in the short-term.","As Eric discussed, we were active both buying and selling assets during the second quarter. During the quarter, we purchased two new apartment communities in Charlottesville and Dallas for a total price of about $118 million and sold two older communities in Fort Worth for combined proceeds of 32 million.","Fund II, which is our joint venture, also sold one community in Macon, Georgia during the second quarter for gross proceeds of $25.8 million, one-third of which was owned by MAA.","Activity continued in July as we sold three additional communities located in Memphis, Birmingham and Charlotte for combined proceeds of $95.6 million and acquired the remaining two-thirds interest in the final Fund II property, closing Fund II.","Construction and lease-up of our development pipeline continues to progress well. We funded an additional $13.1 million of development costs during the second quarter and fully completed two communities, Colonial Reserve at South End in Charlotte and Colonial Grand at Lake Mary Phase 2 in Orlando.","We now have two communities remaining under construction, with a total remaining funding commitment of only $33.7 million.","Total construction costs and lease-up targets in the aggregate remain on track, and we expect stabilized yields in the 7.5% range for the current development and lease-up pipeline.","During the second quarter, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet by using the proceeds from the issuance of $400 million of 10-year unsecured notes mentioned earlier to repay $198 million of secured Freddie Mac debt and $192 million maturing bonds series acquired from Colonial. As mentioned, we executed the deal little earlier than planned, capitalizing on market demand to achieve a credit spread of 125 basis points above 10-year treasury, which exhibits the strength of our balance sheet.","The 10-year unsecured financing increased our unencumbered asset pool, our interest-rate protection and the duration of our debt maturities. At quarter end, over 66% of our gross assets were unencumbered. Over 98% of our debt is fixed or hedged against rising interest rates, with an average duration of about 5 years.","Also at the end of the quarter, company leverage based on market cap was 35.5% and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.6 times. Our total debt to Recurring EBITDA was 6.41 times and we had $488 million of cash and credit available under our unsecured line of credit at quarter end.","And finally, as expected, there are many crosscurrents included in our earnings guidance this year as we work through the integration and consolidation of Colonial, along with a related higher level of both non-core and core capital recycling transactions. Based on the second quarter performance and updated expectations for the remainder of the year, we are revising core FFO guidance for the full year to an expected range of $4.79 to $4.95 per share at the midpoint of the range, which is $0.47 per share. This represents a revision of $0.04 per share for the remainder of the year.","We are narrowing our NOI guidance for the full year to 4% to 4.5%, which translates into a penny per share revision to core FFO for the back half of the year. And additionally, we now expect $0.03 per share impact in the second half from transaction, timing and corporate items. Of these, we now expect to achieve our full year multi-payment disposition target by mid-third quarter, which is earlier than we originally projected, costing us about a penny per share versus the earlier forecast.","Also, we upsized our bond deal in the second quarter. We issued $400 million versus the $350 million planned, which increased our interest rate protection for the long-term, but cost us about a penny per share over the remainder of 2014.","And finally, after filing our franchise tax returns and extensions for 2013, we increased our franchise tax accrual rate primarily due to changes in our tax base from the Colonial merger, which will cost us an additional penny per share over the remainder of this year. And together, all of these items account for the $0.04 per share revision to the forecast for the back half of the year.","Also during the third quarter, we expect to record gains on the sale of several properties of around $34 million, along with a $2.5 million prepayment charge on a related loan, all of which are excluded from core FFO for the quarter, but maybe important for modeling purposes.","Quarterly core FFO per share is expected to be $1.15 to $1.27 per share for the third quarter and $1.21 to $1.33 for the fourth quarter. Core AFFO for the full year is expected to be $4.04 to $4.20 per share, which represents a 71% dividend payout at the midpoint.","We expect to end the year with our balance sheet in very good shape, leverage at the low end of the range, somewhere around 42% debt to gross assets, encumbered assets at historic levels, greater than 65% and with coverage ratios very strong greater than 3.5 times, position well to support 2015.","So that\u2019s all we have in the way of comments. Aaron, I\u2019ll turn the call over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Certainly. (Operator Instructions) We will first take a question from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Good morning, guys.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Hi, David.","Albert M. Campbell III","Good morning.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","I\u2019m still kind of struggling to understand the real mix of secondary market trouble, or I guess sort of why it fell a little bit shy of your expectations. And I know you, Eric, you mentioned employment and tough comps. But maybe if you could just provide a little bit of detail on the mix of rent at the new and renewal level, and also maybe comment on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of move-outs to home purchases, and specifically where there\u2019s troubling supply.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","","Okay. Well, let me start with it on some of this, and then Tom can give you some information on the pricing. But broadly speaking, David, I think, the secondary market segment story really centers around the employment issue. This segment of the portfolio continues to not see the level of new supply that we are seeing take place in some of larger markets.","The only areas where we\u2019ve seen any sort of real supply issue \u2013 we have a submarket in Jacksonville where we\u2019ve got a couple of properties that have seen a little supply and we\u2019ve seen a little supply in San Antonio. But, broadly speaking for the segment as a whole, it really gets back to employment trends. And we know that when the economy starts to recover that the bigger markets, like Dallas and Houston, are going to really do quite well. But I think we have to see the economy lift at a more accelerated pace than what we\u2019ve seen thus far to really get the job growth trends more favorable down at the secondary market level. And give you some perspective on it.","We use a lot of information from moodyseconomy.com in terms of job growth projections. And if you look at 2013 job growth year-over-year in the secondary market\u2019s segment, we underperformed in that segment. Those markets underperformed national employment trends by about 70 basis points. And then, in 2014, we\u2019re tailing by about 30 or 40 basis points.","But if you look at the projections for 2014 through 2016, which I know \u2013 assumes that we continue to see some acceleration in the employment markets. The secondary markets, they approach performing at a level consistent with sort of national trends. And of course the large-tier share markets are blowing away the national trends. They are doing much, much better.","So I really believe that \u2013 and then in particular, we had, Memphis is an example where we had some real tough comps. Last year, our occupancy \u2013 we carried roughly 97% occupancy in Q2 last year and we\u2019re comparing against that this year.","So Memphis in particular had a tough comp, as an example. But I think really it gets back to the job growth trends and we just have not seen the growth take place in these markets up to this point. But at least the projections are assuming the economy continues to show some progress that we\u2019ll see things get better as get into 2015 and 2016. But we still don\u2019t see really the supply issues.","Before I turn it over to Tom, the other point I will tell you is move-outs to home buying and move-outs to renting a home are actually less in secondary markets than they are in the large markets. So it\u2019s not a unique issue surrounding single-family in any way affecting the secondary markets. Tom?","Thomas L. Grimes Jr.","Sure. David, the new lease renewal blended trends follow what Eric laid out. We\u2019ve got markets such as Little Rock and Memphis. During the quarter, Little Rock was up 0.2%, Memphis 2.2%. That\u2019s on a blended year-over-year basis. And then places like Savannah, Charleston, they were 7%, 8.3%. It really just sort of depends on where they\u2019re fitting in the spectrum of job growth. Limited new supply in Jacksonville in those pieces.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","It is a mixed bag, because as I commented, Memphis, Birmingham, we saw weakness. Huntsville has been weak; Columbia, South Carolina has been weak for us, as has Columbus, Georgia. But Savannah has been strong, Chattanooga has been relatively strong, Charleston has been strong. Greenville has been strong.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, if we just think about \u2013 like, to take an asset in particular that may be a little bit weak from your perspective, what is the conversation like at the ground level, with tenants on renewals and incoming tenants? If it\u2019s a market where there\u2019s weak employment, our people just pushing back on rent? Are you sort of giving up a little bit of rent to keep occupancy, and keep the turn rates low? What\u2019s the actual dynamic in an asset?","Albert M. Campbell III","No, David. And when you look back at our comp versus last year, we needed to carry our average physicals and we did. And of course, there\u2019s the temptation to really tradeoff hard on pricing to get to that number. We feel like there\u2019s good re-pricing in the portfolio and we feel like we have an opportunity to push that through. Move-outs to rent increases are actually down like 14%. So that dynamic is not occurring. We\u2019re sticking to our guns on pricing and feel good about that long-term tradeoff. We have solid occupancy. We don\u2019t have as good as what we planned on.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And my last question is just a detail, and I might have missed this. But did you comment on what your plans are for the Las Vegas assets?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","We didn\u2019t comment on it. I would tell you, David, we\u2019re taking a hard look at that. We\u2019ve got only two properties in that market. And we\u2019re going to be looking at our plans over the next couple years as we talk about recycling, and we\u2019ll have more to say about it then. But I think that we either need to bigger or out, one of the other. And we haven\u2019t made a firm decision on that yet.","Thomas L. Grimes Jr.","And just a comment on Las Vegas, we closed July $96.4 million there with low exposure, 7% and rents were beginning to pick up. We feel like you\u2019ll see better traction in Las Vegas in the second half of the year than you have in the first half.","David Toti \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks for the detail today.","Operator","And we\u2019ll next go to the site of Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.","Ryan H. Bennett \u2013 Zelman & Associates, LLC","Hi, good morning, guys. Just to follow-up, just on your outlook for the full year, given the second quarter. You revised the core FFO guidance and walked through the detail there. Just curious, you\u2019ve maintained this fourth quarter guidance, I believe, is why I\u2019m just curious. If you could just walk us through kind of how you get back to that by the fourth quarter as we think about the run rate into 2015? And then, as part of that, the income contributions you\u2019re thinking about from the redevelopments of Colonial assets later on this year?","Albert M. Campbell III","Hi, Ryan, this is Al. I can talk to you. Remember, there\u2019s a lot of crosscurrents going on this year that affect the quarter-to-quarter and changes quarter-to-quarter. Let me just tell you how we approach looking at the back half and how our guidance has established large element. So if you look at what we\u2019re expecting, we really expecting \u2013 rent trends have been good this year, first quarter and second quarter and continued to do so in July.","So we expect those to continue. And we expect, really to hold number one, those rent trends will continue to compound through effective rents as you move into third quarter, even more so in the fourth quarter, probably the biggest contribution in the fourth quarter. We expect to really hold the strong occupancy that we held at the end of the second quarter. We ended at 95.7%, and we expect to hold that strong for the year.","And as Tom mentioned, we didn\u2019t capture quite as much effective occupancy during the second quarter as we wanted. Our plan is to hold that and to not have that happen again over the back half of the year and then to capture more fee performance. As we talked about, transaction fees were down a little bit, I think, for a couple of reasons. One is that we didn\u2019t capture quite as much opportunity related to some of the programs on the Colonial side of the portfolio. We had hoped in the second quarter. We feel very good about that performance in the fourth quarter that is there. It\u2019s a little bit later than we had thought. If you think about the revenue trends, that gives you the line.","And on expenses, as we had always talked about in our guidance, we did expect the biggest pressure point to be in the second quarter. Had we talked about that someone may read a couple of things. Real estate taxes for the year, they\u2019re 6.5%. But just because the timing of the accruals last year and this year, the first half was higher. I think the first half average was 8.2%. So you can see it\u2019s higher than the year. We expect some reprieve at the back half.","And then, we talked about our landscaping expenses. And we just had a pretty significant difference this year to last year in the landscaping expenses. They fall where the work \u2013 the time the work is done. So when we put the two, Colonial portfolio and our portfolio together, our practices changed a little bit. And we had a lot more of the expense problem in the second quarter as we did our [mulches] (ph) and annual things that we do. We expect to see that reprieve in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, primarily in third quarter.","So my point being, the back half of the year is largely based on continued rent trends, holding occupancy, capturing the other income of the fees that we talked about and lower expenses. And the final thing is, we have captured in the second quarter some favorable expenses from some of the synergy, probably some of the things that we had planned to do.","Our costs were low in personnel and R&M, and we look for that to continue in the back half of the year. And then, we also had an insurance renewal that will affect the back half of the year. We penciled it on July 1 and we get a 20% reduction \u2013 somewhere between a 15% and 20% reduction. So I\u2019m just giving the color for all those things that combine both our income and our expense and make us feel good about the back half of the year, that performance.","Ryan H. Bennett \u2013 Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. I appreciate the color there. But just in terms of your comments about holding rents and seeing that positive trend, what\u2019s kind of baked into your baseline economic assumptions for the secondary markets in the back half of the year? Are you modeling in pretty significant pickup? Or is it more stable, what we\u2019ve seen? Have you kind of dialed that back a little bit?","Albert M. Campbell III","","In secondary markets, as we talked about, we took the back the back half of the year down a penny per share primarily for secondary market performance that Eric talked about. Pretty consistent in trends, but we just soften it a little bit from the secondary markets. But still, we expect good trends going out.","Ryan H. Bennett \u2013 Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay, got it. And then, just building on that, just on the transaction side doing the deals in Memphis and Birmingham, after the quarter here, just any indication give us on pricing, and how that came in relative to your expectations given the economic backdrop in those markets?","Albert M. Campbell III","They came in pretty good. I think the average of those that we sold in July was just south of 7%. I think the average of the two that we sold during the quarter was closer to 6.5%, 6.4% or something like that, and they were in Forth Worth. So I\u2019ll say it this way. We\u2019ve sold, I think, six of the eight assets that we had for the full year in the program to sell $140 million to $150 million in multifamily. We expect the cap rates to be just south of 7% on that and that\u2019s what we captured so far. And we expect the remaining two that are about $20 million to be the same.","Ryan H. Bennett \u2013 Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay, great.","Albert M. Campbell III","That\u2019s on a $3.50 per unit CapEx, 4% of management fee, and in-place NOI.","Ryan H. Bennett \u2013 Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay, got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","And we will next to the site of Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Thanks. Just following up Ryan\u2019s question there, in your presentation at NAREIT, you kind of walked through kind of what you expected in terms of same-store revenue and NOI there on a quarterly basis. Can you give us an update as to how you\u2019re thinking in the third and fourth quarter, just in terms of trends and the contributions there?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Well, I mean, I\u2019ll let Al give you the specifics, but broadly speaking, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve pulled back a little bit on the revenue assumptions and improved a little bit, if you will, on the expense assumptions. So on a net basis, we still believe \u2013 our original guidance for the year was 4% to 5% NOI growth and we\u2019ve dialed it back to 4% to 4.5%.","So still within the range, the bottom half of the range we originally started with. But we\u2019re just going to get there a little bit differently with a little \u2013 based on what we\u2019ve seen so far this year, a little weaker revenue growth, but better expense control frankly. And the net result is 4% to 4.5% NOI growth for the full year. And it really reflects all the things we\u2019ve been saying in terms of what Al just walked through in terms the back half of the year and based on what we\u2019re seeing thus far. I mean, Al, you want to\u2026","Albert M. Campbell III","Yes, I\u2019ll just give you \u2013 if you did the math on it, Mike, you\u2019re going to need from our estimates about 3.6% revenue growth over the back half of the year. Okay? So third quarter, we expect somewhere in the 3% to 3.5% range. Fourth quarter, as we continue to compound those rents in and capture those fee opportunities, 3.5% to 4% range that shows you how we expect that to average out.","Michael J. Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Okay. That\u2019s helpful there. Second of all, just given the comments about the secondary markets performance there being seemingly more job growth and supply-related. Does that make you rethink the mix of the portfolio a bit more? I know when you announced the Colonial portfolio, you said you had your target mix, but does that make you shift maybe a little bit more in favor of the primary markets?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","I\u2019ll tell you, Mike, not materially so. I think that we continue to believe very much in the notion that we want to deploy capital for a full cycle sort of performance profile. We always have understood that the secondary markets that don\u2019t capture quite the level of robust job growth that you get in the bigger markets struggle at various points in the cycle. They don\u2019t likewise get the supply pressures that you typically see in the larger markets as well.","While certainly there are some weaknesses that we saw this quarter, again this quarter, in Memphis, Birmingham and the others that I\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve also seen some strength in some others. And so, I would tell you that in terms of a sort of overall long-term performance objective, we still feel very much that the right thing to do is continue to allocate roughly 60% to 65% of our capital to the large markets and 35% to 40% to the secondary markets.","Now, what you\u2019re going to see as a consequence of our capital recycling effort, you\u2019re going to see some recycling take place, and it will be more active within the secondary market segment of the portfolio. There are some secondary markets where we think the prospects are not nearly as strong as they are in some other secondary markets. We feel like we can still go into some of these higher growth secondary markets that \u2013 Charleston is an example and some others that we\u2019ve been buying in. And we can still get the performance dynamics over the long haul, but I think put capital in a position where it\u2019s going to create a little bit more robust long-term organic growth rate. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re really trying to do.","Michael J. Salinsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Appreciate the color, guys. Thank you.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Thanks Mike.","Operator","And we will next go to the side of Rich Anderson with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Rich Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd.","Hey, good morning.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Good morning, Rich.","Albert M. Campbell III","Hi, Rich.","Rich Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd.","Welcome to my site. You talked about capital recycling. Would you be willing in this market, with cap rates being where they are, to actually take on a little bit more dilution in the short-term if you found the right situation, even if you didn\u2019t have a synonymous amount of redeployment opportunity, just to take advantage of the transaction market today to clean up the portfolio?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","The answer is, within reason. I will tell you that this year in particular is a challenging year from a recycling perspective, in that not only are we eating dilution surrounding recycling multifamily capital, but we\u2019re also eating dilution cycling out of some commercial assets, which is pretty darn dilutive, selling those at much higher cap rates. And we\u2019re also eating dilution from the development lease-up pipeline, all of which does first \u2013 the development pipeline will largely be fully productive going into next year. And we certainly expect to be cycled out of a lot of the commercial assets by next year.","So those two areas of current earnings solutions kind of goes away. My guess is that you what will see is a higher level of recycling taking place within the apartment side of things, stabilized portfolio going into next year. But, again, we\u2019re willing to \u2013 we\u2019re eating about $0.14 of earnings this year. And I wouldn\u2019t want to see that go up significantly from that, because we are committed to protecting the balance sheet and making sure that we don\u2019t step back from all the work that we\u2019ve done for the last five years, frankly, to get the balance sheet where it is. But our capacity for handling dilution improves in the sense we can cycle more multifamily next year, because we won\u2019t have the dilution surrounding the lease-up and the commercial recycling.","Rich Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd.","Okay. And in terms of cap rates, obviously, the multifamily side, you\u2019ve probably seen some compression there. Maybe you can comment on that. But has there been any move at all on the commercial side from a cap rate perspective?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Not that I\u2019m aware of, Rich. We\u2019re not, I would say, particularly active in the commercial side of things. We just got two assets in the land asset that we\u2019re rotating out of. So I can\u2019t really comment a lot on the commercial side. These two operating commercial assets that we\u2019ve got, we\u2019ve had them under contract now for a while. So it\u2019s not like we\u2019re really active in the market. So I couldn\u2019t tell you if there\u2019s been any real compression or not.","Rich Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd.","Okay. And then, just a quick one for Al. The mark-to-market, the $90 million, how quickly will that trend down? How long will that take?","Albert M. Campbell III","That is amortized over 4.5, almost five years, Rich. It\u2019s a little bit frontend-loaded in that as individual pieces of debt in that mature, it comes down. So I would say it doesn\u2019t come down quickly, but it will come down each quarter a portion until it\u2019s very low by the end of the fourth year.","Rich Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd.","Okay.","Albert M. Campbell III","So, I can probably offline give you a little more specific math, but it helps you give you the trend of it.","Rich Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd.","Okay. That\u2019s good. Thanks, guys, I appreciate it.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Thanks, Rick.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now take a question from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hey, good morning guys.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Good morning.","Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Eric, maybe Tom, can you take us behind the scenes of the last three or four weeks of the quarter? Trying to get a sense what the major change factor was between NAREIT, the first week of June where you had seemingly much rosier expectations for same-store revenue for the quarter, mid to maybe upper 3s than what you actually achieved. Trying to get a sense, more clarity, granularity on how the results came in so much lower than what we expected, when after all this is the apartment business; we have pretty good forecast ability, you have revenue management, which gives you the opportunity to assess upcoming lease expirations, absorption, competitive pricing, et cetera.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Haendel, this is Eric. And I\u2019ll tell you that the pricing trends played out very much like we expected. The two things that surprised us a little bit was the effective occupancy point that we\u2019ve mentioned, as well as the transaction fees. And I can tell you, if you will, behind the scenes, getting to your question, May was sort of the apex of work going on regarding back office, conversion and integration processes. We started the conversion over to Yardi in latter part of the first quarter, and really working it \u2013 taking a division at a time, if you will.","And May was a time where we had the greatest fog, if you will regard what was happening at the property levels. We knew that where occupancy was at the end of the quarter, or at the end of May into early June. We knew what sort of occupancy was at that point. What we didn\u2019t have real clarity on at that point was the average daily occupancy that we had throughout the month of May. And when we got back and sort of got the two different sets of reports in two different systems, and got all the information compiled, it was obvious that we had given up roughly 35 basis points of effective occupancy during the course of the month of May, beyond what we had anticipated.","And so that was really where the difference came from. So, good news is in June we wrapped it all up. And at this point, we\u2019re all in the same system. We\u2019ve got great insight now into everything and feel very good about where we are.","Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Would you be willing to share with us the new and renewal by month for April, May and June? And then what the month and occupancy numbers were for those months as well?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Tom got it.","Thomas L. Grimes Jr.","Sure, Haendel. All right. So April, May and June on year-over-year basis work for \u2013 April was 2.7% May for 4.3%, June 3.2% on new lease. And then renewal was 7.3%, 7.6%, 7.6% and 7.5% for the quarter.","Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then, the\u2026","Thomas L. Grimes Jr.","We ended June at 95.7% and April and May were both 95.1%.","Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. So, you mentioned that your renewals for July here were 5.8%, so a little bit below what you were getting during the second quarter. What are you sending out today for August? And do you have an expectation of where you think that\u2019ll be?","Thomas L. Grimes Jr.","We\u2019ve got it. And on a year-over-year basis \u2013 actually I only have lease-over-lease for that right now, Haendel. So July, lease-over-lease was 8%, August 7.3%, September 6.4%, October 6.6%. We intentionally tail off. We don\u2019t push on renewals as hard in fourth quarter moving into the summer season as we typically do during the busier season.","Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And as far as occupancy at 95.7%, is this a level you feel comfortable sustaining here near-term, would you like to build that up a bit as we get the back half of the year end well?","Thomas L. Grimes Jr.","Our strategy is we\u2019ve got the best re-pricing opportunity sort of late second, early third. And then we being to build our occupancy and lower our total exposure as we head into the slower winter months. We are looking like \u2013 we close July today, but expect that to be at 96% with exposure, which is total availability, close to 0.3%. That\u2019s compared to 9.2% last year. And our average physical occupancy during the quarter or during the month looks like it\u2019s going to be up about 30 basis points, as Eric mentioned in his comments.","Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks.","Thomas L. Grimes Jr.","So, yes, to answer your question, I would expect occupancy to run much closer, or slightly better, but much closer to last year\u2019s numbers in the second half than in the first half.","Haendel St. Juste \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","And we will next take a question from Buck Horne with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is now open.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on economic cap rates in your markets based on the levels of investments that you\u2019re seeing out there in transactions. Just what are you seeing for A and B properties in the Sunbelt relative to the gap between large markets and some of the secondary markets?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Buck, this is Eric. I would tell you that broadly speaking, for the higher-end product, new product in some of the larger markets we\u2019re seeing economic cap rates on a stabilized NOI level, sort of 4.8%, 4.9% to probably 5.25%. And in the secondary markets, it may be 5% to 5.5%, probably no more than 50-basis point spread, but broadly in that kind of range for the sort of more stabilized assets, frankly none of which we\u2019ve been buying, because that\u2019s in particular where the competition is pretty fierce. But we\u2019re seeing stabilized assets, five, six, seven-year-old properties to some of the large markets, good locations, trading 5% to 5.5%, and in the secondary markets probably 5.5% to 5.75%. It\u2019s rare to find anything at 6% today.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And you mentioned how move-outs to single-family or \u2013 home buying and\/or single-family rentals is down year-over-year. Could you quantify those numbers for us, and give us some perspective on what you\u2019re seeing in those trends?","Thomas L. Grimes Jr.","Yes, sure. The turnover on home buying was, it dropped from about 20% to 19% on that. And then, on single-family rentals, I don\u2019t we indicated were down. They were up modestly, but still running there in the 9% range, still a third of the level of our larger reasons for move-out, which are home buying and job transfer.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","And the trends have been fairly consistent for awhile now. I mean, the move-outs to renting a home have ticked up just a tad. But it\u2019s gone from roughly sort of 6% of our move-out to about 9% of our move-out. But as Tom said, it\u2019s really not a meaningful impact overall. What really has been helpful in terms of driving turnover down is the continued low move-outs to buying a house. And we saw a drop again this quarter. So that\u2019s an area that\u2019s been very helpful.","Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Thanks Buck.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now take a question from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Karin A. Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Hi, good morning. Question for Eric. The focus of your comments earlier regarding the revenue underperformance in the second quarter really were centered around the secondary markets. Should we infer from that that primary markets all performed as you had expected for the quarter, and that you expected the deceleration, I think, was 50 basis points that you saw from 1Q to 2Q in those markets including Atlanta, Austin, South Florida, all of those performed as you\u2019d expected?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Yes, I would tell you broadly speaking that majority of the performance issue was in the secondary markets. Now, Atlanta as an example, we gave up, it looks to be, about 70 basis points. Austin we gave up a little more than that in terms of year-over-year effective occupancy, again just the quarter. And as I alluded to, the market that we saw the most pressure in was in Raleigh and fully expected that.","But broadly speaking, when you look at the revenue trends overall, I mean, Atlanta driving 3.7% year-over-year growth in revenues and Austin driving 4% year-over-year growth in revenues, despite the give-up and effective occupancy that we saw in both Atlanta and Austin, we still delivered pretty darn good revenue growth overall. And broadly speaking, the only market that really was weak per se was Raleigh.","And then, Tampa was a little bit weak there. But Tampa is a market that \u2013 frankly, we were just comparing against a little higher-occupancy variable there. And we gave up, it looks to be, about 60 or 70 basis points there in Tampa. But Tampa\u2019s back. It\u2019s hard to draw any broad conclusions from just three months to three months year-over-year. We still feel good about Tampa long-term, certainly. But largely, the large markets generally performed pretty much in line with what we were expecting.","Thomas L. Grimes Jr.","And, Karin, as we look forward to the second half, some of those markets that Eric mentioned are ones that we look to for further improvement over the first half of the year. Atlanta and Austin both trended very good in July. And we\u2019re looking at 96.2% there on effective occupancy in Atlanta, and rents and renewals over \u2013 new lease rents at 5.5% and renewals 8.9%; supply and check in Atlanta. Austin is 96.7% now, below 7% exposure. There\u2019s certainly some supply going on there. It\u2019s much heavier in that central town like area than it is in the suburbs, though there is some. And then, Dallas, Fort Worth, Tampa and Las Vegas, we would expect those to perform better in the second half than they did in the first half.","Karin A. Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Thanks for the color. My second question is on the merger and integration. You alluded to the focus on that in the second quarter causing sort of a lack of information for you guys for a period of time. Do you think it also \u2013 just because of the intense sort of nature of that transition, do you think that caused your team to take the eye off sort of the operational ball in 2Q? If so, do you expect that to reverse in the second half? Or is it just really that informational gap that you had and maybe a delay in the merger synergies that you saw in 2Q?","Thomas L. Grimes Jr.","Karin, I saw a lot of people really since October 1 with their eye on the ball and working incredibly hard with a lot going on. I will tell you going forward, we\u2019re sort of ecstatic to be done with it. I think we have great insights. Our teams have gelled in terms of working together with each other. Our systems are in place. We\u2019re no longer rolling out a new process, a new procedure, a new software. And I think you see some of the results of that in July, and I think we\u2019ll continue to learn how to wring out the value of this merger as we move forward.","Karin A. Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","","Thanks, Karin.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now take a question from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Yes, good morning. Just two questions. In regards to asset sales during the quarter and subsequent to the quarter, you did make sales in Fort Worth and as well as Charlotte, which are some of your larger markets. And I think you guys have always expressed most of your asset sales will come from the smaller markets. Just curious why in particular these assets were sold.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Tayo, in all cases, there were some legacy Colonial assets, pretty old. Some pretty significant CapEx requirements that we just concluded, that we\u2019d be better off to cycle out of those. So they were just unique in the sense of \u2013 these are old, frankly, assets that come to Colonial through the Cornerstone merger that they executed well over 10 years ago. So there\u2019s no change in strategy. It\u2019s just unique situations pertaining to age and the CapEx requirements associated with those particular assets.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, could you just talk a little bit \u2013 give a little bit more detail about the Austin, Texas market in particular? I know it\u2019s one of these markets \u2013 you had a lot of exposure to it. And you had always mentioned rising supply in Austin was something you were on the lookout for on a going-forward basis.","Thomas L. Grimes Jr.","I\u2019ll tell you, Tayo, I think Austin certainly has had a fair amount of supply. It seems like it is abating in the suburban submarkets. It\u2019s still there. It\u2019s heavier in the core. We\u2019ve been encouraged honestly. We mentioned Raleigh and Austin as our worry beads at the beginning of the year. And Austin has held up, I think, a little better than we expected and is trending stronger for the second half of the year. And just encouraged with where it is right now, and where our assets are located.","Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Thanks Tayo.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a question from Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.","David Bragg \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Can you please share the year-over-year revenue growth for the legacy MAA and CLP portfolios in 2Q?","Albert M. Campbell III","Yes. I can tell you, Dave, there was a about a 20 basis points difference. So, overall I believe, on legacy MAA was about 2.5%. I think legacy Colonial was about 2.7% for the second quarter. We have a little more larger markets, and there\u2019s obviously some things we\u2019re trying to do to capture.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Little more larger markets in CLP portfolio.","Albert M. Campbell III","Yes.","David Bragg \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that. And thanks for all the insight on the occupancy and secondary market issues that proved to be challenging in the second quarter. But what I\u2019m kind of taking away from this conversation this morning is that there was also \u2013 what played a big role was a temporary challenge in your reporting and forecasting systems due to the integration. I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s a fair assessment when we think about the 3.4% to 4.4% second quarter revenue growth forecast you put out there at NAREIT in early June, versus where you ended up. Is that really a pretty big part of this that we\u2019re not as focused on this morning?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","I would tell you that it\u2019s certainly part of it. I mean, just be honest with you, clearly there was a lot of work going on in the second quarter regarding systems integration and training and just, as you can imagine, putting together two $4 billion platforms and getting everybody sort of on the same page, and really hitting an apex, frankly, in the month of May. And there was some challenge to it, no doubt about it. But I would tell you \u2013 and so obviously, we came up short on revenues relative to what we had expected. Now, we actually did a bit better than we expected on expenses.","So while NOI still came up short because of the miss on the revenues, NOI miss was not a significant as based on what we were thinking going into NAREIT. But having said all that, as Tom alluded to a moment ago, it\u2019s all done. We\u2019re all on the same platform now. The teams are working very, very well together. The integration is complete. We\u2019ve got great visibility into everything that\u2019s happening at this point and feel very good about the outlook for the back half of the year.","David Bragg \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. And could you just summarize for us the changes to your expense growth expectations specific to the second half of the year?","Albert M. Campbell III","Yes, Dave, this is Al. I\u2019d tell you, as we talked about, we had always expected the best expense performance being the third quarter, you got several things going on. You got the favorable comparison from some of the [noise] (ph) in Colonial\u2019s numbers last year in the third quarter that we always had forecasted. A couple changes though. We did have some favorable performance in our expenses, I mentioned personnel, R&M, in the second quarter and we expect some of that. That\u2019s capturing some of the synergies and savings from the platform. We expect that to continue into the back half of the year.","And then also, we got very favorable insurance renewal, 20%, 15%, (indiscernible) that will take the back half of the year and the real estate tax comparisons get better. So my point being, third quarter will be by far the best expense performance and likely will be flat to negative, slightly negative. And the fourth quarter will be more of a modest, reasonable growth rate, averaging to much lower for the back half and the front half.","David Bragg \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Okay, thank you. And one more for Eric. Eric, when you say that this integration is all done, do you also feel as though the organization is prepared for another sizeable portfolio opportunity should one present itself? Or is it too early?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","We\u2019re absolutely ready. We have learned so much over the past year, Dave, I can\u2019t begin to tell you. And our team has done just a tremendous job. And we\u2019ve learned a lot through the process. We\u2019ve got, I think, a great platform in place. And there\u2019s not many challenges that we\u2019re not prepared to take on at this point.","David Bragg \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Okay. And throughout this process, you\u2019ve spoken a lot about your desires in terms of large and secondary market exposure. What are your broad thoughts on an opportunity that could make the portfolio meaningfully more urban and younger within your existing markets?","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","Younger is good. I\u2019m not hung up on the idea that our asset base needs to become increasingly urban-oriented, particularly in this region of the country. This region of the country tends to support a lot of employment and entertainment and good places to live that are not in the urban areas, and more in the suburban locations. So younger is good. Newer is good. We would continue to like very much the large markets that we\u2019re in. As I\u2019ve alluded to, I think we need to cycle more into some better growth secondary markets, which we certainly are working to accomplish over the next couple of years. But we like a good mix of urban and suburban.","David Bragg \u2013 Green Street Advisors, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And I\u2019m showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Eric Bolton for any closing comments.","H. Eric Bolton Jr.","","No comments from us. I appreciate everyone joining our call and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see everybody starting of September. So thanks.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

The company will first share its prepared comments, followed by a question-and-answer session. At this time, we would like to turn the call over to Leslie Wolfgang, Corporate Secretary. Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin.","Leslie Bratten Cantrell Wolfgang","Thank you, Stephanie. And good morning, everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Corporate Secretary for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; and Tom Grimes, our COO.","Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday\u2019s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call, will be available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Eric.","H. Eric Bolton","Thanks, Leslie, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start my comments this morning by expressing my appreciation for all the hard work over the summer months by our folks at MAA and Colonial. We obviously had a busy summer, as our most active leasing season was also highlighted by quite a bit of work surrounding the integration of our company's operating and reporting systems, ensuring we were ready to execute as the combined company upon closing our merger. Advisers for both companies did a terrific job, and the merger transaction was successfully closed on October 1. Our property associates and the entire management team from both companies really pulled together, and we are now successfully up and running as a combined operation.","As noted in our earnings release, both MAA and Colonial portfolios ended the quarter with strong occupancy, and as a result, we are well positioned for the fall and winter leasing season. I'd also like to thank Tom Lowder and the entire Colonial management team for their hard work and enthusiastic support in positioning our now combined company for a strong start.","As reported in yesterday's earnings release, MAA's core FFO per share for the third quarter was $1.25 and at the top end of our guidance range. MAA's same-store NOI performance of 4.6% was in line with our expectation, and the outperformance in FFO was due to a combination of better-than-expected lease-up in our development pipeline and lower-than-expected interest cost. The midpoint of our forecast range for 2013 growth in same-store NOI of 5% has remained consistent all year.","As expected, during the quarter, leasing conditions continued to support more robust performance from our large market segment of the portfolio. Houston, Dallas, Austin, Atlanta and Nashville all delivered solid revenue results. Sluggish employment conditions in Memphis and Little Rock held back rent growth and impacted our Secondary Markets segment of the portfolio in the third quarter. We continue to believe that as we head into next year, as new supply deliveries are likely to generate some moderation in pricing power, our Secondary Markets segment of the portfolio will provide a stabilizing influence on the overall portfolio performance.","Next year's outlook for the ratio of new jobs to new unit deliveries is in the 8:1 range for our large market segment of the portfolio, which is consistent with this year. While the secondary market segment is forecasted to move from jobs to new units, ratio of 6:1 this year to well over 10:1 in 2014.","We were encouraged with the continued low resident turnover in Q3, as we turned only 1% more units in the third quarter this year as compared to Q3 of last year. On a rolling 12-month basis, turnover remains low at 57.6%. Move-outs to buy a house remained right around 20% of our overall move-outs, consistent with what we've seen from the last several quarters. Likewise, move-outs to rent a single-family home continued to hover in the 6% to 7% range of total move-outs. These numbers have been consistent for several quarters now.","While it wasn't officially part of our operation in the third quarter, I wanted to also provide a little color on the Colonial same-store portfolio in Q3. The portfolio captured year-over-year revenue growth of 4.7% in the third quarter, with the best performances coming out of Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Charlotte and Charleston, as each of these markets exceeded the average rent growth performance of the portfolio. Same-store occupancy made a strong recovery from the end of Q2 and ended the quarter at 96.4%, a 150 basis point increase.","As expected, during Q3 there was some cleanup in final accruals and merger-related closing activities in the expense area, as same-store operating expenses came in high at 10.3%, a combination of onetime incentives and leasing commissions put in place shortly after the merger announcement and real estate taxes pressured expense performance in the quarter. We expect all expense line items to normalize in Q4, with the only continued pressure coming from real estate taxes.","We remain comfortable with the original assessment surrounding the expense synergies and opportunities to be harvested over the next few quarters from our merger with Colonial. We're well underway towards completing systems integration activities and reworking a number of contracts and processes that we expect will benefit both profit-level NOI results and overhead cost. The 4 development projects acquired through the merger are all on track, with leasing now underway at Colonial Reserve at South End in Charlotte and Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes in Orlando. In addition, we now have the vast majority of the remaining Colonial commercial assets and nonproductive landholdings currently in the market for disposition, and we'll be working to recycle this capital into productive multi-family assets over the next year.","As outlined in our supplemental schedules to the earnings release, leasing continues to go very well at our existing MAA development and lease-up properties. In particular, our lease-up in Charleston has performed well ahead of our expectation, with 170 of the 270 units delivered during the quarter and 231 or 86% of the units already pre-leased or occupied at this time. I will provide you with more details on this update of the balance sheet, but we are pleased to complete our inaugural bond offering in October. The transaction was well received and we believe our now combined balance sheet is in terrific shape. As we continue to drive higher levels of earnings productivity out of the capital on the former Colonial balance sheet, we look to build on this balance sheet strength.","In summary, it was a busy quarter. We're excited to have the merger officially closed and are optimistic about the opportunities surrounding the combination of MAA and Colonial. As the current real estate market cycle continues to play out, we believe our enhanced portfolio and full cycle portfolio strategy, supported by strong operating platform, puts the company in a terrific position to continue to drive higher margins and more value from our existing asset base. Additionally, we believe that over the next couple of years, there are going to be some good opportunities to opportunistically deploy capital. Our planned capital recycling activity and solid balance sheet position puts MAA in a terrific position to support this effort.","That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. And now, I'll turn it over to Al.","Albert M. Campbell","Thank you, Eric. And good morning, everyone. I'll provide additional color on the company's third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and on updated guidance for the fourth quarter. As mentioned in the release, given the October 1 close of the Colonial merger, third quarter results reflect only MAA activity with combined reporting beginning in the fourth quarter. There will, of course, be a good bit of noise from the merger in the fourth quarter, but we're going to work very hard to provide as much detail and clarity as we can to help project the combined company performance for the remainder of the year. We will discuss this a bit further in a moment as we address revised guidance.","Core FFO for the quarter was $55.4 million or $1.25 per share, which represents 9.6% growth over comparable results for the prior year, and was $0.04 per share above the midpoint of previous guidance. The favorable FFO performance for the quarter was primarily produced by leasing activities running well ahead of plan for the lease-up and development pipeline adding about $0.02 per share and some lower interest expense for the quarter due to the timing of the planned bond transaction, adding an additional $0.02 per share.","As Eric mentioned, performance from the same-store portfolio was in line with expectations, as same-store NOI grew 4.6% for the quarter, based on 4% growth in revenues and 3.3% growth in operating expenses. Continued rent growth and strong occupancy levels drove revenue performance, with real estate taxes being the primary area of the expense pressure for the quarter, as we continue to see increases in key states such as Texas and Florida. The real estate tax expense for the third quarter grew 13.5% over the prior year, based on the 7.5% to 8% growth rate projected for the full year this year, combined with the impact of a tough comparison of last year's 2.5% growth in the third quarter.","Year-to-date same-store NOI increased 5.9% based on 4.4% revenue growth and 2.3% growth in operating expenses. We closed no acquisitions during the third quarter but following quarter end, we acquired one additional new community located in Fredericksburg, Virginia, a 251-unit Haven at Celebrate, which will be operated as Phase 2 of Seasons at Celebrate, one of our existing communities purchased in 2011.","Following this transaction and the gross purchase price of acquisitions year-to-date is $148.8 million including the 2 communities purchased from MAA's joint venture fund. We also sold 4 communities during the third quarter for total growth proceeds of $46.9 million and one additional community following quarter end for $10.4 million in proceeds. These transactions bring year-to-date sales proceeds at just over $131 million from 9 communities averaging 26 years of age and representing a weighted average cap rate of 7.2% based on in-place NOI after deducting a 4% management fee and $350 per unit in CapEx reserves.","With these combined sales for the year, MAA exited 5 Secondary Markets segment, including Melbourne, Florida and Athens, Thomasville, Lagrange and Valdosta, Georgia. Progress on the company's lease-up and development pipeline continued during the third quarter, with one community, Cool Springs in Nashville, fully stabilizing. And with the 3 remaining completed communities all achieving over 90% occupancy during the quarter and projected to be fully stabilized in the fourth quarter, which we defined as greater than 90% occupancy for 90 days.","We now have 2 MAA communities remaining under construction, with an expected total cost of $74 million for 564 units. We funded an additional $5.3 million in construction cost for these communities during the third quarter.","With the Colonial merger, we also acquired 4 additional communities under construction. The total construction pipeline now consist of 1,731 units and 6 communities, with a total expected development cost of $236.5 million, of which $93 million remains to be funded. We do expect to find an additional $28 million on multi-family construction during the fourth quarter.","We completed a renewal of the company's unsecured revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter. We improved the terms and increased the borrowing capacity to $500 million, with the option to expand it to $800 million, and extended the maturity by almost 2 years to late 2017. This expansion was an integral part of our plans to complete the Colonial merger and to support the larger company scale in the future.","Also, following the end of the quarter and the closing of the Colonial merger, we completed our planned inaugural unsecured bond offering. We are very pleased with the market perception. We are able to execute a very successful financing, despite a volatile market backdrop. We issued $350 million of public bonds with a 4.3% coupon price at 99.047% of principal, and we settled at $150 million in forward interest rate swaps we had earlier this year, as part of the planned financing. Effective interest cost of the financing is 4.15% over the next 10 years, and the proceeds were used to pay off all of the borrowings on a revolving credit facility.","Our balance sheet ended the quarter in great position. The company leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 40.8%. Total leverage was 6x recurring EBITDA, and MAA's fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as recurring EBITDA to interest expense was 4.7x. With the closing of the merger and completion of the bond deal on October, MAA's balance sheet further strengthened. Our leverage levels remained essentially the same, but unsecured debt, unencumbered assets and fixed rate protection all increased. And at the end of October, over 60% of MAA's assets were unencumbered. Secured debt was less than 25% of gross assets, and 98% of outstanding debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates, with an average maturity of 4.8 years.","Finally, we're providing updated guidance for the fourth quarter reflecting combined company results. And the full year performance for the company will be comprised of 9 months of MAA stand-alone activity and 3 months of combined activity for the fourth quarter. There will be a good bit of noise in reported earnings for the fourth quarter, so we're giving guidance on a core FFO basis, which excludes merger-related and certain other items with the goal of providing more clarity and comparability to prior periods. Also, we've added a fair amount of detail on our supplemental data schedules with the press release to help model a combined company performance.","Core FFO for the fourth quarter is projected to be $1.09 to $1.19 per share, which is $1.14 at the midpoint. Based on average shares of about $79.3 million following the merger. This is $0.06 per share below previous stand-alone guidance, which is in line with our expectations for the combined company, given the nonproductive development pipeline and the land bank acquired from Colonial, as well as the remaining synergies to be captured at the next 15 to 18 months. Full year core FFO is projected to be $4.81 to $4.91 per share, which is $4.86 at the midpoint.","We're maintaining the midpoint of full year NOI guidance for the legacy MAA same store portfolio at 5% based on revenue growth of 4% to 4.5% and expense growth of 3% to 3.5%. We expect the legacy Colonial portfolio to produce revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 3 1\/4% to 3 3\/4%, which would equate to a full year revenue growth of 4 1\/4% to 4 3\/4%, which is within previous guidance ranges provided. NOI is projected to grow 2.5% to 3% for the fourth quarter, mainly due to operating expense growth of 4.75% to 5.25%, primarily related to pressure from real estate taxes.","We now expect acquisition volume to be $175 million to $225 million for the year, and disposition volume to be $131 million, which is the current year-to-date total, as the remaining disposition plan for the year is now expected to close in early 2014. We expect G&A and Property Management expenses combined for the fourth quarter to be $14.5 million to $15.5 million, excluding merger and transition cost, which reflects about half of the expected synergy capture on a run-rate basis for the year.","Total combined transaction cost related to the merger are still expected to be about $60 million in total, with around half projected to be incurred during the fourth quarter.","Also, we expect to record a mark-to-market adjustment related to the assumption of the Colonial debt balances of around $90 million, which will be amortized over the remaining life of Colonial's outstanding debt, or about 4 years, and will be excluded from the calculation of core FFO.","AFFO for the full year, defined as core FFO less recurring capital expenditures, is projected to be $4.20 to $4.30 per share, and our current annual dividend rate is $2.78 per share.","That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Stephanie, we'll turn it over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Thank you for the color in terms of the Colonial portfolio as of the third quarter. I was just curious if you could provide some more color in terms of your top 4 pro forma markets and how Colonial's assets performed relative to MAA's legacy assets in the third quarter.","Thomas L. Grimes","Sure, Ryan. It's Tom Grimes. They're probably tough markets for Austin, Charleston, Atlanta and Dallas. And they did well in those markets, Austin was 7 2, Charleston 7 1, Atlanta 6 8 and Dallas about 6 3.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. And that was on a revenue or NOI?","Thomas L. Grimes","That's on a revenue basis.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. And then I guess in terms of the guidance for Colonial going to the fourth quarter it does seem to be substantial deceleration on the revenue front. Is there any particular markets that might be driving that into the fourth quarter here, given that occupancy is relatively high?","Albert M. Campbell","Well, first, let me just address that the deceleration that Tom gives some color on the markets, but if you look at the full year as a whole, I think both Colonial and -- and we have projected continued growing revenues with some slight moderation in the fourth quarter. So, I mean, I think if you look at the guidance, the midpoint of the fourth quarter revenue is 3.5%, which is slight moderation, but pretty strong still. And so, I'll let Tom give color on where that's going to come from.","Thomas L. Grimes","Just on an overall basis, the portfolio is 95 5, with just 8% exposure, which is vacancy plus unnoticed, and traffic is strong. So we sort of feel like the portfolio as a whole, both Colonial and MAA, well positioned for the fourth quarter and pricing for 2014.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. Got it. And then just in terms of your asset sales that you've completed since the end of the second quarter. Can you give us pricing on those assets in particular, instead of just the pool to date and how that pricing came in relative to your expectations?","Albert M. Campbell","Yes, this is Al. We sold the 4 assets. And I think they came in all pretty close to expectations. And we've been working those for quite a while. We sold Marsh Oaks in Jacksonville for $7.1 million, Three Oaks in Valdosta for -- right at $12 million. Wildwood in Thomasville, Georgia, for just short of $13 million and Shenandoah Ridge in Augusta, Georgia, for $15 million.","H. Eric Bolton","I'd put the cap rate on those somewhere around 7.5 or on a blended basis for all 4 of those.","Albert M. Campbell","That's right, for average 30-year-old assets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Macquarie.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Al, can you just help a little greater detail, sort of reconcile those sort of $1.25 core FFO in the third quarter down to the $1.14 midpoint of the fourth quarter. I assume that there's some seasonality. There's probably some dilution from the merger. And then what else sort of feeds in to the decline on a sequential basis?","Albert M. Campbell","Yes. Great question, Rob. First of all, let me say that the majority of outperformance in the third quarter was sort of onetime items. It was the quick lease up on development that got there faster than expected, but the overall run rate is what we expected. So that's sort of a onetime kick. And then the interest expense was sort of onetime kick of its timing of the bond that we ultimately did it, we just did it a little later than we thought we would, so had some savings in the third quarter.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","How much was that combined you think?","Albert M. Campbell","$0.04, those -- $0.02 a piece so that's about it. So that was really -- we had $1.21 was our guidance, our midpoint for the third quarter. So that really provided that addition. So if you look at what we gave as guidance originally for the fourth quarter, it was $1.20 per share, Rob. And so now we're at $1.14, I'll tell you that virtually all of that is the Colonial merger. And really, what that is, as expected, you've got continued synergies that we're going to capture. We did state $25 million. We feel confident in that. We captured, I think in the fourth quarter we expect to capture about half of that on a run-rate basis as we'll start to see workforce reduction, systems changes things like that, but we'll still have [indiscernible] to capture over the year. Obviously, we acquired the development pipeline, which we paid over $100 million for and is not yet productive. We expect to make that productive and as we sell non-core assets or land bank over the next couple of years, that will be productive. So the point I'm making is $0.06 dilution in the fourth quarter is the widest range that you'll see, and we would expect to see that narrow each quarter as we continue to work through those plans.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Does the Colonial portfolio go into the same-store immediately?","Albert M. Campbell","No, we'll probably -- we'd obviously be reporting combined results. But technically, we'll not go into same store because we defined our same-store for our SEC reporting. So what you'll see us do is call it consolidated results and have some language actually work through that, but we will, on a technical basis, have to keep it out of same-store, but we'll give you the information to help you see it combined and separate life cycle.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","So the same-store going forward, until what, a year from now until the fourth quarter?","Albert M. Campbell","Yes.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Will wind up being the MAA legacy portfolio?","Albert M. Campbell","Yes, that's right. But for modeling purposes, we're going to give you plenty, Rob, to help you [indiscernible] if you wanted.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","And then can you talk about how the revenue expense and NOI guidance you guys are given for the Colonial same-store portfolio differs from the legacy MAA portfolio in the fourth quarter? Are those ranges fairly consistent with the MAA? Or are you doing better in the MAA's on expenses and revenue? Can you sort of provide some color there?","Albert M. Campbell","I would say it's pretty close and the 2 -- the main stories are: One, slight moderation of revenue that we had predicted the same for the full year. And the real story is though expenses. It's taxes where we both had a strong, tough tax number in the back half of the year as we had growing expenses that continued to grow as we move through the year and got sort of bad news on taxes and we both had sort of favorable comparisons, favorable situations last year that would create a tough comparison this year. So stories from both are both very similar. Revenue is about as expected. Slight moderation fourth quarter but very bad tax expansion for the quarter.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","And then, are you guys planning on starting in the development spend guidance, is there any new starts there in the near-term?","H. Eric Bolton","Rob, this is Eric. Nothing near term that we're planning to do at this point. We're focused on getting productive the pipeline that we've got right now. There's one development site that Colonial has down in Orlando that we're taking a hard look at and thinking about if we want to do anything on that next year. But frankly, the other development sites, we're all looking to sell them at this point.","Robert Stevenson - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then what's -- on the current pipeline, what's the expected stabilized yield on a combined company development pipeline?","Albert M. Campbell","It's pretty similar. We've always stated, we said 7% to 8% range, Rob, we feel comfortable of that on the combined pipeline.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Toti with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","This is Gaurav Mehta with David as well. A couple of questions on your guidance. So you talked seeing real estate expense pressure, but at the same time, your -- the insurance expense guidance have been lowered a couple of times this year. Can you talk about what's offsetting real estate taxes?","Albert M. Campbell","Yes. I mean the other items and everything, personnel, the big items in our, obviously, the strongest contributor are personnel, repair, maintenance, utilities and all those. And we expect those to be modest growth and not significant pressure. It's all a pressure from taxes.","H. Eric Bolton","We've also done some -- moving more and more of our leasing online and do a lot more sourcing of traffic online so our marketing costs are coming down. And frankly, as Al said, to really offset some of the pressure on real estate taxes, it's been really across the board from personnel all the way down to landscaping, trend and utilities have been positive as well.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Great. Second question I have is on the synergies. So you talked about $25 million in expected overhead savings. And then you also said that you expect additional savings from efficiency. Are you going to quantify that at all how much you're expecting?","Albert M. Campbell","The second portion -- Gaurav, help me on the second portion of that question, savings from what on the second portion? I didn't get that.","Gaurav Mehta - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","So you also talked about that you expect additional savings in addition to $25 million. Are you able to talk about that? Are you able to quantify how much you're expecting?","Albert M. Campbell","I'll tell you, we'll have a lot more to say about that when we put out our '14 guidance. Honestly it's in the NOI area, we're in the process of renegotiating a lot of contracts from property and cash to insurance to buying paint to buying appliances. And so all that work is underway at the moment. And as we cobble together our '14 guidance and finalize our budgets, we'll have a lot more to say about the opportunities beyond the $25 million that we've talked about.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just going back to the acquisition. Now that the deal is now complete, could you talk a little bit about versus when you initially underwrote the deal and when you've closed, if there were any material changes and ran expectations or anything of that sort?","H. Eric Bolton","No. I'll tell you, Tayo, not really. We knew the company pretty well. And probably the only thing that was different than when we started the conversations earlier in the year was the fact that they continued to sell off some of their commercial assets, and -- sold One Ravinia, which is roughly a $90 million office project in Atlanta and we continued to -- they've been very focused on continuing to get focused solely on the multifamily assets. And so we -- they sold a few more commercial assets than when we started conversations. But as far as the multifamily assets and balance sheet in general, there really was no surprises in terms of what we found or the underwriting that we assumed and how we ultimately closed the transaction.","Albert M. Campbell","I'll just add to that. On the assets, they did sell, Tannehill in Birmingham, which was addition to what you guys have seen from the third -- from the second quarter report. So I'll just continue the progress that Eric has mentioned. So the revenues combined company are well less than 2% from commercial now.","H. Eric Bolton","And I'll add. I mean we're continuing that effort. Virtually every commercial asset that they owned is in the market right now for disposition.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, and that's helpful. And then in some of the Southeast markets where in a combined basis, you guys really are particularly large. Any thoughts on maybe the exposure in those markets, a little bit too heavy and probably rationalizing from a bad exposure?","H. Eric Bolton","We're going to be looking at that as part of our '14 plans. I mean we're pretty big in Dallas at this point, a little over 10% of the portfolio. Charlotte is a big market for us. And my guess is that you -- there will be some recycling going on next year as we continue to move out of lower margin investments into higher-margin investments. But yes, we're certainly sensitive to the weightings that we have in various markets now. And we generally like to not be much more than 10% in any given market. And so if there was a market to be heavy in, Dallas and Austin are not balance to be heavy in, but we'll look to probably cycle a little bit there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So just want to understand by what you mean half of the synergies of the $25 million getting reflected in the fourth quarter. Do you mean -- you don't mean $12.5 million? Do you mean the run rate of $25 million? Half of that, right?","Albert M. Campbell","$3 million to $3.5 million, Rich, exactly right. That's a run rate basis that will be half.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I figured that. I just wanted to make sure. And from the standpoint of other savings to an earlier question about renegotiating contracts and that type of stuff. Are you expecting any of that to hit in the fourth quarter?","Albert M. Campbell","There will be a little bit of it as we started. I'll give you one example, as our property-casualty insurance, we expect significant savings next year as we redo the whole portfolio. By the end of the third quarter we did bring them on to the same platform, and we'll get somewhere $0.005 to $0.01 from that. So there's beginning to already be some impact from that. I think it will be much larger next year as we [indiscernible].","H. Eric Bolton","And Rich, I'll tell you, there's really 2 areas that we're working to sort of finalize and monetize our forecast. One is just the NOI area that Al is referring to, which includes property and cash and all the other things I was mentioning earlier. The second area of opportunity is in the area of sort of redevelopment opportunity within the portfolio. As you know, we've had a fairly active sort of interior redevelopment initiative within our operation and Colonial has not. And as we've now visited almost every property, we see some meaningful opportunity there. And so we'll be moving that program into the Colonial portfolio, and we think that that's going to be some real opportunity over the next several years frankly. But exactly, the impact for next year will have, as I say, a lot more to say about that here when we release Q4 earnings.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","If we were just to take a shot at modeling this, so let's just say $25 million of overhead synergies, a G&A-type number and then another, I'm just using a number, $25 million of other savings. If you have $50 million of total savings, how much of that $50 million would be a sort of a same-store impact, and how much would be outside of that?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, let me say it this way, Rich. I mean I wouldn't -- we're totally not in a position to say we're going to have a $25 million additional on top of that. But let me just say this, if you take the additional NOI you're just talking about, the potential redevelopment opportunities and also the additional income we're going to expect to pick up from leasing up the development pipeline that's not earning right now and from the recycling assets over the next several years, there's -- we think $0.30 to $0.45 per share opportunity in all of those things combined. We haven't yet -- we're not yet ready to break out the components and talk specifics. We'll give you a lot more color in Q4 as we release our...","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","$0.35 to $0.40 of total savings including the $25 million?","H. Eric Bolton","Yes, we're not -- that's leasing up the development pipeline, monetizing the assets and all, and the NOI additions and the real -- that program, all of that together but, yes.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Got you. So it's some revenue, some cost savings. In terms of supply, Eric, you mentioned the supply potentially being a headwind for you in your primary markets next year. I mean, wouldn't that also be a significant problem for where the CLP portfolio is situated, that supply would be an issue, even maybe more so with them than they would from the legacy MAA portfolio?","H. Eric Bolton","Yes. I mean, clearly, Colonial has a bigger presence in larger markets but let me give you some perspective on this. When we talk about supply pressure, of course, it's pressure only to the extent that there's not jobs there to absorb the supply. And we use these jobs to supply a ratio as sort of a barometer to make an assessment of how weak or how strong the market's going to be and how much pressure you're going to get from supply. And you look at the large markets segment of the portfolio, both on a combined basis, the ratio of job growth to supply trends -- and this is using economy.com and Reis and maybe all the same services that everybody uses. So these are not our numbers, but the ratio in the large markets segment this year is 8:1. Next year, in the large markets segment, it's 8.5:1. And so it's hard to get anxious about a real supply problem at this point, assuming -- this is an important assumption, assuming that we continue to get steady job growth. And so the idea that the large markets are headed for some sort of cliff, I think is a tremendous overstatement. I think that some moderation is to be expected, and of course, it varies a bit by market. But in aggregate, the ratios are pretty comparable next year to where we are this year. I think what's more important to also recognize is the secondary market component is different, and that's why we have this component in our portfolio because these segments of the -- the other portfolio of these markets don't get the supply pressure. These markets though are also very dependent on job growth, they don't get a lot of supply, but they need job growth to get -- to absorb what little supply they do get. If you look at the secondary markets this year, that ratio in 2013 is about 6:1. Next year, it's going to jump to over 10:1. And so, again, it's hard to -- we think the secondary markets are going to be -- do exactly what they're supposed to do as we get into '14 and '15.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","But, I mean, of those 6 or 10 jobs, how many of them are really career-oriented jobs, and how many are crossing guards?","H. Eric Bolton","So, I mean, in places like Charleston, it's Boeing. In places like Chattanooga, it's Volkswagen. In Savannah, it's Gulfstream and General Dynamics. I mean, these secondary Sun Belt markets have envious quality manufacturing jobs coming to them. I don't think we have any crossing guards, I'm not sure.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Just 2 quick final ones. Commercial sales, what's the -- what do you -- I should know this but just the value of that -- I know it's relatively small, and what you're thinking cap rates might be from out of the commercial, Colonial's commercial portfolio?","Albert M. Campbell","I'm going to tell you, just first, Rich, as I mentioned they had progress in Tannehill for a potential $40 million in the third quarter. The other major projects, the Brookwood in Birmingham, the mall and the office, and the Norlock [ph], the project in Covington, Louisiana. Those are 2 major ones. And so I think cap rates are in that -- just over 8, somewhere in that range, I think, is what we would expect.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And dollar value?","Albert M. Campbell","Dollar value, those 3 projects together, you're probably talking $120 million range.","H. Eric Bolton","Yes. I was going to say that the total value for the operating commercial assets is $100 million to $120 million, excluding Tannehill, is where we have it.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then lastly, do you still look at $60 million of merger-related costs in the fourth quarter?","H. Eric Bolton","We do. We stated that originally. We still feel like that's the right number. Well, it's obviously composed of legal and advisory. It's composed of debt cost, debt assumption costs, and all those things, we still feel good about that number. And let me follow-up on the synergy question you had earlier, Rich, just to make sure you understood. The $0.30 to $0.45 that I mentioned was above the stated $25 million in synergies that we talked about. That's additional earnings from those areas.","Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. You said $0.30 to $0.45 of incremental over and above the $25 million of overhead savings.","H. Eric Bolton","Right. Perhaps over the next years as we work through that plan, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I appreciate a lot of color surrounding the merger. I know you can't talk about a lot of the items, and are waiting to provide more detail in January. But can you help me understand on the land portion, what you're selling today in the marketplace? Who's the bidder in Sun Belt in terms of the land parcel today, how the initial conversations are going? And any round numbers you can provide about to what the pricing expectations are?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, I mean, there's the total land bank of -- we've got the value roughly around $90 million. About $30 million of it's multifamily, and about $60 million of it is office retail, various outparcels, some single-family. And we've got a vast majority of each of these parcels in the market at the moment. And pricing is -- it may follow the board. But I mean, broadly speaking, it's all coming in line with -- as you can imagine, did a lot of work in valuing this stuff before we did the merger. And so, we'll have, again, a lot more to say about it, but I think that the $90 million roughly a value that we ascribe to this portfolio, this land bank, we feel very confident that we'll be able to get that monetized.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And there's been no mark taken against it so far suggesting that there's just nothing but upside right here? There's going to be gains to be reported on these parcels, no impairments?","H. Eric Bolton","No, that number I gave you is the marked number.","Albert M. Campbell","Yes. I mean, understand the process, Haendel. This is Al. That what we will do is go by the process of recording these assets, what we believe is fair market value on October 1. So if everything worked out right, we'd sell it exactly for that. Hopefully, we can have some addition, but that's how we approach it. It should be fair market value on initial recording.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got you. Okay. And curious on the recent acquisition in Fredericksburg, was it opportunistic? Did the developer come to you? And are you seeing any more anxious sellers in some of your Sun Belt markets today?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, the developer built the adjacent phase that we acquired back in 2011. And so, we had talked to him about this for some time, starting back in 2011. So, it wasn't really marketed. We, all along, had plans to buy this from him. We just wanted to give it to a certain lead status before we took it on. But in answer to your other question, yes. I think that as we begin to see some of these projects come online increasingly in 2014 and 2015, I believe there is going to be some great buying opportunities emerge out of this. We're in conversations currently with several developers on deals that they are either just starting or they are well into construction. And with talk now of more supply coming into the marketplace, we'll find developers who are increasingly wanting to talk about going ahead and doing some sort of a pre-purchase contract, which more or less allows them to get the risk off the table. And on a non-marketed basis, we're able to come in and offer them an exit, and we feel like bringing brand-new assets on the portfolio at pretty attractive pricing.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Appreciate that. And one last one. Earlier this week, we heard, maybe it was last week, one of your peers identified Austin and Raleigh specifically as higher risk markets for next year. I would love to get your assessment on these 2 markets over the near team, given that they're now top-five markets within the pro forma portfolio.","H. Eric Bolton","We like Austin and Raleigh. We certainly wouldn't categorize them as high risk but I think they're moving from fabulous to pretty darn good. Austin, this year, had 3 jobs for every 1 unit, and it will be about the same in 4 -- but it's also got, in '14, excuse me, it's got 4% job growth coming on. We feel like we won't be able to do double-digit rent growth there anymore, but it will still be stable for us. And then, Raleigh's sort of the same. It was 2:1 this year, and it's going to bump up to 6:1. It will be a little more stable but it's held -- both of them have held good rent growth so far. So they -- I think they'll back off from white-hot to just solid good high growth markets.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And one last follow-up, if I could. Earlier, in response to a question, you mentioned rationalizing your portfolio in certain markets. The use of the proceeds -- so I presume that they will be to largely fund redevelopment, some of those redevelopment opportunities within the Colonial portfolio you talked about, or can you give us some thoughts on what the capital would be used for?","H. Eric Bolton","So it's a combination of just wherever the best opportunity is at that time. And certainly, the redevelopment opportunity's very accretive, and very accretive uses of capital, and we definitely expect that, that will be a big component of it. But as I was talking a moment ago, we are also believing and optimistic that we're going to see some great external growth, new acquisition opportunities that will be compelling as well. But we'll take a hard look at whatever the best capital deployment decision is at that time it may very well be just to continue to strengthen the balance sheet in some way, whether that is -- depending on where we're being priced in the public markets, and depending on sort of where we feel very good about where our leverage level is at this point. But we're committed to keeping the balance sheet very strong. So it's hard to -- I mean, we'll, again, have a lot more to say about planned capital deployment for 2014 as we get our forecast together but there will be -- I'm sure we'll be able to put the recycled capital work in an effective manner.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And stock repurchase will be on that menu of consideration as well?","H. Eric Bolton","If it makes sense.","Operator","And our next question comes from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask first about the MAA legacy portfolio. You said the performance in that portfolio was generally in line with your expectations in the third quarter. So can you just talk about what you saw coming in the fourth quarter that made you lower your same-store revenue growth midpoint by 25 basis points?","Albert M. Campbell","Yes, I mean, I think we just saw -- at the beginning of the year, we've put the guidance out, saying that we would see a modest decline of revenues in the back part of the year, we saw that. But we also saw a decline in the expenses offsetting that, Karin, so I'm going to think we would say NOI growth at the midpoint is exactly the same, and we just took the top end of the range down a bit it on the revenues and then, the same on the expenses.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can you just give us some color on what you saw trend-wise in October from a rent standpoint?","H. Eric Bolton","Sure. For the consolidated company, the rents -- the asking rents were up about 5%. And then, does that answer your question?","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes, and how did they trend from, say, August, September into October?","H. Eric Bolton","We don't have combined numbers on that in terms of the both companies together but...","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just the MAA legacy is fine, if you can give us that.","H. Eric Bolton","Yes, no problem. MAA legacy on the trend basis was -- bear with me just a second, I've got it.","I think broadly speaking, our rent growth has been in that 4% to 5% range, which is in line with the revenue guidance that we gave for the year. I mean, this year for the most part, our revenue result was all driven by rent growth, and so we've been seeing 4% to 5% sort of rent growth throughout the course of the year. And as Tom just mentioned, I mean, asking rents in October were up 5% year-over-year, now that's on a consolidated portfolio. I would expect the MAA component of that to still be in kind of that...","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Around the same range?","H. Eric Bolton","Right around the 5% range as well.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Next question's just on Colonial. What quarter do you guys think that $0.06 dilution number that you have in 4Q, when do you think that will turn positive next year?","H. Eric Bolton","I'd say, Karin, it's really hard to say because it's a function of not only getting the sort of the NOI opportunity fully captured, but it's recycling capital. So it's selling properties and it's buying properties, and absolutely timing those transactions and telling when that's going to happen is hard to say. We think that the synergy component will be fully realized by the end of next year. We think that the opportunities surrounding the recycling of capital is a function of the transaction markets and it's really hard to predict that, it could be a 12 to 24-month period of time, it's just really, really hard to say. I will say this though, that the $0.06 of dilution goes down from here on a per quarter basis because we are realizing opportunity every quarter. And so, this quarter is the biggest gap we have in terms of dilution and as a result of the nonproductive assets and the development pipeline. As we continue to lease-up the pipeline, it all starts to become more productive every day. And exactly when it turns positive, it's hard to say. But, again, we'll have a lot more clarity on that as we put out our plans for '14.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Eric, I think you said when you announced the merger that you thought that Colonial would have better growth than the MAA legacy portfolio next year. Now that you've gotten to know the portfolio a little bit better from here, do you still believe that, that'll be the case?","H. Eric Bolton","I believe that the markets that Colonial brings to the portfolio tend to be higher job growth markets on a balanced basis. They are a little bit more exposed to supply because they are the large markets. But as we've said all along, I mean, our whole approach is built around the idea of trying to establish a, what we refer to as a full cycle performance profile. You may call it a balanced profile, but we think it's appropriate to weigh capital in large markets where you perhaps have a little bit more exposure to supply, but you also get the benefits of more robust job growth. And I allocate a portion of capital to secondary markets where you're not as exposed to supply but you're more dependent on job growth. And so, we're trying to weigh both sides of the equation a little bit in an effort to create this full cycle profile. Now, having said that, Colonial brings a ratio of sort of large to secondary, moves up from about 55, 45, large, 45, secondary, that is based on legacy MAA to now roughly around 60-40 large as a result of the -- 60% large and 40% secondary, as a result of this combination. And so we think that on balance, we are a little bit more exposed to higher growth markets as a consequence of the merger, and we're glad of it.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And last question for me is what are you guys thinking in terms of property taxes for next year? Do you think that you'll still be under pressure from a lot of your municipalities, or do you think that will start to ease in 2014?","Albert M. Campbell","I think -- this is Al. I think you'd see a little bit of easing -- I mean, I think the important thing is to look at taxes over the long term. In the last 6 years, it's [indiscernible] this year, let's call it 8% growth. They've grown 6 years, 2%. And so I think, definitely, over a long term, a more modest growth pattern will definitely -- we would expect that we're at the peak of the pressure. So we're not yet ready to put out guidance for next year, but we believe we'll see some moderation next year and we'll put more color on that in the next year.","H. Eric Bolton","It won't be 8%.","Albert M. Campbell","We don't expect it to be 8%. That's what -- so we'll put that out next quarter but you should see some moderation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paula Poskon from Robert W. Baird.","Paula J. Poskon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Eric, what exactly is left to do in terms of integrating either the people, the systems, the reporting structure, et cetera?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, the people portion is done. That's -- we've completed that. But one of the big steps we've got left to do is integrate the property management systems. They were on Yardi. We're on MRI. We'll be converting to Yardi on the first half of next year. We've got some consolidation to do on the AP system, the accounting and general ledger system. So a fair amount of systems work left to be done over the next 6 to 9 months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Salinsky with RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Eric, bigger picture question, if you look at '14 -- I mean, when you look at '14, '15 and '16, how much of the Colonial portfolio would you say is core versus kind of order assets kind of don't fit the MAA definition there? And going forward, how should we think about recycling of apartment capital over the next couple of years given the 133 that you've done -- 131 you've finished the year-to-date.","H. Eric Bolton","I would tell you that it's all core in a sense that it's markets that we want to be in. There's really no market exposure that we're being introduced to as a result of this merger that we don't feel good about. Having said that, our recycling plan is really predicated on, as it has been for MAA for a while now, rotating capital out of lower after CapEx margin investments into higher CapEx margin investments. And so I would tell you that a reasonable run rate for us is going to be around $150 million to $200 million of recycling going on every year just to ensure we're continuing to refresh the portfolio with higher margin investment. '14 will be a year that we'll be taking a look at things because as you know, we also have a fair amount of recycling that we're committed to doing in terms of commercial assets as well. And we're putting a high priority on rotating out of these commercial assets, and that there's dilution associated with that. But I would tell you that there's nothing non-core that comes from this, and really, for us, it's just going to be cycling just as a discipline, lower margin investments to higher margin investments. And now, we put that number at $150 million to $200 million.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. Second question. Within the Colonial portfolio specifically, relative to when the transaction was announced to where you stand today, how much turnover at the property level have you seen in terms of personnel?","Thomas L. Grimes","Mike, it's Tom. I mean, virtually none. We had, really, the advantage of being able to work with those property teams and then, we'll go forward multisite team. We started talking to them as early in June, and we had the multisite team combine from both companies by mid-July, and we were meeting and visiting properties on a regular basis by August. So, frankly, because of that great cooperation we had out of Birmingham, we were able to communicate with folks we have not had any material turnover that was merger-related on either side of the fence. We've got a great team going forward.","H. Eric Bolton","Other than what we had planned for, I mean, we made some changes at the multisite level but that was all done early on.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just given your comments then on supply starting to taper a little bit next year in your small markets, and then being pretty comfortable in your larger markets, is there any -- how do you think about development starts -- new development starts realizing those wouldn't be until like -- until '16, probably, at the earliest, in '14?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, I would tell you that we continue to believe in our model, which is not being a big developer. Having said that, we will do perhaps a little bit, sort of order of magnitude, $150 million, maybe $200 million. But again, our model is more built around the notion of outsourcing the risk and the operation where essentially we enter into pre-purchase transactions for something that is being built by a developer that we've got a lot of confidence in. I would tell you that what we would probably be targeting mostly would be some of these more high-growth, vibrant secondary markets for that sort of activity. I've often thought about -- I mean, the idea of building in Dallas or building in Atlanta, I kind of step back and say, \"Why?\" I mean, let others do that. Because there's plenty of it that happens and I'd rather just be an opportunistic buyer in those markets. But take a market like Charleston as an example, where we did a pre-purchase development deal like I just described here, and we just got most of the units this quarter, and the darn thing's already 86% leased. So, I mean, it's unbelievable in some of these stronger secondary markets, what you can do because there's just not that much supplied. So, that probably would be where we would target what limited development we did do, is in some of these vibrant secondary markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Then, just finally, in terms of the market, I mean, your revenue growth, you reduced a little bit. You're seeing pressure in real estate taxes. What are you seeing in terms of asset pricing right now? Have you seen any moderation in cap rates in the last 90 to 120 days, or is it holding pretty firm there?","H. Eric Bolton","It's holding firm, Mike. We saw a little bit of noise back about 3 months ago when there was some talk about -- the Fed was suggesting that they were going to start to pull back a little bit, but the market quickly sort of got past that, and I can tell you, I mean, we're still seeing in our large markets transactions based on our underwriting trading anywhere from just under 5 to 5.5 all day long, and we're seeing transactions in secondary markets in 5.25 and 5.75 range, for high quality newer assets that we're interested in buying. So we haven't really seen a lot of change.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons.","Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Can you share the number of units you actually purchased from Colonial? I know it has the same store count in the supplement, but what's the total number that's not in development?","Albert M. Campbell","Just over 34,000. We could dig the exact numbers. Stabilized operating units were 34,147 and leased up, 252. So total operating were 34,399, and there was 1,167 in development.","Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","And then I just want to make sure I understand this right. Your projected amortization of debt, market to market, that will be included in FFO but excluded from core FFO. Is that right?","Albert M. Campbell","Yes, it will be excluded from core FFO. We're going to -- we plan to provide guidance on core FFO, Carol, because we think that's a clearer picture but reported FFO, we'll have it in there, in the part of the NAREIT definition, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Can you share your observations so far on Colonial's use of LRO, and how it might differ from how you use it, and whether or not there's any revenue growth upside based solely on that transition?","Thomas L. Grimes","Yes. I mean, obviously, they used the same system. We do, do it. We -- you operated differently, Dave. And yes, there is -- we feel like some upside on it. We tend to set some base parameters out there on what range LRO can operate in and then let it optimize asset by asset and really get it down to working on individual floor plans and individual units. Colonial tended to take a -- make that band a little tighter and force it up at certain times, which tended to dictate prices more centrally than letting the system optimize. I mean, they used it well. We just see some opportunity in tweaking that.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","So, Tom, how could we quantify that? Do you have a view as to where their rents are versus where you think they could be?","Thomas L. Grimes","I think we've got to spend a little more time diving into the system on that before I'd be comfortable saying it's worth a percentage point of rent growth or something like that.","H. Eric Bolton","Dave, I would tell you, I mean, if you look at sort of June 30 numbers, average rent and average revenue in our portfolio was a little bit higher than the Colonial portfolio when you consider the fact that they've got a higher concentration of larger markets, you would think it would be the opposite. So I would tell you that we think that there is definitely some opportunity there, and we just -- we're not ready to quantify just yet, but we're -- it's there.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Next question is, can you please reconcile the outlook, I think, that you shared on potential operating expense synergies, outside of, of course, G&A and property management expense, reconcile that with the what I think was 10% expense growth in 3Q and 5% expense growth in 4Q for the Colonial portfolio.","Albert M. Campbell","Dave, this is Al. I'm trying -- let me make sure I understand your question. Are you saying -- you're trying to get a better picture of the fourth quarter and where that change is coming from in terms of run rate? Let me make sure I understand what you're asking.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Sure, Al. So, earlier in the call, you seem to suggest that there are other operating expense savings opportunities beyond the $25 million of G&A and property management expense savings that you expect. Please correct me if I'm wrong on that, but I thought you said that. But then we see Colonial expense growth up more than 10% in the third quarter and up 5% in the fourth quarter, so maybe it's really a margin question, what are the margins in the Colonial portfolio today and where do you think they will come out at?","Albert M. Campbell","Well, let me first -- I think what we were discussing in the first part of that was potential NOI savings above the $25 million sort of overhead savings. I think the difference there Dave, that will come over a long period of time. I mean, that's not really fourth quarter, that's more next year even into some of the following year. And so that's a longer-term picture. And talking about the fourth quarter, I think what I was trying to communicate, and I probably didn't a good job on that, was that the main pressure is taxes for both our portfolio and their portfolio in the fourth quarter. We're having about 10% increase, same for both. Both because you've seen a 7% to 8% increase in the current year growth rate, and both had sort of a tough comparison last year because we were reducing accruals up in the last year because things came in more favorable. It sort of was -- a lot of municipalities kicked the can down the road on the growth. So that, and so the other -- and what I was trying to say was the other areas of operating expenses: personnel, repair and maintenance, utilities, all of -- landscapes, those things, they are more moderate and so, they are not really causing a pressure, 5% in total. Real estate taxes is the main point of growth.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And just to ask it a slightly different way, I think you said that COP's expense growth in the second half of the year is roughly 7.5%. I think that, that's above their original plan. Why did that occur, and what portion of these higher expenses are going to continue going forward?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, what I would tell you, Dave, is -- what I was commenting on, or I think I've said something about in my prepared comments, some of the pressure in the third quarter, the 10.3 in the Colonial portfolio, was a result of some onetime leasing incentives and some accrual catch-ups and some other things that we booked as part of the merger close and some things that they've put in place sort of after they announced in early June that this transaction was going to occur. And as you may recall, the Colonial occupancy really fell off at the end of the second quarter. We felt it was important to get it back before we got into the winter. So there were some onetime things done in the third quarter in an effort to address those issues and those concerns. On top of that, we had the expense pressure associated with real estate taxes, as Al was mentioning. Now, as we get into the fourth quarter, we see real estate taxes still being a little bit of a pressure point, for the reasons that Al mentioned, we're comparing against the prior year number, that's very, very difficult. But those onetime sort of leasing incentives and other things that were done in Q3 will not repeat themselves in Q4. And so, we'll expect to see same-store expense in Q4 in a year-over-year basis moderate back down into that 5% range or so off of the 10% that we had in Q3. The other part of your question surrounding expense savings that comes from renegotiating contracts and all the other things that we're going to be doing that affect NOI, that's all stuff that we'll get into next year. And that's something totally different. And so, I think that -- it's just Colonial's Q3 expense result was unusual because of the company effectively was merging with us, and a lot of things were down onetime, but that's -- so I wouldn't read more into it than that.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Last question is, you're pretty sure of the sequential same-store revenue expense in NOI growth figures for the Colonial portfolio in 3Q.","H. Eric Bolton","Yes, we have it right here, hold on. The -- there it is, yes. Right here, okay. Yes, sequential revenue growth was 2.5% and the sequential expense growth was 12.3%. For just the Colonial portfolio, Q2 versus Q3, '13, 2.5% in revenue, 12.3% in expenses.","Operator","And I'm currently showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.","H. Eric Bolton","No closing comments. So, thanks, everybody for joining us this morning, and we'll see a lot of you next week. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

Afterwards, the Company will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, today, July 27, 2017.","I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Argo","Thank you, Lynn. Good morning. This is Tim Argo, SVP of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Rob DelPriore General Council. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, Company management will be making forward-looking statements.","Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the safe harbor language included in yesterday\u2019s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call, will be available on our Web site. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks, Tim, and good morning. We were pleased with the solid results for the second quarter with FFO performance ahead of our expectation. Pricing momentum continues to move in a favorable direction and occupancy remains strong. Our portfolio of properties balanced across various sub-markets and price points of the Sunbelt region, combined with our strong operating platform, continues to demonstrate an ability to better tolerate the elevated pockets of new supply present in several markets.","The integration of the Post portfolio is making terrific progress. And as expected, the emerging positive trends in higher rents and occupancy are starting to build momentum. The initial opportunities surrounding expense synergies, resulting from our reconciling operating practices and taking advantage of our larger scale, have yielded some early wins on operating expense performance. We expect these trends to continue over the balance for the year into 2018.","While, it\u2019s clear the current new supplied trends have caused some moderation from last year\u2019s rent growth results, especially for new moving residence, we continue to believe that at this point in the cycle our legacy MAA portfolio locations continue to offer some offsetting balance or protection against the new supply pressures, which are more evident within the legacy Post of market locations. Our property teams are doing a great job in taking care of our existing residence with renewal lease pricing across the combined adjusted same-store portfolio continuing a solid trend in the 6% range with a steady pattern of improvement and renewal pricing being generated out of the legacy Post portfolio.","Resident turnover remains low with 12 month rolling turnover rate at 50.9% halfway through the year, essentially matching last year\u2019s performance of 50.8%. So overall, while leasing conditions have become more competitive when compared to prior year, we continue to believe that a combination of our balanced portfolio, focus on solid employment growth markets of the Sunbelt, coupled with the growing margin expansion opportunities from our merger with Post, will yield continued FFO growth and NOI performance that are in line with our expectation.","The transaction market remains highly competitive as investor capital and interest in the multifamily market continues to outpace opportunities being brought to market. As noted in our earnings release, we did not make any acquisitions during the second quarter. However, we continue to underwrite quite a few deals, and we\u2019ll continue to be patient and disciplined in our underwriting as more new development projects are brought to market over the back half of the year.","Our lease up and development pipelines are making solid progress. The six new properties currently in lease up were 82.5% occupied at the end of the second quarter, and we expect to stabilize four of these communities in the current third quarter. Our six projects remaining under construction are also making solid progress with additional leasing just getting underway now in Austin at Post Afton Phase II and in Atlanta at Post Millennium Midtown.","So in summary, we like the momentum we\u2019re seeing during our peak leasing season and we remain excited with the upside opportunities to capture over the next couple of years from our merger with Post Properties. Our balanced portfolio of properties and strong operating platform continue to demonstrate an ability to deliver stable results through the cycle.","Before I turn over the call over to Tom, I do want to express my appreciation to our entire team here at MAA. I appreciate your efforts over the busy summer leasing season, and not only delivering great performance today, but also your extra efforts focused on completing our merger and consolidation activities, which are further strengthening MAA\u2019s platform for the future.","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Grimes","Thank you, Eric and good morning everyone. Progress made since the first quarter is encouraging, and we were especially pleased. We are especially pleased with the improvement in pricing trends emerging from the legacy Post portfolio. For the second quarter, on a lease-over-lease basis, blended rents, which include both new and renewal leases for the combined adjusted same store portfolio grew by 2.6%, an improvement of 130 basis points from the performance in the first quarter.","Breaking that down a little bit. Lease-over-lease rents for the new resident lease written during the second quarter were down 70 basis points. This is a significant 250 basis point improvement from the performance in the first quarter. This positive momentum on new lease pricing for the combined adjusted same-store portfolio continued in July with new lease pricing turning positive, now up 30 basis points. Renewal lease pricing within the combined adjusted same store portfolio remained stronger in the second quarter, growing 6.3%.","The positive trends are most evident within the legacy Post portfolio as blended rents on lease-over-lease basis improved 150 basis points from the first quarter to the second quarter. The trend continued in July with Post blended lease-over-lease rents growing 2.6%. July\u2019s blended rent performance represents 370 basis points improvement in rents from the first quarter for the legacy Post portfolio. This improvement drove the blended rent growth for the combined adjusted same-store portfolio up to 3.1% in July. The trends are similar for average daily occupancy. In July, the MAA portfolio remained steady at 96.1%, and the post portfolio, which ran 90 basis points behind the legacy MAA portfolio in the second quarter, closed the gap to 50 basis points to 95.6%.","60 day exposure, which is all banking units and notices first 50 day period for both portfolios, is now just 7.4%, very strong for this time of year. We expect the gap between the portfolios, on both rent growth and occupancy, to continue to narrow as the benefits of our operating approach come to bear on the post communities. We\u2019ve completed most of the foundational work associated with repopulating our revenue management system with updated data from the legacy post locations. And they are benefiting from the improved occupancy and exposure positioning.","We are pleased with the improvement of this portfolio and our critical busy summer season, and believe that we\u2019ll be positioned as we head into the slower winter months. Expense performance follows a similar pattern. RM costs were down by 2.2%, led by a few early wins in the Post portfolio. As a result of the improved scale, our national accounting pricing improved in both portfolios, but was more impactful in the post results. In addition, the renegotiation of in-market contract services, such as interior paint vendor and pool cleaning services, aided the post results.","We have improvements still to come. At the end of the second quarter, the Post communities are still running 25% higher on a maintenance cost per unit basis than the legacy MAA portfolio. We expect this gap to close as our approach to turning units, which is less reliant on expense of contract labor takes hold.","Driven by these improvements, in revenue and expense, the NOI margin on the post portfolio increased 130 basis points from the second quarter of last year. While elevated supply levels moderated rent growth, we\u2019re seeing good growth in main markets; Forth Worth, Raleigh, Charleston and Jacksonville stood out from the Group. In both portfolios, Houston remains our only market level worry-bid and represents just 3.7% of our NOI.","We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. Currently, our combined Huston market\u2019s daily occupancy is 95.3% and 60 day exposure is just 7.9%. Renter demand remained steady and current residents continue to choose to stay with us, move-outs for the portfolio are in line with prior year and turnover remained low at 50.9% on a rolling 12 months basis. Move-outs to home buying and move-outs to home renting remained consistent at 20% and 6% of move-outs.","As you know, much of the Post product is in the inter-loop, and is in inter-loop areas that are seeing the most supply. While this puts pressure on the newer product, it creates opportunity on the older product in excellent locations. There\u2019re 13,000 Post units without compelling redevelopment opportunities.","We can make these great locations more competitive by updating the product. We have room to raise the rents and still be well below the rates of the new product coming on line. Momentum is building on the Post redevelopment program through genuinely completed 423 units. On average, we\u2019re spending 8,600 and getting the rent increases 13% more than a comparable non-redeveloped unit. For the M&A portfolio, during the quarter, we completed over 2,300 of interior unit upgrades. On legacy MAA, our redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 units to 20,000 units remains robust. On a combined basis, our total redevelopment pipeline is in the neighborhood of 30,000 units.","As you can tell from the release, our active lease up communities, are performing well. Leasing has gone better than expected at Charlotte and Midtown and Nashville, and that stabilization date has been moved up a quarter to the fourth quarter of this year. Innovation in Greenville and residents in Fountainhead and Phoenix stabilized on schedule during the quarter. Our four communities scheduled to stabilize in the third quarter are on track to do some. We are actively leasing the [indiscernible], Post South Lamar II and Post [indiscernible] Midtown, and they are progressing well.","It has been a busy quarter for our teams and we\u2019re pleased with our progress. The momentum building in the Post portfolio is particularly encouraging. We look forward to continuing to capture value creation opportunities on both revenue and expense sides of the equation. Al?","Al Campbell","Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll provide some additional commentary on the Company\u2019s second quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally, on guidance for the remainder of the year. Net income available for common shareholders was $0.42 per diluted common share for the quarter. FFO for the quarter was $1.48 per share, which was $0.07 per share above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter.","The earnings outperformance was primarily related to favorable interest G&A and integration costs during the quarter, with the each producing about $0.02 per share of favorability. And additional $0.01 per share was provided by favorable performance in our lease-up and development properties, which are included in our non-same store portfolio.","Our combined adjusted same-store NOI performance was in line with expectations for the quarter. And the integration expense savings were mainly related to timing of cost, which we expect to incur over the remainder of the year. I\u2019ll outline our revised guidance for the full year in just a moment.","During the quarter, we completed the construction of two communities, Post Parkside at Wade II located in Raleigh, and Post Afton located in Huston. We\u2019re also beginning the construction of one new community, a Phase II expansion in 1201 Midtown, a community located in Charleston that we acquired late last year.","During the second quarter, we funded an additional $50 million of development costs, brining our year-to-date funding to $110 million. Our current development pipeline now contains six projects with the total projected cost of $396 million with only $103 million remaining to the funded. The six projects are expected to produce an average 6.5% stabilized NOI yield once completed and leased up with four of the projects projected to be completed by the first quarter of 2018, and the remaining two completed in the back half of 2018.","Just after question end, we sold three wholly-owned communities, located in Lakeland Florida, Montgomery Alabama and Fort Worth, Texas. The total proceeds of $88.4 million represented a strong pricing for 28 year old assets on average and produced 5.3% economic cap rate. We also exited two tertiary markets with these sales. During the second quarter, we successfully used our enhanced credit ratings to complete a bond offering. We see $600 million of 3.6% unsecured 10 year notes an issue price of 99.58%, using the proceeds to pay down our line of credit. Therefore, we also prepaid $156 million of secured mortgages, further increasing our unencumbered assets to 83% of our total gross assets.","For our bond covenants at quarter end, our leverage to bond as debt to total assets, was 34% and our consolidated net income, our consolidated income, covered our debt services of 5.2 times. We also had over $877 million of combined cash capacity on our credit facility to provide protection and support for our business plans.","Finally, we increased our earnings guidance for the full year to reflect the second quarter performance and updated expectations for the remainder of the year. We are updating guidance for net income per diluted common share, which is reconciled to update FFO and AFFO guidance from the supplement. Net income per diluted common share is now projected to be $2.69 to $2.89 for the full year of 2017. FFO is now projected to be $5.77 to $5.99 -- $5.97 per share or $5.87 at the mid-point, which includes $0.15 per share of merger and integration costs for the full year.","AFFO is projected to be $5.18 to $5.38 per share, or $5.28 at the mid-point. We\u2019re maintaining our guidance expectations for the combined adjusted same-store portfolio, which is expected to produce NOI growth for the full year in 3% to 3.5% range. Since summer, we are increasing our FFO guidance for the full year by $0.03 per share, representing the additions from Q2 performance discussed earlier, partially offset by the $0.02 per share of integrations costs now expected to be incurred later in the year, along with an additional reduction of $0.02 per share related to provide the acquisition timing and yields for the year. And given the competitive environment, Eric mentioned earlier, we now expect our remaining acquisition opportunities to occur later in the year in all to be lease up communities.","Our guidance for acquisition volume and total merger and integration expenses for the full year remains unchanged. We did increase our range for disposition volume as our actual pricing expectation is exceeding our initial estimates. We also narrowed the range of expected G&A costs and development investment for the full year. We remain on track to capture the full $20 million of overhead synergies related to the Post merger on run rate basis by year end. And we also expect to continue capturing additional NOI opportunities, including our forecast, primarily in the later part of this year as operating practices and platforms become fully integrated.","That\u2019s all that we have in the way of prepared comments, Lynn. So now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Nick Joseph","Just in terms of same-store revenue guidance, I know you maintained it. So it looks like you\u2019re assuming acceleration of growth into the back half of the year at about 3.5% versus the 2.5% you did in the first half. So I am wondering if you can give the components of that in terms of occupancy assumptions, rate growth assumptions and the other revenue that makes you comfortable with that acceleration.","Al Campbell","Nick, this is Al. I\u2019ll tell you, if you remember we talked about in Q1 that what we needed to see for the rest of the year for our revenue guidance, it was to see renewals continue to be very strong about 6%, which we definitely saw in the second quarter, about 6.3% on average. And we needed to see that new lease pricing, which was down little longer than we expected in Q1 and continue to see those positive trends that we began to see in April. And we did see that in May, June and I think Tom mentioned July, and a very strong -- renewals were strong over 6% and new leases moved to positive territory, lending to about 3.1%. So that\u2019s all the positive change that we needed to see in terms of the back half.","We need to continue to see that blended rent in the below the 3% range. We expect to see that from a couple of reasons; one, the MAA portfolio is very stable, very strong; we expect it to have some seasonality as we move through the back of the year; but hold strong in terms of renewals and new lease pricing; then, we expect to continue to capture some of the opportunities in revenue on the Post side really supporting that further. And so the combination of those two gives us really firm support for our belief in the revenue guidance that we\u2019ve got. I would tell you, we expect it to grow as we go through the year. I think our expectations for Q3 are 2.5% to 3% range-ish and Q4 are 3% to 3.5% as we continue to capture those synergies that we talked about.","Eric Bolton","And Nick, this is Eric. I would also add though that we also feel very confident in the expense guidance that we have out there as we talked about. We\u2019ve seen some real opportunities emerging on that side of the equation. And as a consequence of that, we feel very confident where our NOI is likely to come out this year relative to expectation.","Al Campbell","Let me just add a point on that too, Nick. I am sure you could do the math on that. So to Eric\u2019s point, NOI is where we are year-to-date and what we expected here. We expect to be well into the range on that, expenses are coming on fast and we\u2019re having a really good performance in that, as Tom mentioned. So that likely will come at first lower end of the range. And the revenue likely as well, given the first half year results and the projections I just talked to you, will probably be lower end of range as well, supporting well into range on NOI.","Nick Joseph","And then just in terms of the performance of large markets versus secondary markets. It looks like the secondary markets actually outperformed in the quarter. In terms of the trend, do you expect to continue or was that something unique to this quarter?","Eric Bolton","I think that the trend will continue, at this point in the large markets, it's a supply issue. And the opportunities in the Post portfolio will add over time as revenue builds. So I think this is a place where I think those performances will -- that gap will narrow overtime as we get the Post revenue process rolling along.","Al Campbell","I would tell you, Nick, that I think that absent the opportunity embedded within the Post portfolio, the delta between the large and the secondary markets are probably continue to play out as if we saw in Q2 for a while, given the supply dynamics that are going on with these larger markets having more supply. But the operating opportunity upside in the Post portfolio is going to really, we think, become increasingly evident in our results over the next several quarters. And likely, will offset some of that supply pressure to the point that we may see large markets resume outperformance in the secondary markets a little quicker than regular supply dynamics would support.","Eric Bolton","Nick may be a good example of that would be in our DC market. That is a place where folks are arguing between whether it\u2019s a bad market or a mediocre market. But our Post blended rents for that market for the second quarter were up 4.6% and we feel good about the opportunities that we see in this Post portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Drew Babin with Robert. W. Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Drew Babin","Talking about the increased disposition guidance resulting from pricing, and not necessarily higher volume of assets sold. The 5.3% economic cap rate on the July sales was surprise. And I guess if you could give a sense of, or give us a sense of what remaining dispositions for this year might look like in terms of being in MAA legacy or post legacy asset or just some color on the timing as well.","Eric Bolton","By definition to some degree is the surprise given that was above our range. But we knew that the pricing would be good, just frankly turned out to be a little bit better than we expected. We do have two other dispositions that we have planned for this year, both around the contract, both our legacy MAA locations, both are in the Atlanta market. And we should have those closed sometime in the fourth quarter.","Tim Argo","And our revised expectations are included in our revised guidance.","Drew Babin","And on the acquisition side, obviously, the acquisition guide has been changed despite just not a lot of activity so far this year. Is that -- I guess what gives you confidence that that number is a possibility in the second half of the year? Is there anything specific you\u2019re seeing, or is it just a wait and see type of approach to see what comes to market?","Eric Bolton","Look, two things, one is that, we do think that the deals being brought to market are more likely to get to grow as opposed to shrink as more supply continues to come on line. So we just think that there will be more opportunities coming into the market. And secondly, historically, for the last several years, we\u2019ve always had more success in making acquisitions in the back half of the year as compared with the first half of the year. We just find developers and sellers are little bit more motivated as we approach year end. And so we, for those two reasons, we\u2019re hopeful that we will continue to be able to capture opportunity in the range that we\u2019ve given.","Drew Babin","And then one quick one on DC. I mean acknowledging, it's not -- that works for markets for MAA, it looks like it's worth asking. Clearly, it sounds like you\u2019re not tremendously worried about DC as a market. Can you just talk about the positioning of legacy post assets around DC exposure the sense rather than healthcare, different dynamics within Washington that might help and\/or cover that portfolio relative to the market?","Eric Bolton","I would tell you much like our portfolio spread throughout the Sunbelt that portfolio in DC is spread throughout. So there is a little bit -- there is some Northern Virginia exposure, there is Alexandria exposure. We\u2019re right there of the river and Pentagon City that has some, obviously, some military exposure to it. And there is a little bit in Maryland. So frankly, it spread across the group. The one consistent opportunity though is that one I think is pricing or two consistent opportunities that we see are pricing practices and redevelopment in those areas. And that\u2019s honestly where our optimism about DC comes as we see opportunities operate differently. And that gives us an outside of the market growth opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Market. Please go ahead, your line is open.","John Kim","On the deceleration of same store revenue growth this quarter, despite the slight pickup in occupancy. Can you just remind us, is this entirely due to rates or do you also offer incentives currently?","Al Campbell","And talking about the decline in revenue from Q1 to Q2, it really bodes down to the pricing -- new lease pricing that we had in Q1. If you remember, we talked about the fact that new lease pricing is typically negative with the first part of the year. But our experience in Q1 was it stayed negative for the quarter long that we expected. Good news was as we moved in April we saw that trend change and move in a positive direction. But that impact of Q1 really does leases fully rolled into our portfolio in Q2. And so that\u2019s when we felt the most impact from that period of time. And in fact, we expected Q2 to be our lowest revenue quarter for the year that was when the big surprise for us. But we also knew that the trends that we expect for the rest had begun in April. We saw that in May, June and even July continue. And so it impacted Q2 the most. We feel good about momentum in the portfolio going into the back part of the year.","John Kim","Okay, so no incentives on renewals?","Eric Bolton","The effective 2.4% of rent growth includes the impact\u2026","Tom Grimes","We\u2019re a net rent shop, so can say, every number that we give you on the rent, lease-over-lease or ERU or effective rent per unit is all -- has all concessions in that number.","John Kim","And then out of your large markets, there\u2019s been a few of them where you had a significant drop of over 100 basis points, sequentially, so that includes Austin, Charlotte, DC, Nashville, Phoenix. Are there any of those markets that surprised you this quarter?","Tom Grimes","I think, frankly, it works as we expected. We are seeing pressure in those areas. We\u2019re still optimistic, I think, Charlotte is a different story than what\u2019s a Austin and it\u2019s more bifurcated between the Downtown pressure where the suburban assets are doing a bit better. But not much on the large market side surprises us, John.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Rob Stevenson","Tom, you said that the legacy Post portfolio closed some of the NOI margin differential during the quarter. What is the NOI margin differential right now as we sit here today between Post and MAA legacy portfolios?","Tom Grimes","We\u2019ll grab that. But at the initial, it was 100 basis points and we\u2019ve closed -- I mean, we frankly exceeded that two quarters in a row with improvement of 130 basis points on Post each quarter.","Al Campbell","And at this point, Rob, we\u2019d effectively brought the Post portfolio on top of it, slightly ahead of the MAA legacy portfolio. And as you remember, we talked about that over time over the first 12 to 18 months we expected that Post portfolio to actually exceed maybe 100 to 150 basis points because it well should given the rent structure of that portfolio. So we\u2019re well, call it halfway there and we feel very good about that.","Tom Grimes","Pretty excited about that progress, Rob.","Rob Stevenson","What is the timeframe you think to get that extra, the other half done? Is that end of year or is that into \u201818?","Tom Grimes","I think that\u2019s later in\u201918, Rob. I mean what happens when you can get in and move the expense side down, we saw quick early wins there and jumped on that immediately. The pricing trends we love, but that\u2019s pricing trends on a month or a quarter and it just takes some time for all that to come down through. So we\u2019re doing great on expenses and we\u2019re right where we would expect to be on revenues on post portfolio that just takes longer.","Rob Stevenson","Al is there any material difference between where the legacy Post portfolio is now and where the MAA portfolio is on a real estate tax rate basis on asses values and everything else relative to what you guys think is reasonable?","Al Campbell","No, I think there is totally -- there is a different product type and even location in those two portfolios on average. So I think that\u2019s built-in. And I think there\u2019s not tremendous difference right now, Rob. I think the opportunity on the real estate tax side is not a situation we go and can change valuations very quickly. It\u2019s going to take time where our approach was a constant downward pressure and we think overtime that bought better results for us. I think what we\u2019ll see on the Post side of the business is maybe that constant downward pressure result in improvements over the next few years. But right now, on a relative basis not a significant difference than what we\u2019ve felt.","Rob Stevenson","Eric, what was behind the sale of the land parcels during the quarter? What they does -- you mentioned you want to go forward yourself on those?","Eric Bolton","They all vary, some just in -- we just didn\u2019t feel like those were size fit that would make sense for us to build out. And some of it is still some legacy, so if we picked up from Colonial. But largely, these are out parcels that for a host of reasons, we just don\u2019t feel like make sense for us to develop.","Rob Stevenson","How should we be taking about development, going forward? I mean, you inherited the bulk of the current pipeline is stuff you inherited from Post. When you fast forward into early \u201918, the current pipeline is going to fall by 75%, you\u2019re going to be left with not that much left in progress with the 2018, the two lateral half \u201818 deliveries. How are you thinking about backfilling or you\u2019re going to be running at about $100 million of development? How should we be thinking about that, going forward?","Eric Bolton","We would like to and we are actively working to find opportunities to start to repopulate that pipeline with projects. And David Ward and his guys are out looking at a number of opportunities right now. We\u2019ve got a couple of parcels of land that we do own that we do feel like will make sense to develop on, one in North Dallas. In particular, I\u2019m thinking about, there is an opportunity that we are actively working on in Raleigh, another opportunity we\u2019re looking at in Denver. And so we do believe that over the course for the next six months, we will start to begin to slowly repopulate that pipeline.","Looking at deliveries that would then probably come online in early -- mid-year 2019 is what we\u2019re working on at this point. But we intend to have something approaching no more than 3% to 4% of enterprise value, I mean, which is kind of where we are right now, really at about 3% of enterprise value. In terms of the development exposure, as you point out, that\u2019s going to dwindle down next year. But we hope to get it back in 2019 and beyond.","Rob Stevenson","The project that you were just talk about, are those Post -- Mid-America Post development assets, or are these assets if you guys are likely to do with some merchant developer, like MAA used to do in the past?","Eric Bolton","No, these would be really depend -- I mean, a couple of them are where we would be the developer. And we are having conversations with several folks right now along the lines of what we\u2019ve done in the past where it\u2019s a pre-purchase of something with the merchant builder or pre-purchase to something they\u2019re going to build. Those things get complicated sometimes in the negotiations in terms of lease-up and so forth. But we will be pursuing both where we will be the developer, we will not be the general contractor ever, but we would be the developer. And we\u2019re also looking at some pre-purchase of things to be built.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open. Mr. Anderson, please shut the mute function on your telephone.","Rich Anderson","So Eric, lot of momentum and a good story about integrating Post into your system and all the margin improvements and all that. I\u2019m curious how much is Post come into the rescue in terms of your perspective of the fundamental picture for multi-family, if not for merging the two companies. How much more negative would you feel about your prospects and maybe how would be operating differently with your legacy MAA portfolio in hand?","Eric Bolton","We\u2019d be fine. I mean we were absolutely fine with our legacy MAA structure and balance sheet. I mean what Post brought, frankly, was an opportunity to be a little stronger in different part of the cycle than what legacy MAA would be on its own. And brought, as I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, also another mechanism, another avenue of opportunity for us to grow externally and deploy capital through development. But this is a part of the cycle where the legacy MAA assets on a combined basis tend to hold up a little bit better as demonstrated by the fact the secondary market group outperformed the large market group in the quarter.","So we don\u2019t view Post, the addition of the Post assets, is coming to the rescue at all. We view that as addition to post assets as an add-on to what was already a pretty strong full stock performance profile that\u2019s only gotten stronger as a consequence of adding assets and locations that will give us more exposure, better performance doing in different part of the cycle.","Rich Anderson","And then just unrelated follow up question. You\u2019ve been -- component of the S&P 500 now for several months. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve been having any different conversations with non-dedicated REIT investors, and if you can comment at all on a different perspective from maybe a changing investor base? If the answer is no, then this is simple answer. But if is there anything there that you can communicate as getting a different class of investors into your stock?","Eric Bolton","Well, I think that there has been another simple change, Rich, in two ways; one, we just see a lot more people that we used to see, having these meetings and whether it\u2019s NAREIT or any of these other conferences that we attend; property tours have really picked up. And so we\u2019re seeing a lot more people, different groups of people that we\u2019ve seen in the past. And secondly, we\u2019ve always believed that our strategy and our approach in the way we think about creating value over the long haul has a strong appeal to the generalist investor, if you will. And so the opportunities that we have to tell our story and to talk about the track record and the philosophies that we bring to the multi-family RIET space, I think, it continues to resonate pretty well with this group. And so we\u2019re excited about the positive impact long-term and we think from being exposed to this more generalist crowd.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Austin Wurschmidt","Just wanted to touch on seasonality a bit, and how you guys are thinking about that as we enter the back half of the year. When do you start to see the impact to new lease rates and seasonality? And should we expect something different within the post portfolio versus legacy MAA? I guess, just given some of the operational upside that you\u2019re starting to see.","Al Campbell","I think what\u2019s built into our expectations of back half of the year is largely MAA portfolio continue to stay pretty stable with a slight seasonality as we expect. But remember through from April through June, July, the MAA portfolio was 3.3%, 3.5% in lender rent growth, so very stable. And we expect it to stay stable, maybe moderating a little bit. But then support coming from continued capture of the post synergies in the back half. So I think we expect revenue to be in third quarter to be higher in the second quarter, and then fourth higher than the third, and so the continued trend in that.","The one seasonal item that I will bring out that I would remind people of that will make, if you don\u2019t remember, it may look unusual. Last year, Post had a very significant reduction in real estate taxes in the third quarter, a 10% reduction as every quarter and adjustment in that quarter. So one thing we\u2019ll see moving to third quarter is our expenses. I think they\u2019ll still be around -- they\u2019ll still be not outsized significantly but that would impact that. I think our NOI for the third quarter will be slightly impacted that, maybe the lowest for the year I think coming back in the fourth quarter being the strongest in the year. And so those are the general trends that we expect.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then on the Post side. Was there any occupancy opportunity late in the year that you could talk about, and what\u2019s the potential upside there? I think more towards the fourth quarter.","Tom Grimes","I think there is probably 10 to 20 basis points in the fourth quarter, in the third quarter, both portfolios had really strong years last year. And so that will be a difficult comp.","Austin Wurschmidt","And then just on the expense side, it sounds like you\u2019re confident that you\u2019ll be within the lower end of that range of the guidance you\u2019ve laid out for the year. I mean is this savings that you\u2019ve already outlined and you\u2019re just seeing it earlier? Or is it on top of what you anticipated when you underwrote the portfolio?","Eric Bolton","Probably Tom and I can tack in this. But it's primarily coming from quicker capture of the Post opportunity. We had lined out both revenue and expense synergy opportunities and we had about $4 million to $5 million that we capture in 2017 with the other $10 million or so, $8 million to $10 million capture in 2018. And what we laid out initially was probably two-thirds will come from revenue and one-third comes in expense in 2017. I think we\u2019ll probably see that flip-flop. We probably see two-thirds come from expense as we really had good opportunity on that early and one-third from revenue this year with the revenue opportunity over the full period being actually there may be little more, and some of that will come in \u201918.","Tom Grimes","I think that\u2019s a fair assessment.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from John Guinee with Stifel. Please go ahead, your line is open.","John Guinee","I haven\u2019t been on the call before. Hi Eric, it's been a long time. Question for you, what I\u2019ve noticed in all these supplemental from the apartment world is nothing on average unit size, nothing on per square foot of rental income, per square foot in terms of development costs. When you guys are talking internally, are you relying as much on per unit or per square foot numbers? How do you think about that?","Eric Bolton","We generally think about -- when we\u2019re talking about development costs, we generally think about in terms of per unit. When we think about rents, it\u2019s a combination of -- it depends on the nature of the conversation we have. We do think a lot about per square foot rent levels out in the market and do some comparisons like that. But it, on balance, I would tell you whether we\u2019re modeling on development or thinking about competitive position in the given market, on rents to see on per square foot basis. And then we\u2019re talking about acquisition costs, development costs, as we think about on a per unit basis.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Neil Malkin","First question, I know, the Post portfolio be included in the same store [bridge] results. If you go back a couple of quarters, looks like more of a market deceleration probably was actually happening. I was wondering if you could give us some perspective on. What is it looks like on the ground in your bigger market Atlanta, Dallas, Charlotte, Tampa? Can you just talk about what\u2019s going out in terms of supply and demand, particularly, because you have an elevated suburban exposure? I was wondering if you\u2019re seeing impact from supply hit all areas.","Eric Bolton","It is not equal as you mentioned, and now just a few of them. At Atlanta, good job growth at 2.6%, but the bulk of the supply is really concentrated in that bucket P3 Road area, so in our loop and that\u2019s affecting those Post assets. The 85 Corridor or 75 Corridor, those are all -- seen much less in the way of supply. I think completions in Atlanta will have about 8,600 that will drop next year to 6,500. And then you mentioned Charlotte and it\u2019s for sure a tougher uptown, downtown picture with rent growth in the suburbs closer to 4%, and it\u2019s flat in the downtown area.","And then Dallas is probably the market where we would expect to see more supply coming up next year, maybe about 2,000 units or so. And it\u2019s a little more wide-spread. It is focused in that Downtown corridor and then runs up a bit to point down to Frisco and [44.21] a bit.","Neil Malkin","And then I guess and there is follow-up in different way. In your market job growth is very strong wages is very strong, the rent continued to slow down. I mean, is the Post portfolio having an outside impact on the pace of revenue growth or rent growth? Or what do you think is driving those phenomena just given the strength on what you could think would be the demand side and ability to pay?","Eric Bolton","Post is a current drag on revenues, frankly. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited and you see the differential between the numbers that I mentioned earlier, the 350 basis point improvement on rents from the first quarter to July. We feel like that is non-market related and we\u2019ve got the opportunity to push outside of that. But Post assets baked in pricing materially slowed our large market group and our overall revenues. And we are quickly, I think, unlocking the value pushing new lease rates up, pushing renewal rates up, which translates into blended rent increases that just takes time to compound and drive revenues up.","Neil Malkin","And then last from me, you talked about looking at project in Denver. Is that a market you want to build exposure to?","Tom Grimes","At this point, yes, it is. I mean we\u2019ve been studying that market for quite some time. As I think you may recall, Post had a development there that we\u2019re already committed to. There\u2019s another site that we have under contract, the post had on contract that we like very much. And so the short answer is, yes, that\u2019s the market that we expect to grow in.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Conor Wagner with Green Street. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Conor Wagner","On the redevelopment program, you mentioned the legacy MAA versus Post. But obviously, a lot of that is Colonial. Can you give us an update on how that\u2019s gone and what\u2019s left for you within Colonial to redevelop?","Tom Grimes","Of that pipeline that I mentioned on the legacy MAA portfolio of roughly 15,000 units, that is primarily the Colonial pipeline that we\u2019re winding down. So we\u2019ve still got room to run in that area.","Conor Wagner","And then Tom, if you could tell us a little bit more about DC. What you outlined on the Post assets is obviously positive. But you had a sequential occupancy drop, and as you mentioned, people think it's either bad or mediocre. Outside of the opportunity you have to just improve the Post assets, what are you seeing in the market broadly in terms of demand trends?","Tom Grimes","We are paying a little bit more for our demand with increased search cost. So I would say, it is moderately harder to get people through the door, but certainly not impossible. And honestly, Conor, I hadn\u2019t spent a ton of time really understanding that because the controllable easy opportunities are right in front of us and we\u2019re kind of focused on that. I\u2019m not willing to become the stage of the DC market, just yet. But we feel good about our opportunities there.","Conor Wagner","And then finally on the move out to home purchase, you mentioned 20% overall for the portfolio. Is there any difference there in terms of just -- we know the overall number will be different between Post and legacy MAA. But is there any difference in the trend there in terms of a pick-up in move out to buy activity on legacy Post?","Tom Grimes","They are right on top of each other, Conor, maybe a 100 bps lower on the Post portfolio, right now.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Buck Horne","Just thinking about the development pipeline a little bit. Have you guys noticed any trends in construction labor availability and\/or materials pricing, things like lumber, concrete, otherwise that obviously those factors going up. Is that affecting development starts in your areas? Are you seeing any signs that one or other inputs going into construction are easing, or making it more difficult to get starts underway?","Eric Bolton","Buck, I would tell you that we haven\u2019t seen anything that would suggest developments getting easier. I think all signs continue suggest that if anything, it's harder. You mentioned construction costs associated materials and labor. Labor, in particular, I think is the area that is continuing to become increasingly problematic for developers. But what we continue to hear also is just that securing financing continues to be a challenge. It\u2019s available but certainly more expensive than it used to be, and the loan proceeds that one can achieve, is not as great as it used to be is what we consistently hear.","So as I mentioned, we are out looking at a number of opportunities and modeling a lot but as it is on the acquisition side, development is hard to pencil right now on a basis that certainly for near term deliveries that makes any sense. So I think that, on balance, I think the pressures are higher to support development today than they were a year ago.","Buck Horne","And I do want to follow-up a little bit on the comment about Denver. Going back into that market or adding to that market from what Post had. Is that something where -- is that a market where you do feel like you could internally develop enough property to get to scale? Or would you feel like you need to make a more portfolio level acquisition to build up an efficient operation there?","Eric Bolton","Well, we think through is a combination of both acquiring existing stabilized assets acquiring current lease up properties or to be built properties plus what we could do on the development side that that\u2019s the market that offers enough opportunity that we could get to scale that make sense for us there. We\u2019re going to be patient with it. It's not something we feel like we have to accomplish in the next year. So we\u2019re going to be very, very consistent in our underwriting and our approach to thinking about how we grow our presence there.","We do like the dynamics of that market long-term. I think it does add some diversification to our portfolio that creates some benefits and so -- but we\u2019re going to be patient with it. But whether it's buying or building, we think the market will yield enough opportunities to make it worth our effort.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Hardik Goel wijh Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Hardik Goel","Just had a quick question on the Post portfolio specifically and what\u2019s your guide is -- new lease growth was there for the first quarter and the second quarter?","Eric Bolton","For the second quarter for Post, did you say new?","Hardik Goel","New\u2026","Tom Grimes","It was down 4%. And I don\u2019t have the first quarter handy, but I think it was probably 200 bps, or so\u2026","Al Campbell","Yes, and been down about 7% in Q1.","Hardik Goel","And I am guessing that\u2019s part of where all the upside to the revenue guidance in the back half of year is going to come from. Where do you see that really ending the year?","Al Campbell","I think what we\u2019ve seen so far is the first part of the year was where the spread was really large that talked about the Q1 was the big, the new leases are down. And what we saw was just on blended proposed, I mean, just blend from there I think is a best way to think about it. We were below one blended negative one for three, almost four months in a row through April but they only moved into May and we went positive 0.7, positive 1.3 in June and move to July, positive 2.6. So that\u2019s a very good trend and that\u2019s where the momentum we\u2019re talking about building. It definitely has been a drag on MAA\u2019s performance but the momentum and the positive aspects of what we\u2019re doing and proxy forms is definitely kicking in, and now we expect it to drive some performance in the second half.","Operator","Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the program back over to Mr. Argo.","Tim Argo","Thank you, Lynn. We have no further comments and just want to [indiscernible] if anybody has any further questions. Thanks.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s program.

Welcome to the MAA Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today August 1, 2019. ","I will now turn the conference over to Tim Argo, Senior Vice President, Finance for MAA.","Tim Argo","Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. This is Tim Argo, Senior Vice President of Finance for MAA. With me are Eric Bolton, our CEO, Al Campbell, our CFO, Tom Grimes, our COO.","Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussions, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our '34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today's prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning's call, will be available on our website.","During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as well as reconciliations of the differences between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial data, which are available on the For Investors page of our website at www.maac.com.","I'll now turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Bolton","Thanks Tim, and good morning. Second quarter results were ahead of our expectation. Strong job growth and resulting demand for apartment housing are driving higher trends in rent growth across our Sunbelt markets. We believe our portfolio, which is diversified across this region in terms of both sub-markets and price point, is particularly well-positioned to capture the benefits of these positive trends. This strong demand coupled with the benefits from our merger and the retooling of our operating platform is really starting to bear fruit as our combined lease-over-lease pricing in Q2 was a strong 5%, higher than what we've seen in several years. We're encouraged with the trends is effective rent growth continues to climb, as anticipated, and in line with our expectations.","Same-store expense growth in Q2 was higher than what we've seen over the past couple of years, as we harvested expense synergies from our merger transaction, setting up a more challenging comparison for us this year. However, as has been our custom, we maintain a rigorous focus on driving efficiencies into our operation, and as you will note from yesterday's earnings release, we did revise down slightly our full year expectation for expense growth.","Overall, the 3% growth in same-store NOI captured in the second quarter as well ahead of our original expectations and we're encouraged with the overall trends. Given the strong year-to-date performance and that we are well into the busy summer leasing season, we are raising our full year expectations for same-store revenues, net operating income, and overall FFO growth. ","On the transaction front, we've not seen much change from the past few quarters with stable cap rates and a high level of buyer appetite. We continue to see good deal flow, but the private equity buyer remains aggressive in their efforts to deploy capital. We remain committed to our investment disciplines and, as noted in our earnings guidance update, we have pulled back on the level of acquisitions we expect to complete this year while increasing the level of funding we plan to allocate to new development starts.","You will note that we also increased our planned dispositions volume. Earlier this month we initiated marketing efforts with plans to sell five properties in the Little Rock, Arkansas market and we expect to exit this market by year-end.","During the quarter we completed lease-up at two of our new properties in Denver. Our remaining two properties in initial lease-up located in Charleston and Atlanta remain on track and should stabilize late this year. Our five new development projects currently under construction also remain on track. ","At a total investment of just over $354 million, we continue to forecast stabilized NOI yields north of 6% from these two pipelines. We also continue to work on pre-development activities at our existing owned land sites in Denver Houston in Orlando. In addition, we are close to finalizing a new JV development project located in Orlando. We expect to have construction under way at all four of these new projects by year-end.","Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to send a big thank you to our team of associates here at the home office, in our regional offices, and at and those associated serving at each of our properties. Our folks have done a tremendous job over the last couple of years working through the challenging process of merging and transforming two large, two long-established companies systems and operating programs. The hard work is starting to show in our results, and we look forward to capturing additional opportunity over the coming quarters. Tom?","Thomas Grimes","Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. Our operating performance for the second quarter was strong and better than our original expectation, driven by strong demand and the improved platform. We have continued momentum in rent growth, strong average daily occupancy and improving trends.","Same-store effective rent growth per unit was 3.2% for the quarter. This was the 5th straight quarter of improving ERU growth. As a result, our year-over-year revenue growth rate was the highest it's been since 2016 and revenues increased 130 basis points sequentially. The acceleration in revenues was widespread. The year-over-year revenue growth rate for the second quarter exceeded the growth rate of the first quarter in 19 of our 21 largest markets.","As signaled by or guidance raise, we expect this acceleration to continue. This is led by steady momentum and new and renewal blended lease-over-lease pricing. Blended lease-over-lease rents for the quarter, up 5% which is a 170 basis points better than this time last year. The improvement in blended prices from Austin, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Dallas were particularly impactful. Even with the great traction on blended pricing during the quarter, average daily occupancy remained strong at 96%. Operating expenses were in line with our guidance, but higher than they have been recently. ","As we have mentioned on prior calls, we have captured the benefits of the improved expense management platform on the post portfolio and the comparisons are now more difficult. Year-to-date expense growth is now 2.8%. As a reminder, our annual operating expense growth since 2012 has been just 2.4%, well below the sector average. The favorable same-store trends continued into July. We're on track for another month of strong blended lease-over-lease pricing. July blended lease over lease rents were up 5.3%, which is well ahead of the 3.2% posted in July of last year. ","Average daily occupancy for the month continued at a strong 95.9%, which was 20 basis points higher than July of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which represents all vacant units and move-outs notices for a 60-day period is just 7.3%, which is 50 basis points better than this time last year. On the redevelopment front, through the second quarter, we completed about 3,800 units, which keeps us on track to redevelop around 8,000 units in 2019. This is one of our best uses of capital. Through the second quarter on average, we spent approximately $5,800 per unit and achieved an additional 10% in rent, which generates a year-one cash-on-cash return in excess of 20%. ","Our total redevelopment pipeline now stands in the neighborhood of 14,000 to 15,000 units. Our technology platform continues to expand. Our overhauled operating system in new website have aided our ability to attract, engage, and create value for our residents. The results are evident in our blended pricing traction. Our tests on smart homes are going well. The technology has been installed with minimum disruption and received well by our customers. We are also exploring a range of AI, chat, customer resource management, and prospect engagement tools. We're excited about the innovations in the apartment space and look forward to continuing to incorporate new technology into our operating platform. Our teams are pleased to have the work of 2017 and 2018 in the rear view mirror. We're encouraged with the momentum in rent growth and excited to have our transformed platform fully operational. Al?","Al Campbell ","Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's second quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity, and then finally on our updated guidance for the remainder of the year. FFO per share of $1157 for the second quarter included $0.04 per share of non-cash income related to the embedded derivatives in our preferred shares. Excluding this item, FFO was $1.53 per share for the quarter, which was $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance. That performance was a result of favorable operating performance. And as Tom mentioned, primarily related to the continued strong lease-over-lease pricing achieved during the quarter and year-to-date. ","Our pricing performance combined with the continued strong occupancy drove 90 basis points acceleration in total same store revenues for the quarter to 2.3% growth. This revenue performance, combined with a 3.6% growth in operating expenses for the quarter, produced NOI growth of 3%, which is the highest 9 quarters and is projected to continue growing over the remainder of the year. Additional information gain during the second quarter confirmed real estate tax pressure in Georgia, primarily Atlanta, and Texas, as we continue to work through significant valuation increases over the last couple of years. We now expect real estate tax expense growth range from 4.25 to 5.25 for the full year.","Despite this increase, strong performance in overall same-store expenses in the first half of the year allowed us to slightly lower the midpoint of our expense guidance for the full year. We continue to make progress on our development lease-up portfolio during the quarter, we funded an additional $26 million toward the completion of our current development pipeline. ","We now have $148 million remaining to fund on the 5 projects currently under construction and we expect to fully complete two of these communities this year and as Eric mentioned, we expect to begin four new projects later this year with a total estimated cost of around $300 million. We continue to expect stabilized yields between 6% and 6.5% on our development projects, once completed and fully leased up.","During the second quarter were, were fairly active on the financing front, we paid off $300 million 6-month term loan, which was due in June, and completed the renewal of our $1 billion unsecured credit facility, extending maturity until 2023. We also established our commercial paper program during the quarter to capture lower financing costs on our routine working capital borrowings. Our commercial paper borrowings will be capped $500 million and our fully backed by our credit facility.","Our balance sheet remains strong. Leverage remains low with debt to total assets of 32% and total debt to EBITDA below five times. And we proactively used the low rate environment in the last few years to further protect our balance sheet. At quarter end, we had 85% of our debt fixed or hedged against rising interest rates and an average maturity of almost eight years, which is historical high for our company. We also had over $670 million of cash and funding capacity under our line of credit and our current forecast is leverage-neutral for the year.","Finally, we are revising our FFO and same-store guidance for the full year to reflect a strong first half performance, as well as our updated projections for the remainder of the year. We're now projecting FFO per share for the full year to be in a range of $6.20 to $6.36 per share, or $6.28 at the midpoint, which is a $0.05 per share increase of our previous guidance, based entirely on increased operating performance.","Given the volatility of interest rates, which is the primary driver of valuation changes related to our preferred shares we're projecting the favorable preferred valuation to reverse later in the year, bringing the full year impact on earnings to 0.","With the continued strong pricing performance of the first half of the year, we are revising our full year guidance for same-store revenue to range of 2.75% to 3.25%, or 3% at the midpoint, which is a 70 basis points increase from our midpoint our previous guidance. ","And as mentioned earlier, though we expect continued pressure from real estate taxes, we project total operating expenses for the full year to now be in a range of 2.5% to 3.5%, or 3% at the midpoint. This performance will produce same-store NOI in a range of 2.5% to 3.5% or 3% at the midpoint for the full year, which is 120 basis points above our initial expectation for the year.","That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments, so Aaron, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We can take our first question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Austin Wurschmidt","Hi, good morning, everybody. Tom or Tim, maybe, or I'm sorry Tom or Al, you discussed that you expect continued acceleration in your markets, you highlighted July lease rates remain well above last year. Occupancy is up on a year-over-year basis, but the revised guidance assumes same-store revenue growth stabilizes at a consistent level with what you achieved in the second quarter. So can you just give us the moving pieces are or what it is you see that could drive stabilization in your same-store revenue growth in the back half of the year?","Al Campbell","I think, if we think about the forecast- this is Al, Austin, and I'll start with that and Tom can add some if he wants to. I think what we really think about it is, we're proud to see the trends that we've seen in the first half and we expect to continue to have good pricing trends, but remember we have dialed in about 20 basis points of occupancy that we will expect to give up and remaining over the back half due to continue to be aggressive on the pricing. And so I think given all that put together, and obviously we have the slower leasing season ahead of us. I think traffic will decline as we get into the 4th quarter, late 3rd and 4th quarters. I think all that together tells us that we feel like we have a good expectation in place and we feel good about that. I don't know if you have any more.","Tim Argo","Yes, I'd just say, I think we'll continue to make progress on the ERU growth with another month of blended pricing in at 5-3 above that.","Austin Wurschmidt","What month do you typically peak from a seasonality perspective?","Tim Argo","Last year we peaked in May. This year right now, the peak would be July, and too early to say where August will be.","Austin Wurschmidt","Okay. And then just last one for me. Based on kind of the refined supply analysis, you guys have done a lot of work on that front. But curious how the supply compares in the back half of the year versus the first half?","Eric Bolton","Austin, this is Eric. I would tell you that the, we think that the supply levels over the back half of the year probably are a little bit higher than what we saw in the first half. We continue to see a lot of evidence of delays occurring in the construction processes. A combination of construction labor shortage coupled with a lot of the regulatory our oversight processes that these cities and others inspections that have to get done, a lot of these cities really backlogged right now. So we have seen supply over the first half of this year come in a little less than we expected and really that's just delayed.","So I think that we're in a period right now we're just supply is going to continue to be fairly high, I think it's moving around a little bit, usually delayed a little bit for the reasons I just mentioned. Having said all that, I am comforted by the fact that I think we're also at a point where it's unlikely. We see a material increase in the supply levels, given the challenges that are continuing to mount on getting deals to pencil. So as a consequence of that, I just think that over the back half of this year, if I had to guess right now, I would tell you that it will be a little bit higher than what we saw the first half of this year. We'll have a lot more to say about 2020 later this year as we complete our more detailed analysis.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Trent Trujillo with Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Trent Trujillo","Hi, Good morning. Just following up really quickly on Austin's question there about supply in your previous disclosures, you mentioned about 48% of your NOI would have lower supply at 44% higher, and 8 about the same, roughly. That was earlier in the year with the shift of supply going in the second half does that dynamic change. Do you happen to have updated figures to think about how supply is impacting your NOI?","Thomas Grimes ","What I would tell you, Trent, is that I don't have the specifics here in front of me. And as I mentioned, we'll be doing a lot more detailed analysis on this as part of our budgeting process that gets under way later in the fall. But I would tell you that those numbers are, the percentage that's going to get better is going to be a little lower. The percentage is going to get worse, is going to be a little bit higher. And it's just shifting around a little bit over the course of this year, but as I say a lot of the delays that we've seen take place just put some of the stuff, more toward the back half of the year.","Trent Trujillo","Okay, I appreciate that context and look forward to the next update. As it relates to your updated dispositions guidance, it sounded like you're exiting Arkansas completely. Why are you making that decision and are and are other markets you're considering exiting given the pricing strength that you cited in terms of market deals?","Thomas Grimes","Our strategy surrounding dispositions is really built around almost really starting in an asset level and considering age of asset, CapEx requirements that may or may not be growing and sort of what the long-term value growth prospect is, comparing that to alternatives that we might be able to fine with that capital. ","As we began Little Rock's market, we've been in since our days of our IPO, the five properties that we, that we have there have an average age of roughly about 25 years old. So these are assets that we just felt like have reached a point in their life cycle, that we need to rotate out of. And we think better to exit the market altogether versus just pulling out two or three assets out of the market, given the size of that market. So that's what really drove us on that.","Going forward, as has been our approach, I mean we will look at this every year. I think it's important that we strive to cycle capital out of some of our older assets every year. And we will look at that going forward into next year. There'll be as it turns out a lot of our older assets tend to be in some of the smaller markets that we have where we also have, frankly, a little bit of inefficiency from an overhead perspective. So I think you'll see us continuing to work to clean that up over the next couple of years.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Your line is open.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. Just going back to lease lover-lease pricing. It's obviously strong on an absolute and year-over-year basis. But how does that spread versus last year trend within your expectations for the back half of this year?","Al Campbell","This is Nick, this is Al. I think as we look at the back half of the year we certainly have seen a great spread and a lot of momentum over the last couple of quarters for a lot of reasons, and Tom to talk about the reasons for that. I think when we look at the back half of the year, we are expecting that year-over-year spread to tighten a bit. ","Primarily related, as we talked about maybe moving into the softer leasing season or the more challenging leasing season, and you've got to remember and total revenue, when you look at that, we still have the 20 basis point occupancy. So I think in summary, we expect it to continue tightening. We hope to outperform that, but that's what we've outlined our plans on.","Thomas Grimes","I would just add to that, I think that to some degree some of the lift is occurring right now is coming out of some of the legacy post locations and it's a combination of just market dynamics coupled with frankly just a little bit more stability now on the operating side of the platform as it pertains to those properties. And we really began to see some early trends of that emerging late last year. And so as a consequence of now going a full year, I think that that will further support what Al's suggesting, that we'll see a little compression of that on a year-over-year basis.","Nicholas Joseph","Thanks. If it was 170 basis points in the second quarter, where could that spread go to in the back half?","Thomas Grimes","I think we expect in the fourth quarter, which is your most challenging, to be a pretty tight spread over the prior year, is kind of what we expect. And so that's, but again that, what's important to remember that's lease-over-lease that we're talking about here, and now the momentum that ultimately frankly really matters is what's happening with effective rent per unit, which really drives revenue. And we think that that momentum in ERU will continue as a consequence of what has been happening with lease release over the last five or six months.","Tim Argo","And certainly contemplated in the guidance, as you see. You can do the math on that Nick, but expected revenue is 2-8 year-to-date and 3 for the year, 3 and a quarter range average for the back half. So that, so we still have to have the trends playing into strengthen our portfolio. But this gap over the prior year in terms of that, just improvement of a trend, we expect that to narrow a bit as we get to the end of the year.","Nicholas Joseph ","Excellent, thanks. So then from a short-term funding perspective, how do you think about and expect to balance the use of the CP Program versus using the line?","Thomas Grimes ","We've got a little discussion on that as we put that and we're happy to put that program in, and first of all, and we think that is sort of them, one of the final ways we can use the strength of our balance sheet to lower our borrowing costs and we're using it, the way we're going to use it to just tell you is it's essentially do the same borrowings and we would have done on our line of credit. But just do it cheaper. I mean at the end of the day its working capital borrowings that we're targeting. And so you'll see the borrowings on our commercial paper go up, you'll see it come down, just like we would you would have seen our line of credit and our line of credit will stay closer to zero. ","And so we're doing that because there's some pretty significant savings in that, just using our balance sheet. We think we've gotten to little strong level now and so we're not increasing, we're not taking on marginal debt, and we're actually, you talked about the comments, we improving the average maturity of our debt extending it out. So we feel like that where we're getting cost savings, we're not adding risk or balance sheet and that's how we expect to use the program. Hopefully that answered your question.","Nicholas Joseph ","It does. So you'll use the line essentially as a backstop to the CP Program in case there is ever any issues on the CPE side?","Thomas Grimes ","Exactly right. And the program we're going to cap with capping our commercial paper borrowings of $500 million, have a $1 billion line, and to your point, fully stopping that. So we haven't, we see no risk to that program or low risk.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","John Kim","Thank you. On your blended lease growth rate assumption for the year, how realistic is even the midpoint of this because you got 3.9% in the first quarter, 5% second quarter, it looks like 3rd quarter probably will get at least what you did achieve in 2nd quarter. So you really need a huge drop-off down to about 2% to even if you have reach the midpoint of your guidance, can you just comment on that?","Thomas Grimes ","Well, I think it's going to be a couple of things that it's to some degree, what we've what we talked about a moment ago, and that we do see market conditions continue to be very competitive. We do think that as a consequence of supply delay in the first half of the year that is conceivable. We see a little bit more supply pressure in certain markets at certain locations in the back half of the year. ","So I think that factors into our thinking here a little bit, coupled with the fact, the second point being that we really began to get the momentum on the lease over lease performance in the back half of last year. And a lot of that, as I said was recovery taking place and some of the legacy post asset locations. As we now come full cycle, full year on that improvement trend the comparisons will get a little bit tougher. So I think that for a couple of reasons you'll just see the lease-over-lease comparisons get a little bit more challenging in that regard.","Tim Argo","And just make sure to add it is very common and expected in our, in our business in our model that in the fourth quarter because of slower traffic and things you will have a moderating blended lease over lease we've seen in the past, we expect that we expect to have good comparison compared to prior year, but that is a typical part of our business. I think when you think about that plus the occupancy decline that we built in a 20 basis points to continue to, to get that pricing that drives your total revenue.","Eric Bolton","Yes, I'll add John. I mean the midpoint of our lease-over-lease pricing 3.9, we are 4.5 year-to-date through June. So it's still implying a pretty strong, call it 3.5 lease-over-lease growth the full six months of the back half.","John Kim","And is there any update on the portfolio wide rebranding?","Thomas Grimes ","Nothing really to to talk about of substance at this point. It's something we continue to look at and refine and work on. We'll have more to say about that as we, as we go into next year.","John Kim","It's more of 2020 event.","Thomas Grimes","Yeah.","John Kim","Thank you.","Thomas Grimes","Thanks, John.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey, good morning. So a question on your investment activity. So you lowered your full-year acquisition expectations by $75 million despite an improved cost of capital here versus the start of the year. ","And given your comments earlier, it sounds like market pricing has reached levels you're not quite comfortable with. So what's your mindset here on perhaps more opportunistic dispositions? Any other markets beyond a Little rock that you may consider exiting on an opportunistic basis?","Eric Bolton","Hi, Haendel, this is Eric. I mean, our plans for the year, really, and the focus we have is limited to the Little Rock dispositions. We continue to think about looking for ways to continue to deploy capital to capture growth in between our free cash flow and the asset sales that we are triggering, that covers it and. ","And so, I mean broadly, we like the diversification, we have in our portfolio. We like the footprint, we like to balance between both some of the larger and some of the smaller markets. So there is nothing fundamental about the portfolio composition today that we think needs to be altered or needs to be changed. It's Just really just a combination of what our capital needs for supporting new growth and how do we fund that growth, and I think asset sales should always be a part of that effort.","And right now we are just finding that the best uses of capital, other than the redevelopment effort that we have, really centers on the in-house development that we're doing as well as some of the JV development that we're doing. We're essentially pre-purchasing something to be built, and when we look at the opportunities that we have to deploy capital at the moment, coupled with free cash flow in the cash proceeds were generated from the asset sales, all kind of works and keeps the balance sheet, strong and so doing anything beyond what we're doing at the moment, it doesn't seem to be something we need to do.","Haendel St. Juste","Got it, got it, helpful, thanks Eric. And maybe some more commentary on the land acquisitions in the quarter. Sounds like Orlando in Huntsville you're on track for late 2019 start. I think you previously mentioned in your development yield target 6, 6.5. So I'm curious how the current underwriting for those two projects compares to the overall pipeline and then maybe some color on how those yields compared to prevailing cap rates in those specific markets.","Eric Bolton","Just to be clear, the hunt you mentioned Huntsville, that was an asset sale. We're not buying land in Huntsville. But we did buy a site in downtown Orlando. We continue to believe that based on our latest underwriting that those, that property along with the others that we've forecasted is to start and we're going to be able to deliver a stabilized yield and that's 6 to 6.5 range. ","One of the things that we look at in an effort to make sure that we're deploying capital in a value-accretive manner is we take a look at what is the, cap rate that we will, could, that we're delivering, if you will, a new development at, using today's rents, looking at assumptions that we make regarding CapEx and the management fee and then what are all-in basis is going to be. ","And if we can deliver an asset today into the market at a 100 basis points or more spread in terms of the cap rate versus where assets are trading out in the market today, we think that's a value add. And every one of these properties that we're looking to tee up to start this year fit that hurdle easily. So we still think that it makes sense to continue moving ahead with the development that we are doing.","Haendel St. Juste","Thanks for the clarification, but within the, what assumptions for rent growth and expense growth are embedded within that stabilized yield protection?","Eric Bolton","Usually we assume zero to 1%, if anything, in the first year or two. And by the time we get to actually starting to deliver units, that first year we're delivering units. I guess, again it will a very by market, will vary by project, but it may be 2% to 3%. And of course you know when you factor in what we always assume some kind of lease-up concessions that we bring into it, t brings the effective rent growth down 2% or less. So it is fairly modest assumptions obviously during the construction in the lease-up period before we get to a stabilized situation where,- and leasing concessions can be burned off and then you get into more of a normalized 3 to 3.5, whatever, depending on the market. Depending on the particular location.","Haendel St. Juste","On the expense side, any trending there or the cost fairly locked in?","Eric Bolton","We usually trend that pretty consistent at 2.5% to 3%, and we kind of start that on day one. I mean generally during, in the modeling in the first year or two during the development period, I mean, our expense growth rate exceeds our revenue growth rate.","Haendel St. Juste","Thank you.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Drew Babin with Baird. Your line is open.","Drew Babin","Good morning. This is Alex on for Drew, just one quick one for us. We were curious if you could break down the leasing performance of Post and legacy MAA assets and Atlanta, Dallas and Charlotte given you guys impressive performance year-to-date? We're just curious on what the position is in those really important markets and are hoping to hear the Post is really flowing through to the P&L at this point.","Eric Bolton","Yes, I mean the Post movement certainly helped us. Blended for Mid America is 5.3, Post is 3.9 on an overall basis, but when you take just the assets for Post in Austin, Dallas, Atlanta, Charlotte they're like 340 basis points better than last year, and so that's, has helped a great deal.","Drew Babin","That's very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open.","Rob Stevenson","Good morning, guys. Tom, most of your markets are outperforming expectations, but where do you see this sort of pockets of weakness or the smallest level of outperformance among your major markets?","Thomas Grimes ","Yeah, Rob, I would say, you know, I mean you can look at the numbers and sort of being comparative Dallas is weaker, but it is, it's sort of moved along at a good pace. The two markets that were a little weaker than we expected were really Houston and Orlando. And those are there still pretty, they are both doing fairly well. We just expected a little more blended progress out of those in the first half of the year than we got.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then why was the per-unit redevelopment cost so low in the second quarter? You were about $600 per unit lower than the first quarter.","Thomas Grimes ","It's likely just mix on that, Rob. I mean, no real changes with it, but it just depends on where the availability comes on it, whether it's a high cost renovate, we just did more lower than higher this time around. But no real strategy shift and it will change again.","Rob Stevenson","So you did skinny redevelopments?","Thomas Grimes","I'm sorry, say again, your block there a little bit.","Rob Stevenson","Yes, so you were, so-called skinny redevelopments, where you just do kitchen and no bath, or a bath and no kitchen and things of that nature. That did not factor into the mix?","Thomas Grimes","No, we didn't, we didn't change our strategy there. Just, just to which units turn or what generated the difference.","Rob Stevenson","Okay. And then last one for me. Al, the preferred derivative numbers, is that a one-time item or is that a recurring sort of amortizing thing?","Al Campbell","Yeah, you know, what will happen is it will slowly over time amortized, we have an asset on the balance sheet now because of the favorability that's built up in that, and it was recorded initially. It will slowly, for about nine more years, amortize off, but it's going to be very volatile with primarily interest rate changes. Rob. So there's no cash value that, no change in our business. I mean it's really, it's frustrating us. ","But what we do, as you saw in our guidance, we had a very favorable amount this quarter purely related to the change in interest rates we thought that volatile, who knows what's going to happen. We just like to take that out. And so in the 4th quarter, we said the year-to-date favorability of $0.03 we took it out in the 4th quarter and has zero impact on earnings for this year. That's the way we prefer you guys think about it, that's really how we think about it. And so that's kind of how we do it.","Rob Stevenson","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is now open.","John Guinee","Great, thank you, and nice quarter. I'm looking at your development strategy you've got about 1,100 units under construction right now, mostly in the early phases then some in lease-up, and I think you said you were going to announce four more in addition to what you've got on page S-8. Is there a trend? Because what we see throughout the industry is more movement away from high-rise and podium and into wrap and garden, and more move maybe into secondary locations where land can be acquired at a more reasonable number. Any trends, you could comment on?","Eric Bolton","I think you're right. John, I think we are seeing more suburban garden-style or mid-rise wrap out in some of these satellite cities and\/or suburban locations and less downtown, city-type. Development of the four projects that will begin later this year, one is in downtown area of Orlando. The other three are out in satellite, market satellite cities in Denver and Houston and in Orlando. So I think you're right, I think you're just you're seeing some of the capital migrate more to, away from some of the more inner city type locations.","John Guinee","And any comment on wraps versus podium, in terms of what it cost to build and where you're getting, you see a better return right now?","Eric Bolton","Usually the wrap is going to be a little bit better, but for us right now. I mean all three of the locations that we're looking at are surface park. So we, it varies a bit. In course numbers the are, the cost are moving around a little bit as some of the impact of tariffs and other things start to start to make an impact.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Hardik Goel with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Hardik Goel","Hi guys, nice quarter. Thanks for taking my question. You guys, January I think it was, or maybe before that in March. You guys put out the margin for the Post portfolio and your MAA legacy portfolio, and that was quite a spread there. What is the spread today and where do you expect it to go, maybe over the next couple of years, just longer term?","Thomas Grimes ","We don't have it right in front of us at the moment on the, where it is right now, but I would tell you, obviously the gap is closing. I mean we fully anticipate that the legacy Post margin, Post asset margin will surpass the legacy MAA margin at some point. I think we're probably another couple of years away from that as the redevelopment effort continues to work its way through that, that portfolio. We got a lot of the expense gains are ready and that, and that's what help close the gap. As Tom's alluded to, we're seeing great pricing momentum out of the legacy Post locations now, and I think is going to continue to work on that gap and it will close more over the next year or so. ","And then is the redevelopment continues to kick in, I think it will, it will, at some point it will surpass it. I mean, that was ultimately one of the things that compelled us on the merger transaction itself, was that when you look at the two portfolios side by side, recognizing that the Post locations commanded an average rent structure that was $500 more per month than what legacy MAA was commanding, but yet legacy MAA had a 100 basis point higher operating margin. We knew there is opportunity there. And we'll see that continue to emerge over the next couple of years.","Operator","And we will go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Wes Golladay","Yes, good morning guys. As we look to the second half of the year, are you seeing any sub-markets that stand out as you may know, causing maybe the biggest variance to your forecast at the end of the year from developers offering a lot of concessions and that, would be not even, not available to push rate, any occupancy risk, sort of like we had in uptown Texas a few years ago?","Thomas Grimes ","That Uptown deal happen kind of as the first, the leading edge of supply hit that market, and I think in most places. I'm trying to think of an exception right now Wes, and I can't. The pipeline is pretty steady and I think we will see it taper off in the back half of the year, as it always does seasonally, but I don't see us going over a cliff on pricing in any one market at this point.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And how is the Dallas market progressing for you? Is supply now starting to move to different markets? Do you see a gradually improving as we get through next year?","Thomas Grimes ","The, Dallas is, I mean there is a fair amount of supply moving through the system. It is competitive, but we are making better progress there. So Dallas as a group, blended pricing is up 250 basis points. So we're handling well, demand is excellent, but we're going to need demand to stay intact for it to continue. But we like the progress that we've made in Dallas, and particularly in uptown .","Wes Golladay","Okay and then just for the portfolio level, how is rent to income trending for new residents?","Thomas Grimes ","It hasn't really budged. It's right there and that 19% to 20% range, and very, very steady.","Wes Golladay","Great, thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Your line is open.","John Pawlowski","Thanks. Eric, what type of blended cap rate do you think you could fetch on the Arkansas portfolio sale?","Eric Bolton","You know, we will see. I mean we are in the market right now, but I would anticipate something in the 5.5 range.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Tom, apologies if I missed this. Marketing costs were up 10%. Are you guys doing anything different on the concession front for your stabilized same-store pull?","Eric Bolton","No, we are not, that is not gift cards. Thank you for asking that question, John. We had some one-time expenses with, related to the ramp of our new marketing platform. Expect that to trend down over the last half of the year and being more normalized range for marketing. It never occurred to me to address that in that way, and I really appreciate you asking that.","John Pawlowski","Not coupons, and not gift cards, it's not --","Eric Bolton","It is none of those things. Al will let me do any of those things.","John Pawlowski","Okay. Alright, thank you.","Operator","And will take our final question from Buck Horne with Raymond James, your line is open.","Buck Horne","Hey, thanks for the time, appreciate it. Just following up on the expenses, and the operating expense guidance here. And I know property taxes have kind of been out of your control to a degree here, and I understand the comment about a tougher year-over-year comp against the savings from Post last year, but I guess the question is why weren't those savings that were achieved a little bit more sustainable on a year-over-year basis? I'm just wondering, I know you're at an elevated level historically, but why weren't those overall operating level synergies more sustainable?","Thomas Grimes","They were sustained. I think that our point is, I mean we captured those efficiencies, they are now, if you will, memorialized into our system. And so we absolutely believe that the synergies that we captured the last couple of years in the margin improvement that came from that is very much intact. ","I think the point really is just that is there is some, it's not so much inflation, to some degree, it's, I mean, you're seeing some wage inflation and you're seeing some level of material, maintenance material cost rise, taking place and so our ability to rework to staffing model or rework the model that we did last year on how we turn apartments and how we staff for that, those gains have already been captured and they are still there, but we don't have the gain this year to offset the rise that we see taking place in some of these other line items. ","So that's really the point that we're making. But, but for absolute certain the gains that we have made over the last years are very much intact.","Eric Bolton","I'll on to that. In our long-term history book, and you will know this is one of the things we've seen is very good expense control has been about 2.5% on average, 3% this year is really that some of the pressure from a real estate taxes and as Tom mentioned, in the back half of the year some of the other expense lines are going to moderate a little bit and get us that 3%. So I think we still a long term expect 2.5% range with a short-term impact from taxes as that hopefully moderates over the next couple of years as cap rates remain stable.","Buck Horne","Now, that's very helpful color, I appreciate that very much. And just real quick on the acquisition guidance reduction, just how competitive it is out there, and just wondering if you can maybe just add a little bit of color in terms of what you're seeing and how competitive the bidders are? Just, I think you mentioned earlier in the call that cap rates were stable but it seems to suggest if you're, with your improved cost of capital and how competitive things are out there if you're having to reduce the guidance. It seems like yields might be compressing out there in any extra thoughts you may have there?","Eric Bolton","I do think yields are compressing. I think that we are seeing as a consequence of efforts by a lot of private equity to get the capital deployed that they are, they are at a point where I mean, they're either getting much more aggressive on their underwriting assumptions in terms of rent growth or other line item expectations, or they're compromising yields a little bit. I don't think there has been a material shift in cost of capital for them, per se, other than just they're forcing a more modest return on some of the equity that that they perhaps we're hoping to get earlier. So I think yields are compressing a little bit.","Buck Horne","Any chance you could kind of quantify what you think Class A or Class B and core Southeastern markets is going for these days?","Eric Bolton","I mean it's the is compressed a good bit, I mean we're routinely seeing Class A assets are trading 4.25 to 4.75 range in terms of cap rate, in older B asset may be 5 to 5.5 range. It depends on the market, but it's, in some cases even lower than that on the Bs. If you think there is a redevelopment or repositioning opportunity that's where you see a lot of aggressive activity occurring where you'll see a 10 to 15 year old asset trade in some cases, at a sub 5, the cost, the plan is to go in and do a massive upgrade and I think they'll get massive rent growth as a result and get the returns they're after and therefore they they'll pay out big time upfront.","Buck Horne","Great, very helpful, thank you.","Operator","And we will take another question. It comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Your line is open.","Richard Anderson","Hi, thanks for taking it. I jumped on late. Was a topic of rent control brought up at all on the call yet?","Thomas Grimes ","No, it was not, Rich.","Richard Anderson","And so I guess the question is do you have any, any of that percolating through your portfolio in terms of something that could be coming down the pike that you have to defend? I'm just curious if that's happening anywhere. It's big news item in California and New York.","Thomas Grimes ","Right, no, to be honest with you, we're not seeing really much happening in any of our markets are any dialog along those lines. In Denver, we've seen a little conversation taking place out there, but I do think that we are very alert to the growing issue of housing affordability. For the most part throughout our Southeast markets where we see the issue kind of coming up is new development starts requiring a certain affordability component to what they do, and a certain percent of the units have to be limited in terms of the rent that can be charged and at this point anything beyond that is not something that we see being actively talked about. But we're staying very closely attuned to lot of the local associations and state apartment associations and it's something we're all watching very closely.","Richard Anderson","Okay, great. That's all I have. Thanks very much","Thomas Grimes ","Thanks, Rich. Thanks so much.","Operator","This does conclude the Q&A session. I would like to turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional comments.","Tim Argo","All right. Nothing else on our end appreciate everyone joining us this morning and will see everyone, I'm sure later this year. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at any time.

Ms. Wolfgang, you may begin.","Leslie Bratten Cantrell Wolfgang","Thank you, Justin, and good morning, everyone. This is Leslie Wolfgang, Corporate Secretary for MAA. With me this morning are Eric Bolton, our CEO; Al Campbell, our CFO; Tom Grimes, our COO; and Tim Argo, SVP of Finance.","Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of the discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the Safe Harbor language included in yesterday\u2019s press release and our 34-Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results. These reports, along with a copy of today\u2019s prepared comments and an audio copy of this morning\u2019s call, will be available on our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Eric.","H. Eric Bolton","Thanks, Leslie, and good morning. We appreciate everyone joining our call this morning. Core FFO for the fourth quarter of $1.20 per share was $0.06 per share better than we expected, with higher NOI performance and lower G&A cost driving the favorable result. Same-store physical occupancy at year-end was a solid 95% and put us in a good position heading into 2014.","During the fourth quarter, the same-store rent per unit increased 3.2% as compared to the prior year. Resident turnover remains low, with the same-store portfolio posting a 5% decline compared to the prior year. Move-out associated with buying a home were consistent with the prior year, driving 21% of total move-outs, and move-outs associated with renting a house continue to be a nonfactor and remain low, driving only 6% of our total move-outs.","As outlined in our 2014 guidance, we expect leasing conditions across the portfolio to remain healthy this year, with same-store revenues increasing 3.5% to 4.5%, occupancy holding steady and rent growth driving revenues.","Looking at the latest forecast of new supply deliveries and job growth, we expect leasing fundamentals across our markets in 2014 will remain steady, as the ratio of new jobs to new supply is forecasted to be in the 8:1 range across our same-store portfolio. We expect to see our best performances in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix and Nashville.","The ratio for our Secondary Markets segment of the portfolio continues to also suggest steady leasing conditions, with the ratio of new jobs to new supply improving slightly in 2014 to a ratio of 10:1.","Our portfolio strategy has historically focused on an objective of achieving a balanced, or what we refer to as a full-cycle performance profile, with the goal of lessening some of the cyclicality in performance that is generally driven by new supply pressures.","We believe that our newly merged portfolio with Colonial has enabled us to retain, and in fact, strengthen this objective. Our redevelopment program completed just over 2,500 units in 2013, and we generated, on average, an incremental 11% increase in rents. We're expanding the program this year as a result of our merger, and expect to complete redevelopment on approximately 4,000 units in 2014.","Our expanded program this year will remain consistent with the parameters that we've been executing on for the past several years, with a focus on unit interior rehab and above-market rent increases in the 10% range.","Leasing momentum continues to go well at our 4 lease-up properties, and we expect to have the entire pipeline stabilized by year -- midyear. In addition, construction continues to be on budget at our 5 new development properties, with our projects in Orlando and Charleston scheduled to complete construction this quarter. We expect to achieve stabilization on this new development pipeline starting late this year and into early 2015.","While we're currently looking at a number of other new development projects, we expect future funding commitments associated with new development to moderate for MAA over the next year or 2. We instead prefer to be focused on sourcing opportunistic acquisition opportunities of new development at this point in the cycle. We continue to actively work on recycling capital from the remaining commercial properties and land assets acquired in our merger with Colonial.","We completed the sale of the retail center Colonial Town Park in the fourth quarter and are currently negotiating sale contracts on 4 of the remaining 5 operating commercial properties. In addition, we remain committed to a program of steadily recycling capital from a number of older multifamily properties, closing on the sale of $131 million of apartment properties in 2013.","We expect to increase our disposition program this year and are looking to sell approximately $150 million of apartment assets. In addition, as mentioned, we are also focused on continuing to recycle the non-core commercial and land assets from the former Colonial balance sheet, and as a result, expect to sell a little over $300 million of assets this year.","And while the acquisition market remains very competitive, I'm hopeful that one of the outcomes from the increase in new development activity in a number of markets is more opportunities to opportunistically add new properties to the portfolio later this year and into 2015. We've targeted $250 million in new acquisitions this year, with approximately $60 million of this associated with our planned buyout of our partners' interest in our joint venture Mid-America Fund II.","Merger integration activities continue to go well, and we're making great progress on establishing a fully consolidated operating and reporting platform. Thus far, our team has completed the conversion and consolidation of all payroll human resource systems, general ledger and accounts payable. We're now underway with the conversion to a common property management system and expect to have this important process completed by early summer. As we capture full consolidation of our operating and pricing systems, we remain confident in the opportunities to be captured from higher efficiency and scale.","Now I want to also express my thanks and appreciation to all our folks who have been working so hard to ensure we were in a position to operate and execute as a combined platform in 2014. We still have more integration work to do, and I believe some great opportunity to capture later this year and into 2015. But we're off to a terrific start. And I appreciate the hard work and success thus far.","That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. And I'm going to turn the call over to Al.","Albert M. Campbell","Okay. Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's fourth quarter earnings performance, the balance sheet activity for the quarter, and then finally, on our initial earnings guidance for 2014.","As we outlined in the release, given the October 1 close of the Colonial merger, fourth quarter results reflect a full quarter of combined activity, with year-to-date results representing 3 quarters of MAA stand-alone activity and 1 quarter of combined operation.","Core FFO for the fourth quarter, which excludes nonroutine items, primarily the merger and integration costs, was $95 million or $1.20 per share, which was $0.06 per share above the midpoint of previous guidance provided. And about 1\/3, or $0.02 per share, of this favorable performance was produced by the combined same-store portfolio, primarily favorable operating expenses, and the remaining 2\/3, or $0.04 per share, was produced by favorable G&A and interest expense combined, mainly related to merger activities.","The combined same-store portfolio NOI grew 3.5% for the quarter based on 3.2% growth in revenues, which was produced by 3.2% growth in effective rent. And operating expenses grew 2.8% for the quarter, despite pressure from a 7% growth in real estate taxes, which are about 1\/4 of our total operating expenses.","The legacy MAA and Colonial portfolios performed essentially in line during the fourth quarter, with the Colonial portfolio operating expenses benefiting in Q4 from the initial savings on combining the insurance programs, which produced about a 60 basis points expense growth improvement for the quarter.","As mentioned in the release, we acquired one recently developed community located in Fredericksburg, Virginia, during the quarter, for $45.2 million, and sold one older community located in LaGrange, Georgia, for $10.4 million. These transactions bring our year-to-date acquisition volume to $129.2 million, including the remaining interest of joint venture communities acquired, and our disposition volume to $131.3 million total for the year.","Following the end of the quarter, we acquired the remaining 2\/3 interest in 2 communities from the Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, our remaining legacy MAA joint venture, for $38.8 million, and we assumed loans totaling $31.7 million. Also, following the end of the quarter, we closed on the sale of a community located in Columbus, Georgia, for gross proceeds of $10.6 million. This sale completed our disposition plans originally projected to all close in 2013.","Construction and lease-up on our development pipeline continued to progress well. We funded an additional $25 million toward our multifamily development pipeline during the fourth quarter. We now have 5 communities, totaling 1,461 units under construction, with $68.5 million remaining to complete them. We also have 4 communities remaining in lease-up at the end of the year, with average occupancy of about 82%. And 2 of the communities are expected to stabilize during the first quarter, and the remaining 2 are expected to stabilize during the second quarter.","Following the merger with Colonial, our balance sheet remains strong and flexible. And during the fourth quarter, we completed our inaugural bond offering, issuing $350 million in 10-year unsecured notes, and we successfully exchanged $392 million or 87% of the outstanding Colonial public bonds for MAA notes, leaving $742 million of total MAA public bonds outstanding at year-end. This exchange eliminates redundant in cost-reporting requirements, and the increased volume of bonds outstanding through MAA's operating partnership is expected to enhance investor liquidity.","At year-end, 62% of our assets at costs are encumbered, 48% of our debt is unsecured, and 97% of our debt is fixed or hedged against rising interest rates, with maturities laddered well over the next few years. Our leverage was 42.4%, based on gross assets, and our coverage ratios also remain very strong, with total interest coverage of 3.4x and fixed charge coverage of 3.6x for the quarter based on recurring EBITDA. And at year-end, we had $586 million of cash and credit available under our line of credit.","Finally, we are providing initial guidance for 2014 with the release. There will be some continued noise related to the merger and importing earnings for 2014, so we're giving guidance on a core FFO basis, which does exclude merger-related and other nonroutine items, really with the goal of providing more clarity and comparability to prior periods. We also added a fair amount of detail in our supplemental schedules with the press release to help model the company performance.","Core FFO for 2014 is projected to be $4.80 to $5 per share, which is $4.90 at the midpoint, based on projected average shares of about 79.1 million. And as we expected, core FFO for 2014 is impacted by the initial dilution from the non-productive development pipeline and land parcels acquired from Colonial -- from the Colonial merger, along with the continued recycling of commercial multifamily assets, as Eric mentioned.","As previously discussed in our investor presentations, we believe there's a combined $0.30 to $0.45 per share of additional earnings to capture over the next few years beyond the $25 million of stated synergies that we've been discussing. And we continue to bring the Colonial assets to the same productive level, our balance sheet will capture these over the next couple of years.","Core FFO per share is expected to range between $1.12 to $1.24 in the first quarter and between $1.18 and $1.30 for the remaining 3 quarters of 2014. The primary driver of 2014 performance is expected to be continued, steady NOI growth from our same-store portfolio. Our estimate includes full-year, same-store NOI from the combined portfolio of 4% to 5%, based on a 3.5% to 4.5% growth in revenues and a 3% to 4% growth in operating expenses.","We generally expect continued strong pricing performance and stable occupancy levels through the year. We expect real estate taxes to be a continued area of pressure on operating expenses, projected to increase 6% to 7% for 2014.","We expect to be net sellers in 2014, with acquisition volume projected to range $200 million to $300 million for the year, and disposition volume, in total, commercial and multifamily, to range $250 million to $300 million for the year. We also plan to fund an additional $65 million to $70 million toward completion of the current development pipeline.","Total overhead, consisting of property management and G&A cost combined, is expected to range between $55 million and $57 million for the full year, with the full $25 million of projected synergies -- stated synergies captured by year end on a run-rate basis.","Total combined transaction costs related to the merger are expected to be $55 million to $60 million in total, including $32.5 million incurred by MAA in 2013 and $18.5 million incurred premerger by Colonial. We expect to incur an additional $9 million to $10 million of combined merger and integration cost during 2014, and these transaction and integration costs are all in line with our original underwriting and expectations.","Other key assumptions include plans to access the public bond market around midyear to refinance the $450 million in maturing debt. And given the current level of projected asset dispositions, our current expectations don't include the need for any new equity during the year. We expect total leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, to end the year between 42% and 45%.","And that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Justin, I'll turn the call over to you for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David Toti from Cantor Fitzgerald.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just a couple of questions, Eric. Can you go into a bit more detail, if possible, on the sort of scope and the timing of the asset sales and specifically, what kind of valuations we could expect to see on some of those?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, we have roughly a little over $150 million of commercial assets. These are operating assets that we picked up from the Colonial merger. And the values, I mean we're -- 4 of the 5 are under contract, we're in the market with the fifth one currently. But I probably shouldn't get into pricing specifically at this point, given sort of where we are in the process. But I can tell you that the pricing we have on all these are well within what we expected in our original underwriting and we feel good about the values and the pricing we're looking at now. What's important to keep in mind is that on these commercial assets, these are all assets that are going to be -- being office and retail, going to be selling at a much higher cap rate than what we're planning to reinvest in multifamily. So they are particularly dilutive as we cycle that capital, at least near term, but we certainly believe important to get back to our focus solely on apartment real estate. The other -- the balance of the plans for the year is roughly about $150 million-or-so of multifamily assets. We sold, as we mentioned, about $130 million last year. We think it's important to continue this steady process of cycling out of some of the older assets. And again, there's some dilution associated with that. It represents, really, about 11 or so properties that we've teed up for next year. And so that really is -- the spread on that is about 100 to 120 basis points is the assumption, in terms of the dilution associated with the recycling on the multifamily. But that hopefully gives you a little perspective, David.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Yes. And then -- and relative to the multifamily, can we expect some of the -- some of those assets to be in sort of the non-core markets, like South Florida, Vegas and so forth?","H. Eric Bolton","Yes. But frankly, what we're really -- it's not Vegas, I mean, is not targeted, neither is South Florida. I mean, frankly, what we're really targeting are the older and lower-margin investments that we have. And as it so happens, a lot of the older assets that we have are in some of the more tertiary markets in the portfolio. And so what you're going to likely see -- what you will see over the next couple of years is continued cycling out of some of the more tertiary markets. There'll be a few in some of the bigger markets like a Charlotte and a Dallas, but it's really driven more by a belief that we can reinvest the capital into higher yielding -- or higher margin, and higher -- longer term sort of value-creation investments and -- but I also want to quickly add though, as I've said in the past, we very much remain committed to this belief in allocating capital between large and secondary markets. So as we are more active in recycling within the Secondary Segment of the portfolio, it's really moving capital out of some of the more tertiary markets into other secondary markets. So it'll be moving out of Valdosta, out of Columbus, Georgia, markets like that into Charleston, Savannah, Greenville, Kansas City, some that we offer -- we believe offer a little bit more dynamic job growth.","David Toti - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just tack one more small question on, Al. Is there a subtext to some of this churn to lower overall leverage for the firm? Are you comfortable with current levels?","Albert M. Campbell","I would say, David, we're pretty comfortable right now with current leverage. But over time, we would expect to bring that in a little bit, as we continue to work through this process over the next couple of years. But we're in the 42% to 45% range right now. We'll probably stay at the low end of that and over the next couple of years, continue to go down. But for right now, we're comfortable.","H. Eric Bolton","And let me also just quickly add on that point, though, that I think it's important when you start to think about leverage levels and you look across the sector at various leverage levels, I think the balance sheet leverage and where the balance sheet -- and how the balance sheet is being managed, needs to reconcile to how the company -- what the company's overall strategy is. If we were a big developer, and we had a big development pipeline with a plan to continue a big future funding commitment to our strategy, I can tell you that I would be pushing to get our leverage much lower than it is right now. But as you know, that is not what we do. And so I think you have to reconcile your leverage and your balance sheet strategy to what you're trying to do overall as a company.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ryan Bennett with Zelman & Associates.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Just curious, just based on your performance in the fourth quarter with occupancy loss in both the Mid-America and Colonial portfolio and then based on your comments that occupancy is staying roughly flat over the next year, I'm just curious, what are you expecting in terms of your rent growth trajectory for both your Large and your Secondary Markets in 2014?","Albert M. Campbell","I'll give you the overall blend. This is Al, Ryan. And I can tell you what we're expecting for the year. In terms of performance for the year, we're expecting pricing and -- occupancy to be stable, pricing to be about what it is, slightly moderated. First quarter carrying the fourth quarter trends in and then second and third quarter, beginning to have a little higher velocity because those are the high-traffic months. But for the year, the overall price performance, I think, a little less for the typical portfolio than we had this year. Now remember, in the guidance, we do have impact also from opportunities from the Colonial, from synergies and so for that portfolio, there's a little more than just a normal performance expected in revenues this year that does impact that top line.","Thomas L. Grimes","And Ryan, on the occupancy front, we don't look at that as an odd trade off on occupancy trending down a little bit from third quarter to fourth is normal seasonality, and we wouldn't expect it to stay flat at this point. We would expect it to grow over time across-the-board. And the -- so to say, it's important to draw distinction between the shift in the MAA portfolio and the shift in the Colonial portfolio. On the occupancy side, you've got to look past the actual ending physical occupancy and look at the average daily for the effective occupancy. For MAA it was 94.7% in the fourth quarter -- or in the third quarter, and moved down to 94.2%. Just a drop of a few basis points, which is perfectly seasonal. On the COP side, you really have to go back and look at the -- and look at their goal for the third quarter, which was to bring occupancy up from the mid-94% that it was at the beginning of the third quarter. They did that beautifully, but gave up a little bit of rent on that and probably overshot the mark. So they came into the fourth quarter with sub-7% 60-day exposure. And so their tradeoff was a little bit less. We expect occupancy to grow from this point forward, we're at 95.2% for January and in good shape on exposure.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. I appreciate the color there. Al, just back to your point on the Colonial assets and the rent growth. Is that something that we can expect in the back half of the year, as you talked about those assets coming online with your revenue management system?","Albert M. Campbell","I think you can expect 2 things Ryan: one is, as Tom mentioned, in the second and third quarter, you have a very favorable comparison because when we started talking about the merger last June, there was a slip in occupancy in their portfolio in the second quarter. They worked hard in the third quarter to get it back, got it back, but there will be some favorable year-over-year in the second, some in the third quarter. And then in the third and fourth quarter, you will begin to see the impact of some of these synergies as some redevelopment program and some of these other things that we're doing begin to play through the portfolio. So more in the second, third and fourth quarter, you'll see that.","Ryan H. Bennett - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Got it. All right. And just to follow-up quickly, just on the redevelopment. In terms of your level of spend that you're expecting this year and how much of that will be, maybe, at the Colonial assets versus MAA?","Thomas L. Grimes","Yes, we'll do -- Ryan, we'll do about 4,000 units and that is about doubling our current pipeline. And 2,000 of those units will be in the Colonial side. They did not have a similar program.","Albert M. Campbell","And for -- just to give you context about same cost level, which will put you in the 18 -- in the around $18 million, or $15 million to $20 million let's say, we'll spend for the full year, Ryan.","Operator","And we'll go next to Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of more questions on guidance, on the same-store revenue growth guidance that you have, can you just break it down -- what you're going -- expecting between the small versus the large markets and what you're expecting Colonial versus the Mid-America portfolio to do in 2014?","Albert M. Campbell","Karin, we really don't specifically breakdown between Large and Secondary on that, we do it property level build it up. I don't think that's something that we've typically want to really put out on our guidance. I'll say to you, we do expect the Large Markets in our projections to, as we talked about, have stable performance, but moderate a little bit and our Secondary Markets to tighten up a little bit, close that range a bit. Not to close it, I mean it's -- the gap is pretty large at this point. We do see some progress in 2014. But not the full gap close.","H. Eric Bolton","We do think, as Al says, I mean, we do think the Secondary Market component of the portfolio will be a stronger performance for us in '14 than it was in '13. Certainly the gap will begin to moderate a little bit. We look for this component of the portfolio to be a real stabilizing influence in our performance. And we certainly think that's going to be the case this year. On the other sort of part of your question regarding sort of the difference in '14 between the sort of legacy MAA and the legacy Colonial portfolio, we do think that the Colonial portfolio will outperform a little bit in '14 relative to MAA, only because of kind of the points that Al was mentioning earlier, we think that there is some opportunity on sort of the yield management side, particularly in Q2 and Q3, to do some things to address some of the things that took place last year in '13, not have those things repeat in '14, and we think on a net basis, that's going to ultimately drive a higher level of revenue result out of Colonial portfolio than it is out of MAA. But on a blended basis, you got the number there.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Next question, on guidance. What is included in the core guidance, with respect to the mark-to-market adjustment?","Albert M. Campbell","The market-to-market (sic) [mark-to-market] adjustment was, in total, about $90 million, that we put in our balance sheet with the merger. And I think, what we have in our fourth quarter, is it $24 million, Tim? I think there is expected to be $24 million to $25 million for 2014. But I'll tell you, Karin, we are wanting to -- as we looked at 2014, this is the first time we're putting out guidance for the year, obviously. And as we looked at the projections, and analysts put out for '14 before we had this guidance out. It really was all over the place, and we were trying, we're trying very hard to give a lot of details in this call and in the supplements to help really focus and put everybody on the same page if we can. I'll say that to say, we are focusing on core FFO, which will exclude the merger cost and will exclude that fair market value adjustment. Now that is a favorable non-cash favorable adjustment that hits FFO -- NAREIT FFO, but we looked at it, since it's noncash, we thought the right thing to do for investors was to pull that out and just show core FFO without that. So we -- I will tell you, that's a number, it's going to be $24 million, $25 million this year, but we're going to exclude that in our core FFO.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","No. That's helpful. Can you just talk about -- I know you mentioned earlier that the cap rates on the dispositions, including -- especially the commercial sales, is going to be higher than what you're buying on the acquisition side. Without giving specific cap rates, can you just talk about what you think the spread will be on cap rates between dispositions and acquisitions this year?","Albert M. Campbell","On the commercial, you're talking 250 basis points, Karin. It's pretty -- because the Commercial they're -- they're higher, typically higher yielding, higher cap rate assets, so you're talking 250 basis points.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And on the multifamily that you're selling versus buying?","H. Eric Bolton","Probably about 100.","Albert M. Campbell","A little over 100.","H. Eric Bolton","Yes.","Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And just last question, you mentioned in your remarks that you prefer acquisitions over developments today. Can you just talk about why -- what you're seeing in sort of the environment and what causes you to feel that way?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, I think it really is just a realization that there's a lot of development in a number of these markets. It's coming online, particularly in the markets, a lot of these Sunbelt markets, a lot of this development is taking place by developers who are not really in the business of owning this product long term. And we've demonstrated a history. I mean, frankly, just -- we've had the opportunity to compare yields that we're getting on some of the development that we have in some cases prepurchased, or development that we have bought in a more opportunistic way and contrasted that against the yields that we're getting on the development that Colonial was doing. And I can tell you that the spreads, the yields are right on top of each other. And so from my perspective, particularly at this part of the cycle, where there's more supply coming into the market, we just feel, on a risk-adjusted basis, that we can bring brand-new product on to the balance sheet at yields and value that is equivalent to what the yields would be if we were building it ourselves. And, of course, we are not taking on the risk to do that. And so we just continue to believe that one of the ways that you sort of manage the balance sheet and manage long-term earnings in this region of the country is to be very -- in my mind, you really limit how much you want to do in development. In particular, this part of the cycle, you want to be more on the buying side as opposed to the development side.","Operator","And we'll go next to Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory A. Van Winkle - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is actually Greg Van Winkle standing in for Haendel. First, just want to get a little more clarity on the Colonial merger synergies and how that's impacting your guidance for same-store NOI growth? Assuming there's some property level synergies baked into that 4% to 5% guidance you put out, could you quantify the impact of the synergies on that same-store NOI guidance for us?","Albert M. Campbell","I can, Greg. This is Al. And as we talked about, we expect some synergies, both in the revenue line and in the expense line. Probably a little more expense in 2014, call it, 60-40 split. We have somewhere in the $5 million to $6 million range, I think, that we expect to capture in the year related to that. And if you do the math and back into it, you're talking somewhere in the 75 to 100 basis points impact on the combined portfolio NOI performance, for the quarter -- I mean, for the year.","Gregory A. Van Winkle - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just one more, if I could. Could you give us a little color on what you're seeing in financing availability for the assets in the secondary and tertiary markets? We've been hearing that the financing environment is kind of drying up a little bit at the lower-quality end, which it sounds like it's mostly what you're selling. I just wanted to get your take on that.","H. Eric Bolton","Well, we haven't really seen any evidence of that. As mentioned, we just closed on the sale of a property in Columbus, Georgia. We were pretty active in the market up until third and fourth quarter of last year and all the deals that we had under contract, our sellers, often private capital sources, they were -- everything worked, I mean they got the financing. There was no real pushback or re-trade on anything. So certainly, having been out to the National Multifamily Housing Council's Annual Meeting a couple of weeks ago, I mean, the appetite for our product is, I can tell you, huge. And there's a lot of people interested and I think that there's no indication that we've seen that financing is a problem.","Operator","And we'll go next to Josh Patinkin from -- with BMO Capital.","Joshua Patinkin","So it looks like exposure to Large Markets increased with Colonial's portfolio, and with job growth to new supply stronger in small markets, I'm curious, 2-part question, what are the dynamics that contribute to that? And second, why not pursue more development in smaller markets right now?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, the dynamics contributing to -- I mean, Colonial had about sort of a 70-30 split in terms of how we define Large versus Secondary and we were at about 60-40 and -- on a blended basis, we're about 65-35. I mean, we -- honestly, that's kind of right where we wanted to be. Obviously, we didn't do this transaction with the idea that we're trying to maximize performance in 2014 or '15. I mean, it's a much longer horizon we're taking to this thing, and so we think that as we get into an up part of the cycle, what we've historically always found, as we've certainly seen over the last 2 to 3 years, is the large market component of the portfolio tends to outperform. And obviously, if you go back to 2008, 2009 timeframe, early 2010, our Secondary Market segment was actually outperforming. And so back to the point I was making earlier about -- our effort is to really try to achieve a optimum sort of full-cycle performance profile to the portfolio. And I mean, what drives the fundamentals in both Large and Secondary Markets is the same thing, it's just, obviously, it's job growth and demand and supply. And so these large markets are -- is where most of the supply is happening right now, and that's why you're going to see more moderation take place in Large Markets versus the Secondary, which tend to be a lot more stable. Having said that, I mean, it doesn't take a whole lot of supply, obviously, to create an imbalance in some of these Secondary Markets. And so rather than ramp up development in these Secondary Markets, we just continue to sit back and wait and let the projects that do take place there, offer an opportunity for us. Having said that, I mean, what little bit of development we have done in the past in terms of -- in sort of MAA's history, it has been in the Secondary Market. We did Charleston, we've done Little Rock, we just finished one in Nashville. So you're unlikely to see us going far. What little bit of development that we do, you're not going to see us do it in Dallas, in Atlanta, in places like that. I mean, there's plenty of that going on there. So, our point is, we do focus on the secondary whenever we do -- and we're at the part of the cycle where, development, in my mind does make sense.","Joshua Patinkin","I see. So just a handful of projects in the Secondary Markets can absorb a lot of the new job growth coming online?","H. Eric Bolton","Yes, exactly.","Joshua Patinkin","Okay. And so some of the opportunistic acquisitions you talked about, would that -- you foresee taking place more in the Secondary Markets to tilt the portfolio balance back?","H. Eric Bolton","No. I mean, we like where the balance is. So, we're not any effort to sort of shift anything around from large to secondary. But we're looking for opportunity in both large and secondary. I think that, frankly, where you're likely to see some of the better buying opportunities over the next couple of years is in some of the larger markets, simply because that's where a lot of the supply is coming online. And I think some of these markets that tend to get perhaps a little bit overbuilt from time to time. There may be some very good opportunities emerge in markets like Raleigh, in Austin. Some of the markets that are arguably weakening a little bit more and undoubtedly when some of these projects were started back and penciled out a year or 2 years ago, my guess is some of them are not going to lease-up quite as fast as some of the developers have hoped. And out of that emerges opportunity.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Salinsky from RBC Capital Markets.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Tom, just to go back to a question here. As you walk through the same-store revenue guidance, can you give us the components -- how much at the midpoint of 4% is occupancy versus rate growth? And then just a question -- the other question I think that's been asked several different ways, of the $0.30 to $0.45 you talked about, how much of that do you expect to realize in 2014, versus how much of that's kind of more '15, '16?","Thomas L. Grimes","And I'll let Al walk us through the split on forecast. And then I'll follow up with the development synergies. And I'll just go ahead with those. I mean we've got, in '14, we will see $1.3 million worth of property and casualty savings. Redevelopment will generate about $1 million. On the RNM [ph] side, we see opportunity. They were -- tended to be more structure and managed to a specific benchmark. We tend to give ranges on things like efficiency and they may be at the benchmark, but what may be better for that property is, well, better than benchmark, and along those lines, they did not do any in-house carpet cleanings. We expect to do half of those in-house. That will save us about $900,000. We also get about $400,000 on scale for RNM [ph] expenses. We feel like revenue management opportunity is about $500,000. I mean -- and that just gives you a general taste of where the opportunities lie.","Albert M. Campbell","I'll give you the split on that Mike, in terms of revenue. If you look at the normal performance for the portfolio outside the synergies we talked about from Colonial, we would see pricing performance be in the 3.5% range, with occupancy increasing kind of an average 30 basis points. So the normal portfolio activity, call it 3.8% total revenue growth for the year. On top of that, you have the synergy that we talked about from the Colonial portfolio that give you the full performance. So I hope that gives you what you need.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","No, that's helpful. Second question, just in terms of development. Eric, it sounded like you're looking at a couple. Should we expect additional commencements in 2014? Or has that all been tabled at this point to really focus on acquisition?","H. Eric Bolton","No, I mean, we're looking at a couple of things, Mike. We haven't really talked to the board about it, but in both cases, frankly, what we're looking at are Phase 2 opportunities where we already own the land. We've got an opportunity up in Virginia, we've got opportunity in Orlando that we're taking a hard look at right now. And so, it will be limited. But in both cases, if we do anything this year, it probably -- something along those lines.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Third question. You bought out 2 joint venture properties in the first quarter, you have 2 more, I think, remaining with your JV partner in one of the funds. Is there a plan to kind of bring that in -- those in-house as well?","H. Eric Bolton","We're going to bring in-house one of those, and we're going to take to market to sell the other one. But we expect that fund to wind down this year.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then finally, of the $125 million to $175 million of commercial and land sales, can you break that out between what you expect to be commercial and what you expect to kind of be land. The reason I'm asking is, obviously, the land isn't contributing any earnings, the commercial is. So as we look to '14 -- I mean, as we look to '15 and '16, kind of trying to get the earnings impact there.","Albert M. Campbell","That explains some of the 2014 noise we talked about, Mike. The vast majority of that in 2014 is going to be the commercial properties. We're working hard to sell and it's the right thing to do, to go ahead and simplify the business. But the Brookwood asset, the [indiscernible] asset and the Kraft's [ph] farm asset, we're looking to sell those during the year and that makes up the majority, based on our value of the...","H. Eric Bolton","Of the $310 million, I mean, roughly, less than or right at about 10% of it is land value. And so the vast majority of this is earning assets if you will.","Albert M. Campbell","So you'll see that land value be more impactful in 2015, as we move to sell that. And it's dead wood now. It will begin to add earnings then.","Michael J. Salinsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So with Brookwood and a couple of the ones, I think you mentioned [indiscernible], some of those have development land and entitlements. You will sell the whole thing? These will all come off the book?","H. Eric Bolton","Yes. Yes.","Operator","And we'll go next to Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just out of curiosity, when you kind of take look at your markets, any markets out there where you're starting to get a little bit concerned about new supply?","Thomas L. Grimes","Yes, Tayo, it's Tom. I think the 2 that we're watching or the 2 that we were watching last quarter is Austin and Raleigh. Both have relatively large chunks of supply coming on. Raleigh it was sort of, if you just looked at the numbers, you would think it was past it because a bunch of it came online in 2013. But most of that supply was back ended. So we're just beginning to feel that. That said, both have awfully resilient jobs machines in them, and I can see their tail off being short-lived. But we're concerned about those 2.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then, Al, I just wanted to confirm my understanding of some of the synergies. Because I know we've been back and forth on this, the $25 million that's kind of been put out there on an annualized basis, you're expecting about $6 million of that to show up in 2014?","Albert M. Campbell","No, no, no. That's, that's -- let me clarify this, Tayo, that's a very good point. The $25 million is the overhead or G&A synergies that were stated in the -- when we talked about the merger. We'll capture virtually all of that in 2014. [indiscernible] Or the vast majority with the -- a certain amount trickling into '15, but most of it in '14.","Thomas L. Grimes","We'll be continuing -- I mean, our run rate by the end of this year will be reflective of that.","Albert M. Campbell","The full amount, that's exactly right. The other is, we have been talking about -- now, if you put the 2 companies together, and you take the FFO that they both had premerger, add them together, and take into account the benefit of that $25 million, you add them together, and take out 25, divide by the combined shares, you're still about $0.20 to $0.25 per share dilutive. What we've talked about is that we have opportunities, whether it be the non-core land, the development pipeline leasing-up, the redevelopment program, that gives us opportunities for an additional $0.30 to $0.45 per share on top of that stated synergy, okay? We're going to capture, call it $6 million of that in 2014. It's a lot of work to get that done, we're capturing in 2015 it'll be a lot more meaningful and some in '16. But that's what we're talking about.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tom Lesnick with Robert W. Baird.","Thomas J. Lesnick - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm standing in for Paula this morning. Following up on Ryan Bennett's questions on occupancy rate and revenue management, Vegas saw year-over-year declines in both occupancy and rate but has little new supply. How are you guys thinking about those assets? Do you think you got them at the trough? And what are your expectations for growth in Vegas relative to your other markets in 2014?","Thomas L. Grimes","Well, it's 2 properties in Vegas, both on the north side of it. And frankly, the market's doing pretty well, and we've got one property firing on all cylinders, and one property, honestly, that we've got a few things that have been adjusted and we're optimistic about how it will do. So just operationally, in Vegas, we feel pretty good about it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Dave Bragg with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Recognizing your stated plans for the Fund II assets, Eric, can you just share your general thoughts going forward on potential JV activity?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, at this point, Dave, we don't have any plans for any additional JV programs. We really feel like that having JVs involved with us from time to time is usually -- we were trying to address a specific need or offload some risk, various things of that nature that sort of compel us to look to JV. I don't think about it so much as an effort to really establish a new funding source. And so, we think that with the assets that we've got and sort of where we have the balance sheet, candidly, just don't see a particular need for any sort of JV structure to come into play based on everything that we know today. Having said that, obviously, if an opportunity were to emerge of some sort, that we felt worth pursuing, and a JV could be useful in terms of diversifying risk or structuring the financing in some way that would create some value for our shareholders, we would certainly look to put a JV in place. But we've done several of them over the years with a lot of very sophisticated partners. But at this point, we have no need to, or plans to do any additional JV work.","David Bragg - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And just a disclosure item for you, Al. Can you provide the sequential same-store figures for revenue expense and NOI growth for the combined portfolio? I don't think I saw that in the supplement.","Albert M. Campbell","I can give that to you, Dave, and sequentially, it was -- the revenues were down 0.4%, which is sort of seasonal. The expenses were down 7%, which was 2 things: In the fourth quarter, you do expect some seasonal sequential decline from operating expenses going down, but we also had the impact of -- Colonial had a third quarter -- they had a lot of noise related to merger adjustments and things like that, that they were making to prepare for the transaction. So that was part of that. So the NOI was 4.4% growth. 4% down on revenues and -- 0.4% down on revenues, 7% down on operating expenses.","Operator","And we'll go next to Buck Horne with Raymond James.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Forgive me if I missed it, did you guys give how pricing is looking in January, both either new leasing and renewal pricing so far?","Thomas L. Grimes","We did not. On a year-over-year, the leases signed in January were up 4% for the combined portfolio and renewals were up 6.5%. Again, renewals achieved.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Is that an acceleration from what you saw in the fourth quarter?","Thomas L. Grimes","Renewals were up a little bit. But no, the fourth quarter on year-over-year leases were -- was also right at 4.1%.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Good. And, I guess for Eric, I'm just wondering, what are the real constraints to supply entering some of the secondary markets? Is it really just the lenders aren't willing to lend in those markets right now? Or what's the constraint and when do -- when does development start -- get started in the secondary markets?","H. Eric Bolton","Well, I think what we need to see is more robust recovery in the economy and more job growth. I think that if we got to a point where the job growth began to accelerate and bled more into some of the secondary markets and the demand picked up, my guess is that the numbers start to work in a more compelling way to ramp up development in some of the secondary markets. I think that, right now, I don't know whether it's necessarily a lack of access to financing capital, but I think, at least, reasonably disciplined equity capital is going to be a little bit cautious about ramping up supply in the secondary markets until we see more job growth.","Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And are construction costs rising? Are you seeing, outside is inflation in competition for labor right now in some of these markets?","Thomas L. Grimes","Yes, that's -- I mean, that's obviously a good point too. And you're right, yes, it is. I mean, of course, we're not out actively trying to price out jobs and -- but based on everything that we see and folks that we talk to and developers that we talk to, certainly, rising construction costs are there. And I think that is acting as a bit of holding down some of the supply pressure as well.","Operator","And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.","H. Eric Bolton","We appreciate everyone joining us. And we will see you, I'm sure, over the next couple of months. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect at this time."]}}
