All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","Now, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host today, Debbie Koopman. Please go ahead.","Debbie Koopman","Thank you, Keith. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our Chairman, President and CEO will discuss the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiative. Then Brian Schell, our Executive Vice President and CFO will provide an overview of our first quarter 2019 financial results and updated guidance for certain financial metrics. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A will be our Chief Operating Officer, Chris Isaacson and our Chief Strategy Officer, John Deters.","In addition, I'd like to point out that, this presentation will include the use of several slides. We will be showing the slides and providing commentary on each. A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","During our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements, which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold. And while we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions risks and uncertainties. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.","Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a full discussion of the factors that may affect any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after this conference call.","Also note that references made to the planned migration of Cboe Options Exchange is subject to regulatory review. During the course of the call, this morning we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings material.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Tilly.","Ed Tilly","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on the financial results for the first quarter 2019 at Cboe Global Markets. As you know, market conditions were challenging throughout the quarter, negatively impacting volume across our business lines. As we have in previous low-volume cycles, we have used this less-volatile period to seed potential future growth in our proprietary index products through increased customer outreach and education efforts. As a result, we are confident we are even better positioned to grow our business and to define markets globally to deliver value to our customers and shareholders.","I will highlight those initiatives today after touching on market volatility. In a reversal from the sharp downturn in fourth quarter 2018, the S&P 500 rallied more than 12% in the first quarter and is now up more than 16% year-to-date. We believe the rally was led by the Federal Reserve's shift away from monetary tightening, generally positive corporate earnings and growing stability in U.S.-China trade talks.","As the markets are once again hitting all-time highs implied volatility levels have fallen across all asset classes and the VIX term structure has steepened. We see that investors are looking for ways to reestablish upside positions. And with realized volatility levels back near eight-month lows, industry strategists are pointing to trades in SPX and VIX, as ways to take a position in the market.","Others are turning to VIX futures and volatility-linked ETPs to express a view on implied volatility. Volatility-linked ETP, AUM which bottomed out at the start of 2019 has been steadily building and is now back over $3.5 billion quickly approaching pre-February 5, 2018 levels.","In the last three months, the ETP complex has gained approximately $130 million of long vega exposure. This has translated to hedging in VIX futures and according to the most recent CFTC data has resulted in the largest net short position in VIX futures on record, yet another example of the utility of the VIX complex has to offer. Whether record market highs or market sell-offs, spikes in volatility or extended periods of market calm The Street continues to reference, our proprietary product set as the preferred tools for managing risk.","We remain keenly focused on the significant opportunity we see to further grow the customer base for our proprietary products. In the interest of better serving our customers, we have aligned our sales and coverage teams across regions and products to promote greater collaboration and cross-selling. Additionally, we developed a buy-side sales team focused on growing usage of our proprietary products in the insurance asset manager and pension fund communities. While we believe our greatest opportunity for growth remains in the domestic market, we also recognize that investors around the globe have U.S. exposure.","We continue to make inroads into new markets and to enhance the customer experience in regions, where we already have a greater foothold. We are exploring new markets such as the Middle East, Scandinavia and Asia while also pursuing jurisdictional approval in more established markets including Switzerland and Israel.","Turning now to the U.S. Equities market where this week we made fee changes aimed at attracting additional order flow to Cboe EDGX Exchange. We believe these changes in addition to our plans to introduce execution priority to retail limit orders on EDGX pending regulatory approval will benefit individual investors while further enhancing EDGX as a destination of choice for retail trading.","We continue to advocate for adoption of our Cboe Market Close proposal which was initially approved by the SEC in January 2018, but has been stalled by appeals. We are optimistic that the original approval order will be reaffirmed by the commissioners and are positioned to launch upon approval. You will recall that Cboe worked closely with customers to develop CMC to provide them with significant cost benefits.","Our commitment to being a leading advocate in the equities marketplace has never been stronger. We are crafting numerous other proposals and rule filings based on feedback from our customers. You'll hear more about these initiatives as they develop.","Now turning to European Equities where our market share remains strong one year into MiFID II. We continue to retain our number one position in the European Equities market as we increased our market share year-over-year to 22.1% for the quarter, up from 21.2%. Our periodic auctions book continues to receive positive feedback from both buy-side and sell-side firms and remains the leading periodic auction solution.","Cboe LIS, our block-trading platform powered by BIDS technology logged another strong quarter. Our primary focus during the first quarter was finalizing our plans to operate in a post-Brexit environment. In March, we received the authorization from the Dutch Ministry of Finance to operate a new venue in the Netherlands.","Given the recent political developments and the extension of the Brexit deadline until the end of October 2019, we now plan to launch the new venue later this year. We continue to work with our regulators and customers on launch timing.","In closing, I would like to thank our team for the progress made throughout the first quarter in laying the foundation for future growth. In addition to the initiatives outlined here, our team continues to hit key milestones on our migration of Cboe exchanges to Bats technology keeping us on track for our planned completion date of October 7.","We've seen ebbs in trading before. They come with the territory. But our experienced and disciplined team continues to execute on strategic growth initiatives, so that our company is well positioned to weather difficult trading conditions and to benefit when they change.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Brian.","Brian Schell","Thanks, Ed, and good morning everyone. Before I begin I want to remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 1Q 2019 as compared to 1Q 2018 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results. As Ed mentioned, we had difficult comparisons given the strength of the first quarter last year and weaker trading volumes this year.","Overall, our net revenue was down 15% with net transaction fees down 24%, non-transaction revenue, up 2%.; adjusted operating expenses decreased 14%; adjusted operating margin of 66.5% was unchanged; and finally our adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 20% to $1.11.","Our first quarter results reflect lower trading volume industry-wide and across each of our business segments. In addition, our results included an $8.8 million charge, the equivalent of a $0.06 EPS impact to reverse the OCC dividend we recognized in 4Q 2018 due to the SEC's rejection of the OCC capital plan.","Despite the tough environment and comparisons, our focus on disciplined expense management allowed us to achieve solid margins matching 1Q 2018's adjusted operating margin. The press release we issued this morning and our slide deck provide the key operating metrics on volume and revenue capture for each of our segments as well as an overview of key revenue variances.","I'd like to briefly highlight some of the key revenue -- key drivers influencing our performance in each segment. Before I get started, let me point out a change we made in our income statement reporting. We combined access fees and exchange services and other fees into one line item access and capacity fees. We believe this enhances comparability and better captures the overall revenue associated with accessing and obtaining desired level of capacity to trade in our markets.","Despite the lower trading volume in the first quarter, our recurring revenue stream of proprietary market data and access capacity fees combined increased 10% year-over-year, which is slightly higher than we originally projected and believe we can grow this at mid- to high single digits in 2019.","We continue to see opportunity across all of our asset classes and believe our migration to Bats technology will provide additional revenue opportunity over the long term. As it relates to proprietary market data, about 70% of that growth was the result of incremental subscriptions.","Now I'd like to turn to our segments. In our options segment the 17% or nearly $29 million decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by a $40 million decline in net transaction fees, reflecting lower trading volume and lower revenue per contract or RPC. Net transaction fees in index options fell $39 million and multi-listed options were down just $1 million.","Index options average daily volume or ADV declined 34% for the quarter, offset slightly by a 3% increase in RPC. The RPC increase was primarily due to a mix shift with SPX options accounting for a higher percentage of volume as well as fee changes implemented in the first quarter of 2019. The 17% ADV decrease in our multi-listed options was primarily driven by lower industry volumes and lower market share.","Our multi-list market share was down from last year's first quarter as we continued to focus on optimizing our overall net transaction fees as reflected in a 13% increase in RPC for multi-listed options for the quarter. The RPC increase was driven by fee changes implemented in 2018 as well as lower volume based discounts.","Turning to futures. The 30% or nearly $13 million decrease in net revenue, primarily resulted from a 37% decline in ADV and a 1% increase in RPC. The higher RPC year-over-year primarily reflects the impact of new pricing implemented in the latter part of 2018 and lower volume-based rebates. CFE posted growth in non-transaction revenue of 16%, driven by higher market data revenue and regulatory fines. If you exclude the increase in regulatory fines, which may not recur, the increase is 6%.","Turning to U.S. equities. Net revenue was down 5% or nearly $4 million, primarily due to lower SIP market data revenue, offset somewhat by increases in net transaction fees and access and capacity fees. The growth in net transaction fees was driven by higher net capture, offset somewhat by a lower industry ADV and lower market share.","SIP market data revenue fell 20% in the quarter, while our proprietary market data revenue increased 2%. SIP revenue fell due to lower market share as well as a decline in auto recoveries versus last year's first quarter. We still expect the SIP revenue pool to remain relatively unchanged in 2019 versus 2018 and expect our SIP revenue to be primarily influenced by changes in market share and any audit recoveries.","Net revenue for European Equities decreased 7% on a U.S. dollar basis, primarily reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. On a local currency basis, net revenue was only down 1%. While net transaction fees were down, the decline was mostly offset by growth in non-transaction revenue.","Decline in net transaction fees was due to lower market volumes, offset somewhat by favorable net capture and higher market share. The higher net capture resulted from combined strong periodic auction and LIS volume, which have higher relative net captures.","Net revenue for Global FX decreased 5% this quarter, reflecting a 12% decline in market volumes, offset significantly by higher net capture, which was up 7%, primarily reflecting the impact of fee changes made in 2018. In addition, we grew market share to a new high of 15.8%, up nearly 50 basis points year-over-year.","Turning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were just over $94 million for the quarter, down 14% compared with last year's first quarter. While expenses were down in nearly every category, the key expense variance was in compensation and benefits primarily resulting from decreases of nearly $7 million in incentive-based compensation and $3 million in equity compensation.","The decrease in equity compensation reflects the forfeiture of unvested equity awards in the quarter and is not expected to be a recurring benefit in the future quarters. The decline in incentive-based compensation is aligned with our overall decline in financial performance. As we've discussed previously, this is our largest variable expense and is self-adjusting based on financial results.","Given our first quarter expense decline, we are lowering our full year 2019 expense guidance to be in the range of $415 million to $423 million, down $5 million versus our previous guidance. In the first quarter we had about $6 million in favorable net expense adjustments that we don't expect to recur in subsequent quarters. Additionally, as I discussed, we plan to continue to invest in enhancing our customer-facing business development team, to drive greater engagement in our proprietary products.","With respect to our 2010 expense guidance, we still expect a range of $420 million to $428 million, which takes into account the benefit of the synergies expected to be realized in 2020 from the C1 migration later this year and a continuation of investing to support the growth of our business. We are maintaining our run rate synergy targets, as we expect to exit 2019 with $80 million of run rate synergies and exit 2020 with $85 million.","Turning to income taxes. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 25.4%, below our annual guidance range and last year's first quarter rate of nearly 26%. The tax rate decrease was primarily due to excess tax benefit, related to equity awards exercised in the first quarter of 2019.","We are reaffirming our full year tax rate guidance to be in the range of 27% to 29%, as we expect the rate to be at the higher end of the guidance range in each subsequent quarter for the remainder of the year. We are also reaffirming our guidance for depreciation and amortization and capital spending with the amount as noted on the slide.","Turning to capital allocation. We remain focused on allocating capital in the most efficient manner to create long-term shareholder value. During the quarter our cash flow generation and financial position enabled us to continue to invest in the growth of our business, while also returning nearly $70 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We currently have $171 million of availability under our share repurchase program and we plan to continue to evaluate share repurchases as part of our overall capital allocation.","We ended the quarter with adjusted cash of nearly $348 million. Our cash balance is elevated versus historical levels for a couple of reasons. First, working capital needs are typically higher at the end of the first quarter, due to tax-related liabilities that are due in the second quarter.","The second and most significant reason is potential strategic acquisition we referenced in our last earnings call, remains under consideration. While we are still unable to provide any specifics relating to this potential deal, there is no assurance it will ultimately occur.","I want to point out again that, if we are successful in completing the transaction, we do not anticipate a significant change to our current leverage ratio or issuing any stock with respect to its funding. At quarter end our leverage ratio was unchanged from year-end 2018 at 1.5 times.","Our cash and capital positions remain strong. And we remain confident that the actions we are taking to implement our strategic initiatives will drive free cash flow and create long-term, sustainable value to our shareholders.","In summary, Cboe delivered solid results amid a challenging operating environment and continued to focus on defining markets globally, growing our proprietary index products, growing our recurring revenue streams, disciplined expense management to leverage the scale of our business, completing our integration plan and delivering on our synergy targets, maintaining balance sheet flexibility and a capital allocation plan that allows us to invest in the growth of our business, while returning capital to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.","With that, I will return it over to Debbie for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Debbie Koopman","Thanks Brian. At this point, we\u2019d be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits, we\u2019ll take your second question. Keith?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And this morning's first question comes from Richard Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Q \u2013 Richard Repetto","Yeah, good morning Ed, good morning Brian and I saw the comp decreased quarter-to-quarter the $13 million. I didn't know we paid Chris Concannon that much this quarter. Anyway, my question is again, you mentioned M&A right at the end of the prepared remarks, Brian. It sort of brings out fodder or more questions on it. And I guess I would say can you give us any more color since it has been mentioned again publicly in prepared remarks? Are we looking to expand it in new -- from what we got from priors it's not as small transaction? It's a sizable. Is it some additive? Can you talk about what the strategic -- is it the expand asset classes or added on to asset classes? Can you give us any more details since it was brought up earlier?","A \u2013 Brian Schell","So I think there were multiple questions there. So let me talk about -- and this will probably address -- and I apologize for anyone else in the queue who will have a related question that might be a slightly different take, but I'll answer it more broadly around capital allocation and this. I don't really want to -- we don't really have any additional comments or color around any specific transaction that may or may not occur that was stated other than in the prepared remarks.","But in the context of capital allocation, let me address that and I think John will maybe cover some of the other kind of our thoughts around strategic investment and considerations and our overall approach broadly. But at the end of the day, our overall goal is always the efficient deployment of capital and just -- and to not just sit on that cash. We do have a philosophy and a long-term track record of returning that cash to our shareholders and we want to balance that with achieving appropriate balance sheet flexibility.","As we do every quarter and we're planning to do later this month, we discussed this topic with our Board on a very regular basis. And beyond the working capital needs, making those investments to grow the core business and achieving that flexibility, as we stated many times our goal is to grow that annual dividend as we've done since 2010 and using that capital opportunistically to repurchase the shares.","As such, it was unusual for us to hold that much cash at the end of the quarter as we did this quarter. And we don't necessarily expect to hold that level of cash going forward. And again, as we noted, it was anticipation of that higher seasonal working capital needs in that potential transaction, but we also were in the market-purchasing shares, demonstrating that ability to balance that relatively small strategic investment with a direct return to shareholders. So we'll continue to evaluate capital allocation decisions with that type of discipline.","A \u2013 John Deters","Hi Rich, this is John. So just on the strategic points. We've said this before. I think, we think about things in three ways strategically, greater access to end users, extending our geographic reach and adding to our asset class coverage. And expect any good deal to hit at least one and we like them to hit multiple of those points. And then expect any good deal to be a solid contributor financially.","Q \u2013 Richard Repetto","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Q \u2013 Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the VIX side we can see the ETP vega exposure increasing, thank you for that information. And it's definitely helping the future side as we can see. The VIX options side has fared maybe less well more recently. Can you flesh out maybe why the more -- or maybe the less robust results on the options side relative to the future side? Thanks.","A \u2013 Ed Tilly","Sure. I think it -- it's Ed Tilly. Thank you, Ken. I think it really -- if we take a half a step back and we look at the psychology going on now in hedging and traders as we know and investors as we know are most influenced by the most recent past. And you're coming out of a fourth quarter last year with very, very high volatility, a huge market sell-off; you entered the first quarter of this year either in a market or in a long position that has been hedged. And you're faced with a couple of options and we kind of set that stage at the last time we spoke where we saw hedging opportunity and remaining in a long position in the market you're forced with basically two choices to hedge that position; out-of-the-money puts in the S&P 500 out-of-the-money calls in VIX. And we referenced the really, really low VVIX making out-of-the-money calls in VIX relatively inexpensive compared to other money puts in the S&P 500.","Now, while that scenario continues and VVIX is at a relatively historic lows all of the influences in the first quarter that very volatile fourth quarter is in the rearview mirror. What we've had now is three or four months of relative calm, uncertainties like -- uncertainty around Brexit, trade wars, government, shutdown corporate earnings.","Remember we weren't even talking about raising fed rates back in the early first quarter. All of those uncertainties are kicked now well into the third quarter maybe the fourth quarter. So, you're faced with that same decision. Do I spend that money to hedge my portfolio by using out-of-the-money calls even though they're cheap? Or do I look 30 or 60 days in the future and say, maybe I need half as much hedge or maybe I'm going to let April just rest on its own. That's what's going on now in the marketplace.","And we see that we're informed by our investors' perception of risk by the volume in each of these proprietary classes. But here is what's different. If you read the commentary that's issued by the sell side each and every day I'll give you just a couple from the last few days. And these are all from banks and this is all of the commentary in the market.","S&P-implied vol of vol as measured by VVIX index was roughly unchanged last week at 84%. We continue to see interest in cheap upside call it convexed etrades which has driven VIX call wing to record highs.","To protect against the squeeze and higher VIX as SPX corrects from record highs consider buying VIX call spreads. So, the commentary is reinforcing when you're looking to hedge these are the products. Cboe's products are the ones you're looking to hedge in any market environment. We've seen the ebbs and flows and I -- we think the psychology of that trade now is establishing and looking forward through now the recent really calm environment to when this uncertainty comes back how do I position myself to continue to enjoy the upside run but to have a hedge position. So, I think that shows up first in those out-of-the-money VIX calls and taking more vertical position in the S&P 500 to maintain loss.","Ken Worthington","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Hey, good morning everyone. I don't usually like to ask about expenses, but I guess it would be great if you can just run through some of this and the expense -- and the expectations for the rest of the year a little bit more Brian.","If I heard you correctly the equities side of the comp line was $3 million better than I think $6 million from something else. I don't know if you said what it exactly was. But -- so I guess its $9 million so the real core expenses if I'm looking at this correctly are more like $103 million so at a 4, 12 run rate.","So, the question I guess is do you expect expenses -- where do you expect expenses to ramp in an environment where you're still taking those costs because of the integration? And then secondly, can you give us a little bit more color around the kind of like incentive fees -- or incentive compensation? How that's working? In terms of what are you accruing right now? What is the environment you're kind of budgeting for? How could this look going forward if we're staying in this kind of volume environment going forward? Hopefully that made sense. Thank you.","Brian Schell","Sure. So, let me take the first part of that as far as the ramp and why do we expect the slightly higher run rate in Q2, Q3, and Q4. As we look out I mentioned -- we mentioned a couple of times about our continuing investment that we need to do. And that will primarily show up in people and different things that we're doing as far as how do we continue to invest in that client-facing approach. So, that's one of the areas of investment. We'll continue to see that it could show up in the comp line end for example.","We also see -- with respect to various initiatives that are going on, we see some increases coming on potentially in professional fees. We know that we have some of our software tech that's rolling on so we're starting to see a little bit slightly higher increase in some of the depreciation and amortization.","Again offsetting -- some of that offset is the synergies that are coming in. But again there is not going to be a material change from synergies showing up until the very end of the year.","So, there's not really that offset as we try to kind of profile a little bit in the last call of like hey, we're still on track and we still think this is a big number on a run rate basis. But unfortunately the realization of that -- those kind of direct-offsetting expenses during the year are just not going to happen in these early quarters.","So, we expect to see a slight ramp-up in comp and I'll come back to incentive in a second. Slight increase in professional fees, slight increase a little bit of a D&A depreciation, and amortization that I mentioned. And along with that sometimes as we ramp up some of this some of our tech support expenses are also going to slightly tick up a little bit.","Again, it's kind of across the Board, so I wish I could point to something specifically to that. So, your analysis I think is the right way to think about that. And that number is still less than that kind of that number of what we had in a quarterly basis last year as far as that adjusted operating expense number.","So, it does reflect a continued benefit from the synergy savings with the investments that we mentioned. As far as the incentives go I'm obviously not getting it into, hey we're setting a new cool rate at this and that. We do factor in multiple financial metrics and operational metrics, but primarily, financial as a way to make sure that we're appropriately funding incentive comp with our shareholders so that we are completely aligned. And we have a perspective on the environment of what that looks like. Our accruals reflect that. I'm not necessarily going to sit down and say, here\u2019s what we think that volume looks like. But if you think about the incentives and the variable piece of comp, it's roughly 25% of that comp line item. If it's going great it's going to be higher than that because it's not just the incentive comp, it's also the associated payroll taxes and benefits and all the other stuff that nobody likes talk to about, but it's cost money. And then if it's lower than that it's because, hey, the financial performance shows what is there. So as a benchmark 25% of the overall comp is going to be driven by that variable incentive comp number.","Alex Kramm","Excellent. Thanks for the color.","Brian Schell","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Hi. Thanks and good morning. Maybe just given some of the investments that you mentioned given some of the expense guidance, what has been your traction with the new clients and international users? And maybe any stat that you can provide over the past few years and what you see as the opportunity ahead given some of these investments?","Ed Tilly","Yes. I don't -- as far as statistics that's very, very difficult. But I will tell you coming out of our Risk Management Conference in March and the hunger for updated and the continued exposure to white papers and neutral papers so for example, we updated the Wilshire report on option-based benchmarks performance and risks and updated that through December of 2018. Those types of engagements because they're demand-driven is why we're focusing and continue to focus in the pension and insurance space where that exposure is non-stop. Those customers need the information. They need third-party validation before they can go and convert funds that don't use our basic strategies to employ those strategies. So it's really now we're in the knowledge and gathering phase after a year like last year.","And the sophistication level and the engagement, I would say that this Risk Management Conference was at an all-time high. I saw all of our client-facing folks engaged in conversations that years ago I could only have imagined from a sophistication level. We need to invest and keep up not only on the client-facing customer interaction from our team, but going out and commissioning papers and having things written by third-parties. That's what we're doing now. And again it's fueled by a year like last year. And run-ups like this where gosh, I haven't seen an all-time high before. Well I did. I've seen them over the cycles in the past. What do I do this time? And why is it different? And these basic strategies these basic -- these white papers that are educating our users that's how we start.","John Deters ","Michael, this is John. I'd add one more thing. So Ed spoke to the sophisticated end of the user base spectrum. And we see -- because it's a little more visible, we see some pretty interesting momentum in the more entry level of the user base spectrum. And you see that around things like some of the packaged products that incorporate our strategies. So for example Global X has recently announced they'd be launching a Russell 2000 covered call ETF -- that joins a family of ETFs from a variety of distributors including Invesco and WisdomTree and others. So we -- those are visible launches. The asset accumulation there has been really robust. We talk about VIX ETPs, but I think the story around ETPs that incorporate all of our product strategies is a really compelling story for us.","Michael Carrier","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to ask you about dynamic in equity market share trends. So obviously, it looks like you've been losing pretty meaningful share. And I know you highlighted EDGX and that's the one we tend to focus on more. But it looks like there have been some losses on the Bats side as well. So maybe expand a little bit on why you're seeing incremental share losses now? What sort of pricing changes you have made? I think you alluded to something on EDGX side, but curious any plans for the rest of the cash equity franchise. And ultimately how is that going to shake out and the blended capture rate we should be thinking about on U.S. cash equity side from here?","Chris Isaacson ","Yes, Alex. Good morning. This is Chris Isaacson. I'll take that one. Yes, as you can see we have had higher-than-expected capture in U.S. Equities. And we made a decision in May we're going to reinvest some of that higher capture into the EDGX book where we've seen most of the market share attrition. So we made quite a change there and we've seen some early results that are positive, but it's just a couple of days in. We intend to be very, very competitive in this space and we're going to reinvest that capture.","We think this change on EDGX will work very nicely with the retail priority that we have before the commission and hope to get approval this summer on that will -- we think put retail orders earlier in a market queue position for them and hopefully improve fulfillment rates. For the rest of the exchanges, it's month-by-month we're looking at market share and capture. And so I think as we reinvest some of that capture you can expect the capture to come down as the market share goes up. We've -- we made a choice here that we think it's better for us and for our shareholders and customers if our market share is higher than where it's at now so we're going to reinvest to capture.","Alex Blostein","So just net-net between the SIP and the trading revenues there, should we be thinking about kind of that whole bucket being flattish? You lose in trading you gain on market data and that's kind of the framework?","Chris Isaacson","Yes. The framework is I think at least net revenue neutral for the entire complex for U.S. Equities, but we want higher market share.","Alex Blostein","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Hi. Thanks very much. So, just to follow-up on two prior questions. Just on that last one the market share we're tracking. It looks like the improvements starting on May 1, I know it's just a couple of days in May, but it looks like it's coming in the Bats area mostly rather than EDGX. So maybe just talk about that.","And then a follow-up to the question on the expenses earlier, I guess, if volumes in general broadly for the whole firm remain at sort of 1Q levels not that we think it would, but if they were to do that would you have more flexibility on that incentive comp side to come in closer to that $100 million quarterly run rate on expenses this year?","Chris Isaacson","Yes. I'll take the -- this is Chris, again. I'll take the question on the market share. For BZX equities market share there were no material changes made in May for BZX equities. So that's probably just movement, natural movement that comes and goes each and every month.","The major changes were made on EDGX and that's what we're watching very closely, but no more color there. And then Brian, if you want to cover the expenses?","Brian Schell","Yes. Brian, on the expenses -- and there would be nobody in this room nor probably anybody on the phone rooting for the scenario you just mentioned. But that would show up in incentive comp. I mean, as far as there would be a lower number, it would reflect a lower-volume environment if the first quarter volumes were to repeat itself.","Brian Bedell","Yes. Thank you.","Chris Isaacson ","I've made a follow-up on the last question about BZX equities. I haven't looked at the statistics yet. But I will note that we are listing VXXB and now actually VXXB migrated to VXX as of I believe it was two days ago seamlessly. So we're watching that closely. That's the listing venue for VXX.","And remind you all, we talked about VXXB last time there was a transition from VXX to VXXB and now there's a -- there was name change back to VXX where its full transition is finally complete.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Yes. Maybe that's the driver. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Thanks. With respect to VIX, it seems like the shape of the VIX curve has more anomalies in the recent quarters in recent years than it used to which I think has perhaps led to some of the uneven volume outcomes, we're seeing. Would you guys agree with that? And if so why do you think that's the case?","Ed Tilly","Anomalies, I think that's right. If you look at statistically, the current shape, while there are -- making of the steepness of the front month versus second while that bounces a bit, the amount of flat days that we've seen in January and February is very unusual. And why would I think that is? I think that it's just a reflection as my original comments it's just the perception of risk over that very short period of time. And that curve is most influenced as I've said by the most recent events.","I think when you have the volatility and the spikes involved like you saw last year that front month is weighed more volatile than it has been historically, which obviously changes the shape of that curve. The roll-down trade it's difficult when that front month is as volatile as it is. If we're going from 16 to 15, 13 back to 15 you're not as likely to engage in what has been a pretty consistent shape of the curve as you had like in 2017.","So my reasons for the shape of that curve were not my own. It is basically just watching the customers' perception of that 30-day versus 60-day and all of those drivers of uncertainty. Where is the timing and the spectrum? And as I said, we've seen the steepness today because all of those four big drivers on the end of the fourth quarter are kicked out into the June through October timeframe. But that's -- there will be something new. There will be more uncertainty. I guarantee it. We've seen it every cycle, but we just don't know what it is yet.","Chris Harris","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Good morning. Just on the slide regarding the proprietary non-transaction revenue in the mid to high single-digit growth guidance, you note that 70% of the market data growth is being driven by additional subscriptions. I guess, focusing on the access and capacity fees, can you give more color as to what's driving the growth there? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is being driven by pricing changes. And then moving forward, are there any meaningful pricing adjustments that are planned for the remainder of the year maybe as that tech migration occurs in October?","Brian Schell ","Yes. So that one is a little bit harder to break out, because, for example, as you think about pricing versus kind of new ports, you'll see movement a lot as far as people, as they test different strategies increasing say, folks maybe on ports because -- maybe I'll use the example of increasing capacity that are not to increase or decrease depending on the things they do. But one of the reasons it's hard to segregate price versus, I'll call it subscription is for example the CFE tech that was just rolled out.","With that platform migration, there was significantly more amount of capacity that was rolled out as part of that platform. And so, as kind of the entire environment changed, and so the pricing changed. And so there was hard way to say well, this number changes because the throughput was different.","And so that's an example of why it's hard to necessarily measure that. And we expect that some changes -- sometimes when you do have a price change, of what happens to capacity do we see the numbers fall?","With any of the price changes we have seen we really haven't seen any material reduction in it. So it's really across the board. As I look across the segments, of the proprietary market data it's pretty solid across the board up. The biggest one is -- I guess we mentioned the -- some of the futures. We mentioned some of the options.","So, it's kind of across the board of what we're seeing. So it's not any one thing. So again, long-winded way of saying that it's hard to tease out. But again we continue to monitor and take a look at it. And Chris, I think you \u2013","A \u2013 Chris Isaacson","Yeah.","Q \u2013 Kyle Voigt","\u2026you're directly involved on a lot of that as well.","A \u2013 Chris Isaacson","Yeah, Kyle, so we assume some attrition of capacity or port fees with a tech migration. But in fact we've seen lower attrition than we expected, as people need in fact more capacity once the platform is faster and they want to move their interest around.","On the market data front, with each platform migration we have new data products order-by-order fees, things that weren't available on the old platform. And with new data feeds people have demand for that so.","A \u2013 Brian Schell","And Chris makes a really good point that I just want to follow-up on, which I didn't make earlier about the proprietary market data. That is -- and we've talked about the growth that we've seen in the U.S. Equities side in respect to Cboe one. And what we're doing and growing that and basically all the shoe-leather, that we're doing to continue to drive that subscriber.","It's -- generally it can be a long lead time. But we're starting to see the efforts pay off. Actually the biggest growth that we've seen is, actually on the options side. And as far as some of that growth so we're seeing -- actually on the enhanced market data side, coming through with Livevol transaction we did, so multiple years ago we're starting to see the fruits of that coming through.","So we're starting to see more and more traction around other parts of this market data story, that are now starting to like I said, show up in the results incremental year-over-year. So again, it's the biggest growth actually came from that options group. But again, we saw positive numbers across each of the asset classes.","A \u2013 John Deters","Kyle this is John. Just on the point of the philosophy behind how we run our business on the options market data side. We think about that in terms of the revenue opportunity in and of itself, but almost as importantly the way those tools those data tools can support trading in our markets.","So, we focus on this reinforcing feedback loop. They're not separate businesses philosophically. And so we like to see the -- I like to see market data line increase. But ultimately that's a seed. We talk a lot about seeds in this call. That's a seed that's being planted for future volume.","Q \u2013 Kyle Voigt","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point.","Q \u2013 Chris Allen","Morning guys, most of my questions have been asked and answered. I guess just a quick one. On the regulatory fees jumped up a bit this quarter. I wonder if there's any one timers there. Or is this a good run rate going forward?","A \u2013 Brian Schell","Yeah. The only thing I think that we have is, it would be the -- if there was a -- in the futures where there was I think the fine that we reported. But otherwise noise sometimes you get rate adjustments from checks they're on. So there's just going to be some noise. There is nothing there that I would say that we see a continuing trend or anything to model.","Q \u2013 Chris Allen","Got you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Q \u2013 Alex Kramm","Oh! Hey! Hello again. Just on the VIX ETP side you had that slide in the growth and I think there was a question about this earlier. And I think you gave a lot of color around like VIX trading strategy.","You don't know what people are doing. But I think that discussion was a little bit more about sophisticated people using your options and your futures directly. So, just trying to see what is driving the VIX ETP interest again. I know it's difficult to see. But what are you hearing in the marketplace?","Is this retail coming back? Are there people asking -- I think people are asking for leverage products again. Like what's going on in the ETF space because historically that's been a big driver of growth I think?","A \u2013 Ed Tilly","It has. And with the CFTC the largest position in short VIX futures as a result of, the long positions in ETPs. And you got to sit back and scratch your head well how does that happen?","So retail yes engaging and taking long positions and whether it's VXX or levered TVIX the result is -- when you're taking the long positions in the ETP, someone's selling those long positions and looking to our VIX futures to hedge. And they're buying VIX futures.","There is a liquidity provider that has to sell those VIX futures. And that record short interest in VIX futures is as a result of the retail and the small investor taking long positions in ETPs.","Q \u2013 Alex Kramm","Okay. I guess the question is like are those all -- is this all retail? Are they semiprofessionals? I guess when you go to your Risk Management Conference are there a lot of people running around using the ETPs? Or is this is more a marketplace that you don't directly touch I guess is the question?","Like because, it seems like, in the -- in previous periods when retail got hurt by something like this was similar it goes away for quite some time. So just wondering if you're hearing seeing more retail coming back is the question really?","Ed Tilly","Yeah. But if we look at that by contract size, because we don't -- obviously as you know \u2013 Alex, you know us well enough. We don't have transparency into clearing and where are the ETPs and the interest clears. If we look at contract size, it's pretty balanced. The more sophisticated trader tends to use the roll-down effect of an ETP to their advantage, and offset the ETP exposure with pure-play into VIX futures options.","Retail, because it's so easy. It's easy to track parity with an ETP and options on those ETPs that tends to be more retail-friendly. But by size, it's pretty balanced on size. And the complex -- I think it's important to look at the entire complex. Our users look at the complex in its entirety. ETPs are just one extension to volatility exposure, but tends to be way more retail-friendly in general.","Alex Kramm","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question also is a follow-up from Richard Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Repetto","Yeah. Hi, guys. Just a brief follow-up just on, I think an interesting area that you're looking at the retail, that's on slide 8. When you -- Chris you talked about. You're trying to give some execution priority to retail limit orders. And I guess the question is can you describe that? Or how are you doing that? Because, at least, I thought that you had to treat all classes of customers of the exchange level the same. I know, there's been some -- it's a fine line with the N.Y.C. has done things in the past to give. But could you explain how you've given retail a priority on EDGX?","Chris Isaacson","Yeah. Sure, Rich. So, this has some precedent in the options market where you have, let's call it customer priority, and customers or \"retailer\" or given priorities. So we're using that as precedent. And as you mentioned, there's been retail programs in the U.S. Equities market kind of, on the aggressive or marketable side to give priority to them. But, yeah, this is just us giving retail priority for retail orders or orders that are clearly from retail.","If they're at the same price level as other interests from market makers or non-retail customers, they would go to the front of the line and time priority for retail orders. So, it's very similar to what we see in multi-listed options. And that's just what we're planning to do. Of course, the SEC has to approve this, and it seemed that there may be a comment period. But, we've canvassed our customers, and by and large people are quite supportive of this retail and non-retail.","Richard Repetto","Is this the first of its kind priority in equities also straight equities?","Chris Isaacson","This would be the first one on the non-marketable side for resting limit orders. This is an idea that we frankly, Bryan Harkins, who runs that business, and us -- internally we've talked about for many years, and we feel like this is the right time to bring it to market.","Richard Repetto","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And as there are no more questions, I would like to return the floor to management for any closing comments.","Debbie Koopman","Thank you. That completes our call this morning. We appreciate your time and continued interest in our company.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Debbie Koopman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Deborah Koopman","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Bill Brodsky, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives for 2013; then Alan Dean, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will detail our first quarter 2013 financial results. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after this conference call. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Brodsky.","William J. Brodsky","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin my remarks on our first quarter performance, I'd like to take a moment to touch on last week's trading outage. First and foremost, I would like to reiterate that we very much regret the inconvenience to our customers, with whom we've been in very close communication since the trading delay on April 25. We are grateful to the many customers who've expressed their understanding of the issue, as well as their overall confidence in our system's capability and reliability. We intend to live up to that trust. Preliminary systems work related to extended trading was identified as the catalyst for last Thursday's outage. Therefore, as part of our ongoing review, we are in the process of retaining an independent systems consultant to thoroughly evaluate the rollout procedures of our extended trading hours initiative. As a result, we are delaying the timetable to begin implementation for extended hours to accommodate this input.","We've also been in close contact with the SEC. Any time there's a trading disruption delay, there is a detailed protocol on sharing information and working with the SEC. We maintain real-time communication with our regulators from the time we realized we would have to delay the start of trading on the 25th and throughout the afternoon as trading resumed. Immediately after, we began a detailed review of our data to understand exactly what happened, how it happened and how to prevent it from happening again. Everything we learned in this process has been shared with the SEC. Our priority now is to make CBOE Command even stronger going forward. We are using that which we learned to reduce both the occurrence and the length of any future disruptions, including a faster alternative backup for our proprietary products, while there are alternative products to use in the place of SPX. And customers were able to trade VIX futures on CFE. The length of the delay in opening CBOE was unacceptable to us. Our disaster recovery system is available for backup, but it takes time to bring it up and performs to switch routing to connect to it. We have begun to develop a plan for a more immediate backup for our trading of our proprietary products, and we will begin taking that plan to the SEC for input review in the near future.","Now onto a look at the first quarter of 2013. Despite lower trading volume industry-wide and at CBOE, we posted strong first quarter results, driven by the strength of our proprietary products, which generate our highest revenue rate per contract. Adjusted EPS increased by 35% to $0.50 a share, while operating revenue increased by 18%. Alan will take you through the results in more detail in a moment. CBOE's market share in multiply-listed options excluding dividend trades, experienced significant fluctuation in the first quarter of 2013 due to intensified C competition. After CBOE's multiply-listed market share dropped to 15.3% in January, we responded with an enhanced VIP schedule in February, followed by an enhancement to our complex order VIP schedule in March. Subsequently, CBOE's market share grew to an industry-leading 18.5% in March, but fell to second place in April when market share decreased to 17.6%. Obviously, this is a very fluid arena. We continue to keep close watch on it and to adjust our competitive incentives accordingly.","Turning now to an update on our proprietary products. As you know, CBOE and S&P Dow Jones Indices sealed an agreement effective March 8 extending CBOE's exclusive rights to trade and -- to create and trade options on the S&P 500 and the S&P 100 and other derivative indexes through 2032. We were thrilled to have reached an agreement that spans 20 years, building on the previous 30 years in which we successfully collaborated on expanding the brand and the use of S&P index options in VIX futures and options. We look at the CBOE-S&P relationship as much more than a licensing agreement. S&P Dow Jones is the leading name in market indexing, and CBOE is the world's leader in index option and volatility trading. The products resulting from the unique strengths of each company and the collaborative nature of our partnership have revolutionized the investment landscape. More important, as the long-term nature of the extension would suggest, we share a very optimistic vision for future expansion of the option index and volatility spaces. In other index licensing news, we were delighted to continue our long-standing partnership with the Russell Indexes under a semi-exclusive agreement. CBOE brings important liquidity to the Russell Index option users. Options on the well-known Russell 2000 Index of small-cap U.S. stocks were previously listed on several U.S. exchanges. It is very gratifying to now have this semi-exclusive agreement. Now for an update on trading and CBOE's S&P 500 Index complex, where we have seen notable upticks thus far in 2013.First quarter average daily volume at SPX options, CBOE's most actively traded contract and the flagship product of our S&P 500 Index option complex was up 22% for the first quarter over the first quarter of last year. SPX average daily volume rose to 21% over April of 2012. It should be noted that SPX volume gains were spurred by robust trading activities in the SPX Weekly products. As discussed in our previous earnings call, SPX Weeklys represents one of CBOE's fastest growing products in 2012. We saw average daily increase of 69% over the prior year. Trading has further intensified in 2013. First quarter average daily volume in SPX Weeklys more than tripled compared to the same period one year ago, while April's average daily volume increased 235% over April of 2012. VIX futures and options volume continue to reach record levels in the first quarter of 2013. VIX futures average daily volume for the first quarter increased 131% over the same quarter a year ago. April marked the fourth consecutive month that total monthly volume in VIX futures reached a new all-time high. Year-to-date, VIX futures average daily volume is 128% ahead of 2012's pace. VIX options average daily volume during the first quarter rose 48% over the first quarter of 2012. April average daily volume increased 13% over a year ago. And year-to-date, average daily volume through the end of April was up 45% over 2012. April was the busiest month in VIX futures trading. And thus far, in 2013, there have been 3 new single-day volume records in VIX futures trading and 2 single-day volume records in VIX options.","Despite historically a low market volatility, we continue to see growing interest in VIX trading thus far in 2013. New money flowed into VIX-linked ETPs, new VIX-linked products were created and new traders began using VIX futures and options to implement a variety of sophisticated strategies. The most recent surge in VIX futures trading appears to be the result of new users in the form of hedge funds and proprietary trading firms in pulling strategies designed to capture volatility risk premia and small pricing anomalies between VIX futures and options, VIX-linked ETPs and other related instruments. Increases in VIX options trading continue to be driven by increase in VIX futures trading, but the greatest source of growth that we see today comes with increased participation from retail customers. Additionally, we see greater sophistication generally including the ability to fine-tune specific risk exposures. Spread orders account for over half of all VIX options activity, ranging from simple directional strategies to very complex term structure and skew trades. We look forward to announcing, in the near future, a revised start date for the implementation of extended trading hours for VIX futures. We expect that the first phase of expanded trading hours will add an additional 45-minute trading session after the current close of VIX futures at 3:15 p.m. Central Time. The new session, from 3:30 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. Central Time, responds to customer demand for expanded time to transact end-of-day trading, as well as to react to late afternoon moves. The second phase of extended trading hours is expected to expand VIX futures trading by an additional 5 hours. Trading will begin at 2:00 p.m. -- I'm sorry, 2:00 a.m. Central Time, which matches the 8:00 a.m. open of the London markets, and continues until the current open of 7:00 a.m. Central Time. Expanded trading hours will allow European-based customers to access a longer trading session in their local time zone, and will meet overall demand from both domestic and international customers for additional time to trade VIX futures. We're also looking to boosting global awareness of, and trading in, VIX futures and options with our second annual European Risk Management Conference this September 30 through October 2 near Lisbon, Portugal. In March, nearly 300 investment professionals convened in Carlsbad, California for the 29th annual CBOE Risk Management Conference.","RMC is an industry-leading educational forum, whereas sophisticated practitioners and users of equity derivatives discuss new products and related strategies. The majority of RMC sessions featured our SPX and VIX product lines, as well as CBOE's option-based strategy benchmarks, such as the CBOE's BuyWrite index or BXM. Next month, we plan to make changes to our S&P 500 Variance Future contract, which we designed as an exchange traded version of OTC variance swaps. Based on customer feedback, we plan to change how we convert volatility points to futures prices, so that the quoted price of our various futures contract will be more directly comparable to prices in the OTC swap market. Post-launch contract adjustments like this one can be the key to our new product's success. Our Variance Futures contract was designed to provide the same quoting conventions and economic performance of various swaps while providing the advantages of exchange traded contracts, transparency, price discovery and counterparty clearing guarantees. We believe that changes in pricing will bring the product even closer in line with OTC swaps without reducing the benefit of exchange trading.","Going forward, we maintain a positive outlook on the future growth prospects of the options and volatility space. Despite the overall dampening of equity options trading in the first quarter, we are pleased that our company continued on its very profitable growth trajectory. Moreover, we believe 2013 holds future growth opportunities for CBOE, given the continued migration of the many forms of OTC trading to exchange markets and the unabated growth in volatility trading.","Last week, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of CBOE and the listed options market. This year also marks the 30th anniversary of CBOE's creation of index options and the 20th birthday of the VIX. There's a nice symmetry to our 40, 30, 20 milestone year, and I hope you won't mind if I take a moment to touch on it. CBOE launched the options industry on April 26, 1973, by trading 911 contracts on 16 stocks in the former smoking lounge of the Chicago Board of Trade. CBOE ended that year with about $1.1 million contracts traded. Last year, CBOE alone traded 1.1 billion contracts as part of an industry that now includes 11 U.S. options exchanges and dozens more around the world. In 1983, CBOE created the CBOE 100 Index, and began trading options on the Options Exchange Index or OEX. Through our partnership with Standard & Poor's, CBOE 100 became the S&P 100. And a few months later, CBOE launched options on the S&P 500.And then in 1993, we introduced the CBOE Volatility Index or VIX, which became known as the Wall Street's fear gauge. A little over a decade later, we created VIX futures and then VIX options. Today, volatility trading has emerged as a dynamic new asset class. We commemorated our anniversary year by producing CBOE 40, a video commentary chronicling our history. If you haven't already done so, I invite you to watch the video, which can be accessed through our website. Our entire team is justifiably proud of CBOE's legacy, but we do not view innovation as something for the history book. People come to work each day at CBOE believing that they will be part of the next great new product, system or service. CBOE's spirit of innovation is alive today as it has ever been, a factor that while difficult to quantify, should never be underestimated. On a personal note, I wish to thank everyone for joining us today on what is my final earnings call as CEO of CBOE Holdings. As you know, following our Annual Meeting on May 23, Ed Tilly will assume his new role as CEO. Ed Provost will take over as President and COO, and I will move into my new position as Executive Chairman. The transition process has been very measured and successful. Ed Tilly, Ed Provost, Alan Dean and I have worked closely together to ensure that our company's leadership is well-positioned to begin the next great chapter in CBOE's history. I could not be more confident in their vision, leadership ability and dedication to CBOE, and I look forward to working with them and the CBOE community in my new role. With that, I want to thank you, the analyst community, with whom I worked for more than 3 years since before the IPO, and I now want to turn the financial reports over to Alan Dean, our CFO.","Alan J. Dean","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning, and I will review our financial results for the quarter and update you on our outlook for the remainder of 2013. We are off to a strong start this year, posting record first quarter financial results. Operating revenue for the first quarter was $142.7 million, up 18% compared with last year's first quarter. Adjusted operating income was $72.6 million, which equates to 50.9% of our operating revenue. This adjusted operating margin represents a 340 basis point improvement over the same quarter last year and our second best quarterly margin. Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders was $43.9 million, up 33% compared with the first quarter of 2012, resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.50, which matches our all-time high set in the third quarter of 2011. Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012 includes certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck. Turning to the details of the quarter, as shown on this chart, the growth in operating revenue is driven by increases in transaction fees, regulatory fees and exchange services and other fees, offset somewhat by lower market data fees. Transaction fees increased $14.3 million or 17% from the first quarter of last year due to a 35% increase in average revenue per contract or RPC compared with last year's first quarter, offset somewhat by a 13% decline in trading volume. While total trading volume declined for the quarter, trading in our exclusive products, VIX options and futures, posted record volume, resulting in higher RPC and transaction fees for the quarter. Our blended RPC, including options and futures, increased to $0.378, primarily reflecting a shift in product mix towards our highest margin, index options and futures contracts, as well as an increase in the revenue per contract for index options. The RPC in our options business increased 28% to $0.333 compared with $0.261 in last year's first quarter. The increase was a result of index options accounting for a higher percentage of total option volume, as well as a slight increase of revenue per contract for index options to $0.671. Keep in mind, this rolling 3-month RPC does not reflect the full impact of the changes we made to VIP at the beginning of February and again, in March. VIP credits increased significantly in March as CBOE's dividend adjusted market share in multiply-listed options increased to 18.5% from 15.3% in January. Assuming CBOE's market share in multiply-listed options holds or increases, the rolling 3-month RPC for the second quarter is expected to decline compared with the first quarter as a result of higher VIP credits and other fee changes. On the plus side, the impact of multiply-listed options on our financial performance continues to diminish with the explosive growth we are realizing in our proprietary products. The contribution from CFE, our futures exchange, continues to increase exponentially as we reap the benefits of the high RPC it generates. For the first quarter, the RPC for futures contracts was nearly $1.62, down slightly compared with last year's first quarter reflecting the impact of discounts provided on certain trades. As depicted on this slide, in the first quarter of this year, index options accounted for 34.4% of total contracts traded, up from 24% in last year's first quarter, while futures contracts accounted for 3.5% of total volume, more than double its contribution of 1.4% in last year's first quarter. As I noted earlier, the shift in the mix of trading volume towards our highest margin products fueled the growth of transaction fees for the first quarter of 2013. Index options accounted for 61% of transaction fees and futures contracts accounted for 15%, up from 56% and 8%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2012. The $5 million increase in regulatory fees resulted from CBOE raising its options regulatory fee on January 1 and the changes we made last year. As we noted in our last earnings call, these fees are only available to cover higher expenses we are incurring to carry out our obligations as a regulator. Exchange services and other fees increased by $1.7 million compared with last year's first quarter, primarily reflecting positive response to a new network access option we added at the beginning of this year. The decrease in market data fees as a result of CBOE's lower market share and a low RPC multiply-listed category compared with the first quarter of 2012. Moving down the income statement to expenses, this next slide details total adjusted operating expense of $70.1 million for the quarter, up $6.3 million or 10% versus last year's first quarter. This increase primarily reflects higher expenses for outside services, employee costs and royalty fees, offset somewhat by lower Trading Volume Incentives. Adjusted operating expense for the first quarter of 2013 excludes accelerated stock-based compensation of $3.2 million. This represents the recognition of the full value of stock awards granted to certain executives due to provisions contained in their employment agreement -- arrangements. Core operating expense of $47.6 million increased $6 million or 14%, compared with the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to increases in outside services and employee costs. Outside services increased due to higher legal expense, primarily relating to litigation activity. Employee costs were up due to increases in incentive compensation, stock-based compensation and salaries compared with 2012's first quarter. The increase in incentive compensation is aligned with our higher pre-tax income, while stock-based compensation reflects grants issued in the first quarter of this year. The increase in salaries was primarily due to staff additions in our regulatory services division. Overall, core operating expense for the quarter was in line with our full-year guidance. Taking a look at the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $210.5 million, up nearly $75 million from where we ended in 2012. The increase in cash was a result of strong cash flow from operations during the quarter. In the first quarter, we generated approximately $95 million in cash from operations, paid over $13 million in dividends and used over $6 million for capital expenditures. While there were no share repurchases made under our share authorization in the first quarter of this year, let me assure you that our board continues to believe that returning an excess capital to stockholders by repurchasing our shares is an attractive way to enhance stockholder value. We have $103.3 million outstanding under our existing share repurchase authorization. A few days ago, we announced that we declared a dividend of $0.15 per share for the second quarter of 2013. Our priorities for cash remain the same, invest in our business to fuel organic growth, show steady consistent growth in our annual dividend and utilize free cash flows and excess of investment and dividend needs to repurchase shares. As noted in our press release, we are reaffirming our full-year guidance that we provided in February 8, as shown on this slide. Before I close, let me point out a few items to keep in mind as you look ahead. Based on first quarter depreciation and amortization expense of $8.3 million, our annual guidance may appear to be high. This is due to the timing of our capital spending, which we expect to be more skewed towards the second half of the year. In our last earnings call, we pointed out that our continuing stock-based compensation expense will fluctuate a bit quarter-to-quarter this year due to the timing of stock grants. Again, we have a slide in the appendix that details the guidance for stock-based compensation by quarter. As I mentioned earlier, next quarter, we will see the full impact on RPC of the changes to VIP and other fee modifications implemented in February and March. Also, in the second quarter, will be the first full quarter of the S&P licensing fee increase that went into effect on March 8. However, as we stated when we announced the extension of the agreement at the beginning of the year, we raised the SPX surcharge in anticipation of this fee increase. Moreover, these changes should be neutral to our bottom-line going forward. On May 1, we introduced a new market-maker affiliate access credit and a floor broker access rebate, which allows each to reduce their trading permit fees based on meeting certain trading volume criteria. This change is expected to reduce access fee revenue by approximately $200,000 per month. There were a number of positive developments in the first quarter that bode well for our future growth initiatives including the extension of our licensing agreement with Standard & Poor's, our new semi-exclusive agreement to trade Russell index options. In addition, ISE conceded to an adverse judgment in its patent suit against CBOE, cutting short what could have been a lengthy trial. As a result, I expect legal fees to moderate, barring any unforeseen litigation. We are off to a solid start in the second quarter with the positive trading momentum in SPX Weeklys, VIX options and VIX futures all continuing. We remain diligent in our expense management as we strive to fully leverage revenue flowing to the bottom line. As Bill mentioned, the last month marked CBOE's 40th anniversary. I consider myself very fortunate to have been part of something for the last 33 years that has been a game-changer in the world of finance. It has been a stroke of luck on my part to work with people who share the same vision, and who I can also call my friends that makes CBOE such a special place to work. It gives me great pride to see how far we have come, and gives me strong confidence in our ability to continue to build long-term value for our stockholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Ed Tilly for some closing remarks.","Edward T. Tilly","Well, thanks, Alan. As this is Bill's final earnings call, I wanted to take the opportunity to say thank you to him on behalf of everyone at CBOE. In his remarks, Bill mentioned the transition process that has been underway here for some time. Thank you, Bill, for your vote of confidence in this entire team. While this is not retirement, I could not let the moment pass without publicly thanking you for your leadership as CEO. Going forward, as Chairman of the Board, we will continue to tap into your expertise and perspective, which we believe to be second to none in the industry. So thank you, Bill. And with that, we will now open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Deborah Koopman","Thanks. We'll be happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, would be most appropriate thing is to congratulate Bill for the transition to the new role. It's been great working with you, Bill, even well before the company went public, so congratulations.","William J. Brodsky","Thanks, Rich.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. Anyway, my question, and I hate to narrow and get into the weeds here, but I'm trying to figure out how Alan beats every quarter here. So on the regulatory fees, the fee that increased that you actually filed with the SEC was only a couple pennies or 30%. But you saw an increase both in the revenue line of 50%, as well as the per, if you divide it by the contracts, per contract charge went up by 46% or 47%. So I'm trying to see, I know it's a breakeven thing, but we already have the expenses in because of your guidance, so it is providing upside to the model. And just -- if you could sort of break -- help us understand why it up-ticked so much?","Alan J. Dean","Yes. Rich, Alan. You have to remember that the options regulatory fee that we put in an increase in the middle of last year, I think, was August, and CBOE and in C2. And then we increased that fee again in January of this year. So that's why, if you're just focusing on the change we made on January 1, it might not add up to the change in the total revenue. You have to compound it. You have to look at the change we made in 2012 and the change we made on January.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","But the numbers I would talk about was sequentially quarter from 1Q '13 versus 4Q '12.","Alan J. Dean","Yes, so -- and so that's what I'm trying to point out, that if you have to look at the increase per customer contract that we instituted in August of 2012, and then add to it the change that we made in January of '13, that's why the regulatory fee line item has taken a big bump up. And also remember that, that fee, that options regulatory fee, is assessed on every customer contract. It doesn't matter which exchange it's traded on. All the exchanges do this, and we all have our own fees. So you just can't tie it to our volume. It's industry volume. And there are other revenue items within regulatory fees that are also -- and there is just not that one fee.","Operator","Our next question in queue is from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So your February pricing changes have definitely had some impact, but you haven't recouped all of the shares you lost versus last year. And I guess I'd just be interested in your thoughts on whether you think the pricing changes have done enough? Are you comfortable with where your market share has kind of shaken out around these levels? And if not then, what levers do you think you have to pull to address that?","Edward L. Provost","Jillian, Ed Provost. So we're never completely satisfied with the market share levels. It's always a battle. Clearly, pricing is a significant -- and evermore so, a significant influence in where order flow is directed. Alan has noted the changes we have made in our VIP program, a couple of times actually over the last 2 months. It's a combination of pricing, it's a combination of technology enhancements, but making sure that our market model appeals to the user community. So again, it is and will always be in the competitively traded classes, a battle, and we are striving as much as we can to maintain the #1 position in that area.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So in general, the 17.6% in April is something that, obviously, you'd like it to be higher, but it's something that you're comfortable with?","Edward L. Provost","Well, let me just say this. We're 0.002% behind the market share leader. So we don't like to be second, we like to be first. So I would say we're not satisfied with it, and we continue to battle for the #1 position.","Operator","Our next question in queue is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you guys elaborate a little bit more on the milestones need to achieve whether with the SEC or just internally to kind of resume your focus on extending the trading hours of the VIX? And maybe a little bit more clarity on the timeline when you think this could happen will be helpful.","William J. Brodsky","Yes, this is Bill Brodsky. Let me at least respond initially to that. The whole initiative on 24,500 was announced by us last fall, and we are very, obviously, enthusiastic about it. But the most important thing is to maintain the integrity of our systems. And so we're just going to put off the start date until we're comfortable that this major change to our systems, I mean there are not many exchanges in the world that trade more than their local trading hours. This is a major, major system enhancement. And what we're doing here is taking a deep breath. We're going to bring in someone to review it with us, so that -- because we don't have an actual deadline. This is a self-imposed, a very important initiative, but it doesn't have a deadline that we must do it by a certain date. So our concern is let's stabilize things because when you make a change like this, where you're basically running your computers almost all day long as opposed to during a very finite domestic trading period. We want to make sure that we have it right. And so we're just taking a deep breath. We'll announce the date when we're comfortable.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then does that require you, you think, any additional investing, whether through expenses in P&L or CapEx to whether you're bringing consultants from the outside or just to have to spend more resources fixing things up internally?","William J. Brodsky","Yes. Let me ask Alan to respond to that.","Alan J. Dean","Sure, Bill. Alex, we have -- within our, the guidance that we gave you 3 months ago on our CapEx for the year, I don't see any changes at all to that guidance at all. We regularly roll out and roll in new equipment in this change of expanded trading hours. All that means is we're more efficiently utilizing the hardware that we already have and that we will bring in. So no, I don't see any changes to CapEx because of this expanded trading hour goal.","Operator","Our next question in queue is from Chris Allen of Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Nice quarter, and congrats on the new role. I just wanted to ask real quickly, and if the RPC change that got made during the -- the prices you seem to have made during the quarter were in at the start of the quarter, what was the impact that's been on the RPC? Just trying to get a flavor for how to think about this moving forward?","Alan J. Dean","Yes, this is Alan. It's hard to say. Well, I could say, but I'm not going to say what the RPC would have been for the quarter had the changes been in for the quarter. What we did see is a decline in RPC first -- on February 1 when we rolled out the first changes to VIP, and then another slide throughout the March 1 when we rolled out another set of changes to VIP. And so based on what I saw in March and what I'm looking at in April, I would expect that to continue. But I'm not going to speculate on what that might be for the quarter going forward or for the year. As you know, there are many things that could impact the RPC for these multi-list products. What I'm sure is that's heading down from the rolling 3-month average that we gave you. It will be dependent on mix. It will be, the change will be evident in the data that we publish in the months going forward. If you're looking for potential size, you could look at what happened in our multi-list RPC in January of '12 compared to 2011 as it may be an indicator of what to expect. But keep in mind that the multi-list business is becoming an ever smaller part of our business. It's hard to believe that I'm saying that, but the multi-list business accounted for less than 25% of our transaction fees in the first quarter, while the futures side and the index side accounted for 77%. So the RPC is heading down, but it has less of an impact on us than ever before. So I hope that's helpful even though I didn't directly answer your question.","Operator","Our next question in queue is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So my first -- or I guess my question is, your futures franchise, I think, has obviously been one of your stars recently. And you're seeing a really nice volume growth. As you think about the VIX futures on a long term, like 2 or 3 years, how sustainable do you think your pricing is? Because as you mentioned, it is well above where your options pricing is and certainly, there's different characteristics to the contract. But do you think that as the contract continues to get more and more important, that you can maintain this pricing over the longer term?","Edward T. Tilly","This is Ed Tilly. Thank you, Patrick, for the question. We're very comfortable in the pricing that we have in place today. And I think as you point out, the notional size of this contract is very large compared to VIX options. So as I say just again, this is the pricing that's in place today. And then Alan said, give-or-take, in the pennies, if we have to offer some incentive going forward, I think it's minor. But we're in a very comfortable place today.","Operator","Our next question in queue is from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the futures business here, I think Bill mentioned that you're attracting more users. So hoping to get a flavor for how much or percentage of your volume is now coming from prop high-frequency traders? How much is from hedge fund? I think when you look at CME, I think prop is like 40% and hedge funds, maybe that's 10-plus. So do you think it can get there? And again, so where are you now? Where do you think it can get there? And just on Patrick's question, the changing user base, how are the fees for the different user bases? Should we think about shift here as maybe the prop side grows faster?","William J. Brodsky","Let's take that question in 3 parts. I think you've asked a couple in there. We'll have, Alex, we'll have Alan answer the fees to different users. Let me tell you kind of another trend that we see. We've always given you in the past the trend of the ETP's, the major institutional sponsored products that are trying to replicate some VIX exposure. And while that has been less and less of an impact on the overall volume that this last month marks the fourth consecutive month that growth in money in those ETPs has increased. So there's roughly $3.5 billion still in those ETP's. That's still meaningful. So on top of that, consecutive 4 months of growth is the trend of new users. And I will point out the strategies that I see, and then Ed can get into some of the new users that are coming into the futures contract. So I think what's interesting is what we see are tied trades. So if you look at our SPX, a very common trade, a volatility trade in SPX is trading calls versus futures. What we're seeing users now in VIX trading tied trades, so VIX futures versus VIX options. So at the end of day, that's really trading the volatility of VIX. So that's new and growing. Roughly 4,000 contracts, of the futures contracts today, are in this tied-up trade. That's new. We see the potential going forward as growing. So that's just one of the strategies and some of the changes that I see from how people are using the contract. I'll turn it over to Ed Provost as to who they are, and then Alan Dean on fees for specific users.","Edward L. Provost","Alex, Ed Provost here. So yes, it's -- our ability to have transparency all the way down to the end-user customer is somewhat limited because, of course, we only see the firms that they come through. But in our interaction with the customer base, we're seeing growth among hedge funds, high-frequency traders, proprietary trading. And one of the interesting recent changes is we've started seeing significant interest by the fixed income market, utilizing some equity exposure to increase their yield and managing that equity exposure using VIX options and futures. So in fact, we had an organization in here yesterday that was very, very excited about both the futures and the options and affirm that historically, it's been more fixed income than equity. So it really is on all fronts that we see a thirst for knowledge and increased usage. So again, in a way, it's a little bit of a lot of different groups and we're very pleased about it.","Alan J. Dean","Alex, Alan. Based on the new users that we're seeing come to VIX futures and looking at what might happen in the future, the differences in the rate per contract that we charge to the users, it isn't so significant that I would anticipate or expect a material change in our RPC for VIX futures going forward. So no, I don't see that as being an issue at all.","Operator","Our next question in queue is from Niamh Alexander of KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And congrats to you, Bill.","William J. Brodsky","Thank you.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","You're welcome. And cash, the cash generation was still strong this quarter, $95 million, and that's up 50% year-on-year. And you got quite a bit of cash on your balance sheet. You don't need a lot of cash to run your company. I know that you gave us kind of in the prepared remarks your priorities, but looking at the flow and looking at the kind of increased pace of cash generation, help me think about, is there -- are you kind of getting close to maybe thinking about inorganic growth? Or is it still we should think about the buyback? Is the appetite for buyback as strong as it was at this float of level of the share price or at the share price level 2?","Alan J. Dean","In my prepared remarks, I talked about the board's intentions or priorities, but it bears repeating. And our first priority is to reinvest in our business as needed to ensure future growth, to continue to pay regular dividends and grow them along with our business, and then to use excess cash for stock repurchases. So our attitude, our board's attitude, my attitude, Ed Tilly, Bill Brodsky and Ed Provost, nothing has changed in the way we prioritize, how we use our cash. We've always taken an opportunistic approach towards our stock repurchase program. And there are many things that could prevent us from being in the market, buying back our stock. And I know you're familiar with all those various circumstances. The one driver of our significant cash generation in the first quarter, that may not be obvious, is that we offer a discount to large options liquidity providers. If they prepay a certain part of their transaction fees for the year, then they receive a greater discount. So if you look at our cash generation in the past couple of years, you'll see the first quarter was always a blip, and that's typically the driver. So nothing has changed in our attitude about stock repurchases, and that's why we -- you see a jump in cash generation on the first quarter.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess that's a good indicator of volume then, too, because it's up on a strong first quarter last year. It's up 50%, and that's people prepaying for activity.","Edward L. Provost","Yes. Well, they prepay for the activity, it's based on the sliding scale. So what they're doing is, and you can read all this in our fee schedule. If they -- they were essentially buying their way down our sliding scale by prepaying for the entire year. And then they will pay us for incremental volume above their buy-down amount. So certainly, the great results we had for the quarter are a driver of the cash generation. But that prepayment is also a factor.","Operator","Our next question in queue is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question is on SPX Weeklys. The growth you guys are getting there is really just phenomenal. I'm just wondering, are you seeing new adopters kind of driving the incremental growth you're getting there? Or is it existing users increasing their trading frequency? And then in addition to that, we're now up to a point where Weeklys are 25% of total SPX volume. So just wondering how sustainable you think the growth is there?","Edward L. Provost","Chris, Ed Provost. And so the Weekly's phenomenon really across the industry, not just limited to SPX, has really been fabulous. In SPX, as we look at the users of the Weekly contract, it's a lot more retail than it is in the longer-term SPX, which is obviously heavily institutional. So we're very pleased with the growth. Again, hard to predict whether the 25% will be 30% or 40%. Certainly, the interest in Weeklys continues. We did discuss and announce at our conference in Las Vegas an initiative to expand the very, very successful Weeklys initiative, so that we will have a Weekly contract expiring everyday. That is to say, that whereas today, all Weeklys expire on Fridays. We will be beginning a new Weekly everyday, and we will have everyday, a Weekly expiring. So that's leveraging a very, very successful product. We think that will ultimately, just like Weeklys themselves were, become an industry standard across all classes. So Weeklys are very popular. And it is more retail-oriented than institutional.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question goes to the BOX contract. And I think the industry is objecting to that contract because I think it's confusing to those who are trading the products. My question is like are those objections likely to sway regulators that have already approved products like SPXpm and the SPX Weekly and the Apple Mini and the Amazon Mini and the Google Mini. Like how is the jumbo product really that much different than launching kind of Mini products, if that make sense?","Edward T. Tilly","Yes, this is Ed Tilly. Good question. I think that really, our comment letter was, let's have the industry get used to or swallow the Mini. Let them absorb that. The multiplier difference, let them know when they're looking at the 160 strike, for example, the half of money call, that there's this Spider, the very successful 2.5 million contract a day, Spider, let the retailer get used to a Mini contract. And then if that gains traction, then we should consider whether or not we fragment the liquidity and yet a third contract with another multiplier. But it's really kind of a staging and a length of time to market for the large contract. That's number one. There is the fragmented liquidity that is concerning. So if there's x amount of liquidity in the marketplace at the money 160 line, in my example, certainly if we introduce a Jumbo contract that's going to take some liquidity away from the very successful Spider contract today, that's concerning to us. We have users, both retail and institutional, that are trading Spiders that are used to a certain amount of liquidity at a given line. That's new. And then of course, selfishly, from an exchange perspective, we're interested in seeing what happens to the 2.5 million contracts, and whether or not a successful Max SPY turns that into 250,000 contracts. So we would be watching that as well. So ultimately, do we think the SEC will find this not as confusing as -- hopefully, they'll look at this in the timeline and take this up in a year or so after the Minis have been absorbed into the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question is from Gaston Ceron of Morningstar Equity Research.","Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just wondering, I just want to come back to the trading situation for a second and on your plans to kind of address things from there. I'm just curious, if you could say any more about, I think you said something like backup for this trading on these proprietary products. I'm wondering if you could say it a little bit more about how that might work? And just on a larger canvas, I know that they had, in the wake of the systems they showed or whatever it was, but there was some kind of criticism of the ability of exchanges to kind of be able to deploy proprietary products. I'm just curious how you see that, if you kind of see that kind of dying down or if you think that might kind of create problems for your ability to deploy your proprietary products down the road?","Edward T. Tilly","This is Ed Tilly. Thank you. Let me be really clear that we take any outage very, very seriously, as Bill said in his opening remarks. So there is obviously, for CBOE, there is a plan, and Bill laid that out. We have delayed the rollout of the extended training hours. That is done. We've identified the extended trading hour potential impact and rollout procedures with a third-party expert. That begins Monday. We'll provide our customers. This our goal, to provide our customers with near-instantaneous backup to SPX and VIX as a trading solution, likely electronic, but totally embedded with the SEC. That's in progress. A run-through with the SEC will be -- happen shortly. Then clearly, define revised procedures for our customers and the SEC, so that all will know what to expect in the future. That will happen right after we come up with a near-instantaneous solution. I'm confident we'll do it. So this is all about confidence and certainty in the marketplace from our customer's perspective. At the end of this, we're going to be more reliable. We will make sure our customers maintain the confidence that they already have in CBOE. And then to your -- the ultimate question is, no, I don't think there's any change that we anticipate for CBOE to trade proprietary products. It's what we do. It's the end result of our innovation. We developed the VIX methodology here. We will continue to trade VIX at CBOE or one of our exchanges. That's what the future looks like.","Operator","Our next question in queue is from Akhil Bhatia of Rosenblatt Securities.","Akhil Bhatia","Could you guys talk about the derivatives tax proposal and potential impact on volumes at CBOE and likelihood that it's going through the way it is right now?","William J. Brodsky","Sure. So this is Bill Brodsky. I think what you're referring to is the camp proposal. It is a -- it's not a, what I'll call legislative initiative at this point. It is really a white paper on the broad base of how derivatives might be changed in terms of taxation. We have been very, very active on this. I've been on the hill. I've met with Senators and Congressmen on this. We think that they, as it relates to the enlisted option business, the case against the proposal is very compelling, and we have gotten good response to our arguments on the hill. And then by the way, we are obviously very active in this. But all the other options exchanges, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, SIFMA, all involved because we have and have had a very strong convention based on the way the law works, of how options in the tax roll to 35 years. And as far as I'm concerned, nothing's broken. This affects literally millions of customer. And therefore, it affects an enormous amount of firms in the country. So they're all impacted on it. We've had firms like Schwab and Fidelity, E*TRADE, Ameritrade, and others all weigh in on this. So we are far from a point where I think that this is a real likelihood. I think it's more a discussion issue. And I will tell you that even in my new role, I will be extremely active on this because we have a system here that's not broken. It serves investors well. No one's getting away with anything. And it\u2019s unique, I think, to the option business to how this works. So I think that something we have to just to stay committed and involved in. And on future calls, obviously, we can fill you in. But it's just part of the process that's going on in Washington right now. We don't even know if there's going to be a tax bill. But if there is, we will be front and center on this issue.","Edward T. Tilly","I want to just, Akhil, punch one point that Bill made. This effort among the industry OCC is taking a very, very active role on this and able to coordinate the exchanges effort, of course. As Bill points out, we certainly are willing to take a lead role, but the OCC being able to bring us all together, we are -- our position is shared not only by the exchanges, but as Bill points out, by our end-users and millions that are representing that community. So this really is an effort on behalf of the entire industry, really to shed light and educate those that would be looking to change some of the tax code.","Operator","And we have a follow-up from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Your regulatory fees they kind of stay at this run rate are going to be probably up close to $20 million year-over-year. And if we look at your core expense guidance kind of midpoint of that is just that your core expenses, they're going to be up about $10 million year-over-year. So is it -- does the math work to say that aside from your increased regulatory costs, your core operating expenses are actually down on a year-over-year basis?","Alan J. Dean","Well, you heard Patrick here, you're projecting volume, customer volume for the year, which was pretty tough to do. We are -- all of our regulatory revenue can only be spent on regulatory expenses. You have to keep that in mind. So -- and there are increases in non-regulatory expenses year-over-year like stock compensation. So that's an interesting way to look at it, but you can't characterize it like that exactly.","Deborah Koopman","One more follow-up.","Operator","And we also have a follow-up from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just wanted to touch on that innovative kind of new pricing schedule you introduced at C2. It seems like it's having a positive impact, at least on the ETF side. So I just want to get an update like what you're seeing on your end, where you think the market share can go by the end of the year? And then I know you had mentioned when you launched that it might take time for market participants to kind of come to understand the new pricing and factor then into their decision-making. So have we gotten through that education period? Or are there still firms that kind of need to figure this out in order to take advantage of it?","Edward L. Provost","Jillian, Ed Provost. Yes, so we had a great month in April. We had 2.4% overall market share in C2. And that was up, this is a little bit of a play on small numbers, up about 25% from March where we have 1.9% market share. I will tell you though, most of that growth was in our ETF options, where we continue to use the maker-taker market model, specifically, Spider, which is the most actively traded multiply-listed option in the industry. We did 7.5% market share in the QQQs, another very active option class, 6.5% market share. And even the IWM, the Russell 2000 ETF option, 3.6% market share. So while we're thrilled with the growth in the market share in C2, it is primarily in the ETFs, which is still a maker-taker model. In the single names, where we've implemented our spread-based model, we are working with our DPMs. They're fine-tuning their models. We're getting traction. But to be quite frank with you, most of the growth we're seeing is in ETFs, and we're not displeased by that. We are still working with our users to get greater traction in the single names. So we're very pleased with the C2 story overall.","Alan J. Dean","This is Alan Dean. I want to add another part to Patrick's question about regulatory fees. Patrick, if customer volume is a lot more than we expect industry-wide, then you should expect us to reduce that options regulatory fee going forward to make sure that we don't collect more than we're spending on regulation. And conversely, if customer volume was a lot less than we expected in our regulatory costs paid where we think that it'd be then -- we'd be thinking about increasing that regulatory fee. So we look at that fee on a regular basis, and we'll adjust it accordingly.","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn it back to Debbie Koopman for any further remarks.","Deborah Koopman","Thanks a lot. That completes our call this morning. We appreciate your time and continued interest in our company. And I'll be available the rest of the day for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Debbie Koopman. Please go ahead.","Debbie Koopman","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our CEO, will discuss the quarter and our strategic initiatives for 2017; then Alan Dean, our Executive Vice President and CFO will detail our fourth quarter 2016 financial results and provide guidance on certain financial metrics for 2017.","Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us, for Q&A will be our President and COO, Ed Provost. In addition, I\u2019d like to point out that this presentation will include the use of several slides. We will be showing the slides and providing commentary on each.","A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website. As a preliminary note, you should be aware that this presentation contains forward-looking statements regarding intentions, beliefs, and expectations or predictions for the future of CBOE Holdings and Bats Global Markets, which are forward-looking statements and that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding anticipated expenses, expected tax rate, future share purchases, plan capital spending, the expected benefits of the planned acquisition of Bats Global Markets and anticipated timing of closing that transaction.","Forward-looking statements represent our current judgment on what the future may hold and while we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties.","Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements including due to the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section of CBOE and Bats filings with the SEC","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ed Tilly.","Edward Tilly","Thank you, Debbie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report a strong fourth quarter 2016 at CBOE Holdings with adjusted earnings per share of $0.63 on revenue of $163 million.","Our fourth quarter performance capped off another year of solid financial results and our fourth consecutive year of record index trading led by new all-time highs in SPX options and VIX futures trading.","Overall volume at CBOE Holdings during the fourth quarter rose 14% year-over-year, fueled by increased trading and our higher margin index options and futures products, which were up 13% and 26% respectively.","For the month of January, we saw trading volume increased 7% over December, with total options volume up 7% and VIX futures volume up 15%. We made significant headway in developing a seamless integration process for our planned acquisition of Bats Global Markets, which was overwhelmingly approved by our stockholders of both companies. We expect the transaction to close by the end of this quarter.","We recently received regulatory approval from the Dutch Central Bank, which leaves us one remaining regulatory approval from the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority FCA.","We are confident that following the closing, we will be positioned to immediately begin realizing the benefits of joining Bats U.S. and European equities, options, ETF trading and global FX platform with CBOE's wide array of equity and index options, multi-asset volatility products and educational resources.","In addition to significantly expanding and diversifying our product line, the acquisition will increase our non-transactional revenue stream on day one. We also look to immediately broaden our reach with Bats European presence to cross-promote two distinct product lines to an expanded customer base and to begin the process of streamlining the company\u2019s technology on to Bats proven platform.","Importantly, we believe the full potential of the deal lies beyond the sum of its parts. Our companies not only have distinct product lines, but also touch customers at different points along the product development and trading cycle.","For instance, as a product innovator, CBOE develops strategy benchmarks for asset managers to create ETPs and benefited from trading in these products, but lacked the means to capture the economics and data from listing them.","The addition of Bats' global ETP listing and trading venues is expected to enable CBOE to create an ecosystem that encompasses every aspect of product development from design, listing and trading, to the generation and packaging of market data with which to create still more products.","Similarly, we plan to leverage CBOE's derivatives expertise and Bats' European and FX footprint to create unique European and FX products for the benefit of our customers in those markets.","The CBOE Bats combination not only enhances our framework for product development, but also provides unique building blocks for new products in the form of CBOE's proprietary indexes and methodologies and an expanded data offering afforded by Bats and CBOE.","We believe the ability to expand our value proposition as it relates to product development is especially compelling given the trends toward packaging sophisticated strategies into simple and cost effective list of products including ETPs and structured products.","This is something of a sweet spot for us as we expect these products will largely be index-based, enabling us to leverage CBOEs indexing services offering. We also expect those products to be increasingly global macro themed, and we anticipate leveraging Bats proven trading technology to expand our customer reach.","In thinking of the opportunities ahead, it's worth noting that industry wide ETP listings are at an all-time high. ETPs account for 30% of the total dollar value traded in US cash equity markets and ETP assets stand at $2.5 trillion, 10% of US stock market capitalization.","Volume and alternative ETPs which include volatility products has doubled in the past three years. We're seeing similar growth in ETP options trading which increased 7% last year, against a 10% decline in US equity options volume.","The ability to develop, list and trade new products brings us closer to customers whether they be issuers, investors or traders enabling us to better anticipate and respond to their needs throughout the trading cycle.","Add to that, CBOEs extended reach via Bats global platform and we have tremendous potential to develop ongoing value-added relationships with a growing global customer base.","The corner stone of our value proposition will remain product development, including products and services designed for a growing number of fund issuers, asset managers and investment advisors that use options and futures to provide risk managed solutions for their clients.","Case in point is CBOE Vest Financial, our asset management affiliate. CBOE Vest has now launched three mutual funds, each focusing on a unique targeted investment outcome, downside protection, enhanced growth and income generation delivered by options strategies benchmarked to a CBOE index.","In less than six months since launch, the CBOE Vest funds have accumulated $35 million in assets and are now available on all major registered investment advisory platforms. We believe the expertise of the Vest team combined with CBOEs proprietary product offerings and expertise in developing option based strategy performance benchmarks uniquely positions our company to lead the option space and targeted based outcome investing, and will serve as a model that can be repeated with other innovative asset managers and advisors.","We look forward to further developing our CBOE Vest family of products in 2017, including leveraging the product packaging capabilities of CBOE Vest for the structured products market in Europe through our planned acquisition of Bats.","Investor education and close collaboration with end-users goes hand in hand with successful product development at CBOE. This is especially true now as we continue to develop new CBOE products as we expand into new asset classes with the anticipated close of the Bats deal.","The continued growth of our risk Management Conference, RMC program which tends to attract early adopters of our new products, takes on even greater significance in light of our expanding global footprint and product line.","In November, we hosted our second annual CBOE RMC Asia held in Hong Kong. I am pleased to say that attendance at the 2016 event nearly doubled that of the previous year, and included many of Asia's foremost volatility and derivatives traders, strategists and researchers. We are now preparing for our 33rd annual RMC US which begins March 8 in Dana Point, California.","In closing, I will reiterate that we believe the pending CBOE-Bats combination will enable us to cement CBOEs position as the go to partner for developing cutting edge trading investment solutions.","We also believe that it increases our ability to provide the marketplace with innovative products across a wide array of asset classes, extends our reach with Bats pan-European equities and global FX Markets and enhances our menu of market data products and services.","Moreover, we plan that CBOEs greatly expanded product and services offerings to ultimately be powered by Bats leading from proprietary training technology. At its essence, this deal is about bringing together two remarkably talented and dedicated teams we've created two exceptionally innovative companies.","I want to take this opportunity to thank both teams for the contribution making CBOE and Bats market leaders and for the collaborative efforts in creating a process to the planned combination of these two companies into a single even stronger market innovator and leader. We believe the combined expertise of CBOE and Bats teams will enable our company to grow our customer base and reward shareholders for years to come.","Before turning this over to Alan Dean, I would like to note this will likely be Ed Provost last earnings call at CBOE. Ed plans to retire upon the close of our planned acquisition of Bats, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his tremendous contribution to CBOE.","Ed began his career at CBOE in 1975, after rising through the ranks in our regulatory division, Ed headed operations planning before being named Executive Vice President and Chief Business Development Officer in 2001. Ed became President and COO in 2013.","I worked closely with Ed these past years. I can attest there's never been a dull moment and that CBOE has benefited from his insight and talent of every turn. His leadership and guidance have been instrumental to CBOEs ongoing success. I know I speak on behalf of the entire team at CBOE and thanking Ed for his outstanding service and friendship to CBOE.","With that, I'll turn it over to Alan.","Alan Dean","Thank you, Ed. And I'll also add my congratulations and thanks to Ed Provost. We'll miss you.","Thanks to everyone for joining us to review fourth quarter results. I'll provide some incremental commentary around our financial results for the quarter and then review our guidance for certain financial metrics for 2017.","CBOE Holdings ended 2016 with solid fourth quarter results as highlighted on this slide. Adjusted operating revenue was $163.2 million, up 6% compared with $154 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Adjusted operating income was $79.8 million representing an adjusted operating margin of 48.9%, up 90 basis points versus the fourth quarter 2015. Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders was $51.4 million, a 5% increase compared with 2015's fourth quarter, while adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 7% to $0.63.","Before I continue, let me point out, that our GAAP results reported for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2015 include certain items that impact the comparison of our operating performance which are not included in our non-GAAP results. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck.","Turning to the details of the quarter. Adjusted operating revenue increased by $9.2 million, primarily due to increases in revenue generated from transaction fees, market data fees, and other revenue versus the fourth quarter of 2015.","Transaction fees were up $4.6 million or 4% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter due to a 13% increase in trading volume partly offset by an 8% decrease in the average revenue per contract or RPC. Our blended RPC including options and futures was $0.0377 compared with $0.0408 in the fourth quarter of 2015.","The RPC in our options business decreased to $0.0311 compared with $0.0349 in last year's fourth quarter, but increased sequentially compared to $0.0304 in the third quarter of 2016.","The year-over-year decline primarily reflects a lower RPC on equity options and exchange-traded products, which were down 45% and 42% respectively due to the mix of account type and higher volume discounts and incentives.","The quarter-over-quarter increase in the options RPC was due to a lower volume discounts in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2016. On the futures side, CFE's revenue per contract was relatively unchanged at $1.68 for the fourth quarter.","As shown by the pie charts on this side, the mix of trading volume between our indexed products and multiple-listed products was about the same in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus 2015 with our highest margin index options and futures contracts accounting for 40.8% of total volume versus 40.9% in 2015's fourth quarter.","Converting the volume into transaction fees, you see that index options and futures contracts accounted for 89.4% of transaction fees for the quarter, up from 83.1% in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, proprietary products accounted for 88.2% of transaction fees, up from 82.9% in 2015.","Looking at other variables influencing total operating revenue, market data fees increased $1.5 million and other revenue increased $2.4 million compared with last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The increase to market data revenue is primarily driven by an increase in CBOE share OPRA market data as well as continued growth in market data revenue from CBOE's proprietary index values.","The increase in other revenue was primarily due to higher regulatory fines assessed to trading permit holders for disciplinary actions. This revenue is used to offset regulatory expenses.","Now turning to expenses. This slide details total adjusted operating expenses of $83.4 million, up $3.3 million or 4% compared with $80.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase largely reflects higher costs for compensation of benefits, royalty fees and travel and promotional expenses, offset somewhat by decrease in depreciation and amortization.","The decline in depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 is mainly due to the final write-off of certain regulatory software that occurred in June of 2016 with the plan transfer to FINRA systems.","This next slide details core operating expense of $53.2 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of $3.5 million or 7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase was primarily driven by a $2.2 million increase in compensation and benefits and an $800,000 increase in travel and promotional expenses.","The increase in compensation and benefits was largely due to higher incentive based compensation expenses which are aligned with our financial performance. The increase in travel and promotional expenses primarily reflects higher costs for advertising of special events versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Volume based expenses which include royalty fees and order routing were $20.4 million for the quarter, an increase of $2.3 million or 13% reflecting higher royalty fees resulting from increased trading volume and our license products. Total trading volume in our Index Complex was up 12% for the quarter with Index Options up 11% and VIX futures up 24%.","Moving to other income and expenses. Investment and other income increased by $1.6 million in the fourth quarter reflecting an increase in the dividend recognized from the Options Clearing Corporation. If you'll recall last year\u2019s dividend represented 10 months whereas for 2016, it covers the full year.","Finishing up on the income statement review our effective tax rate was 39.8% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with 36.7% in 2015s fourth quarter. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in uncertain tax positions, offsetting the favorable impact of the preferential tax treatment on the OCC dividend income.","Now, let's turn to a few highlights relating to our balance sheet and capital allocation. In 2016, we generated more than $230 million in cash from operating activities. It is worth noting that this includes over $19 million pretax and acquisition related costs incurred in 2016.","For the year, we used about $44 million for capital expenditures, returned nearly $79 million through dividends and about $65 million through share buybacks. In 2016 we repurchased nearly 1 million shares under our share repurchase program at an average price of $63.83 reducing shares outstanding by nearly 3%.","We have approximately $97 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorizations. As we noted previously, we suspended our share repurchase program in connection with our pending acquisition of Bats so there was no repurchase activity in the fourth quarter.","However going forward, we may make opportunistic share repurchases, although we currently intend to direct our capital resources towards paying down the $1.65 billion of debt incurred in connection with the Bats transaction.","Moving to our guidance for 2017 which is based on CBOE only and does not take into account our pending acquisition of Bats. Once we close the transaction, we will update our guidance to take into account the combined company. CBOEs core expenses for the full year 2016 came in at about $208 million, below our original guidance of $211 million to $215 million, but in line with the outlook we provided on our last earnings call.","For 2017, we expect core expenses to be in a range of $214 million to $218 million representing an increase of 3% to 5% versus 2016. The expected increase in 2017 primarily reflects higher expenses for compensation and benefits and professional fees and outside services.","The increase in compensation of benefits primarily reflects merit increases and higher incentive based compensation. The increase in professional fees and outside services primarily is driven by higher costs relating to regulatory services; however we expect regulatory revenue to offset this increase.","Stock based compensation expense included in compensation and benefits is expected to be approximately $27.5 million for 2017. This includes $13 million on accelerated stock based compensation expense, approximately 12 million of which is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2017.","We plan to include the accelerated stock based compensation in our non-GAAP reconciliation. The increase in accelerated stock based compensation versus 2016 is due to a plan change in the retirement investing schedule for Equity Award Grants. We expect our effective tax rate for 2017 to be in the range of 38.5% to 39.5%.","Moving on, capital spending in 2017 is expected to be between $46 million to $48 million, up somewhat compared with the $44 million we spent in 2016 which includes our ongoing investments in systems hardware and software to support and enhance our trading technology.","Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be between 440 million to $42 million compared with $44 million in 2016. In addition let me touch on interest expense. On December 15, 2016, we entered into $1 billion five year delay draw term loan agreement and on January 12, 2017, we completed an offering of $650 million of 3.65% senior notes due in 2027.","Combined this secures the $1.65 billion to finance the cash portion of our pending transaction of Bats, as well as the repayment of Bats existing indebtedness and certain transaction costs.","The interest in fees for the senior notes are expected to result in interest of expense of about $24.2 million for the full year of 2017 little over $6 million each quarter. We plan to draw on the term loan upon closing of the Bats acquisition.","The initial interest rate of the term loan will be based on LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum. This rate is subject to change based on credit rating and a range from 1.00% to 1.75%.","Finally, we entered into December 15, 2016 a $150 million five year revolving credit facility that can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Currently, there are no borrowings outstanding under this agreement.","Going forward we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and we plan to keep debt levels in line with an investment grade profile to maintain the flexibility for capital expenditures, dividend payments and opportunistic share repurchases and other strategic initiatives.","We entered 2017 excited about expanding our sources of value creation and the diversification of our earnings profile we expect to achieve through our acquisition of Bats. Our strong financial position and operating cash flow generation has allowed us to invest in CBOE's future and we look forward to executing on our strategy to deliver long-term value creation for our stockholders.","With that, we thank you for your time this afternoon and attention. I'll turn the call back over to Debbie for instructions on a Q&A portion of our call.","Debbie Koopman","Thanks, Alan. At this point, we would be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back into the queue. And if time permits, we\u2019ll take a second question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Worthington","Hi, good afternoon. And thank you for taking my question. Many shareholder advocacy groups support the separation of the CEO and Chairman of the Board position. So maybe Ed, for you, the CBOE or do you expect to hold both positions longer term or is this more of a near term consideration for CBOE as the Bats and CBOE merger kind of go through their integration?","Edward Tilly","The Board obviously can make its decision at any time going forward, but this is not anticipated to be short-term in its duration.","Kenneth Worthington","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just on the Bats deal, in the release you state that you'll immediately begin to realize the benefits of bringing together Bats and CBOE.","Can you just talk about the process thus far and I'm just trying to get a sense as to how much of a head start you've been able to get on the integration planning for costs and revenue synergies and whether or not you feel more or less confident in your synergy guidance than when you announced the deal?","Edward Tilly","So two questions. Let me tackle just the process that has been under way, certainly since our announcement in September, we have pretty detailed work streams in a structure and teams in place that have been facilitating that process in readiness and using really strategic integration office and Steering Committee that really reports up to me.","So from a readiness, we're good to go. And as in my prepared remarks as I've said, we've gotten one of the final two approvals completed on the second and then just to wait the FCAs approval.","We are ready integration wise should that come earlier, but we're still planning in end of the quarter, if things change, we get that FCA approval we'll let you know. And then Alan, if you want to tackle the actual synergy numbers and the road map to delivering on those.","Alan Dean","Sure, thanks, Ed. Hi, Kyle. I can't help but be more confident at this point than I was say last October 1st when we certainly did a lot of background investigation calculating to come up with our synergy numbers and now I have the month of October, November, December, January and as Ed said we've been working hard at this integration, so I do feel more confident in the number going forward and I'm happy to report that.","Kyle Voigt","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Thanks a lot guys. Maybe just Alan, just two things on the compensation. Just the acceleration in the first quarter, just maybe the decision around that, and then there is some accounting changes on the equity comp side and just wanted to see if there's any impact on the tax rate for 2017?","Alan Dean","Yes. So the acceleration - you're talking about the stock based comp is that correct, Mike?","Michael Carrier","Correct.","Alan Dean","Okay. So what we're doing is changing when stock compensation would fully vest and has to do with years of service and age and we're - our practice is changing in a way that puts us in line with best practice. And so that's all we're doing and we felt as if we were outside of best practice going forward and we weren't serving shareholders in the best way we could.","So that's the grants happen in February around here and so this is all subject to Board approval, our Board meeting is late next week, but that's what we're anticipating.","Regarding the change in taxes related to stock based compensation, yes, we do anticipate a favorable impact on the effective tax rate because of the gap changes. But it's not material to us. And it's included in the tax guidance range that I gave you.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Alan Dean","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm","Hi good evening. Just wanted to touch about multi-list for a second, I recognize it's a small part of your business obviously, but if you look at the pricing trend and market share that business continues to bleed. Just wondering Alan if you have any updated thoughts in terms of your positioning from a competitive dynamic. When you see what your competitors are doing, do you feel like you have to keep on taking this race further down?","And then also I think when investors sometimes look at your RPC as you reported and compare to the other public peers out there, it looks like you're very, very underpriced relative to the competition, so you obviously look a little bit more in detail in terms of different pricing schemes that other guys have, so how much do you feel like you may be undercutting the competition at this time? Thank you.","Alan Dean","How many questions was that?","Alex Kramm","That was one question.","Alan Dean","So pricing in the multi. So if you look at the press release, even though overall pricing is down year-over-year sequentially, you can see a bounce in both the equity and the exchange traded products line which I'm happy to see. And we - so I think that's good. I hope that trend continues.","Of course, I can't, I'm not predicting anything, but that bounce is good and reflects some fee changes that we made late last year. I think price is what moves market share in that multi-list category. Of course you have to have the right systems, the right functionality, dependability. We have that. We spend a lot of time thinking about fees and so although I'd like to see fees higher, I think we're priced right.","Remember this is the small part of the business as you referred to it. It's only part of the multi list picture. There is access fees and market data revenue and exchange services and other fees and our goal is to optimize total revenue, and sometimes we do a better job at that than others but I'm pretty happy with where we are at. I still - also I'll say this, and you've heard me say this.","I think there is a bottom to pricing in the multi list category and it's higher than what you would expect if you're comparing it to the cash equities side of our industry and that's because of the lack of market data revenue that the options industry has relative to cash equity.","So it feels like we're at a bottom, but I think we do a pretty good job on pricing and optimizing our total revenue, so did I - so I'm not sure if I answered all your questions, Alex.","Alex Kramm","Maybe we'll just leave it at that then for now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein","Hey guys, good evening.","Edward Tilly","Hi.","Alex Blostein","A question for you guys around the proprietary products so wanted to touch on the VIX and SPX complex particularly on the trends you're seeing so far year-to-date. So the VIX levels obviously down a lot and you coming off a pretty tough comps on a year-over-year basis.","But your volumes are actually holding up reasonably okay, kind of down maybe mid to high single digits and it seems like the open interest continues to grow at least on the futures side.","So just peeling back a couple layers maybe give us color what's going on and why maybe it's holding up a little better relative to the broader low volatile environment?","Edward Tilly","I think what you're speaking to is the utility and even on days with low volume if we look at a day like today in the industry not a super busy day but well over a million contracts again in SPX.","And I think you are speaking to just the broad receptivity and the flexibility around the contracts and the offerings with Monday, Wednesday, and Friday expiries and being able to capture and monetize short-term movements in the market.","But overall in volatility, I think that it's such a great question Alex coming from you because I've looked at Buzz Gregory who is probably one of the leaders, I think in volatility space, when he commented and I follow him. Policies and process and it takes time.","So far we've got a lot of words on what might affect the business overtime and the market seems to be willing to give the administration a pass in short-term and charge relatively inexpensive rates for insurance on the portfolio of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days.","But not surprisingly, not willing to ensure those portfolios for any long periods of time in that the price if we look out over the volatility service returns to normal pricing October VIX level over '18.","So this is typical of shorter term trends, the effect of realized volatility as an anchor on implied volatility looking out over time, but over time the market just not willing to sell that insurance at cheap levels indefinitely.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Right. Thanks for that. We'll make sure to tell Buzz, you say hello there.","Edward Tilly","All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","Edward Tilly","Hi, Brian.","Brian Bedell","Just want to go back on the Bats synergies. I appreciate, obviously, you're going to give us updated guidance when you close the deal. But in line with what you were saying Alan that you are becoming more optimistic, as we think about lining up the integration, should we be thinking realistically, that $50 million year three expense save is likely to happen much sooner than that?","And then maybe if you can comment on potential incremental saves over and above that maybe not quantifying them, but just categorically talking about them?","Alan Dean","Well, it's way too early Brian for me to throw off my $50 million target or three-year synergies. I hope that in a not too distant future, my confidence will get to the point where I can revise this number up, but I'm certainly not anywhere close to that point right now.","This will take time. We're diligently working on the integration process. But it's a three-year goal and if you think about the realization of the synergies, you'll have some synergies that happened out of the box for an easy one or C suite redundancy or things like outside auditors or insurance that happens right out of the box.","But then the migration from our platform to their platform, the realization of synergies there are real, but that will take time to realize. And you won't know for sure, how you're doing against your targets until later on.","So I'll restate that I'm more confident now in the $50 million three-year synergy targets, but I'm nowhere near the point where I could revise them either way.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Chris Harris","Thank you. Hi guys.","Edward Tilly","Hi, Chris.","Alan Dean","Hi.","Chris Harris","Wondering if you guys can talk a little bit about what the multiple listed options business is going to look like once it's merged with Bats and then I guess specifically wondering whether you think the merger will help to stabilize your share in RPC in that part of your business?","Edward Tilly","Well until we close we won't be talking about RPC and the Bats organization today or their exchanges, but from an operational standpoint, yes, we will be running the four exchanges each I think offering they are so unique.","And part of what we really drove looking at even the multi-list business here as we really don't truly compete even in multi-list options and the nature and the difference between the fee schedules and the allocation algorithms between Bats and CBOE.","So we look forward actually to bringing them in under CBOE Holdings and then we'll optimize and make sense on fees and allocation algorithms when we look at the combined offering. So it will be at day one business as usual, we will be running those four exchanges and looking to make changes over time.","Chris Harris","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. I guess Alan, if you could comment maybe on the outlook for some of the non-transaction revenue specifically thinking about access services into next year?","Alan Dean","Sure. Be glad to, Dan. Access fees let's start with that. That has since our IPO been declining slightly year-over-year and there is - were way above market in what we charge there and so the 2015 to 2016 is down about $1 million.","So I would expect a kind of slow decline going forward in access fees as continuing into 2017. Exchange services and other fees, I would expect that line item to continue to grow at the rate of inflation or even at a rate slightly above inflation because of more customers and pricing opportunities.","Market data fees, that's half of that line item is there because of market share and the multi-list side and proprietary side. So half of that line item will grow or decline with our market share.","And the other half is our proprietary data fees which like exchange services and other fees, I think will be successful in gaining new customers and there could be pricing opportunities there. So I would look at that half of that growing with inflation or slightly above.","I should also say that on the half that is impacted completely by market share and market data fees, OPRA has a history of increasing fees marginally with the rate of inflation, so if you stayed flat on market share your revenue should still go up slightly because of their continued price increases on that side.","Regulatory fees for fourth quarter 2016 all that revenue is used to support our regulatory efforts and because our regulatory expenses are increasing by 3% or 5%. I would expect this line item to go up in concert with our regulatory expenses. Other revenue, there's two; the two largest items here are fines and licensing fees.","And fines are really hard to predict, very chunky, very up and down and you may recall this year we were light and fines all year until the fourth quarter and then larger fine, I have no transparency or ability to predict what could happen there.","Although 2016 feels like a typical year and 2015 seems like a higher year in terms of fines looking back over the years. The second largest line item in other revenue was licensing fees.","So this is all the fees that we collect primarily licensing our VIX methodology around the world and ETPs isn\u2019t based on AUM and that line item continues to grow by a rate faster than inflation.","And so I'm not putting a number to it, but it's not too far from the point where we\u2019d be thinking about separating that as its own separate line item, so I hope that background helps.","Dan Fannon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm","Wow. We are already through here. Hello, again.","Debbie Koopman","Wake up, Alex.","Alex Kramm","Yeah. Some people are missing what's going on here.","Edward Tilly","Something about foothold here.","Debbie Koopman","Come on, you are the last one.","Alex Kramm","All right. I'll be quick. No just one quick question, only one question this time. I guess for anyone who wants to chime in but obviously with the new administration there's been a lot of talk about deregulation, if I look at options volume over last two years it's been pretty stagnant.","So just wondering if you step back and think about the environment over last two years and higher capital requirements and all that stuff we've been seeing, where do you think any sort of deregulation could help your business and are you more optimistic now or do you think it's not going to be really a game changer?","Edward Tilly","So we've had a little different view on the benefits coming out of regulation in that the exchange space benefits from transparency. We think our customers are better served with a transparent market and we are in favor with markets and in favor of essential counterparty clearing.","So from that view, that's all been what I think is very positive, so what can happen what's going forward really is around capital and to your point I think that some of the capital rules have been pretty good headline grabbers. But they have not de-risked the system. They are not risk-based not all of them are risk-based.","So maybe a more rational approach to the capital and the capital requirements if there's a risk component where we can get behind that because we are about delivering and mitigating risk it's what we stand for. But when the capital requirements don't offer offsets of long and short and some of this has been just not done we think optimally we'll be involved in affecting as much as we can and influencing positively regulation going forward.","Alex Kramm","All right. Very good. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","Hey, wanting to jump in with a quick one for Alan. So generally it seems like the trends over the last several years have generally been pretty positive in terms of revenue and EPS. And in contrast to the operating cash flow box you have on slide 23 where it looks like operating cash flow peaked in 2014 and it is down the last couple of years.","Alan, can you kind of walk us through why that's decreased and I think in particular as I look at the balance sheet, there's been a large increase in your income taxes receivable that might have something to do with that?","Debbie Koopman","Yeah.","Edward Tilly","Yeah. So part of its capital expenditures have increased over the years and we have paid in more in taxes than there's a large tax receivable as we paid in more due to uncertain tax positions that are out there. Debbie, am I forgetting anything there?","Debbie Koopman","Yeah. No, it's mostly the tax that's where a lot of the change has come like you said we have a big receivable, so we've made tax payments and we have an increase in uncertain tax positions, so that affects the cash flow.","Edward Tilly","And don't forget in 2016, we had a large number for acquisition costs that was new to us and would have certainly helped to turn that - make that 2016 cash flow generation number look a lot better.","I'll tell you what I'm going to do Patrick is ask Debbie to take a look at that and if there is any details that I'm forgetting, she'll give you a call and we'll get back to you.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","Got it. Appreciate it.","Edward Tilly","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, guys. Hey, Alan just a quick one on the expense guidance. On the stock based comp, just I guess in the total 27.5, is that all included in the 2.14 to 2.18?","Alan Dean","No. So the 27.5 is total, but 13 is going to be adjusted out as a non-GAAP measure. So the expense that we're reporting is the net between the two - the 27.5 and the 13 and that's what's included in the core expenses.","Debbie Koopman","Actually, I think it\u2019s 14 for the year. 13 is in the first quarter\u2026","Alan Dean","Yeah, right.","Debbie Koopman","Since it\u2019s heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter, we told them what the first quarter impact would be.","Michael Carrier","Okay. That makes sense. I just wanted to clarify it. Thanks a lot.","Alan Dean","Yes.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Debbie Koopman for any closing remarks.","Debbie Koopman","Thank you. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. This completes our call. We appreciate your time and continued interest in the company. I'll be around for however much time I need to take any follow-ups. We'll be traveling in the morning, so you won't be able to contact me, but then I'll be available in the afternoon. Thanks.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Debbie Koopman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please begin.","Deborah Koopman","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Bill Brodsky, our Chairman and CEO, will provide an overview of the quarter and an update on our strategic initiatives; then Alan Dean, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will review our third quarter 2012 financial results.","Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A is our President and COO, Ed Tilly; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Business Development Officer, Ed Provost. In addition, I'd like to point out that this presentation will include the use of several slides. A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","As a preliminary note, you should be aware that this presentation contains forward-looking statements, which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold. And while we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.","Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a full disclosure of the factors that may affect any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after this conference call.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Brodsky.","William J. Brodsky","Thanks, Debbie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I know many of you are calling in from the East Coast, and I want to preface my prepared remarks by acknowledging the very difficult circumstances that many of you and your families are dealing with in the aftermath of this devastating storm. We know that a long recovery is ahead. Our employees, like all Americans, are seeking ways to help in the relief effort. We are urging them to follow President Obama's request for financial support of the recovery efforts, and our company will lead by example in that donation effort.","There's been speculation in the media on whether the closures, Monday and Tuesday, could have or should have been avoided. We participated in the calls with other exchanges and the SEC in the spirit of cooperation. We did not and will not second guess decisions made by those in the eye of the storm. Their first priority was to avoid any additional calamity, financial or worse, that could potentially result from keeping markets open as a life-threatening storm engulfed the entire Eastern seaboard.","Every natural disaster is different. No doubt there will be lessons to be learned once the response to this has been more fully evaluated. For now, we are grateful that trading resumed yesterday without a hitch, and we're returning to business as usual, at least in the financial markets. Thank you again for joining us under what are difficult circumstances for many of you. I will now turn to my report, the CBOE's results for the third quarter of 2012.","It's my pleasure to report another strong quarter for CBOE Holdings, where our ability to leverage proprietary products to compete effectively in multi-listed products and to prudently manage our resources enabled us to achieve solid financial results. There were several bright spots in trading volume at the CBOE, maybe even more notable, given the very lackluster trading in the broader market, particularly in U.S. equities, where third quarter volume has hit the lowest in 5 years. Year-to-date, the options industry is down 13% from last year's record pace. At CBOE, where increased market share and a diverse product line have helped to mitigate the effects of a broader market decline, volume for the same period is down 7%.","In light of the market challenges, we took proactive measures to reduce expenses while continuing to invest in our growth initiatives. My remarks today will focus on progress made in those initiatives and on the considerable opportunities we see ahead, beginning with product development.","There are several positive developments to note with regard to our high-margin proprietary product lines, CBOE's S&P 500 Index options complex and options and futures on CBOE's Volatility Index. Our S&P 500 Index product line, which includes our flagship SPX product, SPXpm and SPX Weeklys, which is also a PM-settled product, carries our highest options rate per contract.","SPX Weeklys, one of these bright spots that I mentioned, represent one of CBOE's fastest-growing products. CBOE invented the weekly options concept by helping customers to target opportunities tied to specific market events, such as earnings and government reports. SPX Weeklys was CBOE's first weekly product, and it initially traded solely in open outcry. In late 2010, we transitioned SPX Weeklys to our Hybrid trading model, which incorporates electronic and open outcry trading in one exchange. Volume nearly tripled in 2011, and year-to-date through September, trading is up 39%.","Moving on now to our volatility franchise. Trading in VIX options and futures continues to thrive even amidst low volatility. VIX options average daily volume is up 4% through September compared to last year's record-setting pace, and volume in VIX  futures continued to ride a wave of dramatic record-setting growth. Through September, VIX futures average daily volume rose 68% over 2011's record. Trading volume in both VIX futures and VIX options set new daily highs in September, which was also the highest volume month in VIX futures history.","The tremendous growth in our VIX complex is fueled in part by a growing number of exchange traded products tied to the VIX Index. At the end of September, there were more than 34 such products, with assets under management in excess of $4 billion and with total shares outstanding at an all-time high.","In addition to the ongoing domestic growth, we are very excited about the potential for increasing the use of our proprietary products globally. Our index products continue to provide unique utility to overseas customers. SPX enables investors to take a position in the broader U.S. equity market with a single transaction, and VIX has emerged as a proxy for worldwide equity market volatility, which, in turn, drives tremendous interest in VIX options and futures.","We expanded our international marketing efforts by leveraging our U.S. Risk Management Conference, now in its 28th year, with our first European Risk Management Conference held in Ireland this September. Risk Management Conference is strongly focused on VIX and SPX, and we were thrilled to host over 160 participants, which included some of Europe's most sophisticated options and volatility practitioners at our inaugural overseas event.","We were especially pleased to announce at Risk Management Conference, our plans to establish a London hub next year using our CFE network equipment, housed in a London data center. The hub will provide European firms with a highly efficient way to send and receive data and to execute trades on the exchange.","We also announced our plan to expand VIX futures trading to virtually 24 hours a day, 5 days a week in response to customer demand for greater access to VIX futures. We believe that around-the-clock trading in VIX futures and the CFE London hub will offer the ultimate trading flexibility to customers worldwide. Both initiatives are pending regulatory approval.","In one other new product development, we announced plans on October 1 to launch S&P 500 Variance futures at the CFE. We expect that the advantages of trading in an exchange environment, including centralized clearing and price discovery, will make our new contract very competitive with the OTC market and the S&P 500 realized variance for the S&P 500 realized variance swaps. In addition, we expect to find interest among market participants whose access to the OTC swap market is limited. We are targeting a year-end launch.","Moving on to equity options trading at CBOE. As mentioned earlier, we achieved considerable market share gains year-to-date in multiply-listed options. Though -- through September, our market share for all U.S. options trading was 29.7%, an increase of 220 basis points over the same period last year. These gains were due largely to the success of our Volume Incentive Program or VIP. We never rest on our laurels in the highly competitive and fluid equity options arena. In fact, we've seen some erosion in our year-to-date market share gains, and in response, we plan to unveil the next generation of our VIP program, VIP 2.0, in the near future.","As discussed in previous calls, we closely monitor trading on CBOE and C2 to ensure that both of our options markets are optimally deployed, given the very dynamic competitive environment. We recently received SEC approval of a rule to allow for Designated Primary Market makers or DPMs on C2. So it will come as no surprise that we intend to introduce a DPM-centric model on our all-electronic exchange.","CBOE pioneered the DPM concept, which we believe will bring additional liquidity to C2. The DPM model also provides us with a framework for new pricing and incentive plans, which we are very excited about. We had, in fact, planned to be announcing our plans for C2 this week, but so many C2 participants have been directly impacted by the East Coast storm and its aftermath that we elected instead to temporarily delay announcing our additional plans but look forward to doing so in the very near future.","I will wrap up by saying that I'm especially proud to be part of a culture at CBOE that enables us to successfully weather short-term market challenges, while never losing focus on product innovation and investor education to grow our business for the long term. Product diversity helps us manage fluctuations in volume, but we also constantly monitor how to best allocate our resources to pursue future growth opportunities even when market conditions are challenging.","We know that volume inevitably rebounds, and we are all thrilled when that happens. But we are in the business of managing, not predicting volume cycles. CBOE has been at it a long time. Whether the industry is soaring or slowing, our disciplined approach to cost management and our focus on future growth does not change. This approach has served us well and will continue to guide us going forward.","Thank you for your attention. Let me now turn it over to Alan Dean, our CFO.","Alan J. Dean","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report solid third quarter results. During last year's third quarter, we achieved the highest operating revenue and earnings for any quarter in the company's history, driven by a surge in trading volume. As we faced lower overall trading volume in the third quarter this year, we took steps to reduce expenses to enhance operating margins going forward.","This slide summarizes our third quarter results compared with last year's third quarter. Operating revenues for the quarter were $128.3 million, a decline of 11% compared with the prior year period. Operating income was $60.8 million, representing 47.4% of operating revenues. Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders was $37.7 million, decreasing 16% compared with the third quarter of 2011 and translating to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.43.","Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the third quarter of 2012 and 2011 include certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck.","Turning to the details of the quarter, starting with total operating revenues. The key metric impacting revenue for the quarter was lower trading volume, which resulted in lower transaction fees. This decrease was offset somewhat by increases in exchange services and other fees, as well as other operating revenue.","Transaction fees declined $23.2 million or 21% from last year's third quarter, driven by a 22% decrease in trading volume, offset somewhat by a 1% increase in average revenue per contract or RPC compared with last year's third quarter.  Trading volume for the quarter was down across each product category, with the exception of the futures contracts, where VIX futures continue to establish new records for contracts traded.","RPC for the third quarter increased to $0.317 compared with $0.313 in last year's third quarter. This increase resulted from higher transaction fees per contract derived from index options and futures contracts as a result of fee changes implemented earlier this year. The RPC for index options and futures contracts increased by 13% and 17%, respectively, compared with last year's third quarter.","These increases more than offset declines in multiply-listed options, equities and exchange-traded funds, resulting from our new Volume Incentive Program. RPC also increased sequentially, up 1% in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, mostly due to a shift in the mix of trading volume. Exchange services and other fees increased by $3.3 million versus last year's third quarter as a result of fee changes we implemented at the beginning of the year.","Given the year-to-date revenue derived from these fees, we are increasing our guidance to a range of $28.5 million to $30.5 million for the year from a range of $27 million to $29 million. The $3.9 million increase in other revenue was primarily due to fines assessed to trading permit holders as a result of disciplinary actions.","Continuing down the income statement. This next slide details total operating expenses of $67.5 million for the quarter, which was down $1.1 million or 2% compared with last year's third quarter, primarily due to lower volume-based expenses. Core operating expenses were $46.1 million, an increase of $3.8 million or 9% compared with the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to increases in employee costs and outside services.","The increase in employee cost was primarily due to severance charges of $2 million taken during the quarter. Outside services were up primarily due to higher legal expenses. Legal expenses can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on activity pertaining to legal proceedings. As we announced in September, we had a decisive victory in the ISE index litigation -- ISE option litigation, whereby the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously rejected ISE's request to appeal the Illinois appellate court's previous decision. In addition, we settled another outstanding litigation. While we were very pleased with these developments, we did incur higher legal expenses as a result.","We continue to closely scrutinize all expenses and in light of the uncertain market conditions, have pulled back on discretionary spending in areas such as travel, advertising and noncritical systems projects. We are maintaining our full year 2012 guidance for core expenses to be in the range of $173 million to $178 million. Previously, we had stated that we expected core expenses to be closer to the low end of our guidance range if volume had been flat to up 4%. We now expect core expenses to be closer to the midpoint of our guidance range due to the $2 million severance charge and higher-than-anticipated legal expenses.","Volume-based expenses, which include royalty fees and trading volume incentives, were $12.7 million for the quarter, which was $4.8 million or 27% lower than last year's third quarter, representing decreases of $2.7 million in royalty fees and $2.1 million in trading volume incentives. The decline in royalty fees is directly related to lower trading volume in licensed products compared with last year's record volume quarter. Trading volume incentives were down due to lower trading volume in multiply-listed options contracts and changes in the criteria for contracts that qualify for the quantity-based fee waivers.","Operating income for the third quarter was $60.8 million or 47.4% of operating revenue, down 480 basis points compared with last year's third quarter margin of 52.2%. We have taken proactive measures to reduce expenses and position the company to gain additional leverage as trading volume improves.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.4%, down significantly from last year's effective tax rate of 44.6% as a result of tax benefits recognized during the quarter. The effective rate for the current quarter includes the benefit of significant discrete items related to prior years, totaling $7.7 million or $0.09 per share.","The lower effective tax rate also reflects the impact of the recognition of other discrete items and the benefit of a new tax apportionment method enacted by Illinois. In contrast, last year's third quarter included the impact of an increase in the Illinois tax rate, effective January 1, 2011, and a charge of $4.2 million or $0.05 per share, taken to reserve for potential additional tax liabilities as a result of an advisory opinion from New York state taxing authorities.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2012 and 2011, which excludes the $7.7 million and the $4.2 million, was 37.1% and 38.9%, respectively. As you can see from this slide and the press release exhibits, we have broken out the adjustments to GAAP results. We now expect our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year 2012 to be in a range of 39.6% to 40.1% versus the previous guidance range of 41.2% to 41.7%. The most significant differences in the adjusted effective tax rate and the statutory rate are state income taxes and discrete items relating to the current period.","Turning to the balance sheet. As shown on this slide, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $160.3 million compared to $134.9 million at the end of December 2011 and $147.2 million at the end of September 2011.","Moving to cash flow. For the first 9 months of this year, cash flow provided by operating activities was $140.9 million compared to $164.3 million last year. This decrease was driven primarily by an increase in working capital usage, resulting from higher receivables, offset somewhat by higher net income.","Year-to-date capital expenditures were about $27 million, up about $3 million from last year. Through September, we spent nearly $53 million to purchase shares and return nearly $35 million to stockholders through dividends. During the third quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock. As of October 31, we had $103.3 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. A few days ago, we announced our fourth quarter dividend of $0.15 per share, reflecting an annual dividend payout of $0.54 per share for 2012, which represents a 23% increase to our 2011 dividend payments of $0.44 per share.","Capital deployment is of particular interest to investors, particularly in light of the uncertainties surrounding tax law changes. We continue to manage excess cash in line with our capital allocation strategy and look to deploy capital opportunistically through dividends and share repurchases, while also considering other investment opportunities to maximize stockholder value. We plan to continue to take a balanced and opportunistic approach to deploying capital. That means, first and foremost, we will fund the growth of our business we will look to repurchase shares to enhance our EPS growth and shareholder returns while also looking to show steady, consistent growth in our annual dividend payout.","As noted in our press release, we are reaffirming our 2012 guidance as updated on August 2, with the exception of the guidance revisions I covered already, which are also outlined on this slide for your reference. In closing, we remain confident on our long term growth prospects as we continue to focus on operating efficiently and delivering innovative products and services to our customers with the goal of creating value, both for market participants and our stockholders.","With that, I will hand the call over to Debbie so we can take your questions. Thank you very much.","Deborah Koopman","At this point, we would be happy to take questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Bill and Alan and Debbie, I guess my question is on the VIX product growth. Bill, you went through it in the presentation, just it's a franchise in itself. And I guess the 2 points I want to ask were, where do you see growth going forward? And then, it does give you more leverage, we believe, with the S&P license. Can you give -- the exclusive trading license. Can you give us any updates you might have with any discussions with S&P given your growth of the VIX?","William J. Brodsky","So wait a second. Rich, I got to get this straight. You're supposed to ask one question. Do you want go back to VIX  or do you want to go back to the S&P thing?","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, I'll just take the second one.","William J. Brodsky","I think, you're better off with the first one. Look, as we've explained in many, many other meetings, we've had this 30-year relationship with S&P. It's an excellent relationship. The contract has many years to go. When we are ready to have those conversations, there'll be time to discuss it. But the point is that we are not discussing the ongoing relationship with S&P other than to tell you that it's excellent. And you're right, the VIX situation makes our relationship with S&P even better and our negotiating situation even stronger than it ever was.","Operator","The next question is from Roger Freeman of Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just I guess coming back to the capital management. I heard your comments and saw comments within the press release sort of acknowledging potential tax changes. You didn't buy stock in the quarter. Just can you kind of clarify or -- thinking maybe a little bit more, I mean, are you considering other options like a special or something?","William J. Brodsky","So, Roger, this is Bill. So let me start off, and if I need help, Alan will join in. But our Board has been very clear that we want to return excess cash to our stockholders. And the 2 ways that we have preferred to do it is a dividend policy that is consistent and that is well within our capability to maintain and the second is to do stock buybacks. Obviously, we are cognizant of what's going on or isn't going on in Washington, and therefore, we want to remain flexible in the next quarter. But I can tell you that our strong preference is the first 2 points.","Alan J. Dean","Roger, I'll add there's still time for all decisions before year-end, and we aren't ruling anything out.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Worthington of JP Morgan.","Paul Lanks - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is actually Paul Lanks, dialing in for Ken. I wanted to follow up on the first question about VIX. Curious what volumes look like in the non-core products and how you view the growth opportunity there versus the more core products like SPX.","William J. Brodsky","I don't know how we -- what do you mean by non-core products? If you wanted to focus on VIX, we'll do that. Is that what you're talking about?","Paul Lanks - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Like the non-core volatility-oriented products.  Like SPX will be more core product and maybe something like emerging markets indices...","William J. Brodsky","Okay. The bulk of the volume is in VIX, VIX options and VIX futures. Other things are, to a greater or lesser degree, proceeding. And what we believe is that if we continue education of customers, both domestically and globally, the concept of VIX, which is really a whole new asset class, will lead to further growth. But the bulk of our business is clearly in the S&P 500 VIX options and VIX futures. Emerging markets is one of the promising areas. What we're doing is engaging on a very long-term educational process that will teach people how VIX works and then it can be applied to other asset classes, particularly non-equity classes. So it's going to be a long slog, but as far as we're concerned, well worth the effort. Alan?","Alan J. Dean","Yes. I think it might be important to add that something that we, I think, at least, suspected and knew before but was confirmed in our Risk Management Conference in Ireland, is that interest from overseas and markets that aren't -- you wouldn't think are tied to the S&P 500. They look at our VIX product as a surrogate for volatility in their markets. So I think there's a lot of growth opportunities outside of the U.S. in this S&P 500-based VIX product outside of our borders.","Operator","The next question is from Howard Chen of Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick one on guidance. First, you've all done a great job of controlling expenses in both better and worse volume backdrops. Alan, can you give a sense of the savings related to the recent announcement? And then if I can jam in a second, the exchange fee guidance assumes a fairly meaningful step-down in 4Q. Is that a function of you trying to say something on stress from the dealer community or is this timing-related? Or is this just kind of good old CBOE conservatism on your part?","Alan J. Dean","Thank you, Howard. Well, there are a lot of factors that you brought up. The guidance that we changed on core expenses, what we did is we said we didn't think it would be at the lower end of the range, given weak volume because of increased expenses that we experienced in severance cost and legal cost. And that's really just how I see it going forward. And reducing expenses, controlling expenses going forward is a battle that never ends, and we look at employee costs on a continuous basis, contract programming, promotional expenses. There's a fairly routine and rigorous process that we go through when we're experiencing stress in volumes. So we've done that certainly this summer, and we will continue to do that as long as we think that volume is weak. Does that get it Howard? I'm not sure if that gets to the heart of your question.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I think that gets it. I was just curious if there was a way to quantify the savings in the workforce reduction and the second on the exchange fees, if there's any other -- if you were trying to say anything in addition to what you put in the release on it.","William J. Brodsky","I think it's important to note that we weren't public at all on the savings that we thought we would realize through the reduction of force that we experienced in early September. What we -- you can look at it is our headcount, and it puts our headcount reduction -- after the reduction of force, we're back pretty much where we started a year ago or at the beginning of the year. And so we're experiencing some pressures, some upward pressures in headcount and other areas of the exchange. And so our reduction of force was -- holds us flat more than anything.","Operator","The next question is from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So just to touch on some of the global VIX opportunities you highlighted. You're extending trading hours for VIX futures and opening up a hub in London, and I just wanted to get your thoughts on where global volume is now as a percentage of the total VIX futures volume and where can it go over the next few years. And also, it might be helpful to size the opportunity. If you could tell us like what percent of assets under management tagged to VIX are coming from funds outside the U.S.","William J. Brodsky","Yes. So on the first issue, we see tremendous potential growth outside the U.S. going forward. Obviously that's the reason we're investing in the London hub, and we met with people from Europe at our Risk Management Conference, where, on one hand, the level of sophistication of some of them is outstanding, as good as any place in the U.S. and in others there's an increasing appetite to learn more about it, both hedge funds and more, what I'll call, traditional institutional money. The growth -- what was the second part of the question?","Unknown Executive","How much is outside the U.S.","William J. Brodsky","Well, I don't know if I can tell you that because many of the funds that exist are from international banks, and they have clients all over the world. So we just see the assets under management per fund, but I don't think we have access to that -- the derivation of the -- where the money comes from.","Edward T. Tilly","This is Ed Tilly. That's right, Bill. Similar to the options volume, we know there's volume coming from outside of the United States. We're not sure because most of the access is by members. And we're not sure where that -- the origination point is. But I think what I'd point you to is we have been extending the hours of VIX well over the last year, and we see 5% to 7% of the VIX volume coming in before the U.S. market opens. So while we can't point directly to where the volume is coming from, it's certainly -- the trend that has led us to expand and then go to 24\/5 and then actually reach as far as putting in a pop in London as you point out. So the trend is right for us in free market open VIX trading, and that's really what we're going after.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to spend a minute on the VIP 2.0 program. Maybe you can kind of talk a little bit about the timing. But more importantly, it feels like you guys have done this in the beginning of the year, your market share picked up a little bit and now it's back down to around 20%. I guess, what gives you confidence that this would work better? And as a follow-up to that, I guess, in the beginning of the year, you were able to raise prices on some of your proprietary products. So would you be able to do the same again this time around? And is there some sort of re-ceiling of how high these prices could go for you?","Alan J. Dean","Our goal in VIP 2.0 is to optimize revenue. It could mean, although not necessarily, that RPC would drop in our multi-listed products. But the goal would be that our overall revenue would increase. So I wouldn't expect that we would do anything that wouldn't increase our overall revenue. Why do we think that a revised VIP program will be effective? Well, we don't do things in a vacuum, and we are careful about what we do. And so I think when we roll something out, we've got a pretty good idea, at least directionally, and I would say even more confident on how effective something would be. So while we haven't announced the specifics on VIP 2.0 that we'll roll out at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year, we think we're confident it would be effective, that it would optimize our revenue and be good for CBOE overall. I think I forgot one part of your question. You talked about loss of market share in October. Yes, we did experience that in October, and we had a competitor who had a -- their response to VIP 2.0 was to establish a program that was similar to ours, but then, through the ownership structure of the exchange, allowed them to provide benefits to their owner, order flow provider in a way that was best for them. So I think we can establish a program, modify our current program in a competitive way going forward.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Real quick, just wanted to come back on, I guess, Roger's question on the capital side. I don't think you mentioned that. But if you look at your balance sheet right now, you have $160 million in cash, I think, at the end of the quarter. I think you're throwing off another $20 million or so before the end of the year, so that puts you at about $180 million or so at the end of the year. So just curious if you could remind us what you think -- if there was the potential of a special dividend, what you think you need to run the business, how low you could go. I mean you have very visible cash flow. And then maybe just related to that, are there any other items in the fourth quarter we should be thinking about that could reduce that potential?","Alan J. Dean","Alex, the policy, the way the board looks at our capital allocation hasn't changed. We first look to fund our business, after that, return capital to shareholders. They prefer regular sustainable dividends. And then after that, stock repurchases. There's tax situation going on now that could throw different variables onto the mix, and there's timing before any decisions have to be made. And we do have $160 million on the balance sheet. I only need, say, $40 million to $60 million, is what I've said in the past and I'm holding to that. That kind of a minimum level suits us just fine. So nothing has changed other than exogenous factors. And we'll -- with time, I think we'll make things clearer for you.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just to clarify, there's nothing else in the fourth quarter in terms of cash outflows? So in essence, you want to have something like $120 million, $140 million excess, right?","Alan J. Dean","Using your math? I can see how you got to it.","Operator","The next question is from name Niamh Alexander of KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I have -- kind of sights on the special dividend. I assume you're not interested at all to borrow for a special dividend. So I'll move on to the volatility end product, which is trading really well. Could you help me get a sense of the stabilization or so in the VIX futures complex because the rate card has been whipping all over and the volumes kind of gotten to enough of a level where it's making a nice difference to the earnings. What's a good run rate to think about for the fee there in that futures complex?","Alan J. Dean","So I'm not quite sure I followed the question exactly. But let me...","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","If I back into the RPC in the futures complex, it was like $1.35, $1.37, $1.32 towards the end of last year. This year, it was $1.70. The last couple of quarters we're kind of averaging out at $1.60, $1.61 for just the VIX futures. So I'm just trying to think has the fee changed or has it kind of stabilized? Is it more just volume mix shift now that's driving it?","Alan J. Dean","No, no. We did change fees right at the beginning of 2012.  And in a way that it -- we knew it would increase our revenue per contract. And I think we even talked about that in our first quarter earnings call. So that's what's driving the increase in the revenue per contract from last year to this year. So with that, this is the spot that we find ourselves today. We expect to go forward. It was a change in the day-trader program, and the extent at which our customers use that can vary slightly. But with the change that went into the beginning in the year, this is really the trend.","Operator","The next question is from Akhil Botia [ph] of Rosenblatt Securities.","Unknown Analyst","I just wanted to get some more color on the DPM program for C2, which participants you're targeting and where you think you might go to gain market share from.","William J. Brodsky","I'm going to ask Ed Provost, who's with us, to respond to that, please.","Edward L. Provost","Thanks for the question, Akhil, Yes, so in C2, we've evaluated the market model that we've had in place since inception, and consistent with some remarks we have made in the past, we have seen a shift away from some of the traditional maker-taker market models, which have been introduced in the business, including the maker-taker model at C2. So we are looking at and we've obviously filed and announced our shifting market model in our C2 exchange to a DPM-centric model. That aspect of the market model is similar to what we employ here at CBOE, where individual firms are appointed as DPM, which is a specialist-like function in each of the option classes. And we think that's consistent with the direction that the industry is going, more toward what we call the classic market model. Accompanying that will be some changes in our pricing model, but we're not public on that yet. So we feel very comfortable that these changes, when fully implemented, will make C2 much more successful going forward.","Unknown Analyst","And do you have any DPMs signed up yet for C2?","Edward L. Provost","So it'd be premature for me to comment on that yet. As Bill mentioned in his remarks, some of our slowdown in our introduction is tied to some of the events on the East Coast and some of the dialogue we've been having with our member firms will be involved in this program. So I'd just say stay tuned.","Operator","And the next question is from Ken Leon of S&P Capital.","Kenneth M. Leon - S&P Equity Research","[indiscernible] asked about the special dividend either. But I want to hone in on average trading volume is down sequentially year-over-year, no surprise. But we haven't really focused on whether there's a burning regulatory issue, either from members or the CFTC, that's already having an immediate impact on trading and not just a global macro risk.","William J. Brodsky","So are you asking if there's a CFTC-based regulatory issue that...","Kenneth M. Leon - S&P Equity Research","Whether there's members and their customers adjusting already from the Volcker Rule or whether there's pronouncements underway or still in discussion with the CFTC that is having a direct bearing on trading volumes.","William J. Brodsky","I think -- this is Bill Brodsky. My sense is that, there's clearly some impact of the Volcker Rule. We saw Goldman Sachs get rid of their proprietary trading operation, but then what happens is the people leave the firm, they set up their own shops. I think it is having less of an impact on our VIX product line than anything else because the VIX product line is so unique that we see new participants, I can tell you we've seen this even as recently as this week, firms that are very established in the business for years, are showing interest in VIX that they didn't show a year ago. So even if there may be some slippage because of the overhang of Dodd-Frank and the specter of Volcker coming in, the business constantly reinvents itself, and I believe that the VIX product line is something that has an enduring effect regardless of what I'll call the changes going on in the broader industry.","Edward L. Provost","And I think, Bill, that's perhaps the dampening effect that we might see today. I think the opportunity, is what we keep pointing at and aligning ourselves and being ready for is the rule-making around may and must move OTC trading to a [indiscernible] or exchange market. While there's still uncertainty there, all we have done and we'll continue to do is prepare ourselves for any outcome that pushes OTC volume to our markets. And we're seeing some of that early traction, but look forward to more clarity as rules are made and finalized.","Operator","The next question is from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies & Company.","Surinder Thind - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Surinder Thind calling in for Dan Fannon. I just wanted to touch base on the tax rate. I mean there was a number factors that affected it this quarter, and we're basically back to the lows we kind of saw in 2009 and 2010. So I was hoping you can help me understand perhaps the sustainability of the tax rate going into next year.","Alan J. Dean","Well, I haven't really commented about the tax rate for next year, although from what we're looking at right now, I don't know of any changes that would impact the range, the guidance that we're giving you for 2012. But as we roll into the next year, we'll revisit that issue again and give you more specific guidance when we talk about fourth quarter earnings in early February.","Surinder Thind - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just very quickly. I may have missed this, but is there kind of a minimum level of cash that you guys are comfortable holding?","Alan J. Dean","Yes, $40 million to $60 million. I've been consistent in saying that. That minimum level of cash is fine by us. We have a system where that minimum level is more than adequate.","Operator","The next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A question on dividend trades. I believe you guys came out and said that you're going to discontinue accepting dividend trades, and I want to say that another firm did. And Philly has basically come out and said they still think that their acceptable trade types and they want to keep offering them. Do you think there's going to be some sort of industry-wide movement to ban those? Or it is just going to be a function of as long as one competitor is willing to offer them, they'll still be out there?","Edward L. Provost","Patrick, Ed Provost. I think your last statement is probably the case, if you've got one exchange that seems to be the destination for those dividend trades continues to offer that fee cap, they'll probably continue. We, CBOE, have never been a destination for those trades. Our marketplace is much too liquid, and it's just impossible to get those kinds of trades up. As to an industry-wide initiative, that would have to be driven by the SEC. The exchanges all compete with each other. We can't talk to each other about our intentions with respect to fees, but we've never been proponents of dividend trades. And while never having had them done at our exchange to any great extent, it was in our fee schedule, and we chose to follow the lead, if you will, and eliminate that from our fee schedule. But the impact on us will not be significant because we never got them. If they were to be eliminated industry-wide as a result of someone else's action, our market share would actually go up because it actually reflects negatively on our market share.","Operator","The next question is from Gaston Ceron of Morningstar Equity research.","Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just had a very quick question on CFE, which we've just seen some nice growth here recently. Just wondering, Bill, I think you talked in your presentation a little bit about how you're going to rollout this S&P Variance Futures product there at some point. Can you talk a little bit further beyond that kind of a little more medium to long term? I mean what kind of other products might we see on CFE kind of going forward and what's kind of the longer-term plan for continuing to drive growth on that market?","William J. Brodsky","Well, the longer-term plan is to do 2 things: one is to keep growing the core product, which is the VIX futures, which as we said earlier, has really become the proxy for global equity market volatility; and the other is to keep innovating and working with the community. The variance strips interestingly are really part of the Dodd-Frank issue, and that is there are -- there is a market out there that's OTC now that some people can participate and others don't really have access to it. And these are sophisticated products for very unique niche of the marketplace. We're working with the user community. We're working with DRW, which is a great firm here in Chicago. So these things are really part of the long-term strategy. These are sophisticated products. They take a lot of preparation to get them up and going, and then you need a lot of continuing education. So we have a whole variety of things. We have volatility on individual stocks, we have emerging market index, we have volatility on different commodity-related products. It's a whole host of things, and we have a new -- recently new head of our futures exchange that came out of the futures community, and he's literally got a global mandate to just promote that exchange.","Operator","The next question is from Faye Elliott of GBG (sic) [BGB] Securities.","Faye Elliott-Gurney - BGB Securities, Inc., Research Division","Could you go over just a little bit more on the London hub and what the benefit would be? It seems that a lot of your users can use your services through the current setup. And I'm curious what the benefit to the top line will be from opening a hub in London and also, if that could affect the tax rate.","William J. Brodsky","I'll respond to the first part, I'll ask Alan to respond to the taxes. We did a lot of discussions with customers in terms of how they want to use VIX. There's little doubt that if you're going to go out of this time zone that the logical place is London. The idea is to be closer to the electronic hub, which London provides. So our feeling was that if we're going to trade after hours, certainly from what we're seeing today and what we know of the marketplace, you want to be in London and that will facilitate better business than if we just try to do it through Chicago during the middle of our night. So I think it all fits together. And Alan can discuss the tax rate.","Alan J. Dean","Faye, on the tax rate, right now, the way we're seeing it is no material change to our tax rate because of this London pop, this London hub. But it's still under evaluation. This hub won't become operative until next year, and so there's a few more things we need to investigate. But my look right now is no material change.","Operator","The next question is from Ed Ditmire of Macquarie.","Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research","I have a question. As you contemplate the next step in the SPXpm or C2 in terms of building liquidity there, I have a question. If the -- beyond the current plans for new kind of incentives and market structure, would there ever be a time when you contemplated that electronification of the SPX could go beyond the pm contract and the attention turned back to the main SPX contracts, i.e. would it ever be possible that you would contemplate introducing side by side electronic and open outcry trading in a fungible contract? Or will all attempts be limited to getting the SPXpm contract running?","Alan J. Dean","Yes, it's a great question. The way we look at SPX and SPXpm is it there's -- this is a complex of products, and we are agnostic in terms of where the growth comes from. And quite frankly, the growth in the last 12 months has come from the Weeklys, which we started off, as I said in my comments, as a pit-traded product and then we migrated that to the Hybrid. And then we brought out SPXpm on C2. We're constantly evaluating the whole situation. But I want to stress something that we've talked about in the past, and that is our SPX product, the core product, is a unique product in our industry because it's so institutional, it trades differently than a lot of other products. So anything we do in that area, number one, we keep our eye on the ball as we want to grow the whole pie. But second, we're not going to just do things just in a kind of reactive way because it sounds good. We have to be very careful that the SPX product is the preferred and the most liquid option contract in the world and used by institutions. And we just don't want to mess with it just because it sounds good to say, \"Well, let's just make it electronic.\"","Edward Ditmire - Macquarie Research","Got you. So it sound like even if there was no further progress with the SPXpm taking -- growing its share that it will be incredibly unlikely that you would introduce electronic trading of the main SPX contract.","Alan J. Dean","I don't want to go that far. I just want to say that we're going to be very thoughtful about it because we -- the most important thing here is talking to your users. There are a lot of S&P 500 products out there. We have something that has the largest dollar value and open interest. And this is a jewel that we just don't want to just -- so it's not that it might never ever happen, it's more that we're just not going to do something because it has some intellectual appeal.","Operator","The next question is from Akhil Botia [ph] of Rosenblatt Securities.","Unknown Analyst","It's Akhil Botia [ph] again. Just a follow-up, what's the sustainability of these other fees? You said there will be sort of fines and what-not. And then just on professional fees, with the lawsuits resolved, will expenses step down in the future?","Alan J. Dean","The sustainability of the other -- I think you were referring to the exchange services and other fees line item that's up this year, is that what you're referring to?","Unknown Analyst","No, the other piece that was $6.2 million in the quarter that were due to the the [indiscernible]","Alan J. Dean","So other revenue, the other revenue line item.","Unknown Analyst","Yes.","Alan J. Dean","Okay. Well, that was -- the increase in that line item is due to a disciplinary fine, so it's regulatory in nature. Those fines are inherently lumpy. So no, I would not take that $6.2 million number and annualize that. I would take a longer-term view of that revenue line item and look at it in that way.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then on the legal expenses?","Alan J. Dean","Well, legal expenses, as I said in my prepared remarks, are unpredictable many times and very dependent upon the litigation that we're going through at the time. So we're able to successfully and conclude 1 litigation in the quarter, and so that should help. But I want to drive down legal cost as much as I can, but we're not going to shortchange ourselves and do something that endangers the company. So I can't be specific on legal fees. But our goal is to hold overall core expenses at the rate of inflation, and we'll be more specific on that in conjunction with our fourth quarter earnings call early next year.","Operator","The next question is from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up. On the investment or the London hub, is the expenses already in the run rate? And if it's not, is that -- I can't see how it'd be that much, but could it impact the cash, this $40 million to $50 million of what you need cash on hand?","Alan J. Dean","No, Rich. The costs really aren't reflected in our results either for the quarter or year-to-date. And looking at the expenses going forward, they're not material. You won't even notice it.","Operator","The next question is from Niamh Alexander of KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","High frequency trading, getting a lot of price again. But there's no specific proposal out there from the regulators, but my understanding is that it's a very small part of your business. Can you just refresh me if maybe is it mostly kind of more focused on C2? Or how should we think about your business there, just in case we do see some new rules come down the pipe or something like that?","Edward T. Tilly","Sure, let me start. This is Ed Tilly. You're right. This is not a big part of our business. The high frequency trading, there's many different forms. We think our -- we benefit from those that are resting orders in our marketplace that will be considered high frequency. We don't think that the -- anything that's contemplated or the traffic, if you will, that we're reading is really directed at those high frequency traders that are adding liquidity in a meaningful way. Rather, the high frequency trading that has picked up some negative price, you're right, we don't find CBOE's matching algorithms. The traditional model here at CBOE very friendly to those type traders in that we continue to reward those that are dedicating liquidity from the open to the close. So really, not in -- going to be negatively impacted if there's a ban or registration requirement. We think we'll continue to get those that are adding liquidity in a meaningful way and those that are on the -- receiving more negative comments as HFT really not going to affect CBOE in the future.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And if I could, you have an ongoing dialogue with the regulators on a lot of different issues, and this is getting a lot of attention in the press. Some of the exchanges have other kind of equity securities  exchanges have expanded on, maybe how much of their revenue it is. And sort of defining as it were, are you kind of in -- is the exchange community in an active discussion with the SEC right now about kind of imposing rules at the exchange level or the regulators kind of crafting new legislation or curbs for that group right now that you're aware of?","William J. Brodsky","Well, as you know the SEC had a public hearing in the last 10 days or so on the issue. I think that this is just an early fact-finding situation. They didn't even have a big option component. It's really focused on the equity markets in the U.S. But on any market structure issue that we believe will have an effect on the option business, we will be active participants, whether it's the SEC, whether it's Congress or even internationally.","Operator","And the next question is from Faye Elliott of GBG (sic) [BGB] Securities.","Faye Elliott-Gurney - BGB Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just back to the the VIP version 2. The first VIP structuring was obviously largely unsuccessful and an additive to you. Do you think that the, I guess, competitor response that resulted in October's lower share that you can come up with yet another pricing structure that fits the additive and really protective of your fees? Or do you think that it will be -- might actually have to dig into the top line a little bit more?","Alan J. Dean","Faye, that question, I think, was asked before, so I may be redundant. I think we can come up with a change or modification to VIP that will be effective, that will increase our market share, respond -- be competitive and successfully respond to our competitor who did something during the quarter that caused us to lose market share. And I think what we will do will be to optimize our revenue, increase our overall revenue. And that's our goal, our primary goal, and that's what we intend to do, and so what I think we will do.","Operator","There are no further question in the queue at this time.","Deborah Koopman","That completes our call this morning.

Ms. Koopman, please go ahead.","Debbie Koopman","Thank you. Good morning. Thank You for joining us for our first quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Then, Brian Schell, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will provide an overview of our first quarter 2018 financial results and guidance for certain financial metrics. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A will be our President and COO, Chris Concannon; and our Chief Strategy Officer, John Deters.","In addition, I'd like to point out that this presentation will include the use of several slides.

Also note that references made to the planned migration of C2 Option Exchange and the Cboe options exchange are subject to regulatory review.","During the course of the call this morning, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. We will also refer to non-GAAP adjusted combined results, which are also reconciled in our earnings materials. As you know, we completed our acquisition of Bats Global Markets on February 28, 2017. The combined results present information regarding the combined operations, as if the Bats acquisition had closed at the beginning of 2017, in order to provide a supplemental discussion of our results and review of our business.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Tilly.","Ed Tilly","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that first quarter 2018 was our best quarter ever, and that we raised our expected run rate expense synergy target to $85 million at the end of 2020, up $20 million, and a year ahead of our initial projections. Brian will discuss that more in detail later.","Cboe Global Markets reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 on net revenue of $329 million led by double-digit year-over-year gains across each of our business lines and new trading highs in our proprietary products. Our record results underscore the utility of our products and the strengths of our diversified portfolio of exchanges, particularly in times of heightened market volatility, which we saw during the first quarter.","As we shared in previous calls, we expected that the ongoing growth we saw in VIX and SPX Options and VIX Futures during sustained periods of low volatility, which spiked when volatility returned to the market. This expectation played out in the first quarter in the form of new quarterly volume records in VIX Futures and options and SPX Options, as well as a lift to our equities and FX businesses.","Following the sustained period of record low volatility in 2017 in which the VIX Index averaged just over 11 compared to its long-term average of 19, investor perceptions of risk changed dramatically in Q1 marked by large spikes in both implied and realized volatility. The new normal appears to be a VIX level ranging between 15 and 25, which is more in line with historical levels that we saw throughout 2017.","Historically, transitions from low to high volatility regimes result in traders reassessing the products they use, and shifting to products that are best suited to a new market environment. We believe that small differences between front month and longer dated VIX futures that is a flat VIX term structure is signaling that the market is still adjusting to the new volatility regime.","We view shifts in product usage as normal during these transition periods, and we believe we are seeing the shift play out within our proprietary index complex. While higher volatility is generally good for all of our businesses, the flat VIX term structure has been a headwind for VIX trades that seek to capture price differences across the VIX Futures curve.","At the same time, large daily moves in the S&P 500 have created new opportunities for VIX option users who can capitalize on daily trading ranges that are three times greater than in Q4 2017. As such, average daily volume in SPX Options, in April, was up 20% year-over-year compared to April 2017, and largely offset declines in VIX Futures and options volume relative to last year's solid April trading.","Furthermore, SPX average daily volume in April was 15% above SPX Options activity for the full year 2017. Since early February, the VIX Futures term structure has been flat or downward sloping 55 of 61 days, an unusually long period not seen since 2011. However, we expect that VIX Futures prices will eventually return to a more familiar upward sloping pattern, as it has done in the past, regardless of where the market sets the new floor for equity volatility.","Let me be clear, volatility is alive and well, and we are confident that our SPX Index products offer the trading tools to manage risk in any market environment. Regardless of market conditions, we remain intensely focused on our commitments to product innovation, leading edge technology, and seamless trading solutions.","I'll take a few moments here to provide an update and key strategic initiatives supporting those commitments. Our legacy of driving growth through product innovation was highlighted throughout the month of April, which we proclaimed VIX Month in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the dissemination of the VIX. The month featured a daily VIX social media campaign, the launch of a new VIX Web site, and a VIX symposium held for press and customers. Perhaps most fitting, we also announced a new VIX product. On April 17th, we launched the dissemination of the Cboe One-Year Volatility Index which provides up-to-the-minute market estimates of one-year volatility.","The one-year index was designed to monitor the market's expectation for longer-term volatility which we expect will be especially useful for investors with longer duration liabilities such as insurance companies and pension funds. We are exploring the development of a futures contract on the index subject to regulatory view, and look forward to reporting on that going forward.","Turning now to the migration of Cboe exchanges onto Bats proprietary technology, which we believe will maximize our value proposition for customers and shareholders and power our company's growth going forward. We completed a major milestone in the integration with a flawless migration of Cboe Futures Exchange to the Bats technology as scheduled on February 25. The migration provides our futures customers with a more efficient and user-friendly trading experience that includes greater bandwidth, significant latency reduction, and enhanced risk controls and improved complex order handling.","We remain laser-focused on executing a seamless technical and operational integration for all of our exchange platforms. We are well on track for a planned C2 options exchange migration on May 14, 2018. And as announced last month, we have targeted October 7, 2019, for the migration of Cboe Options Exchange. We are modifying Bats technology to incorporate both electronic and open outcry trading for Cboe Options Exchange, which includes SPX and VIX Options Trading. We targeted two technology enchantments for 2018 in advance of migrating Cboe Options Exchange. The immigration of S&P 500 index options to hybrid trading, which we successfully completed last week, and the introduction of new trading floor terminals, which we plan to begin rolling out on November 5, 2018, subject to regulatory review. We are encouraged by the initial response to SPX and hybrid and are very pleased with the conversion itself is flawless.","The completion of the CFE migration and significant steps taken to prepare for the C2 and Cboe options migrations leave us well-positioned to achieve our ultimate goal of providing our customers with a unified world-class experience on Bats leading-edge across all of our equities, options, and futures markets. As noted in our last call, our preparations ahead of MiFID II, which came into affect on January 3rd, have enabled us grow our European business in the midst of a changing regulatory landscape. The rapid adoption of our periodic options book this quarter, which is a MiFID II compliant lit order book operating auctions throughout the day, demonstrates that market participants are finding value in executing their trades in a venue designed to provide minimum market impact.","Our Large in Scale block trading platform also continues attracting customers and increase volume with average trade sizes in excess of a million euro. Additionally, we have continued to grow our Systematic Internaliser technology services business further diversifying our European business model. While the liquidity landscape will continue to evolve under MiFID II, we believe our seamless rollout of new technology and services ahead of the new regulation leave us well-positioned to continue to adapt and grow.","In closing, I would like to thank our team for truly tremendous quarter. While the return of volatility to the marketplace provided great headwinds, the collective work of our team helped position each of our exchanges to benefit with double-digit volume increases. Further, throughout what proved to be our company's busiest quarter on record, we continue to lay the groundwork for future growth by rolling out new products and services while advancing our technology integration. As a result, I look forward to all that we can accomplish to power the potential of our customers and shareholders in the months and years ahead.","With that, I will now turn it over to Brian.","Brian Schell","Thanks, Ed, and good morning everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that unless specifically noted my comments relate to 1Q '18 as compared to 1Q '17 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted combined results including Bats. Building on 2017 positive momentum as Ed already noted, we reported record financial results for the quarter. In summary, our net revenue grew 24% with net transaction fees up 36%, non-transaction revenue up 7%, and organic net revenue growth of 28% for the quarter.","Adjusted operating expenses increased 3%, which combined with our strong revenue growth, produced 560 basis point lift and our adjusted EBITDA margin of 70.4% demonstrating a strong operating leverage. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 47% to $1.38. The press release we issued this morning and our slide deck provide the key operating metrics on volume and revenue capture for each of our segments as well as an overview of key revenue variances.","Additional disclosures can also be found in our Form 10-Q filed this morning. At this point, I would like to briefly highlight some of the key drivers influencing our performance in each segment. In our options segment, the 24% net revenue growth was primarily driven by a higher net transaction fees reflecting the record volumes previously noted.","Turning to futures, the 47% increase in net revenue resulted from a 44% increase in average daily volume, offset by a 5% decline in revenue per contract, with the latter reflecting higher rebates related to elevated VIX futures trading volume.","We continue to be excited about the opportunities we believe the CFE technology migration will have for our futures business and particularly allowing us to bring new products to market at a faster pace and more efficiently. Overall, the long-term growth of our proprietary products remains our primary focus, and we have a robust pipeline of new products, we are excited about launching.","Turning to U.S. equities, net revenue grew 10% with equities volume benefiting from the return of volatility to the market shifting more trading to on-exchange venues versus off-exchange. As this slide show, total market data revenue for U.S. equities is up 16% in the first quarter with SIP market data revenue up 14% and proprietary market data up 24%. The significant portion of the $3.7 million increase in SIP revenue was due to order recoveries. So the first quarter is not representative of our expectations for future quarters this year as we continue to expect downward pressure on SIP market due to industry consolidations.","Looking to growth in our proprietary market data revenue, majority came from pricing changes implemented at the beginning of the year. We expect continued growth in proprietary market data in 2018 as we benefit from pricing changes and customer response to our Cboe-1 product.","Net revenue for European equities grew 37% on a U.S. dollar basis, reflecting growth in both net transaction and non-transaction revenues following the implementation of MiFID II in January, as well as strength of the pound sterling versus the U.S. dollar. On a local currency basis, net revenue increased very healthy 18%. While we benefited from increased market volumes, realized increased revenue from higher net capture due to the later-than-planned implementation of the dark pool volume caps. We expect net capture to moderate back to historic levels through the remainder of the year.","Net revenue for global FX grew 35% this quarter, setting new highs in both market share and average daily notion of value traded on our platform. Volumes improved on both our New York and London Matching Engines, with the latter more than tripling its volumes year-over-year. Macro environmental factors have certainly contributed the overall growth in the spot effects market, but we believe our market share growth reflects the impact of technology enhancements, as well as more effective liquidity provisioning.","Turning to expenses, total adjusted operating expenses were nearly $110 million for the quarter up 3% compared with last year's first quarter. The key expense variance was in compensation and benefits resulting from one higher incentive based compensation, driven by and aligned with our financial and operational performance and to accelerate stock based compensation recognized in the first quarter up about $4 million and $2.5 million respectively.","As we pointed out in our last earnings call, there are several incremental expenses impacting our year-over-year comparability such as expenses associated with the Silexx acquisition, the increase strength of the pound sterling, and the gross up of offer-related expenses. Additionally, during the first quarter, we raised our capitalization threshold which resulted in incremental expense. In total, these items accounted for about $2.9 million in incremental expenses in the quarter with the currency impact being the largest. If you just put those items, expenses would have the up less than 1.5 of 1%.","We are reconfirming our full-year expense guidance to be in the range of $420 million to $428 million. We expect compensation and benefits to be lower in subsequent quarters, reflecting the expected realization of expense synergies as well as smoothing out the impact from the accelerated investing, which is typically related to the first quarter when new grants are issued.","For the first quarter, we realized $3 million in pre-tax synergies, primarily from compensation and benefits. As Ed mentioned, we established our technology migration date for C1, our final and most significant migration to Bats technology. With that, key date now established, we raised our expected annualized run rate expense synergy target to $85 million from $65 million. Furthermore, we now expect to reach this run rate in 2020, a year earlier than our initial projections. We still expect to exit 2018 with approximately $50 million in annual run rate expense synergies, and now expect to reach $80 million at the end of 2019.","Turning to income taxes, our effected tax rate on adjusted earnings from the quarter was approximately 26%, somewhat below our annual guidance range of 26.5% to 28.5% due to the settlement of uncertain tax positions during the quarter. The effective tax rate on combined adjusted earnings in the first quarter of 2017 was 28.1%.","The decline primarily reflects the favorable impact of corporate tax reform. We are reaffirming that we expect the annual effective tax rate on adjusted earnings to be in the range of 26.5% to 28.5% for 2018 with the tax rate for the second quarter expected to be slightly above the high end of the guidance range and the tax rate for the third and fourth quarters to be at the higher end but within our guidance range.","In addition, we are lowering our guidance for capital expenditures to be $45 million to $50 million versus our previous guidance of $50 million to $55 million. The decrease reflects more efficient spending and the adjustment of our capitalization threshold.","Moving to capital allocation, we are maintaining our unwavering focus on effective capital deployment to drive shareholder value by prioritizing the investment and our business to support our growth strategies. And then returning excess free cash flow to shareholders via a combination of dividends and share repurchases while continuing to de-lever to maintain a strong balance sheet and longer term financial flexibility.","Our quarterly results, once again generates strong cash flows, which enabled us to pay out dividends of $31 million, use $44 million to repurchase shares and reduce our debt by an additional $25 million. Year-to-date through April 30th, we have repurchased approximately 451,000 shares of Cboe common stock for about $51 million or about $112 per share.","We ended the quarter with adjusted cash and investments of $166 million and a leverage ratio of 1.6x. The adjusted cash balance was higher than normal due to a number of significant tax related liabilities due in April.","In summary, Cboe delivered outstanding quarterly results and continue to demonstrate our focus on and the strength of our proprietary index products reflecting industry leading organic growth, strong growth in a diverse set of revenue streams, disciplined expense management, leveraging the scale of our business producing higher profit margins and integration plans on track with our higher run rate expense synergy target expected to be achieved a year earlier and ongoing focus on capital allocation by reducing debt while continuing to return capital to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.","With that, I'll turn it over to Debbie for instructions on the Q&A of the call.","Debbie Koopman","Thanks, Brian. At this point we would be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue. And if time permits we'll take a second question. Keith?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from the line of Richard Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Repetto","Yes, good morning, Ed, Chris, and Brian.","Ed Tilly","Good morning, Rich.","Richard Repetto","So I guess, Ed, you talked about the topic of my question today, and you've talked about this in the past that traders can express their views on volatility in a number of products whether it be just VIX Options, VIX Futures or SPX, so -- and SPX has been strong. When you adjust for the RPCs or what we think the RPCs are even if you ran out April for the rest of the year, VIX coming up you'd still be 9%-10% up in revenue in these products. So I guess, the question is can you get more into why people choose SPX in an environment right now, and then how long -- it sounds like, at least to me, you have some time for the VIX complex to convert to the new volatility sort of regime, and could you sort of give us some color on where we are on that? And whether this analysis is the way you think about it as well, like the bundle revenue perspective is what I'm calling it?","Ed Tilly","Well, Rich, I think you've nailed it from our perspective, and I appreciate the way you framed that, because it's the way the entire organization looks at the index complex. So I'll borrow on a few of the words that were in the prepared statement. But really, if you look past the incredible records of the first quarter and look at April, you're right on the way we view the complex in the shift in products -- product and its utility. So, if we figure last year we averaged 2.2 million to 2.3 million contracts in that complex, that's where April is.","The difference is really to your point in the shift. So what causes that? VIX products and their utility are great hedging tools early in the change of perceived risk. The vol spikes, so think January where the market peaks, two weeks later the market is down 10%. That is an incredibly powerful vehicle using VIX products to hedge in that case. The market then heats up, and that's the market that we're in today vol service is flat, which means we still think we're in transition. The market hasn't said what it perceives risk over time yet. That's that flat volatility surface.","Well, what suffers? VIX Futures. It's hard to express a difference or said differently, it's hard to capture the difference in the price of future risk versus today's risk because the market has said, \"We don't see a big difference now.\" That's very, very unusual, but what's happened in the meantime, yesterday, no better example of how traders have shifted in the S&P 500 complex. From the prepared remarks you'll recall we said the S&P 500, those intraday moves, 3x greater than we saw in the fourth quarter 2017. So, by using the S&P 500 as your hedging vehicle, those intraday moves like yesterday allow you to take advantage of a move that's really unusual if you look out over time and monetize the hedges that you're putting on by using the S&P 500 instead of VIX Futures.","Now, that scenario of flat volatility doesn't last long historically. It's unusual in this instance, but we believe history is what we look back to and we'll go to a normal upward sloping curve in vol, which then reignites the volatility strategies that allow you to trade up and down the volatility surface. The punch line is that we have a product that serves our users in any market environment if you can interchangeably understand the utility of VIX futures, VIX options and the SPX complex.","That's the way we see it.","Richard Repetto","That's great. Thanks. That's a good answer, and I know Chris agrees 100% with that too.","Ed Tilly","Correct.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. So just on the Bloomberg reports, this keeps popping up, SEC and CFTC have opened investigations on VIX. I know you guys have reportedly said that there's no evidence of any manipulation. But again, it keeps coming up. So my question is how easy would it be for Cboe to address the allegations by making changes to product structure either on settlement or the expiration process if needed? And how do you think any changes you make how would that likely impact activity levels if you could speculate? Thanks.","Ed Tilly","Sure. Well, we'll leave manipulation to the prepared comments that we made in the past. We are sure and certain that both our regulatory department, the first line of defense here on any market activity, and then ultimately, obviously, in cooperation with the regulators, that is a pass and that is -- precedes, I think, each and every day. And it's not just in the VIX complex, it's in everything that we trade across all of our exchanges. So if we put that aside and address specifically, I think, what you're asking our question is and recognize that each and every day, VIX trades throughout the day almost 24 hours a day, VIX futures and that there is this moment in time that we're always and constantly looking at how do we make better this settlement moment.","If we could focus on that, I think it's exactly what Chris would like to tee up for you this morning. But again, I want to stress, let's concentrate on that settlement. The intraday trade and the measure of volatility and the perceived risk in the market, this measure is working beautifully throughout the day and almost around the clock. So let's focus if you like right at the moment of time of settlement.","Chris Concannon","Yes, thanks, Ed, and Kenny, great question with regard to the VIX settlement auction. Obviously, this is a moment in time auction. It's not much different than the auctions we run every day in equities at the open and at the close. And I've spent my career around auctions, so as I look at this auction, there are things that we can attack in this VIX settlement auction. And we have a variety of approaches that we're using all with the sole goal of enhancing liquidity in the auction.","As I think about it, it's really three areas of attack. First, we're enhancing the technology that we use for the auction. We're improving the distribution of the imbalance messages. Those are the messages that send out the imbalances that are formed in the auction. And then we're taking steps -- active steps to increase liquidity in the auction. Returning back to how we are enhancing the technology, just this week as you know, we rolled the hybrid platform for SPX. Now this platform allows market makers to have a more enhanced interaction with SPX all day long, but more importantly around the auction moment in time.","We also plan to increase the speed of the opening process during the auction itself. With regard to the distribution of imbalance messages, as you think about it in the most recent auction we had, we had a large order imbalance. Now it is our job to market those imbalances to the market -- to the widest distribution that we can possibly do -- do that distribution. And those -- what we did see on that day was those imbalances message were being read and received and orders were filing in most of that large order imbalance but not all of it.","So it's not the trader that submitted the order. It's not his job to market the imbalance. It's our job as a market. So, some of the steps we are taking to improve that. We plan to enhance the imbalance speed by increasing the speed of its dissemination. We are actively pursuing ways to improve the distribution of our imbalance information. We plan on making available to a wider audience through a variety of means.","Now turning to liquidity, that's the most critical part of this. We are actively talking to our current market makers and new market makers to join not only the VIX complex but the auction itself. We have been fielding inbound calls from our market makers and our end users that want to participate in those imbalance orders because those are money making opportunities for all market participants to offset. So, we have a three-prong attack that we are taking in the auction. These are short term and long term plan. We ultimately will be rewriting the auction when we migrate to the Bats technology, when we migrate the C1 platform in 2019. Hopefully, that answers your question, Kenny?","Ken Worthington","Yes. It sounds like I caught you completely off guard by the question. Thank you so much for the response.","Ed Tilly","Yes, I have not answered the question on the VIX settlement auction, but I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sameer Murukutla","Hey, good morning guys. This is Sameer Murukutla on for Michael Carrier. Thanks for taking my question. Another related with the VIX. I know you -- thanks for providing the CFE user detail on the slide. I guess can you just give us more detail on what type of users are driving this growth? And maybe if the mix of users in changing how this effects RPC going forward? And I guess I know you provided the 1Q number, but can you give us anymore detail on the growth in users I guess after the meltdown of some of the fix strategies let's say from beginning of February to now?","Chris Concannon","Sure. Well, most importantly on February 25, so post February 5, we migrated the futures platform for CFE. And that was a -- what I call, \"Wildly successful migration,\" not only because it was perfectly executed but it enhanced the liquidity pool of our platform. And since that migration, we have been monitoring closely our user traffic, both in terms of the number of market participants and market makers joining the platform post migration as well as the as you mentioned the user account level.","We are now -- we've grown since migration to somewhere just over 6000 active user accounts at the customer level. The majority of that growth ironically is in active and VIX contracts. While we have a very successful launch of Bitcoin future, we have seen some growth in the Bitcoin -- active accounts in Bitcoin, but the majority of the growth since the migration has been in VIX user account. So, we are pretty excited about that.","More importantly, the performance of that platform since the migration, we have seen our displayed liquidity has obviously increased during both regular and overnight trading hours. That's important when you think about Asia trading in the VIX complex. It has actually doubled since the migration. That's an impressive stat. The spread has narrowed to our fix spread in -- in VIX in particular the spread has narrowed down to the actual nickel increment that we have minimum spreads on. So, really in some wildly successful migration, we are very positive about the active user accounts since that migration on February 25. And we like the performance of our market makers since that migration.","Ed Tilly","Yes, I think the other potential is the amount of new eyeballs on a one-year VIX contract in the current index form. It will be interesting as we work through what it takes to make that a tradable contract in the future. What interest we will see as a result for a new user base who is more interested in longer dated vol. So, in the preparatory remarks we pulled out insurance companies and pension funds. So, I think there is -- I would think there is more to come that short dated vol exposure is not as interesting to that group as longer dated vol is. So, I think there's -- I am hopeful that there is more interest as more eyes are looking at that one-year vol number.","Sameer Murukutla","Thanks for that. Love the details guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Ed Tilly","Good morning.","Brian Bedell","And thanks for -- yes, same thing. Thanks a lot Chris for that detailed auction answer. The -- maybe just another one on VIX, with the [indiscernible] being flat, I mean we still have a pretty decent base of underlying VIX futures issues. April was about 255. So maybe either Ed or Chris, can you characterize what people are doing now with the futures despite the curve being flat? And then, Chris you mentioned the 6000 new user accounts given the new -- given switchover on the C2. So -- I am sorry CFE. How should we think about that in potentially developing the percentage increase in VIX futures attributable to the new functionality on the platform?","Ed Tilly","So first the trade that we said is, is really facing the greatest amount of headwinds is capturing the difference over time in the vol surface. So you've nailed it. So if we are used to in 2017 looking at vol over time starting at 10 or 11 in the front month and moving up to 18 six or nine months out. That's a huge spread and that was a very very big trade. But to your point, a day like yesterday, we traded over 300,000 VIX futures contracts that day trader is still very very active.","There is still movement around in that front month of vol. If you look at move yesterday when you move 35 points in S&P500, there are still a great number of trading opportunities. And we see those day traders still in the market. I talked to one of most active traders a couple of days ago and I said, what are you doing differently? He said, well, I am learning some different strategies that I couldn't employ last year with a steep curve and I am trading differently today. And market is still in adjustment mode or flat.","We don't expect that to proceed for a long period time, it just will not last. We expect more historical shape to the curves. We think those strategies will come back. What is also relatively inexpensive is maintaining a constant position in volatility when the surface is flat. It was expensive in 2017 to maintain a constant exposure with VIX futures because of the roll down cost. You would be replacing front month 11 vol for example with a couple months out at 14 or 15 vol. That's an expensive roll down cost.","Today, you are replacing 17 vol contracts with a 17.2 vol contracts, so relatively inexpensive to maintain constant exposure of volatility. So just again it's the utilization. It's different use case. All good, we think with more users coming back when the surface changes -- back to Chris' point and he'll pick up on those new users, there is more users ready when we get to a normal stay.","Chris Concannon","Thanks, Ed. And with respect to users let's be clear, we grew our user base since the migration. That's something we were looking for and we are excited about over 6000. We didn't grow by 6000. I just want to make sure we are clear. But what that base gives us and you really can't convert users to a formula of new contracts. It's actually it's very positive post-migration. It's a very positive statistic. But, I look at yesterday where we traded over 300,000 VIX contracts in our complex. What those users really reflect we are primed for the environment that Ed is talking about when the curve started to shift, so having those user base is there, those users create the 300,000 day trade in the complex. So can't drill the formula from the number of users, anyone user can be a dramatic user of VIX and we've seen some accounts have exceptional volume in the VIX complex. So it's hard to draw any formulas from new users to total volume.","Brian Bedell","Great, that makes sense. What was the user base before the conversion?","Debbie Koopman","There is a chart.","Chris Concannon","Yes, we have a chart in that.","John Deters","Yes, we're up about, this is John, we're up about 11% quarter-on-quarter, and you should be mindful what this chart is saying. Prior to that, we had a growth rate of 25% over a two-year period. So it's really just a tremendous up tick we've had since the re-platforming.","Brian Bedell","Yes, okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citigroup.","Ben Herbert","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just maybe -- I know four days in here, but SPX's migration to hybrid platform and just maybe how or if you're seeing anything yet -- on the plant strategy while just how that customer mix might be shifting or how we could look forward to shift? Thank you.","Chris Concannon","Sure. Great question and as you mentioned it's just been a week but it's been a very successful week, just some stats on the migration to the hybrid system. Spreads in SPX and again this is one week of data but spreads in SPX have tightened by 50%. That's an impressive stat. Display size has increased by approximately 90%. So that allows the external all automated electronic execution in the SPX to see a greater size that is available on the screen. The electronic versus open continues to maintain about the same level pre-migration but we would expect there to be some time before that starts to shift upwards towards the electronic side.","Most importantly what we have seen and we structured this very carefully to make sure that the spread was going to narrow but not impact the open outcry liquidity, so we continue to see large trades being satisfied in the open outcry pit to stop solve for very complex positions and again it's critical that they are able to get those trades off in what is already a narrow SPX spread. So, very successful migration it's only been a week as you mentioned but the stats are pretty impressive for we.","Ed Tilly","I think yesterday, Chris has a really good view into unusually wild day in the market as far as a move from open to close and being able to satisfy a roughly $1.6 million contracts and four day platform from a market makes perspective, so good view into busy day, yesterday.","Ben Herbert","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is [indiscernible] filling in for Alex. Can you talk about the recent news around the FCC block in the market data see increase and what sort of conversations are you having with the regulators and the next course of action from you?","Ed Tilly","Sure. Just to be clear, the FCCs focus was on the consolidated step fee change that was filed earlier in the year. So it's all of the S rows [ph] that participate in the SIP, and that filing was -- if filing needs to be re-filed with clarity around rationale for the pricing. So it doesn't mean that pricing can't be changed; it just means the filing has to be enhanced that is made before the FCC. So it's still early in the process and the exchanges are working with the FCC on the SIP finally. Hopefully that answers your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just a follow-up question just around the customer letter they sent out regarding the VIX settlement process. I think in that letter you addressed some of the concerns that were asked earlier in the call just around the potential manipulation of the settlement process. Just given that you self would need to issue this letter to your customer, is it fair to think that the letter was in response to more inbound inquiries from your customers in this topic or was this more of a proactive move. And I'm just really trying to understand the level of concern from your customer base regarding what has been in the media more recently. Thank you.","Ed Tilly","Yes, I think Chris can speak to the direct feedback from the customers and whether or not they see a concern from the media. My comments and views from the customer are that we're trading day in and day out because this is the vehicle we used to hedge vol exposure. And we do it 24-hours a day. That's the first inbound I received. As far as communicating with our customers that is, from our perspective, proactive. That we want to tell our story every chance we get. We've done that with all of you when we think there's something to tell you that doesn't fit a normal cycle. So proactive communication and transparency is really what we've always been about. So I would expect you should see us doing that at any occasion when we think there's something to be told.","As for Chris, the feedback you're getting on the liquidity and trading in and around that settlement, I think you should share your views as well.","Chris Concannon","Yes, one of the -- obviously quickly issued the letter proactively because we wanted complete transparency around what our visual into that event was. And we wanted to share that with our trading community. More importantly the inbound has been from many clients, how do I trade with that imbalance. They see that as a trading opportunity, and the inbound has been consistently from both market markers and end users are very interested in trading with those imbalances that they actually miss that morning, so very positive from the trading community. Remember, not all of our end-user clients trade in to the settlement. Many of our clients are rolling their contracts into the following month. So they don't experience the settlement, they are rolling their positions on a regular basis. But, look, we wanted to be clear that we were disappointed with the 18th, and we saw it as a liquidity challenge and nothing more. And we're out now trying to enhance that liquidity as I spelled out earlier in the call.","Ed Tilly","Kyle, I think you should expect us also as the press is trying to understand this, this isn't easy stuff. So the misperceptions on how these processes work, we're going to be helping all along. And we think that's part of our responsibility is to continue to educate. And if we can do that with the press we're going to do it. So expect us to be engaged and trying to straighten out those misperceptions regardless of the event, the day, or the market environment, that's just what we do.","Kyle Voigt","Thank you","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Great. Hey, guys. Appreciate all the comments around the growth in the user base. Just wondering if you could expand on that a little bit more, trying to determine if you can exactly who the new users are, if these are mostly traders or if you're seeing new users coming in that are more of the hedger variety? And then if there's any way you can maybe potentially help us out with -- we're trying to figure out how much incremental volume could these new users really bring to Cboe. I mean, are these users that really trade a lot potentially or maybe not so much?","Ed Tilly","Debbie, can I give that forward-looking. Chris is going to take this one, I have attorneys around me.","Chris Concannon","Right. So, look, I said it earlier, when you do these migrations it's critical to look at the users that come back after the migration. And obviously we had the events of February 5th before the migration, so we were able to see the users that came back after February 5th along with coming back after the migration. Both are market-maker participation and our client participation was up post migration. So those are all phenomenal statistics when you're analyzing the success of the migration. With regard to the activity levels, remember the VIX contract is a sizable contract. It's not really a retail contract today. So when we look at those users' accounts they're largely sophisticated users that are in those accounts.","We haven't tracked each account down to the level of activity and how that shifts the future volume of VIX. But I do think I was excited about yesterday's 300,000 contracts because it gives us -- we have successfully migrated a base of users that can deliver a day of over 300,000 contracts, despite very small open interests. So again, the open interest -- the correlation between open interest and volume yield of VIX, there's not a lot of correlation there when you have over 300,000 contract day like yesterday.","Ed Tilly","I would say though, in the past, we have said looking into the migration that we did not fit a global standard from a futures traders' perspective, so there were pros that weren't going to write to our old platform. We did point out that big, big trades, the most meaningful ones were really customers of ours, but there was the next layer and the layer below those that just did not find our convention -- our quoting methods meeting their global expectation. So we knew there was a queue that should be coming as far as new users. But again the big players we've had here.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Allen with Rosenblatt.","Chris Allen","Good morning, guys. Appreciate all the additional color you gave us in the settlement in VIX in general. I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the market data. One, I think -- I'm not sure if I missed it, can you give us the magnitude of the audit -- fee audit charges this quarter that helped you? And two, maybe just a little bit more color on the SEC issue. Sounds like you're going to be refilling with more rationale on the pricing increases. Does this signal kind of a change in the SEC to the other approaching market data longer-term, this is kind of implied in the Virtue [ph] call this morning, so any thoughts in terms of how you believe the SEC is viewing market data moving forward would be helpful.","Ed Tilly","Sure. On the SEC front, probably not much change from my perspective. Over the last couple of years the SEC has been very diligent around any market data filing. Certainly we've spent a lot of time on our -- on what was originally batch one and it is now Cboe 1 working through that original filing and adding a lot more detail in the filing than traditionally in the past. So this is probably the last couple of years we've seen a great deal of focus on all market data filings, both the proprietary exchange-level market data filings, as well as SIP-related filings. With regard to the SIP pricing, the goal of that pricing was to be revenue neutral. When you declare something revenue neutral you obviously have to spend a lot of time explaining how it is actually revenue neutral.","So I think a lot of the requirements that the SEC are putting on market data filings have been going on for a couple of years. And I don't see this as any different really to enhance the description of the filing, and really talk about what the impact of those pricing changes would be.","Brian Schell","And then, Chris, Brian. Of the 3.7, the increase we saw in that, so it's year-over-year, probably 85% or a little over $3 million is actually attributable to the audit recoveries.","Chris Allen","Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And as there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to return the call to management for any closing comments.","Debbie Koopman","Thank you. That completes our call this morning. We appreciate your time and interest. And we'll be around if anybody has any follow-ups.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude the conference call and the presentation. Thank you very much for attending. And you may now disconnect your lines."],"4250":["CBOE Holdings, Inc.

[Operator Instructions]. I would like to turn the conference over to Deb Koopman. Ms. Koopman, please go ahead.","Deb Koopman","Thank you, good morning and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our CEO will provide an update on our strategic initiatives for 2016, then Alan Dean, our Executive Vice President and CFO will review our first quarter financial results. Following their comment, we will open the call to Q&A.","Also joining us for Q&A are Ed Provost, President and COO and John Deters, Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Corporate Initiatives. In addition, I would like to point out this presentation will include the use of several slides. We'll be showing the slides and providing commentary on each, a downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the investor relations portion of our website.","As a preliminary note, you should be aware that this presentation contains forward-looking statements which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold and while we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward future performance, and involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements, please refer to our filings with the SEC for a full discussion of the factors that may affect any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publically update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after this conference call.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Tilley.","Ed Tilly","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that CBOE holdings began 2016 with a record first quarter and diluted earnings per share and increase in revenue and operating margin. Throughout the quarter, we expanded our proprietary product offering while extending our global customer reach laying the foundation for continued growth in 2016 and beyond. ","Our solid first quarter financial results were fueled by the ongoing growth of trading in our proprietary index products. It was the third consecutive quarter in which trading in our proprietary products exceeded 40% of our overall trading volume. Futures and Index options trading rose 17% sequentially and 28% year over year significantly outpacing the year-over-year increase of 3% for multiple listed options traded industry-wide.","Today I'll update progress made in the four point growth strategy we laid out for you at the beginning of the year which is to continue to develop unique products, expand our customer base, leverage strategic alliances and continue to define and the lead the options in volatility space globally","Product innovation including further developing and expanding our current product line is the cornerstone of our growth strategy. CBOE's S&P 500 index, SPX options continue to thrive and grow, after posting a third consecutive year of record growth in 2015, average daily volume in SPX options for the first quarter 2016 rose 15% from both the same period of last year and the previous quarter. The gains were driven largely by strong weekly trading which continues to attract new customers to our SPX marketplace. Building on the growing demand for SPX weekly's trading we launched Wednesday Weekly's on February 23rd. Wednesday expiring weekly's combined with our standard SPX weekly's which feature end of week expirations create additional trading opportunities and enable investors to better target specific expirations.","Wednesday Weekly is also aligned with the Wednesday expiration of VIX Weekly's futures and options creating new trading opportunities and synergies for the growing number of customers who employee both VIX and SPX products. We are pleased with the initial traction seen thus far. Wednesday Weekly's averaged 63,000 contracts daily in March, the products first full month of trading. And over 71,000 contracts through April 22nd,with a single day high of a 123,000 contracts. ","Given the appeal of Wednesday Weekly's we plan to seek SEC approval to add Monday Expiring Weekly's which will allow investors to hedge their over the weekend risks. We expect trading growth to continue as we roll out marketing and educational programs, highlighting our new SPX weekly's products. This past quarter CBOE created a series of CBOE S&P 500, Buffer Protect Indexes that are designed to track the performance of an investment strategy combining a 10% downside loss buffer with upside participation capped at a targeted level. Our buffer protect indexes bring a new level of standardization and transparency to popular protection oriented payouts and facilitate the creation of products that allow investors to pre-define their investment outcomes.","CBOE began the [indiscernible] daily values for the Buffer Protect Indexes of April 1st. That's financial group and asset management firm that provides option-based investments through structured protective strategies and innovative technology solutions is the first to license the new indexes. You will recall that earlier this year, CBOE made a majority equity investment in [indiscernible] which now plans to use the buffer protect indexes to create products that are expected to be available through a number of full service broker dealer platforms. We view target outcome investing as an important step democratizing the use of options as it can offer the benefits but substantially reduces the complexity of options for retail and high networth individuals. We recognize that all investors are not the same. Some are attracted to short dated weekly's contracts while others have a time horizon a year or more and favor buy and hold investment solutions.","Our expertise in developing option-based strategy performance benchmark index combined with our partnership with Vest, provides CBOE with a unique advantage point for which to define and leave target outcome investing in the options space. ","Turning now to VIX futures and options. Elevated volatility at the start of 2016 drove significant increases in VIX trading in the first quarter. Average daily volume in VIX options trading rose 55% over the first quarter of 2015 and 20% over the prior quarter, average daily volume in VIX future's trading was up 16% year over year and 15% over the previous quarter. Heightened levels of volatility tapered off throughout the quarter eventually falling below historic level, a levels by the quarter's end and into April. In other VIX news, we began overnight dissemination of the VIX index on April 15th. As you know, VIX measures the real time implied volatility of the S&P 500 options. Our implementation of our fully electronic market for SPX options during extended trading hours, that\u2019s 2:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. central. Not only provides increased access to SPX trading but also enables us to calculate and disseminate VIX index values in that same period.","We are thrilled to offer market participants the opportunity to view volatility when used breaks overnight through the same lens used in regular U.S. trading hours. We expect that increased access to real time volatility information, coupled with the ability of overseas investors to reference the VIX index during their regular trading hours will drive increased fixed trading in a global marketplace.","Turning now to trading and FTSE Russell Index products, you will recall that CBOE became a sole U.S. provider of major FTSE Russell Index products in 2015 beginning with the Russell 2000 index RUT options in April. In the first quarter of 2016 RUT trading at CBOE was up 5% over the first quarter of 2015 when RUT options were still multi-listed and up 18% from the previous quarter.","On March 29th, we listed options on two additional FTSE Russell Indexes, the FTSE 100 and the FTSE China 50 enabling investors to gain exposure to the largest and most liquid segments of the UK and Chinese equity markets. the new FTSE options add to the growing international dimension of our index options franchise which began with the launch of MSCI products. I should note following sustained marketing and educational efforts, we are encouraged to see early trading in our MSCI index products and believe we can build on that growth going forward.","CBOE continues to leverage the marketing and education efficiencies afforded by a comprehensive suite of CBOE index options and volatility products. We plan in 2016 to further leverage our concentrated index option liquidity pool while expanding our global customer base through joint marketing and educational efforts with our index provider partners. Last week, we took a major step forward in broadening the global reach of VIX futures trading by establishing connectivity between CFE our futures exchange and Stellar trading systems, a major independent software vendor in Europe and Asia.","Stellar specializes in providing low latency solutions for high volume traders. Our connectivity with CQG, trading technologies and now Stellar trading connections CFE to the world's top futures execution programs significantly expanding our customer reach and bringing new efficiencies to VIX futures trading globally. We are now planning our Fifth Annual CBOE Risk Management Conference in Europe, RMC Europe, which will take place September 26th through 28th in County Wicklow, Ireland. I'm pleased to say we are preparing to open our CBOE London office, our first business development outpost in July.","In addition, we have engaged a full time CBOE consultant based in Hong Kong in order to have boots on the ground to support our ongoing development efforts in Asia. I will close here by saying we are obviously pleased with our strong first quarter results and while overall volume at April dropped from those first quarter highs, we continue to see increased trading of VIX futures and we accomplished several key strategic objectives.","Regardless of the macro-environment our team remains focused on developing new products, expanding our customer base and leveraging strategic alliances. This disciplined approach positions our company to optimally benefit from trading tailwinds and continue to lay the foundation for future growth when faced with headwinds. ","So I will end here by thanking our team for their ongoing commitment to advancing our strategic plan regardless of market conditions. It is their focus that enables CBOE to continue to define and lead the options and volatility space globally and thereby best serve our customers and shareholders over the long-term. ","With that I will turn it over to Alan Dean.","Alan Dean","Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone. Let me start with an overview of our first quarter results. Strong trading volume in our propriety products for the quarter drove solid first quarter results. Operating revenue came in at $162.3 million, 14% above last year's first quarter. Adjusted operating income was $80.6 million representing an adjusted operating margin of 49.7% up 100 bases points compared with 48.7% in the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders was $49.9 million, up 18% versus the first quarter of 2015, resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.61, a 22% increase compared with $0.50 per share for the same period last year.","Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 include certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck. Looking at our results further, starting with operating revenue, we reported increases in transaction fees and exchange services and other fees partially offset by a decrease in other revenue. Higher transaction fees accounted for most of the revenue growth in the quarter up $19.3 million or 20% compared with the first quarter of 2015 resulting from a 19% increase in the average revenue per contract or RPC versus last year's first quarter. Total trading volume was relatively unchanged from 2015's first quarter.","Looking at volume by product category, you can see there are higher RPC propriety products significantly outperformed the lower RPC multiply listed options with trading in our index options up 29% and futures up 16% over last year's first quarter. These increases were offset by lower volume and equity options and options on exchange rate of products which decreased 20% and 5% respectively. Our blended RPC including options and futures increased to $0.405 from $0.34 cents in last year's first quarter. The increase in RPC primarily reflects a favorable shift in the mix of trading volume with our highest RPC products and ex-options [ph] of future contracts accounting for 42.4% of trading in the first quarter up from 33.3% in the same period last year.","The RPC in our options business increased to $0.346 cents compared with $0.284 in the first quarter of 2015 largely due to the favorable mix of trading volume. Furthermore, the RPC for equity options and index options increased 10% and 1% respectively primarily a result of lower volume discounts and incentives. Revenue per contract at CFE, our futures exchange decreased 4% to nearly a $1.64 from a $1.70 in last year's first quarter reflecting the impact of higher rebates linked to volume and account type.","Looking at the sequential change in RPC the blended RPC for the first quarter was down slightly from $0.408 in fourth quarter primarily reflecting higher volume-related discounts and a shift in the mix of trading volume with index options. Engaging RPC going forward keep in mind that the RPC varies by index option and changes in a mix of volume by product traded impacts the average RPC for that category. The revenue contribution from our proprietary products continues to increase as a percentage of our total transaction fees. In the first quarter, proprietary products accounted for 85.8% of our transaction fees up from 81.3%in the first quarter of 2015, and 83.1% in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Looking at some of the other factors influencing operating revenue, exchange services and other fees increased by $1.7 million. This increase was largely due revenue contributed from CBOE Livevol technology services which became part of CBOE Holdings on August 7, 2015. Additionally, other revenue was down by $1.7 million, primarily due to a flow of revenue from fines. In 2015, revenue from fines was higher than normal particularly in the first three quarters of the year which could result in more difficult comparisons and other revenue in future quarters. Revenue from finances pulled with regulatory revenue and is used towards expenses as we incur to support our regulatory functions.","Turning to expenses, this next slide details total adjusted operating expenses of $81.7 million for the quarter and increase of $8.4 million or 11% compared with $73.3 million in last year's first quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter reflect higher costs for royalty fees, compensation and benefits, professional fees and outside services, and depreciation and amortization. Core operating expenses were $50.9 million and increase of $3 million or 6% compared with the first quarter of 2015. This increase primarily reflects higher costs of $1.5 million in compensation and benefits and $1.3 million in professional fees and outside services. The increase in compensation and benefits largely reflects higher incentive-based compensation which in-line with our improved financial performance.","The variance in professional fees and outside services primarily reflects higher costs for legal and other professional services. We\u2019re reaffirming our guidance with core expenses for the year to be in the range of $211 million to $215 million. We do expect core expenses to increase on the back half of this year, as we noted in our previous earnings call under the regulatory services agreement with FINRA, we plan to complete our migration to FINRA's regulatory software in July resulting in an increase in fees for outside services. While this increase is expected to be offset somewhat by lower depreciation and amortization expenses due to the final write-off of certain regulatory software, it does shift some expenses into core in the third and fourth quarters that were previously in depreciation and amortization.","In addition, I want to call your attention to the fact we added accelerated stock-based compensation to our guidance, we expect to recognize it's R rated stock based compensation expense on a quarterly bases totaling $1 million for the full year. This expense is expected to be reported in compensation and benefits and included in our non-GAAP reconciliation as an adjusted financial measure. The accelerated investing of certain equity awards is based on planned participants reaching age and service requirements specified under our long-term incentive plan and award agreements.","Looking at volume based expenses, royalty fees increased by $4.9 million or 35% reflecting the higher trading volume and licensed products during the quarter. The royalty rate per license contract came in at $0.155 this quarter below the $0.161 we saw in the fourth quarter resulting from a slight shift in the mix of products traded.","Looking forward, I would expect the rate per license contract to be somewhere within the range we saw in 2015 of $0.146 and $0.163 depending on the mix of products traded. Before I move off of the P&L I want to comment on other income and expenses which had a favorable variance of $900,000 on an adjusted bases compared to last year's first quarter, this primarily reflects a $700,000 increase in investment income largely resulting from a higher dividend paying out by the Options Clearing Corporation, OCC versus the amount declared in the fourth quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $107 million compared to $102 million at the end of 2015. CBOE is a strong cash producing business. In the first quarter we generated net cash flows from operating activities of $97 million versus $78 million in the same period last year, largely driven by the increase in net income. Through March we use more than $19 million to pay dividends and nearly $47 million to repurchase our stock. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9 million.","Looking out to the end of the year, we\u2019re reaffirming our prior guidance of $47 million to $49 million for capital spending. The majority of our capital spending continues to be systems related particularly with the ongoing development of our new trading platform CBOE Vector. As we told you previously, Vector is planned to be up and running for our futures exchange CFE towards the end of the third quarter and we look forward to continuing to development of Vector for CBOE and C2.","At March 31st, 2016, we had approximately $115.1 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorizations. As we have said in the past, first and foremost we\u2019re committed to investing in the growth of our business, then we look to return excess cash to shareholders through sustainable dividends and share repurchases. In closing, we are pleased with our solid financial performance for the first quarter and are optimistic about the opportunities we see ahead as we continue to focus on deploying cash generated and value enhancing ways to reward our shareholders.","With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. I'll turn it back over to Debbie for instructions on the Q&A portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Rich Repetto","I guess the multi-listed market share question again. So you had an uptick in the first quarter due to the pricing adjustments but in April it's ticked down again. I'm just trying to see your outlook on this. It's below 15% of transaction revenue and probably just around 10% or 11% of overall revenue. So do you still regard the multi-listed platform market shares you know a priority for you?","Ed Provost","There is no question on our position on multi-listed options, it is a valuable part of our business. It not only provides the transaction fees as you mentioned but supports the revenue line items, as well. Through the first quarter, we ebbed and flow with the number one position, we\u2019re within tenths of a point of the number one market share position. We feel as though we're optimizing revenue which is key for us. So haven't seen any significant shifts in flow, large block trades which tend to move away from some of the primary markets can account for some shifts in market shares. So all in all, we feel very good about our market share position and multiple listed options and nothing has changed.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually [indiscernible] on for Mike Carrier. Alan, I guess this is more of a question for you. Given the recent number of acquisitions, can you give us an update on your minimal level of cash that you need and also CBOE had a debt-free balance sheet. Has your philosophy on leverage changed given your M&A and capital management needs? Thanks.","Alan Dean","Good question, I'm glad you asked it. I appreciate the opportunity to update my thinking on cash and leverage. So it really hasn't changed even with the bolt ons that we\u2019ve been acquiring over the last couple of years or so. $50 million to $70 million of cash I think is more than adequate to run our business especially with no leverage, no debt on our balance sheet which then if we needed to, we could go out and borrow money pretty quickly. Regarding taking on debt on our balance sheet, it's a subject that our Board takes up every quarter one we discuss capital allocation and so far our position hasn't changed. We like the flexibility that no leverage, no debt gives us on our balance sheet and so as of today no change in that position either.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","A quick question on the core index franchise, so CME had their earnings maybe you guys watched and they had a very small bullet on their presentation where they pointed out their S&P options market share has improved couple points year-over-year versus you guys. So I know obviously these are not the same products but they are somewhat substitutes. So just a bigger question about what you see out there in that core market of yours. Are you seeing other substitute products take some share? How are you thinking about it? How you\u2019re pricing that business? And what substitute products in your opinion doing better than others, like for example OTC versus obviously [indiscernible] CME products, anything you could add would be great. Thanks.","Ed Tilly","Sure. Alex. We\u2019re very mindful of the cost between the two complexes and whether or not they can be substitute products and as we have always said from a retail perspective one of the substitutes that certainly comes to mind is the most active ETF trade in the industry, so we\u2019re always mindful of the cost advantages or disadvantages offered at CBOE. I think it's important to point out though in the first quarter, where our index complex, I will throw big speeches in there just for fun. It's growing 28% year growing compared to the industry singlest volume growing 3%. So this is a very important growth area for us. We have seen incredible uptake on the product extensions, the most recent and the ones weekly -- really only about a month and a half to two months of training, big uptake, a lot of activity. It really led us to the announcement this morning of launching subject to SEC approval, Monday Weekly, so we\u2019re out there offering answering the demand from our customer side and really don\u2019t see a sustained share loss or drain to the CME, but rather really accommodating much more demand in fine tuning expiration in the listed arena here at CBOE.","Alan Dean","Let me just add, Alex, that one of the things we continue to see in our [indiscernible] product and particularly as a growing use of the product by retail clients. Some of the retail firms are among the largest providers of order player and particularly in the weekly whereas as we had many years ago a product that was absolutely exclusively institutional, we have a very, very rich mix of both retail and institutional. We see that trend continuing.","Ed Tilly","And also I think it's important, Alex, to look at the similarly the way that we look at the ETN growth in volatility trading. So look at the CME growth in options on futures as complementary. If the entire complex of the S&P 500, if that exposure there is more demand globally, that's a good thing for CBOE. So encouraged by any growth we see in the 500, not a new contract in the industry but one that continues to grow year over year when compared to the competitive space that CBOE is in, as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","If you can comment a little bit, there is obviously new competitor in the market with volatility with the spike index. If you can comment on your sort of sensibility on your VIX franchise versus the other competitive calculations whether you think that will gain traction?","Ed Tilly","Yes. We have heard there's another volatility contract out there but the contract specs are out. So we really don't know what that contract is going to look like. So until there's specs out, it's kind of difficult to comment on. This is not the first challenge to the volatility franchise. I think [indiscernible] here in Chicago has a contract a couple years ago, IFC [ph] announced a volatile contract probably about a year ago. Nothing really in the market and again without the specs for this new contract, I'm not quite sure what to make of it but that said, we have benefitted from the growth of any listed volatility contract in ultimately where the liquidity is in our VIX futures and options. So likely if there's any success on any new contract, whether it's the one you're referring to or one of the others, the traders will have to go little liquidity that is our VIX futures and options. So we'll look to see what the specs look like and kind of make our moves from there.","Operator","The next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","So it looks like you implemented a frequent trader program in April which gives rebates to end users if they reach certain volume thresholds during given months. Could you help us understand the thought process here? Maybe what it potentially helps you in terms of understanding your client base better and then lastly if you could give us any idea of how many clients have signed up for the program already and if you see any impact on fee capture going forward materially. Thanks.","Ed Provost","You actually summarized it pretty well. It's a program you can set it, it's intended to give end user customers the ability to identify themselves through the broker dealer that they route orders through and thus giving us the ability to directly communicate with market to and educate those end users. Often times we\u2019re asked about whether business is incremental, how many customers that are using our products are new versus ones that have been with us for many, many years.","It's never been an easy question to answer because there is a layer between us and the end user customer that prevents us often from knowing who that is. So this is an attempt on our part to create a financial inducement for customers to provide their information through their broker dealer. It has been launched. We have a good number of clients that have signed up at this point and we will go to the details of those, but we\u2019re very pleased with the extent to which customers have shown an interest in participating and again the primary business objective is to promote directly to those clients the existence of our products, how to use them and are there information that we can garner on how to improve those products. As to the financial implications, I'll let Alan speak to the financials.","Alan Dean","Kyle, I view this as market data that we're purchasing through a discount on our transaction fees. I think it has a value to us, but the good thing is we absolutely control the amount of discount that we give to customers through the acquisition of this market data information. So, no I don't expect that the discount will be material to our capture and our revenue per contract capture and I would think that in total it would be consistent with what you would expect with any company who might purchase market data information about their customers.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital.","Andrew Wong","Just following up on VIX futures, volumes are tracking closely in-line with your strong Q1 volumes and we have seen a nice pick up in open interest but trading in VIX related ETP has declined somewhat. So I know the data you\u2019ve on the end user is somewhat limited, but what do you think is driving the futures growth in quarter to-date in Q2 in place of the ETF volumes that have been a big driver in the past? ","Ed Tilly","The hedging activity off ETNs tends to fluctuate with redemption in the ETN or the ETFs. So what we have noticed as you know volatility change and the perception of risks change, so then does the volume in ETNs and ETFs. I will point out that the assets are growing in the ETN and ETFs so the assets that are captured in those specific ETNs and ETFs are growing and as a result, those tend to be longer, positions that are held longer in the futures some of the options as opposed to like a day trader that you will see in a VIX futures contract as [indiscernible] increases we see a lot of day trader activity. So that\u2019s carrying the futures along nicely and then the change in in perception of risk over the long term changes the assets under management and ETNs and ETFs which tend to be longer hold positions in both the futures and the options.","Operator","And the next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Wondering if you can provide your perspectives on the NASDAQ's acquisitions of ISE, whether you think that's going to lead to a big change in the market? I believe the plan over there is to lower pricing. And so maybe you could speak to how that might potentially affect RBC going forward for your guys?","Ed Tilly","I will let Alan tackle what we think will happen in pricing and really from CBOE's perspective, the value propositions here doesn't change at all. We\u2019ve been completion with each of those medallions, whether they're owned, not part of NASDAQ or NASDAR with their existing medallions we compete with them head-to-head every day, that is a very much fee game and fee competition. But it doesn't change the CBOE value proposition. With 99% of the market share in broad based indexes the efficiency and scale at CBOE doesn't change just because ISE is part of NASDAQ. So from the day to day multi-list space it's still going to be head-to-head in fee game, Alan can speak to that ,but in the overall look at CBOE, the way you look, CBOE where our end users looks at CBOE that deep pool of liquidity in the index complex doesn't change just because ISE now is part of NASDAQ but to the potential fee compression as a result I'm sure Alan has some words.","Alan Dean","Yes, Chris, our outlook on pricing and the multi-risk category really hasn't changed and so notwithstanding this acquisition of NASDAQ by NASDAQ of ISE, I don't think anything has changed in price. This is a very competitive space with 14 exchanges all trading the same products. We here at CBOE, we want every options contract to come here. We are committed to a market leading position in the category. Ed Provost mentioned before about how the market share in multi-list category supports other revenue line items in our P&L.","I don't think this acquisition at all changes the landscape. As a matter of fact, it's possible if I were to buy something, I feel some pressure to make sure I show the results from that investment and so lowering pricing wouldn't be the way to do that. I understand that maybe NASDAQ might have said they're more efficient now and it will be interesting to see what happens. I don't expect anything earth shaking, anything new coming out of this acquisition. The good news is Ross, that now 85% of our transaction fees, over 85% emanates from our propriety and not this multi-list category. So I don't see anything new coming out from this acquisition.","Operator","And the next question from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Unidentified Analyst","It's Amanda out here for Ken. Just touching market share of the multi-listed options again, with the declining market share there, as you mentioned the competitiveness of the space, what is the magnitude of pricing changes you think is necessary here for CBOE to maintain or perhaps even gain share?","Ed Tilly","Amanda, I want to make sure I understand your question correctly. Are you asking how far down pricing can go in a multi-list category? Is that what you're saying?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. In your experience, with what you have seen so far, what type of pricing adjustments do you see as being necessary there?","Ed Tilly","Well, we're not a price leader, we're a price follower and with the objective of maintaining a market-leading share or near market leading share in the multi-list category. RPC is all over the map on exchanges. Some I have seen some numbers as low as $0.03 per contract and some past tense -- upwards of $0.10 or more cents per contract. And so I expect RPC to continue its load decline going down. I think it will level off somewhere. At some point exchanges will say, they'll need a certain level of revenue to support the costs associated with this business. Is it, $0.04, $0.05 per contract? $0.03, $0.06 somewhere in that range I would expect.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we do have a follow-up question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Alan, if you can just talk about the RPC trends on sort of volume basis in the index complex, obviously market index options volumes are down almost like 20% in April versus the first quarter, to what extent -- I know there's a lot of different moving parts within the index options franchise but to what extent should we, if we stay at that level in the second quarter, how do you imagine that would impact the index options RPC?","Ed Tilly","Index options, we averaged $0.72 per contract traded for the first quarter. And looking at it by months, it was relatively consistent. It was $0.73, a little over $0.73 in January, $0.72 in February and a little above $0.70 in March. And it is very difficult to predict, but as a rule of thumb, the big volume amounts you should expect a lower RPC. Now, going forward, I think to use $0.72 what we reported in the first quarter is a pretty - you'll be pretty close in your model for the rest of the year at $0.72. I of course monitor the information that we disseminate about pricing on a monthly basis. They are rolling free month average and that should help guide you. But, no, I don't see any major moves in pricing in index RPC.","Brian Bedell","If I can just ask one follow-up question on the revenue in the fine side. Alan, if you could talk about the calibration of that in other revenue versus expenses, how should we think about that for the second quarter I guess if that remains depressed you know is there an expense offset to that?","Alan Dean","Yes. Well first of all, any revenue that we collect either in fines or in the regulatory revenue category has to goes to support our regulatory efforts. So it can't be used for anything else. We can't make a profit off of those two revenue sources.","Now, it's sort to governing, if we thought fines was going to have a fantastic year, we would lower regulatory revenue in concert with that and vice versa. Fine revenue was extremely difficult to predict and year-over-year our other revenue was down $1.7 million and that was $2 million was fines year over year and we had an increase in licensing fees to go along with that that offset some of that decrease. I think the experience that we saw in fines in the first quarter was extraordinary. I wouldn't expect that to continue the rest of the year and I would say that overtime I would think that we will be closer to -- it will be higher on average.","Brian Bedell","Was there an offset in the first quarter or?","Alan Dean","We take a longer view of the fine revenue, regulatory revenue rather than a month by month adjustment, it's a multi-quarter, even an annual look back to make sure that the revenue that we collect from regulatory sources is adequate given our expenses.","Brian Bedell","Right. That is weaker than we should consider that as a positive to the, in other words, you can reduce expenses if that's tracking weaker this year? Based on that?","Alan Dean","So if total regulatory revenue goes down in 2016, that would indicate that our regulatory expenses are down.","Operator","And next question is also a follow-up from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Sorry if this is covered already but just to tag along with the index RPC question, any thoughts about the outlook for futures RPC for the remainder of the year?","Alan Dean","Yes, I do. Glad you asked. Our revenue per contract was $1.64 and that was kind of over the map. It was $1.58 in January, $1.63 in February and $1.73 in March. It was low in January. We had the volume. The participation of volatility was a great market for high frequency traders for people coming and trading the market and providing helping to provide markets for that product. So I think that it was extraordinarily low in January and helped bring down the revenue per contract for the quarter at $1.64. So I would guess, again, it depends on volume and market conditions, but I would think that revenue per contract for the futures category would increase for the remainder of the year.","Operator","And we also have a follow-up from Michael Carrier of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unidentified Analyst","It's Sameer again, Alan this is another one for you, just on your full year expense guidance, you know, given the lighter revenues and like the seasonality of the volumes, how much flex is there in the expense guide given the deals and the investments that you made?","Alan Dean","Yes. There continues to be flex in the expense category and we have a track record of reducing expenses if we see sustained low volume and revenue here at CBOE. But we don't see that right now. We're coming off a fantastic first quarter. April volumes started out kind of slow but it's picking up now and so, no, we're sticking to our guidance and core expenses we expect expenses to pick up a bit later in the year. So no alarm bells going off here as a matter of fact, quite the opposite. We feel good about the quarter and the year as it looks right now.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude the question and answer session. So at this time, I would like to return the call to management for any closing comments.","Deb Koopman","We want to thank everybody for their time today and we look forward to talking to you on our next earnings call and we\u2019re available for the rest of the day for any follow-up questions.

Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Strong fourth quarter trading made 2014 a year for the record books at CBOE Holdings. Record trading at each of our exchanges, CBOE, C2, and CFE, combined for a total of 1.3 billion options and futures contracts traded an all-time high and an increase of 12% over the previous year\u2019s total. The groundwork laid by our team to engage customers, develop products and broaden access to our marketplace positioned CBOE to increase CBOE Volatility Index, VIX futures trading by 26% and total options trading by 11%, outpacing U.S. options industry growth by several percentage points. We were particularly gratified to see record trading in our proprietary products, S&P 500 Index, SPX options and VIX futures and options.","Increased trading across all product lines in 2014 drove new highs in key financial metrics, including revenue, earnings, and operating margin making 2014 our company\u2019s fourth consecutive year of record financial results, a performance that allowed us to reward shareholders through increased quarterly dividends and share repurchases and to lay the foundation for ongoing growth in 2015 and beyond.","CBOE continued to lead all 12 options exchanges with a total market share of 28.6% in December 2014, an increase of just over 1 percentage point from December 2013. I am pleased to say the momentum has carried into the new year. January average daily volume across all products traded at CBOE Holdings was 5.4 million contracts, an increase of 5% from December 2014. While we continued to see strong trading in VIX futures and SPX options, we saw a decline in VIX options trading, which we attribute to the unusual flattened VIX curve that we began to see in January.","To give you a better sense of this, we thought we would show you what traders saw looking out at the VIX term structure, first in December, then in January. It\u2019s very much a tale of two markets. In December, we see the normal contango we almost always see in the VIX curve, the upward slope that creates so many trading opportunities. Fast forward to January and we see a flattened term structure, which is an anomaly for VIX. This tells us the market is uncertain about both short and long-term risk, meaning that many position traders who use VIX options are temporarily on the sidelines. We fully expect the curve to return to its norm, which is in contago and with the return of contango, a return to the trading opportunities that have been temporarily negated by the abnormal term structure.","Next, I will take a few minutes to discuss the 2015 initiatives, beginning with the opportunity for index options and futures trading overall. December 2014 Tabb Group study highlighted strong growth in U.S. equity index derivatives over the past 5 years and projected an additional lift of 6% this year. Over 90% of asset managers plan to increase use of equity index derivatives in 2015, citing market structure changes in the OTC and cash markets, as well as the inherent utility and versatility of the products themselves. Much of Tabb\u2019s report corroborates our own observations and customer feedback. We also look to an ongoing macro shift from active to passive investments and more transparent index products as a powerful indicator and driver of continued growth in index trading at CBOE.","Total dollars in passive investments more than tripled between 2004 and 2012 and are expected to triple again between 2012 and 2020, shifting from 11% of total assets under management in \u201812 to 22% by 2020. We expect this drive \u2013 we expect this to drive increased trading in index options and futures among fund managers who use these products to drive returns and hedge risk. We believe CBOE is uniquely positioned to benefit from the trends pointed to increased use of equity derivatives. Key to our strategy is expanding and leveraging partnership with index providers. We were pleased in December to enter into a licensing agreement with MSCI that enables CBOE to be the only U.S. exchange to list options on several well-known MSCI global indexes.","We plan this quarter to launch options on the popular MSCI EAFE and MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes, with four others to follow later this year, pending regulatory approval. The global exposure afforded by MSCI Index products brings a new dimension to our index option franchise, which features options on prominent domestic indexes, including the S&P 500, Russell 2000, Dow Jones, and NASDAQ 100. Our MSCI partnership also provides us with the ability to create MSCI volatility products as a means to similarly bring global exposure to our VIX product line.","In addition to forging partnerships with index owners, we continue to leverage our in-house product expertise to create proprietary index in options and futures. The ability to create our own products, such as VIX, puts CBOE on the licensor side of the equation, enabling us to create additional recurring revenues and extend our customer reach. As a result of our track record in product innovation and successful collaboration with index provider partners, CBOE not only brings new index products to the market, the market brings index product ideas and opportunities to CBOE. This virtuous loop enables us to offer our customers the world\u2019s widest array of index option and volatility products and deep liquid markets in which to trade them. While product innovation is central to our unique value proposition, we are equally committed to mining the significant untapped opportunity in our current index product mix. In 2014, VIX trading volume increased by 8% over 2013, led by an increase in SPX Weeklys trading of 38%.","It bears mention, given that we are frequently asked about the life cycle of growth in VIX trading that SPX volume increased at a compound annual growth rate of 16% over the last 10 years, a timeframe that represents years 21 through 31 in the life of SPX. More important, the aforementioned industry trends point to considerable headroom for increased trading in our flagship product. We plan to further grow SPX trading in 2015 through intensified educational efforts aimed at institutional investors, including OTC participants, fund managers, and overseas investors.","We have mentioned in the past our ongoing educational efforts with the buy side, which despite the inherent leveraging and hedging power of SPX options has only begun to broadly embrace these products. After chipping away at this market for many years sometimes one pension fund at a time, we believe we are nearing an inflection point, where increased awareness in understanding of SPX options meets the opportunity created by the ongoing shift from active to passive funds and from OTC to listed equity derivatives trading.","We recently commissioned a white paper on fund use of options, which found that options based funds have higher risk-adjusted returns and lower volatility. We have received great feedback on the paper from buy side customers in need of data-driven validation to increase their ability to use equity derivatives to manage funds.","We will continue to expand our SPX marketplace globally in 2015. SPX options provide a means to take a position on the broader U.S. market with a single transaction and efficiency of particular appeal to overseas investors. This quarter we will enable a global customer base to more conveniently access SPX trading through extended trading hours. As announced this morning, the new SPX trading session will begin on Monday, March 9, following our launch of extended trading hours and VIX options beginning March 2. The new session for SPX and VIX options will run from 2 AM to 8:15 AM Chicago Time.","Turning now to VIX Futures and options, further growing a thriving product line and marketplace is a major opportunity and priority for us. VIX Futures trading established a fifth consecutive record year in 2014 with average daily volume of 201,000 contracts, an increase of 26% over the previous year. VIX options trading \u2013 VIX options traded more than 632,000 contracts per day, a new record and an increase of 11%.","Diversifying our VIX product line represents a significant means for CBOE to further define and expand the volatility space. On January 13, we began calculating and disseminating values for three new volatility indexes based on the prices of the most liquid FX options traded at CME, the dollar euro, dollar British pound, and dollar Japanese yen futures contracts. The new indexes offer the first ever measures of pure FX volatility and we look forward to developing tradable products based on them going forward. While we are excited about new products in the pipeline, we are also committed to developing markets for two important contracts launched last year. Short-term VIX VXST futures and options and Interest Rate VIX futures based on the CBOE\/CBOT 10-Year Treasury Note VIX Volatility Index, VXTYN.","We introduced VXST futures and options last year into what then became sustained headwinds of historically low volatility. Despite a slower than expected start, customer feedback confirms an appetite for short-term volatility trading and fuels our belief in the product\u2019s potential. We will continue to work closely with end users, presumably under more favorable trading conditions to evaluate and adjust our approach as necessary. We view the November launch of VXTYN futures as the beginning of an ongoing opportunity to grow VIX trading, but caution that market is making inroads in trading is a longer term proposition. Interest rates represent an entirely new sector of volatility trading. Laying the tracks to reach and educate this new customer base will be an ongoing mission for our team.","We look also to the opportunity to grow VIX trading overseas. After implementing near 24-hour trading in VIX futures last June, more than 9% of all VIX trading now takes place outside of regular U.S. trading hours. On days when there is breaking news outside of U.S. trading hours, we have seen that percentage rise to as much as 20%. With this quarter\u2019s planned roll out of extended trading hours for SPX and VIX options, I am pleased to say that we will provide a growing worldwide customer base with increased access to our three fastest growing, most profitable products.","We continue to leverage the efficiencies afforded by marketing a comprehensive index suite that enables market participants to hedge and trade global volatility, the global stock market, the broad U.S. stock market, and the U.S. small cap market and the world\u2019s emerging markets. There are obvious synergies in using these products in tandem and develop and significant overlap among our customer segments. We leverage our marketing and educational efforts accordingly.","We were pleased last year, for instance, to launch a newly enhanced cboe.com website as well as a new CBOE Mobile App that prominently feature our proprietary products. Both have tremendous reach and both will be further expanded in the coming year. This year, we will also expand our successful Risk Management Conferences, beyond the U.S. and Europe with the first RMC in Asia. RMC showcases our premium index products and attracts sophisticated and influential market participants who tend to be early adopters of new CBOE products and services. Embedded in all of our strategic initiatives are ongoing efforts to ensure that our systems are efficient, robust and secure. I am pleased to say we completed a major systems effort in the fourth quarter by separating CFE\u2019s trading environment from CBOE, thereby greatly reducing the potential for any single point of failure in our marketplace. The continued rollout of extended trading hours and the implementation of numerous hardening and performance upgrades are priorities for us in 2015.","Protecting the integrity of our markets is ingrained in all that we do. In December of 2014, we entered into an agreement with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, FINRA. Under that agreement, FINRA began to perform the majority of CBOE\u2019s and C2\u2019s options regulatory services on January 1. Alan will address the financial implications of the agreement, but I will note here that we believe the combination of FINRA\u2019s regulatory independence and efficiency, with CBOE\u2019s options regulatory oversight experience, further reinforces the integrity of our markets and investor protection.","I will close here by noting that our record 2014 was the result of the sustained efforts and disciplined approach of our entire team to broaden access to our marketplace, expand our unique product set and grow our customer base. Our team\u2019s ability to consistently advance these three strategic growth initiatives leaves us well positioned to meet the considerable opportunities on the horizon in this year and beyond. We couldn\u2019t be more excited to build on that momentum.","With that, I will turn it over to Alan Dean.","Alan Dean","Thanks Ed. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. This morning, I will walk you through our fourth quarter results and then provide guidance on certain financial metrics for 2015. CBOE Holdings had another strong quarter, benefiting from more favorable market conditions and solid execution from our team. As outlined in the press release we issued earlier this morning, operating revenue was $166.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 17% compared with last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income was $88.8 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 53.4%, up 220 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders was $53.6 million, an 18% increase compared with 2013\u2019s fourth quarter, while adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $0.64.","Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the fourth quarter of 2014 include certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck.","Turning to the details of the quarter, as this slide shows, the growth in our operating revenue was primarily driven by higher transaction fees. Transaction fees increased $23.7 million, or 24% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter, due to a 15% increase in trading volume and an 8% increase in the average revenue per contract or RPC. Trading volume increased across every product category in the fourth quarter compared against both the prior year period and the previous quarter. Our blended RPC, including options and futures, was $0.34 compared with $0.316 in the fourth quarter of 2013. This increase mainly resulted from a shift in the mix of trading volume towards our highest margin products index options and VIX futures.","The RPC in our options business increased to $0.284 compared with $0.275 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The RPC on equity options and exchange-traded products declined by 9% and 16% respectively while the RPC on index options rose 5%. The RPC decline in the multiply-listed products was primarily due to an increase in volume discounts as market participants optimized the benefits offered in our fee schedule through higher levels of trading.","On the futures side, CFE\u2019s revenue per contract increased 3% to $1.62 from $1.57 in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily resulting from a more favorable mix of trades by account type, as well as fee changes. As this slide depicts, the contribution from our highest margin index options and futures contracts accounted for 35.3% of total volume in the fourth quarter versus 33.8% in 2013\u2019s fourth quarter. Converting the volume into transaction fees, you see that the index options and futures contracts accounted for 83.7% of transaction fees, up from 80.1% in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Now, let me provide a few brief comments on some other revenue variables that influenced the quarter. Access fees were down about 5% compared with last year\u2019s fourth quarter, primarily due to a decline in market maker permits. Looking ahead, we expect to see a similar decline for the full year 2015 and are projecting access fees to be down by about $3 million to $3.5 million this year versus 2014.","Regulatory fees for the quarter increased $1 million compared with 2013\u2019s fourth quarter, reflecting a higher rate for the options regulatory fee, as well as an increase in industry-wide customer trading volume. As we have pointed out in prior earnings calls, the revenue derived from these fees is only available to cover expenses we incur to carry out our obligations as a regulator. As a result, we make adjustments as needed to keep the revenue obtained from the options regulatory fee and related expenses in balance. For 2015, we expect regulatory fees to go down by about $2 million to $2.5 million due to the elimination of fees related to CBSX, our stock exchange which ceased trading in 2014, and a lower options regulatory fee rate compared to 2014.","Now, let me turn to expenses. This slide details total adjusted operating expenses of $77.7 million for the quarter, an increase of $8.5 million or 12%, compared with last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Adjusted expenses for the fourth quarter of 2014 exclude $1.9 million of severance expense, which relates to the outsourcing of the majority of our regulatory services to FINRA.","Turning to core operating expense, this slide details fourth quarter core expense of $46.5 million. This represents an increase of $2.6 million or 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to higher expenses for outside services. The increase in outside services was mainly due to higher costs for legal expenses and contract services. The increase in legal expenses reflects the recognition of an insurance reimbursement in the fourth quarter of 2013, with no corresponding benefit this year.","Volume-based expenses, which include royalty fees and trading volume incentives, were $20.2 million for the quarter, an increase of $3.9 million, or 24%, primarily reflecting a $4.2 million increase in royalty fees. The increase was mostly due to higher trading volume in licensed products, which include index options and VIX futures. In addition, royalty fees included higher fees associated with our market data sales and fees linked to certain order flow for contracts directed to CBOE.","Effective for 2015, we are making some adjustments to royalty fees to improve its alignment with the trading volume of licensed products. Going forward, the fees linked to order flow will be reported as contra-revenue offset against transaction fees. This change should result in a more consistent metric for modeling royalty fees and better align the trading volume for licensed products with royalty fees. Taking these reclassifications into account, we expect the royalty fee rate per licensed contract traded to be just under $0.15 for the year, reflecting a rate of about $0.14 for the first quarter and $0.15 in subsequent quarters in 2015. Volume from all index options contracts traded, VIX futures and any other licensed contracts should be taken into account for this expense projection.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 41.2% versus 36.1% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to tax adjustments related to changes in our assessment of uncertain tax positions and a lower benefit from discrete items versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the tax adjustment related to a prior period, which is included in our non-GAAP adjustments, the effective tax rate was 39.4% compared with 36.1% in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Let\u2019s turn now to a few highlights related to \u2013 relating to our balance sheet and capital allocation. In 2014, we generated more than $263 million in cash from operating activities, which enabled us to return more than $67 million to shareholders through regular dividends, $44 million through a special dividend and more than $177 million through share repurchases. Through share repurchases, we reduced shares outstanding by 3% in 2014. Since our share repurchase program was implemented in August of 2011, we have reduced our shares outstanding by 6%.","Our capital position remains strong, ending 2014 with cash and cash equivalents of $148 million. Our approach to capital allocation remains unchanged. We look first to fund the growth of our business and then to return capital to our shareholders through sustainable quarterly dividends and share repurchases. At December 31, we had $90 million remaining on our share repurchase authorizations. We consider both dividends and share repurchases important in providing additional value to our stockholders. Few days ago, we announced that we declared a dividend of $0.21 per share for the first quarter of 2015.","Now, I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2015. Looking at core expenses for the full year 2014, we came in at about $189 million, in line with our guidance range of $186 million to $190 million, which we provided back in August. For 2015, we expect core expenses to be in a range of $195 million to $199 million, an increase of 3% to 5% versus 2014. This increase primarily reflects higher expenses for data processing, business development, which is included in travel and promotional expense, and outside services. In addition, we expect a reduction in employee costs as a result of our regulatory services agreement with FINRA.","As Ed noted, CBOE and C2 entered into an agreement with FINRA to perform the majority of the exchanges regulatory services. As part of this agreement, many employees of CBOE and C2 transitioned to FINRA in late December. As a result, in 2015 you will see our employee cost decrease and outside services increase. Our core expense guidance anticipates a net reduction in employee costs of approximately 8% or $10 million with a net increase in expenses related to outside services of 45% or about $14 million. While there are other variables impacting these line items, the FINRA agreement is the most material.","The net increase in employee costs for 2015 represents staff reductions resulting from the FINRA agreement net of increases for staff additions, merit increases and incentive compensation. Adjusting for the impact of the FINRA agreement, employee costs would increase and outside services would be relatively unchanged in 2015 compared with 2014. Under our agreement, FINRA will utilize CBOE\u2019s regulatory software over a transition period. As a result, we are accelerating the depreciation of certain regulatory software to be fully depreciated at the end of this period, which will add about $3 million to depreciation and amortization expense in 2015.","Continuing stock-based compensation, which is included in core expenses, is expected to be about $12 million for the year. The decrease versus 2014 is due to the final vesting in June of 2014 of stock awards granted in 2010 following our IPO, offset somewhat by new grants awarded. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be between $46 million to $48 million, reflecting capital additions in 2014 and the accelerated deprecation for regulatory software I referenced earlier.","2015, capital spending is expected to be between $37 million to $40 million, down somewhat compared with the $50 million we spent in 2014. The heightened level of spending in 2014 supported our efforts to harden our systems. In 2015, the majority of our capital will continue to be used to enhance the efficiency and integrity of our trading systems. Finally, our effective tax rate is projected to be between 38.5% and 39.5% for 2015.","In closing, 2014 was a great year and we enter 2015 well-positioned to continue to deliver solid results, while also continuing to invest for long-term growth. I am very optimistic about the opportunities before us and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.","Thank you for your interest in CBOE. And I will now turn it back to Debbie, so we can take your questions.","Deborah Koopman","Thanks, Alan. At this point, we would be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everybody and feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits we will take second question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Yes, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Rich Repetto","Good morning, Ed. Good morning, Alan.","Ed Tilly","Good morning, Rich.","Alan Dean","Hi, Rich.","Rich Repetto","I guess, Ed, thanks for the comments and color on the VIX term structure upfront. And I guess that\u2019s my question is if you look at volatility, the volatility levels now were at pretty high levels, at least for the VIX, but we are not seeing like, if you look at your index option, as well as the VIX futures, they are not at commensurate high level as what you saw in the \u2013 it\u2019s more like 2Q or 3Q or a little bit above. And I know you pointed towards the VVIX before, and that\u2019s still running at 100. So, I guess this new tool helps us to sort of understand it, but are you saying that we would actually need a decrease in short-term volatility to see pickup in these index options and VIX futures?","Ed Tilly","Well, Rich, no. What we are saying is not necessarily a decrease in the front month, but rather this could be the new norm. If 19 is our new normal, I would anticipate them the back end of the curve slopping upward toward the mid 20s, 22, 23, 24, 25, that\u2019s a pretty normal spread we can still remain in contango. So, what is unusual is just the flat shape? We don\u2019t see that very often. I think you have to go back to 2008, 2009 to see this flat curve. Now, all of that said Rich, it\u2019s about 3 weeks worth of data. So, we didn\u2019t see this in December. We have just seen this in January. So, primarily just focusing on VIX options strategy, those are the users on the sideline. VIX futures while we saw some pretty terrific calendar spread trading pickup throughout the year, last year, there is very little attractiveness to trading that calendar when the difference between front month and October is less than a point. You really don\u2019t trade in and out of that curve.","So, what we have seen in VIX futures though to pickup the slack and why that\u2019s still up month over a year is because the day trader is trading with much more frequency, because of the higher VVIX, but we have that calendar spread around the sideline in the futures. We have the term structure, the trade rolls up and down the volatility curve on the sideline in the options. That said, all the terrific backdrop for us in the flagship SPX which traded almost 1 million contracts a day in January, we have never seen anything like it before. So, the complex itself, trading the 500, hedging your exposure to the 500 is still very robust, we are pretty pleased with it overall. And I think a return to a normal shape of the curve brings back the VIX options trader and the calendar futures trader, while we are going to rely on the active day trader and the VIX futures in the meantime.","Rich Repetto","That\u2019s very helpful. I think that gives sort of the segment of the different traders. Thanks. And I hope you watched that little game this past Sunday night.","Ed Tilly","We did indeed. Rooting for you.","Rich Repetto","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. Alan, maybe first a question for you, I think I understand what you were saying on the royalty fees, but I just wanted to make sure things weren\u2019t changing, just the way that the calculation we will be looking at going forward will be on a contra basis, meaning the fees that you are paying into the market that\u2019s not changing. And then just in kind of tandem with that, when you think about pricing just in general, whether it\u2019s on the transaction side, the access side, market data, it seems like throughout the industry we are in a period where pricing is showing some signs of improvement, meaning the exchanges have more power. So, just wanted to get your take? I know you guys have done things in the past, but just wanted to get your take on how you see the dynamics in the current environment?","Alan Dean","Yes, good morning Mike. Good question. Yes, to clarify the royalty fee issue, no, nothing new there. We are just taking out small amount of dollars that we showed as royalty fee expense and moving it up to transaction fees. And that item when we left it in royalty fees, sometimes messed up the correlation between royalty fees and the index and futures volume. And so just by moving it up, we think that will improve the correlation between that and nothing is new. And so the $0.14 in the first quarter, $0.15 for the rest of the year and that\u2019s I think for the fourth quarter, we are at $15.2. So, you can see the impact of the dollars that are moving up to transaction fees. The impact on RPC, this is multi-list contra revenue that I am moving up to the revenue side. It will have a really small impact on RPC, a few tenths of a percent, a few tenths of a cent. So, that was the idea there.","Now, on pricing, actually I have been saying this for a while and I am feeling better about it as time goes on. The way I look at pricing right now on the multi-list side, yes, there has been certainly stabilization in those line items. And that\u2019s great. I think maybe we have all gotten it that dropping price may yield short-term gains in market share, but in a long run, competitors match and everybody is out revenues. So, on the multi-list side, it\u2019s stable going forward. On the index options side, we have been able to acquire a few cents of RPC there over the past couple of years, but I would model stable pricing in that category going forward. And VIX futures, because of the size of the contract, it\u2019s so large. The notional value that VIX future is so large, there is more room to move up there and you saw that. If you look at historical pricing there, I think you will see an increase in pricing in VIX futures. But we are very deliberate in what we do on pricing. These \u2013 the growth curves of SPX, of VIX options, VIX futures is so fantastic that what we don\u2019t want to do is turn anybody off to these products because of fees. So, we are very careful about what we do there. I would much rather have an increase in revenue driven by volume rather than fees. So, that\u2019s how I am viewing fees going forward.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Alan Dean","Sure, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Good morning, everyone. I just want to ask about market participants and growth in that regard. When we talk to people, index traders and things like that, it sounds like the last 6 months have seen a little bit of a slowdown in I guess what those guys are seeing in terms of new people connecting and trading. So, just wondering if you are seeing the same things or if it\u2019s more like market-driven in terms of maybe the lead time of somebody like looking at the product set and then getting live is it\u2019s taking a little bit longer or maybe different market participants just taking longer or moving elsewhere, because other areas look a little bit more exciting right now, so maybe flesh it out a little bit? Thanks.","Ed Provost","Hi, Alex, it\u2019s Ed Provost. So, as you know and we have discussed this, we have very, very experienced team both on the futures and the securities side engaging buy side clients, mostly institutional, some retail on a regular continuous basis both domestically and abroad. We evaluate the messages that are brought back on a regular and ongoing basis. We see as Ed mentioned, the little slowdown in the VIX options is very much being market conditions driven, no lack of enthusiasm, no lack of interest, still increased connectivity, especially on the futures side. So, we are \u2013 we continue to be very optimistic. We are looking at record attendance at our Risk Management Conference coming up in March, where we speak solely about the products that are proprietary to CBOE. So, we are \u2013 we couldn\u2019t be more optimistic about not only the current user base, but those parties in particular pension space, who have not historically used our products, but who are adapting to using our products in the future.","Ed Tilly","Yes. I think also Alex this is an opportunity for us now with broadening the products that we are bringing globally. You couldn\u2019t be more excited about a March launch and announcing that today for VIX options and SPX options. It really allows the team to get out there. And then of course MSCI to really offer to a growing customer base CBOE\u2019s growing set of unique products only to CBOE. So, you may hear a more tempered approach but our sales guys couldn\u2019t be more excited. And I think there is enthusiasm around both the ETH launch for options and MSCI in broadening our reach for global hedging.","Alex Kramm","Alright, very good. Thank you.","Ed Tilly","Thanks Alex.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Allen with Evercore.","Chris Allen","Good morning guys.","Ed Tilly","Good morning Chris.","Chris Allen","I appreciate the color on then VIX term structure. And you referred that the last time you saw this happened was back in \u201908, \u201909, I am wondering, A, how long it lasted back then. B, what should we be looking at as indicators for potential change, is VIX open interest a good indicator for a change in the current environment right now that\u2019s continuing to decline in January and February, will that start to pick-up and start to see it lengthening out, I mean a change in the term structure, any color there would be appreciated?","Ed Tilly","So, it doesn\u2019t last long, just like when we see spikes when VIX in that normal upward slope contango, when we see spikes in backwardation where the front month is higher than the back months, that doesn\u2019t last long either. Again, this is a very small data set of basically the last few weeks. What I would point you to similarly what we pointed you to in May is go to our CFE website. You get to see the term structure real time, the futures prices are up there today. They are up there every day in real time. And you can see basically 19% to 20.5%, 20.75% over the next 10 months, which is really, really flat.","So, you will either see a new normal at 19% and upward slopping into the mid-20s or you will see the front month coming down. I can\u2019t predict that. We use real prices of the S&P 500 options. And when those settle, you will see a change either to the front month, or you will see a new norm and the back month will tick up. I can\u2019t predict time, I would say that a very unusual from a trader\u2019s perspective to see moves in the S&P 500 of 3% or so in a given week, that\u2019s really, really unusual. We have had \u2013 any given day, we can move 20 handles, that is historically, unsustainable. But again, I can\u2019t predict the future. I use real prices like everyone else when I look out over that term structure. The website will tell you, will give you a pure good look into what those that are insuring the 500 are willing to pay for insurance.","Chris Allen","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.","Christian Bolu","Good morning guys, thanks for taking my questions. On extended trading hours, clearly it\u2019s been a big success in the futures world. As we think about SPX and mortgage securities world, is there any difference in the customer base or behavior that would mean extended trading hours are more or less successful relative to the experience with futures?","Ed Tilly","Yes. I think the difference is really the futures industry is we didn\u2019t introduce extended trading hours in the futures industry. We picked up an industry who is used to trading around the clock. For example, Globex has been opened 24 and three quarter hours for quite some time. We love that, we follow that model and have been very successful in trading VIX futures in non-U.S. trading hours. Uniquely, now CBOE will launch on the security side, SPX options and VIX options. So there is a difference. There is a different user base. We are excited about it. Our most active traders are looking forward to the launch. We have got liquidity providers testing with us and ready to provide some really meaningful quotes. So it is different, it is unique. CBOE paving the way again for introducing and allowing access into the U.S. market in the non-U.S. trading days. So I would point out the biggest difference is the futures users are used to this and the securities guys this will be new and CBOE is bringing that to the marketplace.","Christian Bolu","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Kenneth Hill with Barclays.","Kenneth Hill","Hi, good morning Ed, good morning Alan.","Ed Tilly","Good morning.","Alan Dean","Good morning.","Kenneth Hill","I wanted to talk a little bit about the new products. So I would assume getting a new product off the ground, if you are going to need some buying from not only market participants as well as guys like market makers and liquidity providers there. What do you guys see as impediment to partnering up with dealers and market makers to come in and back new products like the 10-year VIX. And what kind of things can you guys do on your end to help incentivize them to get in and make markets for those new products and get them off the ground. And I guess on a related note, are there certain products that are more difficult to get buy-in for versus others?","Ed Tilly","Yes. So, let me start, I am going to turn it over to Ed Provost, there certainly are ones that come more naturally to us and ones that present a bigger challenge. What we said on the launch of the 10-year is getting into the fixed income space is new to us. It\u2019s new to our liquidity providers and it\u2019s going to take a longer lead time. What\u2019s more natural obviously is extending trading hours in products that are in our core, SPX options and VIX options and extended trading hours, different challenges, but once that we are much more comfortable with.","I would point out that you mailed, we need to launch new products, first with liquidity. And as we go back and look at our successes, it\u2019s because we have got anchored tenants posting liquidity from the opening bell to the closing bell in meaningful quality markets. And without that, new products are not setup to succeed. We think we do a very good job of that. But I will turn it over to Ed and he can touch on some of what we are hearing from his business development guys.","Ed Provost","So, yes, just add to what Ed said, it really is a balance of the liquidity provision and getting order flow providers prepared for and to promote the use of the products. VXTYN, whole new product set for us, a much bigger challenge in getting continuous liquidity in that product, but we have gotten that going that we think pretty well. MSCI products pretty much are consistent with our current mainstream products, won\u2019t be a big challenge. Extended trading hours in VIX and SPX options, we have three dedicated DPMs starting at 2 AM, we feel very, very good about that. So it has a lot to do with the product and the space that we are operating in. The closer it is to our historical product line, the better it is, the newer it is, the greater the challenge. And that\u2019s true on the order flow side as well. The users of the VXTYN, a different user set for us. So, new people to meet, lots of more \u2013 lots of greater challenges in engaging that audience as opposed to again MSCI products which is basically the same user set that we are running into all the time at our Managing Directors Conference. So, different products present different challenges. As we look to diversify our product set, we will find ourselves engaging new users both on the liquidity provider side and the order flow side. But, we have recognized that and we are well equipped to handle both.","Kenneth Hill","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Hey, good morning guys.","Ed Tilly","Good morning Pat.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","So, a question on the market data fees line. You guys are seeing some really nice growth in that area, kind of in the first half of 2014 and I think you attributed a lot of it to growth in your futures exchange market data, is that something do you think there is still some more upside left, because it seems like you obviously have a very viable property and there is probably more ways that you can monetize that?","Ed Tilly","Yes. That\u2019s a great question Patrick. In 2014, we saw three things happen in market data fees. First of all, we had an increase in market share and that drove our operating revenue. So, operating revenue is driven by each exchange\u2019s share of industry options trade. So, that was a big driver in 2014. But we also saw some pricing changes affect that line item and that drove another although other smaller part of the increase. But the other two items that were drivers were CFE, our futures exchange market data fees, which we continue to see growth in and our own streaming markets that we sell. So, the largest part was operating revenue, but we are seeing growth on CFE and our streaming market side as well.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Great. Thank you.","Ed Tilly","Sure.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander","Hi. Thanks. It\u2019s Niamh Alexander. So and just on the MSCI and it\u2019s quite a well known index. So, it could be a pretty exciting opportunity. Can you just help me think about how you are thinking about framing the product? Is it going to be primarily an electronic index? Is there an opportunity to kind of create something like the S&P with the pits? There already are ETFs or options on ETFs in place right now for MSCI products, but just help me think about how you are looking to? And right now I guess you haven\u2019t ruled it out, but should we be thinking about this as being similar to your index options in terms of the pricing and whatnot?","Ed Tilly","So, I will let Alan talk to you about pricing, but I think you have nailed it. So, think of the success that we have had when we have looked at SPY. And as the SPDR ETF trader grows the size of the trades the complicated, the sophistication of the strategy, we have talked to those traders to move into the SPX. So, think of that in the exact same way. The MSCI contracts will be much larger notional value, cash settled European exercise. So, think pro, once you have begun and had success trading that ETF, we want to move those traders into the much more professional sized trade that will be offering options on for MSCI. So, exact same way. So, look to SPDR, look to SPX, and that\u2019s what we hope to accomplish with the large institutional size contract that we are going to be introducing. Alan, on pricing?","Alan Dean","Yes, I am looking pricing on these products similar to what we are experiencing in our index option side right now. So premium pricing, their license products and we will extract more value from those than we would on our multi-list side.","Niamh Alexander","Okay. And it\u2019s first quarter rollout, right?","Ed Tilly","Yes.","Alan Dean","Yes.","Niamh Alexander","Okay, fair enough. Good luck with it.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Thanks. Hi, guys. A quick question on the slide you guys have there on the passive assets, I thought it was kind of pretty interesting, but wondering if you could help us out a little bit more maybe trying to frame the opportunity there. Do you guys know how much derivatives a typical passive fund actually utilizes? And I ask that if you look at the expectations for 2020, $23 trillion of assets, maybe if it\u2019s 5% that use derivatives that might help us frame up the market share a little bit better?","Ed Tilly","I can\u2019t pinpoint exactly by strategy or by fund. I think what TAB points out that we are so excited about is the trend to what is basically the core for CBOE is really predicting that the hedging ability on the macro side and using these funds and the increase in the assets in these funds should line up well for CBOE\u2019s complete suite, whether it\u2019s the 500, whether it\u2019s growth stocks in the Russell, whether now with MSCI with the trillions benchmark to MSCI, we think those benchmarks and those assets under management is going to grow. And we then see the continuation and the engagement of whether it\u2019s on volatility related to those funds or the straight out hedging that we see today just growing over time. Ed?","Ed Provost","Yes. So, I will add to that, Chris. Take a look at the white paper. It really is an impressive study of the fantastic growth of funds utilizing option strategies and the fact that people can increase returns. And in some cases, it actually reduced risk at the same time. So, I think that gives an addition to the TAB study a great perspective on the \u2013 on what I will call another form of the institutional use of options. We speak oftentimes about the pension space, but the fund space has grown fabulously as that white paper pointed out.","Ed Tilly","Yes. And then one more thought, I mean that\u2019s the U.S. approach and I think the trend is just beginning globally and picking up exposure for us with MSCI really allows our guys to go out and we have gotten out two risk management conferences outside of the U.S. That\u2019s just beginning for us. So, in our business development guys and our teachers go out, the suite now in attracting not just U.S. exposure and hedging that in funds, but rather now being able to use MSCI and that suite of products, it really opens a lot more doors for us.","Chris Harris","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Hi. Good morning folks.","Ed Tilly","Good morning.","Alan Dean","Good morning.","Brian Bedell","Good morning. Just a question on the options, both multi-list and index options market share, obviously there has been some shift around with MX losing some share to Batz. Just wondered if you would comment on, first of all, whether that will have any impact on you? And then just looking at February, I know it\u2019s only a couple of days in, but it looks like you have some lighter share in the index side and then little bit on the equity side. So, if you can maybe just \u2013 and maybe that\u2019s just too early, but if you could just comment on those trends? And then just the timing of the MSCI launch and when you expect that to be material through revenue?","Ed Provost","So, Brian, Ed Provost. MSCI launched I think end of first quarter and revenue impact obviously beginning there and going forward. As to the market share situation, been pretty stable, multiply-listed options very much in the 20%, 21% leading the group. We like the business. It\u2019s not on a revenue per contract basis nearly as lucrative as our proprietary products, but we like the business. We compete aggressively and we feel as though we are optimizing revenue in that space. Our overall market share was obviously going to ebb and flow more based upon the activity levels than our proprietary products, but the market share wise, we like our position, it\u2019s strong. And in my perspective, as it\u2019s been pretty stable for a good number of months, I don\u2019t read anything quite frankly into the early February numbers, but we feel \u2013 so this will be a strong market share year for us.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. And then just RPC trends would be moving if we have softer volumes in 1Q that would be beneficial for RPC from a volume threshold basis on the options?","Ed Tilly","Well, you have to think about, Brian, mix. And so if you saw softer volumes and equity options and ETF options, but SPX and VIX and VIX futures remains strong than our overall RPC is going to jump. And conversely, if you saw an incredibly strong equity in the ETF category, it would negatively impact our overall RPC. I talked about RPC by category a few questions ago and so that\u2019s how we are looking at our PC today.","Brian Bedell","Yes, okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning.","Ed Tilly","Good morning.","Ken Worthington","If I calculated correctly, operating margins about 53.5% or so, I think that\u2019s the highest we have seen. And you have a number of initiatives that continue to play out extended trading hours, product extension and so on. But as we think about the groundwork for growth, say over the next 5 years, just looking at the increase in margin, so call it high-quality problem. Are you investing enough or maybe is pricing really optimized to maximize revenue and revenue growth or maybe the answer here is the right margin level for CBOE is not really 50%, but it\u2019s really closer to 60%. So, as we think about this improvement in margins, what\u2019s kind of the right way to frame how we should think about this going forward?","Ed Tilly","We don\u2019t manage the operating margin although, it\u2019s a byproduct and it\u2019s a formula. And I am going to be stating some things that I am sure are obvious to you, but it starts on the revenue side, coming up with proprietary products that we can charge premium pricing on maximizing the growth rate of our current product suite. I think we are doing that for education and business development efforts, other business development efforts there and that driving revenue, looking at fees and fees is much an art as it is a science. We have to be careful about what we do in fees and all of our product categories. And we think we are \u2013 but we want to maximize that revenue. In VIX futures, it\u2019s possible to increase those fees, but I don\u2019t want to do something that would stop the next big futures firm from trading VIX futures. I just wouldn\u2019t want to do that. So, that\u2019s part of the equation.","The other part is the expense side and the leverage that margin doesn\u2019t work unless we do the right job on the expense side. And I think we have a pretty good history of controlling expenses. I think our guidance for next year is \u2013 it should be no surprise to anyone, it\u2019s I have always said 3% to 5% year-over-year on core operating expenses, that\u2019s how it\u2019s looking for next year again. And if we see volume downturns, we respond. And for instance in 2014, our initial guidance was in the mid 190s and we saw a volume downturn in the late spring and into the summer. We have responded by pretty dramatically cutting cost and lowering our guidance for the year. So, that\u2019s the formula. I don\u2019t guide to an operating or I don\u2019t have a target for an operating margin number. All the pieces underneath have to be watched and worked on. And if we do the job there, then the operating margin works.","Ken Worthington","Great. Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Akhil Bhatia with Rosenblatt Securities.","Akhil Bhatia","Good morning. My questions have been asked and answered. Thank you.","Ed Tilly","Thanks, Akhil.","Alan Dean","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Neil Stratton with Citi.","Neil Stratton","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I am sorry to do this, but I just want to come back to the January dynamics one more time. And most of the comments about the term structure were, I think, focused on the options. So, I just want to ask a question about the VIX futures. And the open interest does seem at sort of lower levels versus prior periods. I just want to see what are some of the dynamics behind it? And is there any impact specifically from the ETP market? Thanks.","Ed Tilly","So, yes, back to the same answer. So, VIX options are priced off of VIX futures. So, you are right to point out the futures, that\u2019s basically that flat curve. What we used, if you look at the history and the growth of VIX futures, we began with a hedging vehicle for our market makers trading VIX options. You are right you point out the ETP growth driven by major institutions offering their customers sponsored ETPs that were designed to replicate exposure to various portions of the volatility curve. That growth was terrific and it really moved us to the next level. We picked up calendar spread traders and day traders as the daily volume got to a critical mass we are able to attract them.","So what continues and what\u2019s fallen away in a flat curve? What\u2019s fallen away a bit is the calendar spread trader. As I said, there is roughly a point maybe between front month and October, so not really attractive trading in and out of calendars at this point, but what has really served us well is being able to attract that day trader with the volatility of volatility or VVIX up about 100. The day trader has more than compensated for the lack of interest from a calendar spread trader and we are up obviously this year about 220,000 to 225,000 contracts a day on the futures side. So, we think both the ETP, the calendar spread trader come back as the term structure changes and we think the VIX options trader comes back as well. I don\u2019t know if that answered your question, but that\u2019s the difference between the futures, why we still see the futures volume growing is because we have this day trader. It is very, very active in a 100 VVIX environment.","Neil Stratton","Sure. Thanks very much.","Ed Tilly","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Hello again. Just one quick one on the extended trading hours, you might have mentioned this, but is the pricing expectation the same one as well for index options, given that you might have some more traditional users versus market makers, HFTs things like that or is it comparable?","Ed Tilly","I think the same.","Alex Kramm","Easy enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And as there no more questions at the present time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.","Deborah Koopman","Thank you. I want to thank everybody for their interest in CBOE and I am available all day if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to report that CBOE Holdings posted record financial results in the third quarter with new highs in operating revenues, operating margin and earnings per share. Tremendous industry wide volume in the third quarter, was outpaced by record volume in our premium products, including S&P 500 Index, SPX options, CBOE Volatility Index, VIX futures and options, and Russell 2000 Index RUT options.","Record third quarter average daily volume in SPX options trading resulted in an increase of 39% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. SPX volume is up 8% year-to-date through October 28th.","On April 1, CBOE became the exclusive home of Russell 2000 Index options RUT. We are pleased to note that average daily volume in RUT options reached a record high in the third quarter, increasing 23% over the previous quarter and 11% compared with 2014\u2019s third quarter, when RUT was still multi-listed.","We are confident we can continue to leverage our concentrated, non-fragmented pool of liquidity for RUT options to increase trading among institutional traders while expanding our customer base through joint marketing and educational efforts with our FTSE Russell partners.","Both VIX options and VIX futures posted their strongest quarter ever. Average daily volume in VIX options increased 54% from the previous quarter and 45% from last year\u2019s third quarter. VIX futures average daily volume rose 43% sequentially and 32% compared with last year\u2019s third quarter. Year-to-date through October 28th, VIX options trading is down 11% and VIX futures trading is up 2%.","Following spikes in volatility in the third quarter and a return to more historical VIX levels, we began to see somewhat lower levels of VIX in October. Regardless of market conditions, we remain focused on strategic initiatives that enable us to maintain profitability in periods of low volatility and to optimally benefit when volatility spikes and triggers increased trading.","We continue to execute our core growth initiatives through our unique ability to create, collaborate, and connect with the marketplace. We launched VIX Weekly futures in July and VIX Weekly options earlier this month. VIX Weekly, combined with our standard monthly VIX options and futures, create a greatly expanded array of trading opportunities and tools to trade volatility. I am pleased to report on the strong debut for each product.","Just weeks after launching, VIX Weekly options are averaging 25,000 contracts per day and hit a daily high of more than 68,000 contracts on October 22nd. VIX Weekly futures are averaging 300 contracts per day, with volume spikes of nearly 2,000 contracts per day. We are in the very early stages of developing this new dimension in VIX trading, but are beginning to see the same types of strategies and patterns that have characterized trading in standard VIX options, including more frequent rolling of certain strategies.","We expect to see greater traction now that both futures and options are up and running and, in response to customer interest, we rolled out additional expirations this week and plan to add more expirations going forward.","On October 20th, we began the roll out of our new FTSE Russell products with the launch of options on the Russell 1000, the Russell 1000 Value, and the Russell 1000 Growth indexes. Passive assets linked to the three indexes totaled $360 billion. Our ability to offer options on Russell large caps, alongside our popular RUT contract, enables market participants to efficiently target and trade key segments of the U.S. equity market.","In all, the FTSE Russell Indexes licensed to CBOE represent a diverse group of domestic and global equities that offer international appeal. We look forward to the continued rollout of additional products, including the planned launch of options on the FTSE 100 and FTSE China 50 later this quarter.","CBOE continues to identify synergies and collaborate with strategic partners to extend our global reach. As recently announced, CBOE partnered with the London Stock Exchange Group and major dealer banks in the launch and development of CurveGlobal, an innovative interest rate trading venue.","CurveGlobal is expected to launch in the second quarter of 2016 with trading in futures based on major European interest rates. Additional products, including potential new products from CBOE, are expected to follow. CurveGlobal products will trade on the LSE Derivatives Market and will clear through LCH.Clearnet.","This is an exciting time to be in the global interest rate marketplace. Our strategic investment in CurveGlobal allows us to participate in that space through a trading venue that will be highly differentiated by the partnership of major dealer banks, new interest rate products, increased trading efficiencies and reduced transaction costs. Our CurveGlobal partnership also enables us to work collaboratively to develop new products and further grow our worldwide customer base.","We are pleased to be the U.S. anchor exchange for CurveGlobal and look forward to developing products suited to that venue and introducing the new platform to our U.S. customers.","As announced in September, we also entered an agreement with Environmental Financial Products, EFP to launch a new interbank lending exchange, called the American Financial Exchange, AFX. The new exchange is an electronic marketplace for small and mid-sized banks to lend and borrow short-term funds.","AFX also plans to provide a transaction-based interest-rate benchmark through weekly auctions to set a new rate for U.S. interbank lending, called Ameribor. CBOE looks forward to hosting, operating and helping to further develop this truly innovative marketplace.","Connecting our global customer base with CBOE premium products continues to be a top priority. Since the implementation of near 24-hour trading in VIX futures in June 2014, trading outside of regular U.S. trading hours in that product has grown to an average of nearly 9% of total trading. On days when we\u2019ve seen major breaking news, that figure has grown to 20%.","This year, we launched an additional six-hour trading session in VIX and SPX options. The new VIX and SPX options session begins at 2:00 a.m. Chicago time, which aligns with the market open in London and the close in Asia. Trading in both products during European trading hours has steadily increased since the new session launched in March and, not surprisingly, increased dramatically when volatility spiked in July and August. This month, we added SPXPM options to our extended trading session and we will continue to add products where we see a need or opportunity.","We continue to connect with sophisticated end users and early adopters of CBOE products through our trademark CBOE Risk Management Conferences, RMC. In September, we hosted a record number of attendees at our fourth annual RMC Europe in Geneva.","I am pleased to note that this year we are expanding RMC beyond the U.S. and Europe, with the first RMC Asia, which will run November 30th and December 1st in Hong Kong.","Our first RMC Asia will coincide with this quarter\u2019s planned launch of options on the FTSE China 50, as well as the launch of the CBOE Options Institute at the Singapore Exchange. We are thrilled to extend our global reach in the growing Asian marketplace.","In closing, I will note that our record third quarter volume and financial results were made possible by the talent and tenacity shown by the entire CBOE team in the face of sustained market headwinds in the first six months of 2015. Our team\u2019s ability to stay the strategic course, even amidst challenging conditions, placed CBOE in a position to benefit optimally when the tide inevitably turned, as it did in July and August.","It is very gratifying, of course, to reward our shareholders by posting record volume and financial results, but the tremendous quarter we just enjoyed also confirms and invigorates the confidence of our entire team in CBOE\u2019s long-term strategy to further define and expand the options and volatility space.","I want to thank our shareholders, our customers, and our entire team for their continued support and shared belief in our vision for CBOE.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan Dean.","Alan Dean","Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. Let me start with an overview of our results for the quarter. As Ed highlighted, CBOE achieved record results in the third quarter, hitting new highs on a number of financial measures fueled by record trading volume in our proprietary products.","Operating revenue came in at $187 million, 26% above last year's third quarter. Operating income was $101.1 million, representing an operating margin of 54.1%, up 370 basis points compared with 50.4% in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders was $63 million, up 31% versus the third quarter of 2014, resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.76, an increase of 33% compared with $0.57 per share for the same period last year.","Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the third quarter of 2015 include certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck.","Now, let's review our results in more detail, starting with operating revenue. As shown on this chart, the increase in operating revenue primarily resulted from higher transaction fees along with an increase in exchange services and other fees, offset somewhat by decreases in the access fees and other revenue.","Transaction fees increased $40.5 million, or 39%, compared with the third quarter of 2014 resulting from a 31% increase in the average revenue per contract or RPC and a 6% increase in trading volume versus last year's third quarter.","Total trading volume in our options products rose 5%, while the volume in our highest-margin futures contracts increased 32% over last year's third quarter. Furthermore, looking at options trading volume by product category, our higher RPC index options significantly outperformed the lowest RPC, multiply-listed options.","Average daily volume in equity options decreased by 20%, options on exchange-traded products were generally unchanged and index options grew by 41% year-over-year and 44% compared with the second quarter.","Our blended RPC, including options and futures, increased to $0.431 from $0.329 in last year's third quarter. The increase in RPC primarily reflects a favorable shift in the mix of trading volume to proprietary products, as well as RPC growth across each product category.","Looking at the mix of trading volume by product category, our highest margin index options and futures contracts accounted for 44.6% of our trading in the third quarter, up from 33.8% in the same period last year.","The RPC in our options business increased to $0.368 compared with $0.275 in the third quarter of 2014, largely due to the favorable volume mix. In addition, we saw RPC increases of 39% for equity options, 25% for options on exchange-traded products and 4% for index options, primarily resulting from fee adjustments made this year and lower volume discounts and incentives.","Revenue per contract at CFE, our futures exchange, increased 1% to nearly $1.65 from $1.62 in last year's third quarter, reflecting the impact of fee changes implemented in January, offset somewhat by higher volume-related rebates.","As a result of the shift in the volume mix and RPC increase, transaction fees generated from our proprietary products represented a higher proportion of our total transaction fees year-over-year and sequentially. In the third quarter, index options and futures contracts accounted for 84% of our transaction fees, up from 81.3% in the third quarter of 2014 and 82.4% in the second quarter of this year.","Looking at some of the other factors influencing operating revenue, exchange services and other fees increased by $1.5 million. This increase was largely due to higher fees for systems services and revenue contributed from Livevol technology services, which became part of CBOE Holdings on August 7th.","Access fees declined by $1.6 million, reflecting a decrease in trading permits. Other revenue fell by $900,000, primarily due to a decrease in revenue generated from regulatory service agreements, which ceased as of December 31, 2014.","Turning to expenses, this next slide details total operating expenses of $85.9 million for the quarter, an increase of $12.1 million, or 16%, compared with last year's third quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter reflect higher costs for royalty fees, professional fees and outside services, depreciation and amortization and compensation and benefits.","Core operating expenses were $51.1 million, an increase of $4.8 million or 10%, compared with the third quarter of 2014. This increase primarily reflects higher costs of $4.4 million in professional fees and outside services and $900,000 in compensation and benefits.","As we have noted in prior quarters, the increase in professional fees and outside services is primarily attributed to our outsourcing of certain regulatory services to FINRA, which occurred in December of 2014.","The increase in compensation and benefits largely reflects higher incentive-based compensation, which was driven by the Company's improved financial performance. This increase was offset somewhat by a decrease in salaries, due to the decline in staffing resulting from the outsourcing of certain regulatory services.","As we mentioned on our last earnings call, given the sustained improvement in trading volume, we\u2019re unwinding certain cost reductions we put in place earlier this year.","As a result, we are updating our guidance for core expenses. We now expect core expenses for the year to be in the range of $194 million to $196 million, up from previous guidance of $190 million to $194 million, but still below the range we provided back in February of $195 million to $199 million. This change largely reflects higher performance-driven incentive compensation, which is directly tied to our financial results.","Looking at volume based-expenses, royalty fees increased by $5.6 million, or 35%, reflecting the strong growth in licensed products traded during the quarter. Looking at the royalty rate per licensed contract traded, it came in at $0.146 this quarter, below the $0.163 we saw in the second quarter, resulting from a shift in the mix of products traded. Looking forward, depending on the mix of products traded, I\u2019d expect the rate per licensed contract to be somewhere within this range.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.4%, which includes the benefit of a release of certain -- the release of uncertain tax positions. Excluding a non-GAAP adjustment of $4.3 million, the effective tax rate for the current quarter was 37.7%.","Year-to-date, our adjusted effective tax rate of 38.5% is in line with our guidance range for the full-year 2015 of 38.5% to 39.5%.","Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $122 million, compared to $90 million at the end of June and $148 million at the end of 2014.","CBOE is a strong cash producing business. Through September, we generated net cash flows from operating activities of nearly $194 million versus $184 million in the same period last year, largely driven by the increase in net income. Through September of this year, we have used more than $54 million to pay dividends and nearly $101 million to repurchase our stock.","Capital expenditures through September were $27 million. Looking out to the end of the year, we are reaffirming our prior guidance of $37 to $40 million. This capital spending includes the development of our new trading platform, CBOE Vector. I am pleased to say that Phase 1 of this project, which is the build out of our new systems for CFE, is on track. We expect the new CFE system to be up and running in the third quarter of 2016, with CBOE and C2 to follow.","At September 30, 2015, we had approximately $92.2 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorizations. Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged; first and foremost we will continue to invest in the growth of our business.","We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through sustainable dividends and share repurchases. We believe that one of the best investments available today is our own Company, so we plan to continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock.","In summary, our third quarter results demonstrated the strength of our business model, powered by positive operating leverage that produced strong cash flows and record-setting operating margins. We continue to see solid growth opportunities ahead and look forward to continuing to deliver long-term value for all of our stakeholders.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Debbie.","Deborah Koopman","Thanks. At this point, we\u2019d be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. But feel free to get back in the queue, and if time permits we'll take a second question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Yes, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Rich Repetto","Good morning, Ed. Good morning, Alan, and congratulations on the many records in the quarter.","Alan Dean","Thanks, Rich.","Edward Tilly","Thank you.","Rich Repetto","So I guess the first the question I have is on capital usage. And the buyback was probably the lowest amount, and understandably because the stock price was up. But I guess, the question is when do you recalibrate that now that, now that you\u2019re building cash. And then, Alan when you talked about other investments, could you talk about what are other things you could be investing in? And again, I believe your sort of principle has been you would rather grow the dividend than doing any variable dividend towards year-end?","Alan Dean","Rich, our philosophy or policy hasn\u2019t changed. As I said in my prepared remarks, regular dividends, we want to see those grow with our business. After investing what we need to on our business to make sure we keep on growing after that stock repurchases we will be opportunistic, but we like our stock and so expect us to continue there. Now with all that being said, I won\u2019t rule anything out there. Everything is on the table. We\u2019ve done specials in the past. And I\u2019m not trying to say that we\u2019d -- there is something on the horizon, but we will consider all methods to return cash to shareholders. That\u2019s the theme. Don\u2019t hold on to shareholder cash and we\u2019ve done that in the past and you can expect us to continue doing that in the future.","Rich Repetto","Okay. Thanks much. I will get back in the queue.","Alan Dean","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, guys. Just given the investment that you\u2019re making in CurveGlobal. Just wanted to get your sense -- I know you mentioned, you hit on in a little bit, but when you look at the environment maybe whether its competitive environment, the regulatory environment, how do you think that platform like potentially differentiate, meaning why -- what\u2019s attractive to make that investment?","John Deters","Good morning. This is John Deters. I think the things that we\u2019d like folks to focus on when thinking about CurveGlobal are, first the participant. So we\u2019ve got two leading global exchanges involved and our participation in particular, it\u2019s a great question when you think about what we do well, when you think about our DNA, its product innovation. And so that leads you to the next point of what differentiates the CurveGlobal platform. It\u2019s a platform that will be focused on product innovation, not strictly listing the products that are out there today. And then, I\u2019d also point you to clearing environment for CurveGlobal. CurveGlobal will clear into LCH.Clearnet, which is the largest OTC swaps clearing platform in the world with close to 200 trillion in notional outstanding for swaps derivatives. And we think the opportunity to garner capital efficiencies with portfolio margining is tremendous. So we look forward to providing those novel products into the platform.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Yes. Hey, good morning everyone. ","Edward Tilly","Good morning, Alex.","Alan Dean","Good morning, Alex.","Alex Kramm","Hey. First I guess only question is for Alan. I know people have asked this before, but the royalty number continues to surprise people, so hoping that you can give us a little more building blocks if you can use in the futures to -- future be better. I mean, I look at different product bucket, VIX futures, VIX options, SPX options, probably the biggest ones. All those increased fairly consistently 40%, 50% and your royalty fees were up 30%. So what am I missing, because it doesn\u2019t seem to be mix of those three buckets, because they all increased have more than royalty fees, so what else am I missing? Thanks.","Alan Dean","Alex, the -- what you\u2019re missing is that which I can\u2019t provide you with is different rates that we\u2019re paying in on the licensed products that we\u2019re trading. And I think if you do a little bit closer analysis of the volume trends of the proprietary products that we traded, that might tell you more and might be able to give you better insights into why that licensed fee per contract dropped in the third quarter relative to the second quarter. There -- not all the products are the same for us, so we pay more on some products than we do on others. And that can impact that metric especially when you have a shift in relative volume. So does that help, Alex?","Alex Kramm","I mean, other three buckets that I just mentioned, are those the three one to think about or are there other things to think about? Maybe you can just speck at least, give us some help in terms of what products are -- generate more royalty fees than others? Or I\u2019d just have to do it ourselves?","Alan Dean","Yes. Its VIX options, VIX futures, its SPX, its Russell. Those are the drivers of that line item and do the analysis; I think you might find some correlation.","Deborah Koopman","Yes, the mix shifted.","Alex Kramm","I will do some more analysis and I will come back for a follow-up. Thanks.","Edward Provost","Okay.","Alan Dean","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Great. Hey, good morning, everybody.","Alan Dean","Good morning. ","Alex Blostein","So bigger picture question for you guys, when you take a step back clearly in 2015, was it a little bit of a tale of two cities tough environment in the first part of the year and obviously very volatile third quarter. But when you look at the whole year holistically volumes in -- whether it\u2019s CFE or index options or your listed product -- multi-listed product has been flattish to down on the year-over-year basis, and it\u2019s hard for -- from our perspective I guess to see some of the organic growth initiatives that you\u2019ve been highlighting. So, I guess the question is, is there any way to size how much organic initiatives have contributed to this year\u2019s results, because we can't really see it from the volumes. And then more importantly, when you look out into next year, what would you consider to be a successful outcome from any of these growth initiatives you outlined today? Thanks.","Edward Tilly","Its Ed Tilly, I\u2019ll start. Actually year-over-year SPX has actually been more than solid. We\u2019re up 8% in SPX year-over-year, future is up roughly 2% even given the slow first quarter and VIX options just a terrific recovery from a first quarter, we were down about 40%, we\u2019re down 11% year-over-year. So all of that certainly leads to a change in volatility and specifically the driver from our end users is the expected risk looking forward over the volatility curve. We talked a great deal on the first quarter, very, very low expectation of risk in the market place. The utility of VIX really outperforms when the expectation over time is an increased risk or more normal risk in insuring the S&P 500 with VIX future and options. The growth, when we look out over the next couple -- the next quarter or quarters into next year, still we will rely on an incredibly intense educational effort. We mentioned just a few of them in my prepared remarks. The joint educational opportunity with Singapore and Asia, our RMC -- our first RMC in Hong Kong completing our fourth in Europe. All of those point to increasing the user base not just domestically but globally for our unique product set, the SPX complex, the volatility complex and now of course FTSE Russell primarily with Russell. And well recently, we haven\u2019t spent any time on that this call, this morning is adding another tool one that more closely tracks Spot VIX with the VIX Weekly option and future. I can't point to a better contract, better start to a new launch contract than the VIX Weekly. We\u2019re in week -- roughly week three here averaging over 20,000 contracts a day and spiking already at 68,000 contracts. That\u2019s pretty remarkable and then has to coincide with the concentrated educational effort to point out the differences and uniquely the similarities and what strategies work in trading on the short end of the volatility curve much more closely in line with Spot VIX compared to that traditional every 30 day expiration in the traditional VIX futures and VIX options. So long answer to a terrific question on what we think and what we expect in the future, more education, much more education, new product set out in the market place answering the demands from the short end of the curve, and I\u2019d ask Ed and Alan if they\u2019d like to join in.","Alan Dean","Ed, I think one, another initiative that has really paid off for us is extended trading hours. The geographic expansion that we\u2019ve seen -- we\u2019ve been able to make our products available in different time zones to people, to investors around the world that we -- has really paid off for us, particularly in VIX futures and now most recently in SPX and VIX options. So that\u2019s another example of our growth initiatives that has really paid off along with the VIX Weekly story.","Edward Tilly","Great point. Thanks, Alan.","Alex Blostein","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Hi. Good morning folks.","Edward Tilly","Good morning.","Brian Bedell","Maybe either Ed or Alan, if you can talk a little bit more deeply about the RPCs and not so much the mix but actually more of the improvement trend in the third quarter by category, focusing more specifically I guess on the proprietary products on the index side and the futures VIX, the dynamic that helped the RPC improve with lower member discounts and as we come into the fourth quarter, where we\u2019ve got VIX volumes down -- VIX futures volumes down a good 25% so far versus 3Q levels and the index options down 12% or 13%. How that dynamic may change the RPC per bucket in the fourth quarter?","Alan Dean","Sure. This is Alan Dean, let me tackle that question. RPC in our multiply listed products this year is up significantly, and it has been a great contributor to our revenue, our transaction fees for the quarter. And what happened there is, our goal that we\u2019ve stated many times before is to optimize or maximize the revenue in that multi-list category. So, we made some pre-changes earlier this year in those product categories and at the same time we lost some market share 1.5% or so, maybe 2% of multi-list market share and that drove our RPC, the revenue per contract up in that category because, the market share that we gave up was for contracts that were either zero or very low RPC or maybe even negative RPC. So it\u2019s optimizing that RPC as our goal and that\u2019s what we did. Now looking forward, I expect revenue pre contract in the multi-list category to decline in \u201916, again consistent with our view as it has always been with the transaction fees there, because there are so many exchanges fighting for the same order flow. I think it\u2019s natural that RPC will come down. And again consistent with what we\u2019ve said in the past, we intend to maintain a leadership position in terms of market share. So if somebody does something in terms of price well you can expect us to react to maintain that position. We have other revenue line items in our P&L that are supported by that multi-list category, and so we are going to defend that. And the license product side, so indexes and VIX futures, I would expect RPC for 2016 in that category to be flat to slightly up. We have pricing power there, it\u2019s -- they certainly aren\u2019t -- there are products that -- where there are competitive products traded, but it\u2019s not at the same level of course that we see in a multi-list category. So, with all that being said, keep in mind that the multi-list business represents a declining portion of our total revenue, and even with the exceptional results that we saw in the third quarter, multi-list transaction fees, as I said in my prepared remarks accounts for only 16% of our transaction fees. I\u2019ll just contrast that with a metric that blows me away every time I think about it. Five years ago when we launched our IPO, the multi-list category accounted for 50% of our transaction fees. So it kind of gives you an idea of the shift and importance that multi-list category has for us. I still want every contract to come here. We\u2019re fighting for every contract and that market share that we want that to happen, but the focus has moved more to the liquidity provider side. So our overall RPC for the exchange will move up if our license products trade have higher volume relative to the multi-list category and the overall RPC will drop if equity in the ETP products increase relative to our index and futures product. So it\u2019s really as simple as that.","Brian Bedell","And just for \u201916, are you basing the RPC flat to up slightly? Is that -- is the denominator there the third quarter or the full year of \u201915 and is that the same comment through the VIX futures product?","Alan Dean","Restate the question. I want to make sure I understand.","Brian Bedell","Yes. So, index options, RPC flat to slightly up in 2016, is that from a base of third quarter RPC or for the full year 2016?","Alan Dean","Well the comparisons we\u2019re making are relative to the third quarter of 2014. So -- but looking forward if I were to compare 2016 RPC and index and futures compared to 2015, I would expect flat to slightly up.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. Thank you.","Alan Dean","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Hill with Barclays.","Kenneth Hill","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Edward Tilly","Good morning.","Alan Dean","Good morning.","Kenneth Hill","So you guys have a lot of partnerships out there. Right now a lot of them have clauses in them where you\u2019re going to develop additional products on the back of them; I believe it\u2019s explicitly stated in the FTSE Russell agreement where you\u2019ve committed to rule out a new product every year. So you\u2019re getting pulled in a lot of directions here. So moving forward, I guess how are you making sure you\u2019re allocating the right resources to develop the products people want? And actually get the market marker buy-in, because I think that\u2019s been a problem for some other products that haven\u2019t taken off quite as well as you would have hoped. So just hoping to hear how you\u2019re going to manage that going forward and then maybe some color on what products you\u2019re hearing customers looking for right now?","Edward Tilly","Great question. So, just to be clear, we\u2019re not being pulled in any new direction. Product development is core here and what these joint ventures and corporations and investments in short is the flexibility for us to develop the new products -- new products similar to what we\u2019ve been doing over years here at CBOE. We gained the flexibility of platform, and now with CurveGlobal the flexibility of a clearing venue. But the resources dedicated to new products have not changed. We are as engaged as we\u2019ve always been. We\u2019re certainly not pulled in any new direction rather look at these opportunities as flexibility in product design and ultimately product clearing, and then the global reach because of that added flexibility. So again, not a new direction for us, just giving us much more options as far as listing and clearing, and we pick up certainly with LSE who have just been terrific. A much more collaborative effort on what they see will answer the needs of specifically customers that maybe originating in their home market. So, its business as usual here with much more flexibility and I\u2019d certainly offer Alan or John Deters certainly to weigh in as well.","John Deters","Yes. I\u2019ll just springboard after that. We really are finding new applications for existing expertise and we take a disappointing rigorous approach to what opportunities we will prioritize looking at things like the size of the end market. It\u2019s no secret that the rates market is an enormous end market opportunity and particularly working in an optimized clearing environment and working in partnership with the large dealer banks, we think we\u2019ve got tremendous opportunity to apply that expertise to great success.","Alan Dean","And Ken, this is Alan Dean. I\u2019ll add that AFX, CurveGlobal, Livevol, so all consistent with our M&A strategy that we\u2019ve articulated many times in the past. What we don\u2019t want to do is get into a new business. A business that we aren\u2019t familiar with or we may not have expertise in. What we do want to do is invest in businesses and opportunities that compliment what we already do or take advantage of our strength. So, I think all those do that, and so it\u2019s not being pulled in a different direction. As John said, it\u2019s taking advantage of what we\u2019re really good at.","Kenneth Hill","Okay. Thanks. I appreciate all the color there.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Amanda Yao","Hi. Good morning. This is Amanda Yao filling in for Ken. Can you talk a bit more about the VIX Weekly\u2019s both on futures and options? Has experience there been different versus what you\u2019ve seen with the short-term VIX? Thank you.","Edward Tilly","So VIX futures, VIX Weekly, the futures and options again relatively new. Futures began in July -- late July about the 23, and then VIX options the 8th of October. So while futures typically and what we\u2019ve seen in our past similar to how the standard VIX futures contract launched pretty slow. VIX futures Weekly\u2019s are averaging about 300 contracts a day, really needed that option compliment to really start the growth of the regular VIX futures as similarly in Weekly\u2019s with the launch of VIX option Weekly\u2019s, but right off to the races as I say averaging about 25,000 contracts per day. So what's the difference? Its really kind of what I said earlier, the beta or how closely the Weekly tracks Spot VIX is very appealing as is in all Weekly contracts or short dated contracts a difference in premium, and the ability to fine tune investment needs for hedging in and around perceive short-term risks in the market or planned events and announcements in the market place that the utility of Weekly\u2019s offers over the third traditional three week cycle or four week cycle. But I think what we -- also I want to point out in the same way that some SPX strategies are driven and replicating exposure in the futures. So VIX futures today you can replicate that exposure by using SPX options. Similarly you can replicate exposure in the short dated Weekly contracts with Weekly SPX. So we would expect to see some new volume being driven into SPX Weekly\u2019s because of short dated VIX contracts both futures and options. So we\u2019re just beginning to realize that impact in the way that those work hand-in-hand. Anyone else want to weight in, Ed or Alan?","Alan Dean","Amanda your question also touched on why is this different in the nine day volatility product and the fact is, in the nine day volatility product we decided at that point that a -- to setting up a separate index from VIX and trading nine day volatility in the form a Weekly was a approach that we thought the market place would be very accepting of. As it turns out what the market place really wanted was the natural extension of our VIX product which has been so successful and a Weekly variant of our VIX product is what the market place has decided works for them obviously. It\u2019s worked out that way in SPX and in many other established products. So I think and looking back going with a VIX Weekly as it has now shown itself to be quite successful is the way that the market place wanted a VIX Weekly product.","Edward Tilly","And I think it ties in pretty nicely with the question just before Ken was -- some contracts don\u2019t perform well when you launch them and we\u2019re not afraid of that, and we\u2019re certainly not afraid to go back to the drawing board and redesign as is the case and the perfect example of the nine day short dated volatility contract compared to the redesign in launching a Weekly on a 30 day number. So we like this stuff, this is what we do. And if something doesn\u2019t work we don\u2019t give in on the concept, because we heard from the end user there is a demand for short-term volatility contracts. We didn\u2019t have it right the first time. So we go back to the drawing board, we re-launch and we re-launched successfully in this case and that is perfectly aligned and certainly what we\u2019ve been used to doing with our customers in meeting their demands.","Amanda Yao","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Rob Rutschow with CLSA.","Rob Rutschow","Hi. Good morning everybody.","Edward Tilly","Good morning, Rob.","Rob Rutschow","Just a quick question on the Livevol acquisition, I think that\u2019s your first one and maybe close to 20 years. I know it looks pretty small, but I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what caused you to pull the trigger on the deal and is the environment for potential deals changing in your view. And then I was hoping maybe if you could just give us a little bit more detail on the revenue and expense stream there?","Edward Tilly","Alan, do you want to start with revenue and expense, and we\u2019ll get into the Livevol what that does for us.","Alan Dean","Yes. It is as you said Rob, a small acquisition and immaterial really. What we said in the press release is that, we expected revenue and expense for 2015 to be flat and then to be slightly accretive next year. The one revenue line item on our P&L that was affected this quarter by the acquisition of Livevol was exchange services and other fees. And so if you look at year-over-year it\u2019s slightly up, and so that was the Livevol revenue flowing through our P&L. The expenses are included in our core expenses and so, not a needle mover initially, but we think in the long run it provides a great opportunity for us. John, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.","John Deters","Yes, and strategically it\u2019s what, we love highlighting the story because I think it highlights our advantage in market data. Market data is an important strategic focus for us and our advantage really is in derivatives market data and the information that\u2019s embedded in derivatives products. We always look when we look at market data initiatives, we look for opportunities that will feedback into our proprietary products either through increased trading because market participants have new tools and analytics to use to help them gain comfort with trading our products for through the data stream that can be turned into yet more innovative proprietary products for us.","Alan Dean","And I think I\u2019ll add one more comment Rob, which I think I\u2019ve been most impressed with while the technology has been just terrific and really the gold standard in measuring and using volatility. The team that we\u2019ve been able to onboard led by the former CEO of Livevol, Catherine Clay and her team of programmers is just incredible and the on-boarding has gone smoothly, and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased to learn from that team and looking at things in a different way and its just -- its been just a terrific experience for us.","Rob Rutschow","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And then next question is a follow-up from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Hi, again. I figured I\u2019d come back on a Friday morning. Couple of cool follow-ups, so let me start with the first one. Just on the CurveGlobal again, I appreciate the color there, but is there any direct impact to CBOE on a commercial perspective that may be helping a little bit more even if this thing is not successful, i.e. are you lending any technology or charging for or maybe a more bigger picture, i.e. do you think you\u2019re going to meet new customer sets that might be cross-saled into your core markets. Anything there or is that not a consideration?","Edward Provost","Yes, look those are great questions I think. Certainly we\u2019ll explore every way that we can contribute to the platform, that\u2019s one of the reasons for equity alignment. We\u2019re bought into this venture and we want to see it succeed. So whether it\u2019s through new products, first and foremost that will be the case. Whether it\u2019s through technology that speaks to options, we certainly have that in spades in a lot of different parts of our business and so it looks for those things. At the same time we gained insight into the rates market and inside into the key participants and what motivates them, and we think that\u2019s very valuable know how and expertise that we\u2019ll be developing.","Edward Tilly","Alex and Provo, let me just add on to that. We spent a lot of time in Europe and quite frankly all around the globe, and as we\u2019ve begun to engage in products outside of our normal equity space, it\u2019s very important for us to make contacts and meet people who are expert in areas that we haven\u2019t historically been focused on. So we think CurveGlobal and the people that we talk to in Europe and around the globe relative to that investment will be people who\u2019ll add knowledge base to the CBOE and will allow us to develop our contacts much more broadly than we would, if we had not engaged in that partnership.","Alex Kramm","Great. Then maybe just secondly, since we\u2019re in follow-up territory here. On the VIX Weekly, I appreciate the color. Any other color you can give in terms of where you think you are in terms of people that are traditional VIX users that might be using Weekly\u2019s, that how many are signed up and how many are ready to go? And then, are you seeing any cannibalization at this point? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve talked about this? Sorry if you have.","Edward Tilly","No, we didn\u2019t add to that specifically. In the prepared remarks I mentioned that we see some of the same strategies being employed. And what I mean by that is, trading what has traditionally been up and down that vol curve, the time spreads for example. That same type of trade is already showing up in the Weekly\u2019s even with a limited amount of Weekly options on the market place. And we pointed out that we\u2019re expanding the offering and adding more Weekly futures and more Weekly options ultimately to have five Weekly options available. So it would not surprise us in the early stages to see a continuation of the strategies that we see in the month-to-month show up in the Weekly and that\u2019s just taking advantage of the slope and steepness of the time curve -- the volatility over time with much more precision because we\u2019re allowing a much, much shorter end of the volatility curve. But Ed, anything you want to add?","Edward Tilly","No, I think that\u2019s right on, Ed. Alex, its always you expect to see some cannibalization, but also some incremental volume, not necessarily new customers, but similar customers or the same customers engaged in strategies using Weekly\u2019s, whereas previously obviously they were limited to the month wise. And the rolling strategy is really as Ed pointed out the one that we\u2019re starting to see. So we\u2019re very confident a portion of that business is incremental, but it\u2019s always hard to answer a question like that with specificity, because we don\u2019t get transparency all the way down to the end-user.","Edward Provost","I want to point out Alex, the only choice of volatility trader had to trade a listed Weekly contract was to employ the VXX Weekly. So if there is cannibalization, the one we\u2019re targeting is certainly that VXX Weekly or even the pros who favor our VIX contract over VXX, the pure play. Had no other alternative other than to trade a VXX Weekly now with VIX Weekly\u2019s we were certainly offering and I think meeting the demand of some of those users who prefer the pure play VIX over an ETN VXX.","Alex Kramm","All right. Very good. Thanks a lot. Have a good weekend and hopefully to see some of you at FA in next week. Take care.","Edward Tilly","All right. You will.","Operator","Thank you. And next we have a follow-up from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Hey thanks for taking my follow-up. Just -- Alan, just one more on the RPC. You talked about 2016 and gave great color on the general dynamics. Just a little bit more narrow coming into the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the member mix that influence the RPC in the index options and the -- also the exchange traded products just the two buckets? And then, how volatility was elevated in the third quarter and whether that influenced RPC? I\u2019m just trying to get a handle of that as we come into fourth quarter with lower volatility?","Alan Dean","Okay. Well, there are -- did you talk about member mix was that \u2026?","Brian Bedell","Yes, member mix and then also the -- way within the index bucket only way \u2026","Alan Dean","Okay.","Brian Bedell","\u2026 the VIX moved around, I guess in the \u2026","Alan Dean","Okay. So there are different participants, pay different fees. And so if for instance, in -- and there is different discounts available for instance week cap customer fees and SPX, I think it\u2019s a 15,000 contracts per trade. There are things like that that could impact RPC and our index products. There is a similar type of cap in VIX, but usually the difference in RPC, the impact by market participants is minimal unless we happen to change fees. What it -- the volatility doesn\u2019t -- it is a force by itself doesn\u2019t impact our fees as much as the volume would impact RPC. So what I\u2019m thinking of specifically is VIX futures. In the third quarter we had big volume, we had a lot of movement, so that meant that there were more of VIX day traders in the futures trading. So taking advantage of the price movements intraday, they pay a much lower rate, they have a discounted fee. That would impact the revenue per contract and VIX futures. So in 2014, I\u2019m sorry, in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter with if volume is lower, I would expect RPC to tick up a little bit in VIX futures just further in that example I was talking about. But I don\u2019t -- it could be the other way as well. The big mover and RPC more than anything else is not participants, its fee changes.","Brian Bedell","Great. And then just on the exchange-traded product line, that\u2019s saw the best RPC increase in the third quarter versus the second. So just the dynamic coming into the fourth quarter and that\u2019s fair?","Alan Dean","Well, the -- it\u2019s related to the products that were being traded. So spiders within ETPs had big volume. Those fees are -- and the ETPs are little bit higher than the equity side and so they resulted in more volume, more revenue and -- in a higher RPC. If you look at our RPC and equities for example, in the last five quarters we had relatively low volume, but the highest transaction fees in the last five quarters in our press release you can see that chart in there. So it is very difficult to predict volume and to be -- to precisely predict revenue per contract. And that\u2019s why one of the reasons why we published that rolling three month average of our RPC each month. So that help you gain insight to what we\u2019re seeing.","Brian Bedell","Yes, that\u2019s great. And then just lastly on expenses for going out into 2016 and beyond on an annual expense base, if you could just reiterate how you see the annual expense growth for the firm?","Alan Dean","Sure. I\u2019d be glad to. So again no different than what we\u2019ve said in the past, we -- and I\u2019m speaking to specifically core expenses, not a volume related expenses. We -- our goal is to limit the growth in core expenses to an inflation like percentage, so 3% to 5% max. It might go over 3% if profitability is there. That might drive incentive compensation, but 3% to 5% year-over-year is our goal and it\u2019s our goal for 2016. We are right in the middle of the planning process for 2016 right now. So I can\u2019t -- I don\u2019t have any more clarity. We will -- of course we will give you guidance on our earnings call in February. And as I think about expenses for 2016, I would apply that percentage that 3% to 5% not to our current guidance that we\u2019re at right now, the 194 to 196, but instead to our original guidance of 195 to 199. I think that\u2019s how you should look at it and we will clarify it in February.","Brian Bedell","That\u2019s perfect. Great. Thanks for all that color.","Alan Dean","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And as there are no more questions at the present time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.","Deborah Koopman","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the conference over to Debbie Koopman. please go ahead.","Debbie Koopman","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Then, Brian Schell, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will provide an overview of our second quarter 2018 financial results and updated guidance for certain financial metrics.

We will be showing the slides and providing commentary on each. A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the investor relations portion of our website.","During our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements, which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold, and while we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties.

Also note that references made to the planned migration of the Cboe Options Exchange is subject to regulatory review. During the course of the call this morning, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ed Tilly.","Ed Tilly","Thank you, Debbie, and good morning and thank you for joining us today. Before jumping into our quarterly report, I\u2019ll touch on yesterday\u2019s announcement of our plans to transfer the primary listing of our company\u2019s stock on our own exchange on September 17, 2018 under our existing ticker symbol, \u201cCBOE.\u201d The move leverages the strengths of Cboe Global Markets and, as a leading equities market operator, it is a point of pride internally to exclusively list our stock on our own venue.","I\u2019m pleased now to report on a strong second quarter 2018 at Cboe Global Markets, where we increased our adjusted earnings per share by 21% year-over-year to $1.05, with net revenue of $284 million, which was up 6%. Additionally, as we announced earlier this week, our board increased our share repurchase authorization by $100 million and raised the third quarter cash dividend by 15%, to $0.31 per share. This marks the eighth consecutive year that our Board has raised our dividend and the second time this year we increased our share repurchase authorization, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flow generating capabilities of our business and our ongoing focus on efficiently allocating capital to create long-term shareholder value.","Turning now to volume in the second quarter and a look at the environment going forward. We continued to see notable success in our FX market, growing average daily notional value for the second quarter by 38% from the prior year. In addition, we saw healthy growth in our European Equities, driven primarily by stronger revenue capture. The major growth story for the quarter, of course, was the ongoing double-digit growth in SPX options.","Trading in SPX options, the most widely-traded index options complex in the world, increased 18% for the quarter. Together VIX and SPX form a powerful set of risk management tools for investors globally. As we\u2019ve said in the past, traders are becoming increasingly attuned to the unique properties of our products and use them opportunistically to hedge, generate alpha or simply take a position on the direction and volatility in the U.S. stock market.","Clearly, market conditions in the second quarter favored SPX options as a more cost effective way to hedge market exposure and to monetize market moves than VIX options on a relative basis. The choppy trading we saw in the weeks following February 5 continued into the second quarter. Daily close-to-close and intraday moves in the S&P 500 were, on average, two times greater than before February, and created opportunities for SPX option traders looking to monetize those price swings. At the same time, our VVIX Index \u2013 which reflects the cost of VIX options \u2013 continued to trade at historically elevated levels.","While market conditions were favorable for SPX trading in the second quarter, the lingering instability in the VIX futures term structure made it difficult for traders to consistently harvest the roll-down premium, measured by the difference between first-and second-month VIX futures prices. This premium is important because it generates returns for short volatility strategies using VIX futures and volatility-related ETPs.","As the VIX futures curve moved back and forth between upward-sloping and flat, the average roll-down premium was only about a third of what it was in 2017. Recently, though, we have seen a return to the stable, upward-sloping pattern that is more conducive to short volatility strategies. In July, the VIX futures curve was in contango every day, and the average roll-down premium recovered to just under 2017 levels.","With stock prices largely recovering from their February lows, and the ever-present threat of a global trade war, we are seeing growing demand for market hedges. Not only has SPX options volume remained solid, but in May and June, we began to see more large trades in VIX options, as the VIX Index trended below 15 for the first time since February and averaging just over 13 in July.","We\u2019ve said many times before that we expect market conditions to change, and we expect a shift in how traders use our products when markets move and opportunities change. We are confident that our SPX and VIX products offer a complementary set of trading tools to manage risk in any market environment.","I\u2019ll note here that, in the face of recent liquidity challenge in other global markets, we are particularly encouraged by growth in the displayed size in our proprietary SPX and VIX options, which in each of the past two months has exceeded every month in 2017. Since moving SPX options to our hybrid trading platform at the end of April, displayed size has increased significantly, and currently averages over 500 contracts.","With consistent volume growth, and now displayed size of $150 million notional value on average, our SPX option complex offers a robust set of trading tools for traders around the world, and continues to be the go-to market for hedging U.S. equities.","Regardless of market conditions, we remain laser focused on our commitments to product innovation, seamless trading solutions and leading-edge technology. I\u2019ll take a few moments here to provide an update on strategic initiatives.","As traders regroup on the volatility front and as we come out of a typically quieter summer trading season, we are gearing up to expand our Risk Management Conference program this fall with the addition of a mini-RMC to be held in Tel Aviv in November. Our Tel Aviv event will follow this year\u2019s annual RMC Europe in Ireland and will precede our annual RMC Asia in Hong Kong. We have seen strong trading and growing interest in VIX futures and options in the Israeli market and look forward to introducing RMC to the region. We will continue to use this one-day mini-RMC format based on customer demand and where we see strong potential to increase trading in our proprietary products around the globe.","We leveraged our product innovation expertise to tap into the growing corporate bond marketplace with the creation of Cboe iBoxx futures, which we plan to launch later this quarter, subject to regulatory review.","Cboe iBoxx futures are expected to allow market participants globally to efficiently participate in the $8.5 trillion U.S. corporate bond market and to hedge the corporate bond credit risk of ETFs or U.S. Treasury bonds with a standardized, centrally-cleared trading vehicle. We have received very positive customer feedback on this product, which will be the first exchange-listed futures product linked to a broad-based corporate bond index.","We are pleased to be working with BlackRock and Markit to take iBoxx futures from product concept to tradable reality. IBHY futures represent a significant first step for Cboe into the credit space, and we intend to further expand our presence in that space through ongoing collaboration with Markit.","We are also working diligently to prepare our business for a post-Brexit world. On July 3rd, we announced plans to establish a new venue in Amsterdam, which leaves us well positioned to continue to serve customers across Europe after the UK\u2019s planned exit from the European Union.","We believe the Netherlands is supportive of competitive and open financial market infrastructures, and Amsterdam is a well-known location for us given our ownership stake in pan-European clearinghouse EuroCCP, which is also based there. Additionally, we have longstanding, good relations with the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) and central bank, which we believe share a deep understanding of the equities and derivatives markets.","We will continue to operate our existing Recognised Investment Exchange in the UK, and our intention is to offer similar services in both the UK and EU venues. Mark Hemsley and team are working closely with our European customers, who are also busy executing Brexit plans, to ensure preparedness.","Turning now to the migration of Cboe exchanges onto Bats proprietary technology. We successfully completed our on-time migration of C2 Options Exchange on May 14th and are now fully engaged in our migration of Cboe Options Exchange, targeted for October 7, 2019.","The completion of the CFE and C2 migrations, and the introduction of several technical enhancements in preparation for the Cboe migration, leave us well on track to our ultimate goal of providing our customers with a common, world-class trading experience across all our equities, options and futures markets.","In closing, I would like thank our team for another strong quarter. We continued to lay the groundwork for future growth with our planned roll out of Cboe iBoxx futures, by expanding our global educational efforts and by advancing our technology integration. I look forward to all that we can accomplish to power the potential of our customers and shareholders in the coming months and quarters.","With that, I will now turn it over to Brian.","Brian Schell","Thanks Ed. And good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 2Q18 as compared to 2Q17 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results. As Ed already noted, we reported solid financial results for the quarter. In summary, our net revenue grew 6%, with net transaction fees up 5% and non-transaction revenue up 8%; adjusted operating expenses increased 5%, adjusted EBITDA of $188 million grew 5%. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 21% to $1.05.","The press release we issued this morning and our slide deck provide the key operating metrics on volume and revenue capture for each of our segments, as well as an overview of key revenue variances. Additional disclosures can also be found in our Form 10-Q filed this morning. At this point, I\u2019d like to briefly highlight some of the key drivers influencing our performance in each segment.","In our options segment, the 8% increase in net revenue was primarily driven by higher net transaction fees from our index options, which resulted from a 9% increase in revenue per contract, offset slightly by a 1% decrease in average daily volume. The increased RPC primarily reflects a shift in the mix of index products traded \u2013 with more coming from SPX options, as well as pricing changes implemented at the beginning of the year. While market share was down in our multiply-listed options business, this was more than offset primarily by higher RPC, as we attracted more profitable flow to our options market; as well as, higher industry volumes.","Turning to futures, the 13% decrease in net revenue resulted from a 16% decrease in ADV and a 7% decline in RPC \u2013 with the latter reflecting a shift in the volume mix towards participants qualifying for lower trading fees. To enhance revenue capture, we recently modified the fee schedule for VIX Futures, with changes effective August 1st.","Turning to U.S. Equities, net revenue grew 4%, primarily driven by higher market data revenues, which was up 8% in the second quarter, with SIP market data revenue up 4% and proprietary market data up 22%. The increase in SIP revenue was primarily due to audit recoveries. Looking at the growth in our proprietary market data revenue, the majority came from pricing changes implemented at the beginning of the year; however, about 20% of the increase this quarter came from subscription growth.","We expect continued growth in proprietary market data in 2018 as we benefit from pricing changes and customer response to our Cboe One product and, absent any additional audit recoveries, which are unpredictable, as well as any pricing changes, we expect downward pressure on SIP market data revenue due to industry consolidation.","Net revenue for European Equities increased 26% on a U.S. dollar basis, reflecting growth in both net transaction and non-transaction revenues, as well as strength of the pound sterling versus the U.S. dollar. On a local currency basis, net revenue increased a healthy 12%. Higher net transaction fees were the key growth driver, reflecting favorable net capture, despite a 2% decline in market volumes.","The higher capture resulted from strong periodic auctions volume, which has a higher relative net capture as well as price changes implemented January 1st. And given the better-than-expected response to our periodic auctions and assuming no significant mix shift, we do expect the capture rate for the second half of the year to be in line with the strong rate we reported for the second quarter. The increase in market data fees and access fees was primarily due to price changes implemented on January 1st.","Net revenue for Global FX grew 33% this quarter, with revenue nearly matching our record first quarter. While second quarter volumes declined modestly versus the first quarter, it grew 38% year-over-year and our market share remained strong at 14.9%. While growth in the overall FX spot market has been favorable, we continue to believe our market share is the result of our ongoing technology enhancements as well as more effective liquidity provisioning.","Turning to expenses, total adjusted operating expenses were $106 million for the quarter, up 5% compared with last year\u2019s second quarter. The key expense variance was in compensation and benefits, resulting from 1) higher salaries, primarily a result of annual salary adjustments and lower capitalization of wages relating to software development; and 2) higher incentive compensation, which is aligned with our year-to-date financial performance and differences in the timing of expense recognition versus last year as we harmonized bonus programs under the combined company.","As we pointed out on our last earnings call, there are several incremental expenses impacting our year-over-year comparability, such as expenses associated with the Silexx acquisition, the increased strength of the pound sterling and the gross-up of OPRA-related expenses. In total, these items accounted for about $3.5 million in incremental expenses this quarter, with the currency impact being the largest. If you also adjust for those items, expenses would be up about 1%. We are reconfirming our full-year expense guidance to be in the range of $420 million to $428 million. For the second quarter, we realized $4.2 million in pre-tax expense synergies, primarily from compensation and benefits, bringing year-to-date expense synergies to $7.2 million.","Turning to income taxes, our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was approximately 29%, above the high end of our annual guidance range of 26.5% to 28.5%, but in line with guidance we provided on our last earnings call. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the second quarter of 2017 was 36.2%. The decline primarily reflects the favorable impact of corporate tax reform. We are reaffirming that we expect the annual effective tax rate on adjusted earnings to be in a range of 26.5% to 28.5% for 2018, with the tax rate for the third and fourth quarters expected to be at the higher end, but within our guidance range.","In addition, we are lowering our guidance for CapEx and for depreciation and amortization. We now expect CapEx to be $35 million to $40 million versus our previous guidance of $45 million to $50 million. This change reflects more efficient technology spending and lower software development capitalization. We are also lowering our guidance for depreciation and amortization to $43 million to $48 million, versus our previous guidance of $53 million to $58 million, reflecting, in part, the lower CapEx.","Moving to capital allocation, our strong financial results, cash flow generation and financial position enabled us to reprioritize our capital deployment this quarter in favor of share repurchases, while also investing in the growth of business and making dividend payments. We returned nearly $79 million to our shareholders this quarter through more than $48 million of share repurchases of our common stock and $31 million of dividends.","In addition, as Ed mentioned, our Board increased our share repurchase authorization by $100 million and raised our third quarter cash dividend by 15% to $0.31 per share, underscoring our unwavering commitment to enhancing value for our shareholders \u2013 in part by returning capital directly to them.","Year-to-date through July 31st, we have repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of Cboe common stock for nearly $122 million. We ended the quarter with adjusted cash and investments of $116 million with our leverage ratio \u2013 and our leverage ratio was unchanged from last quarter at 1.6 times.","In summary, Cboe delivered solid quarterly results and continued to demonstrate our focus on growing our proprietary index products, as we prepare to expand into a new asset class by launching the first broad-based U.S. corporate bond index futures, growth in a diverse set of revenue streams, disciplined expense management, leveraging the scale of our business, producing higher profit margins, an integration plan on track, and ongoing focus on capital allocation by continuing to return capital to shareholders though quarterly dividends and share repurchases and even raising the quarterly dividend.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Debbie, for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Debbie Koopman","Thanks, Brian. At this point, we would be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits, we\u2019ll take a second question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And this morning, first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Rich Repetto","Yes. Good morning, guys. I guess the first question is what is on everybody\u2019s mind, but can you give us comfort that the volume slowdown, I guess, in July, is seasonal or cyclical rather than anything that\u2019s more permanent? And I guess how do you \u2013 can you give us any anecdotal what you\u2019re hearing from clients et cetera, because we\u2019re seeing this across the board, I guess the low volumes?","Ed Tilly","Yes, Rich. Thanks. It\u2019s Ed, and good morning. Thanks for the question. We have seen across the board, I think for us and what we\u2019re hearing from the marketplace and feedback is the strategies that have been employed over the last couple of years and this really gets to, Rich, probably a second part that you\u2019re thinking how much of this is just the major market in cyclical and how much of this is actually structural in the marketplace. I\u2019d point out a bright spot right out of the gate and SPX continues to really draw the attention of those hedgers and those who are looking for position in the U.S. market.","So, if we kind of keep SPX to the side and just talk about volumes in general, I think what we\u2019re expecting in this market is a return to a lot of the strategies that were present prior to February 5. And what do I mean by that? We purposely showed you roll-down strategies in premium harvesting that have just basically gone away and are now with the structure, in the VIX terms structure coming back. I would expect to see those trades coming back into our marketplace showing off in VIX options and VIX Futures. I can\u2019t guarantee it, but the market is setting up for the reemployment of those cyclical strategies that are really coming to market when we have a term structure, a risk profile that our customers are used to seeing.","So, I would expect in this market condition to see a return on that. As for the market in general, we\u2019ve seen some shifting in volume. We\u2019ve seen some pretty good uptake in multi-list options. I think that shows where the retail heart is, basic option strategies that perform well in any marketplace. Retailers going back to the basics with pure and simple override strategies. So while we can\u2019t predict exactly what will happen in the months to come, the way the market is setting up is favorable to trades that we have seen in the past. So again, impossible for us to predict volumes going forward. We\u2019ve never been good at it, but we will tell you that this \u2013 the structure of the marketplace is setting up for a continuation or further \u2013 some of the strategies that we\u2019ve seen in the past. Chris, anything to add?","Chris Concannon","No. Just I think the SPX growth that we\u2019ve seen year-over-year in the quarter and then year-over-year even in July is reflective of the liquidity in the SPX and some of that is related to the re-platforming to hybrid. So, I think it\u2019s important to point out that we have made structural changes to the product and we\u2019re really feeling the benefit of those structural changes.","Ed Tilly","And I think those changes cause to your point; it really shows up in that liquidity. And so when there is a need to employ the strategies, various strategies, the liquidity is in the marketplace, it\u2019s certainly in SPX, to Chris\u2019 point, and we see it also in VIX options. So, there is liquidity ready and when there is the demand coming from the customers, we\u2019re confident that our market will be able to satisfy those needs.","Rich Repetto","Thank you. I know Chris is working on his volume generation machine. You\u2019ve got to get that cranked up as well.","Ed Tilly","Yes. If he can make it so, he would, Rich.","Rich Repetto","Thank you.","Chris Concannon","It\u2019s working in FX, Rich.","Rich Repetto","Definitely.","Operator","Yes, thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi, thank you for taking the question, and I apologize for the background noise. You\u2019ve pursued a number of pricing changes this quarter, and I guess you are always producing \u2013 pursuing pricing changes. But you changed prices for permanent holders in VIX. I apologize if I missed it, what\u2019s the impact do you see on RPC there? And in the past, I think you said that VIX was working well and you didn\u2019t want to muck with the pricing. Why is now the right time to make changes there? And then you made changes in core in disaster recovery fees. As you think about the pricing power you have in connectivity and data, and given the press activity levels broadly, what are your thoughts on now being the right time to be more aggressive on pricing there? Thank you.","Brian Schell","So, Ken, it\u2019s Brian. The first part is obviously, we can\u2019t give a prediction on the pricing, where that will look. I think what we talked about as far as the second quarter reflects were a couple of things as far as the dynamics of a lower RPC during the quarter with seeing some of the block trading volume going away, somewhat related to some of the ETPs that were associated with some of that volume in the VIX Futures market, which without that can generate a lower capture of what we\u2019ll see. And we also saw with some of the volume mix we saw some of those more significant players, who were actually qualified at the lower tier. So that was the mix.","The overall change absent some of that, we would expect to see an increase to recall that some level of baseline up from where we saw obviously in the last quarter. But absent some of the other mix changes that I\u2019ve previously referenced, I wouldn\u2019t set the expectation that we\u2019ll be back to where we were, say, 2Q of last year when we had that different mix of client volumes.","Chris Concannon","And Ken, it\u2019s Chris. I\u2019ll just add, we have been looking to change the VIX pricing \u2013 VIX Futures pricing. We looked originally to change it at the beginning of the year with some of our other annual pricing adjustments. We chose to delay that, because we were migrating the VIX platform on COC. We wanted to look at the behavioral changes post that migration and what we saw was quite attractive for a pricing adjustment. So this pricing adjustment is, I would say, long overdue. It was really to eliminate the day-trader rebate that we had that would create some of the mix from quarter-to-quarter. So this should create a much more stable RPC, a much more attractive RPC overtime.","And more importantly, it \u2013 we paused because of that migration and now we\u2019re happy with the results of that migration. With regard to your question around what I call non-transaction revenue, we have a very healthy balance with our clients to not overcharge, but continue to grow that business \u2013 that area of our business, where we charge for access, we charge for data, and we charge for connectivity. So it\u2019s a careful balance that we have. Certainly, our proprietary market data continues to outperform in terms of growth, new clients, new subscriptions and that\u2019s the best way to grow that revenue is really adding new clients. And so we\u2019re very excited about that.","John Deters ","Ken, this is John. I\u2019d definitely look at Page 31 when we break out that mix that Chris was talking about in terms of our segments and for the segment that has kind of the greatest volume headwinds of Futures segment, really mark non-transaction revenue with more opportunity than it is risk.","Ken Worthington","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Actually, thanks for the segue just there, because I \u2013 the one thing I wanted to ask about is actually on Page 31. Maybe to small number to do harp on, but in the Futures segment, I did notice that the exchange services and other fees, which are only $1.7 million, but they were down 50% quarter-over-quarter. So, when I look at that number and I look at what\u2019s going on in your VIX franchise, it looks like some clients are massively paying you less for something, which is quite connectivity or whatever. So maybe, if you just flush it out a little bit and maybe, in particular, say, what client types of scene pull back in that area, because, obviously, that\u2019s something that people has been wondering about for a while. Thank you. ","Brian Schell","So, Alex, it\u2019s Brian. So, I think that to Chris, it\u2019s kind of a \u2013 it is a nice segue from Chris\u2019s earlier point about. We look at different parts of the business collectively to look at non-transaction fees and as we\u2019ve looked in a shifting of the new technologies implemented and the services we provide and with the underlying Bats technology, some of that non-transaction revenue may fall in the different buckets of where we\u2019d categorize it from just kind of a pure accounting standpoint. So in a way, we look at access fees and exchange services and other fees very collectively.","So I wouldn\u2019t get too focused on the differentiation of growth from one category to another. So, this is really of how we ended up implementing some of the tech and how we charge for it kind of falling into the different bucket, shifting more into the access fees and how we deliver that value. If you look at the stats and look at the capacity that our clients now have on the CFE platform and the speed, and what they\u2019re able to do, some of that is reflective in those services. So that\u2019s showing up more in access fees versus a decline of people running away from exchange services and other fees.","Chris Concannon","You really just need to look at that page and add together at least the two access fees and exchange services, I even add together market data fees to point out again that there\u2019s more opportunity than risk in these items for CFE.","Alex Kramm","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citi.","Ben Herbert","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate a lot of the discussion around mix in VIX Futures complex, but I just wanted to go back to there was a slide last quarter on CFE new user accounts, and if you could just kind of give us some update around growth there quarter-over-quarter and then anything you\u2019re seeing there?","Chris Concannon","Thanks. It\u2019s Chris, I\u2019ll take this. Obviously, we\u2019ve focused on the user accounts, really the active user accounts in and around our migration. The most important thing we were studying was making sure that the story continued from the active users prior to migration and active users post-migration. So that\u2019s why \u2013 that was the story that we were trying to convey in the last quarter, because it was strictly around the CFE migration. We also looked at our activity on the C2 migration and the mix certainly was successful in the migration of C2. So that it was really more focused around the immigration and continuing the activity around that migration.","Ed Tilly","I think Chris, to your point, bringing that up was very important. We had a lot of CFE users, who had never written to Bats tech different than C2. So, very important and mindful of that number as for the first time, some of those customers were writing to and using Bats tech.","Ben Herbert","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays.","Jeremy Campbell","Hey, thanks. Just back to VIX, I guess for a second here. And we've talked that in all of them, about a lot of the issues happened in February. but if we kind of put some of the structural issues around ETPs and the shape of the curve aside, where there\u2019s kind of visibility in volumes, I guess, how do you think about the secular demand for your VIX products that will kind of move volumes higher? And where do you think \u2013 where do you see that next level of kind of incremental demand coming from? Is it global users? Retail adoption now that ETP has been delevered a little bit or something else? How are you thinking about that?","Ed Tilly","Well, it\u2019s a great question. I think what we\u2019ll see in these marketplaces, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s, we\u2019re setting up and have begun to see, if you remember, the $0.50 premium option hedging strategy that was really, really, common for us last year. Those trades are coming back into the marketplace, where \u2013 and I reference VVIX is a really good look for you all into the relative price of hedging with VIX versus a SKU, which might give you a pretty good look of the relative cost of hedging with SPX. We see the VVIX lining up and then we\u2019ve seen the 50,000 lot trader come back into the marketplace.","What still missing is that million contract trade that we saw at the end of last year and into and up to February. The market\u2019s setting up for that trade as well. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll come back, but I would anticipate in this market environment that the structure is perfect for those strategies. And as you know, there are tagalong or copycat strategies that go along with the 50,000 lot trade and a smaller version of the million contract hedge for the unknown unknowns. So, I expect to see that volume either come back and then grow as a result.","As for structurally in retail, what we\u2019re noticing with a really simple strategy and that rolled down, I\u2019ll go back to that roll-down premium and how that\u2019s changed, really easy to take a position that you collect money, that roll-down collection and inverse ETPs, that was really simple. The ETP that won\u2019t be named that went away and then the delevered S60 [ph], it was really a buy, forget and take advantage of the roll down. What we\u2019re noticing is the most sophisticated ETP traders, that retail customer base showing up and shorting VXX. It\u2019s the same position and collection opportunity in the roll down is being wrongly inverted.","So, as the user is looking to employ the same strategies that were very successful in a normal volatility structure that you pointed out, that pivot in the VXX is the same exposure to roll down and we\u2019ve seen the short interest in VXX grow. So that\u2019s our answer. It takes education and persistence and we\u2019re best at what out there doing, but we need a marketplace that\u2019s something to point to and we\u2019re finally coming into the market, where we can go back to the street and say, \u201chey, this is pretty familiar. It\u2019s what you are used to.\u201d And from there, I think, I would expect to see some of those strategies coming back.","John Deters","I think \u2013 this is John, to the point of secular shift, this is the way to think about our \u2013 this premium captured that Ed was talking about. It\u2019s an insurance marketplace. So, you\u2019ve got insurers, who are buying insurance and you\u2019ve got insurance writers, and we had a hurricane event in February and Ed used the word regroup earlier in the prepared remarks. And you\u2019ve got always after an event like that, there\u2019s a regrouping, where the insurance writers assess their participation in the marketplace, the insurer reads, asses their needs for insurance, but the risk, the volatility risk that our traders hedge in our marketplace, that is a constant. There\u2019s nothing secular about that and we\u2019ve got every confidence that when people do go through the regrouping process, the needs that we provide in the marketplace exclusively will really resonate.","Jeremy Campbell","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","Hi. Thanks guys. Brian, maybe starting to some of the guidance you gave, two maybe clarifications. So, first, just on the market data. You mentioned the SIP will be likely trending lower, but proprietary, you\u2019re still seeing growth. I guess, just on a net basis, do you still see some growth in that overall business? And then on the expense guidance, you guys kept the same, but depreciation and amortization was slower. So I just wanted to understand sort of what was the offset to that and if we do remain in a kind of a muted volume backdrop, do you have some flexibility, I guess, particularly on the comp, just given that we saw some increase there.","Brian Schell","All right. Good question. So, let\u2019s talk about the market data first. So, the big unknown, obviously, with the SIP is \u2013 are there \u2013 what\u2019s been somewhat of a variance has been in the auto recovers that have, like I said earlier in the comments that they are somewhat unpredictable. But overall, we\u2019d still be optimistic about that growth just given the success of the proprietary and that\u2019s actually been kind of outpacing, obviously, outpacing on a percentage basis in the overall dollar contribution on the quarter.","Our year- over-year basis for each quarter has been actually helping to carry that category, even though the SIP revenues may be flattish and given where they are. So, we still remain optimistic given the both subscriptions, flash user growth and the pricing changes that have been implemented. So, we still see the growth there. We\u2019re still optimistic and that really hasn\u2019t changed. Any variance on the upside has been the audit recoveries and certainly that we\u2019ve seen so far in 2018.","On the expense guidance, and again, the proprietary, like I said, is with that 22% growth rate we had, that\u2019s been the trend the last several quarters. So like I said, we continue to be excited about the work that we\u2019re doing there as that expands geographically and across other asset classes.","On the expense side, a couple of dynamics that are going on there. With respect to the comp, if volumes, say, for example, in that scenario, talked about our muted, they don\u2019t necessarily grow to the level of expectations, one of the self-correcting mechanisms we have within comp is the bonus element, which a lot of times is based on expectations at the beginning of the year of how we're going to do and various measures with respect to revenue growth or earnings growth. And as that becomes potentially more muted, that amount will fall.","And so that accrual will be less and actually may even reverse itself. So you will see some \u2013 you would see some contraction in that number. The other thing that's actually potentially driving it up a little bit is the capitalized wages that I mentioned earlier is \u2013 the technology team on the upside is as if they are doing a very good job from an efficiency standpoint of spending less dollars from a cash flow standpoint. But some that goes into how they're actually capitalizing and how we look at, they're actually capitalizing less wages than they did last year. So it has a slightly negative GAAP impact, but it shows up, obviously, in a slightly higher expense. But net-net, as far as overall results, it ends up being a more efficient cash flow spend. So that's maybe elevating that a little bit more than what you might have expected as well.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. Maybe just to go back to the set up that you talked about, Ed, in terms of the increasing usage of short- vol strategies. We are seeing a little bit of pickup in VIX futures just in the last few days. But if you can talk about maybe the interplay between the SPX options complex and the VIX options complex and whether all of the RPC increase in the second quarter versus the first quarter was due to the premium RPC on the SPX. And then I guess, as we move forward into this quarter, to the extent people embrace VIX options more, will we see a substitution effect back to the VIX options? Or do you think \u2013 a lot of things you talked about, Chris, with the SPX options, do you think that would be independent and we could see an environment where we could see an improvement in SPX options volumes this quarter in conjunction with increasing usage of the short-vol strategies?","Ed Tilly","So, let me try to maybe ask it one other way and see if I'm capturing your intention. I'll ask Brian to speak to specifically the mix and how we benefited from a pivot on some of the S&P 500 hedging moving into SPX and the difference there. But I think if I can maybe make it \u2013 what I'm hearing is, if we see a change to the normal-term structure, does all of the increased volume we see in SPX, does that just go back into VIX and the entire complex just remain flat? Is that kind of a simple way\u2026","Brian Bedell","Yes. It's a two-part question. It's one on the durability of the short- vol strategies and then yes, exactly what you just said on \u2013 in terms of that mix.","Ed Tilly","Good. So I do expect some movement. If you're hedging the S&P 500 today with SPX and you've not gone into VIX basically because VIX call options are historically at a higher level than they have been, so you need to hedge your 500 and you've gone into the SPX, I think we will see some shift back into VIX. But what is completely missing \u2013 so it is just the opinion on volatility and the strategies around vol, those come back and they don't come from typical SPX users. That is an opinion on the term structure. There is a trade up and down the term structure that just goes away when it's flat.","So there are those strategies that are now sidelined or have been on the sideline, and that is taking a position in the difference between a front month that might be 13 and that month that's trending to the average trending to the average of roughly 17.5. So all of that trade is not dependent on the 500. That this \u2013 those are rolled down in premium harvesting strategies found in the term structure, found in option positions in the VIX complex. So there are strategies that are just not in the market today. So I hope that gives you a little look in what \u2013 and the $0.50 is a great example of that, right? And so is the $1 million contract trade that is using volatility to express \u2013 to take an expression in a look forward in vol. As for the mix shift in the benefits, Brian, I think maybe you can take the second part of the question.","Brian Schell","Yes. And that may have been whether \u2013 I think when people looked at the results and the kind of the growth in the Options segment, while some of the index options volume was somewhat muted from a year-over- year contract growth rate, you saw the RPC increase 9%, largely reflecting \u2013 and all this will become a high level of numbers. If you think about the \u2013 just the pure VIX, SPX mix of going 60% SPX and VIX being roughly 40% from a year ago period to this period of more of a 70-30 mix, SPX to VIX, you'll see that 9% improvement or roughly a $0.06 improvement on a rate per contract. So you can see how just that pure mix shift was very favorable, obviously, to the top line and bottom line results as well I think it can be very powerful from that extent despite the, we'll call it, more of the flattish volume on a year-over-year basis.","Brian Bedell","Great. Yes, that\u2019s perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Thanks. Hey, good morning, guys. Question for you around the multi-listed options business. So it looks like the volume there really kind of buck into trend year-over-year if you kind of look at third quarter results so far. Any sense what's driving that? Is it retail or is it something else? And then maybe hit on the Cboe Bats combined market share is still slipping, in particular, on the Cboe side. What's driving that?","Chris Concannon","Great, question. Really in the multi-list we\u2019ve been very excited about seeing the overall market grow for the first time in a number of years. And it's really driven by retail demand, retail stepping back into options and the use of options, even in this environment. That's impressive to see given global volume challenges that we're seeing in other markets. So we're excited about multi-list. We made a capture decision at the beginning of 2018 around our various markets. Obviously, we have four of them all offering very different products to our clients. That capture did impact our market share relative to the market.","But overall, I'm very happy with the outcome of adjusting capture up to the detriment of market share. And we're very comfortable with our position going forward. And obviously, we have one major migration left. That's our C1 platform. We're excited about what the performance of C2 and EDGX because it's carrying many of the different features and functionalities. So we continue to be excited around our market share and our capture prior to our migration in 2019. ","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","OCC is under investigation by a few regulatory agencies. I wonder if you guys could comment as to whether there's any potential negative implications for Cboe?","Ed Tilly","We obviously, as is on the board of OCC, we're not going to comment on any speculation around investigations from a regulator, just in general. So until there's actually print from a regulator, we'll have no opinion on articles written in speculation around OCC.","Brian Schell","And I'll just add. I think it's important, we just recently saw an SEC approval of an OCC clearing fund filing, which is an important indicator that the SEC has recognized how the formula works. And there is a reduction \u2013 an expected reduction in the clearing fund going forward. That is beneficial to all of our products, our multi-list products as well as our proprietary products.","Chris Harris","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good morning. Sorry if I missed this, but just a question on moving your listing from NASDAQ to your own exchange. I think Bats previously targeted entering the corporate listing space at one point, but then shelved those ambitions and focused on ETP listings. Should we be correct in thinking that Cboe Global Markets isn't the only corporate listing you'd expect to eventually list on your exchange? And maybe just some updated thoughts on strategy. Thanks.","A - Chris Concannon","No, it's great question. Look, we've been highly focused on the ETP listing market. We think our opportunity to continue to grow that market and continue the success we've had in listing ETPs we now count some of the largest issuers of ETPs across our market. We just recently added First Trust, one of the larger ETP issuers. So we're excited about the ETP listing business being listed on both Cboe\u2019s exchange as well as NASDAQ isn\u2019t the way we wanted to sell our ETP listings to our favorite issuers. We wanted to reflect our belief in our ability to be a primary listing by switching our listing to be primary with Cboe Exchange. As we look at the lack of success that IEX has had in the corporate listing area, we would expect a very challenging business opportunity in corporate listings. We don\u2019t sit here very excited about corporate listings, and all of our focus is on ETP listings and the success, just the continued success we can have there.","Ed Tilly","But we\u2019re happy to list NASDAQ if they\u2019d like us.","Chris Concannon","True.","Brian Schell","Hope that answers your question?","Kyle Voigt","Okay. Yes, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy","Hey, good morning. Can you speak to the feedback you\u2019ve received from market participants on your planned corporate bond index futures contract? And on a somewhat related note, whether you have plans to build a presence from the credit space or whether your plans to build a presence in the credit space extend to play a role in the cash credit market?","Chris Concannon","Great question, because you brought up our \u2013 one of our favorite recent products, the iBoxx futures \u2013 iBoxx iShares futures product. The feedback we\u2019ve gotten since the announcement has been exceptional. It\u2019s the first time that Cboe is talking to some of the credit funds in the market. So it\u2019s a very exciting conversation for us. The demand has been quite high from, not only the end users finding some benefit to the product, but also our bank partners seeing a great opportunity in having a cleared corporate bond of index futures.","So overall, we also \u2013 the other benefit that we\u2019ve seen and demand we\u2019ve seen is proprietary market makers that are making markets in the iBoxx ETFs are excited about having a hedging instrument in the futures market as well. And these are really the identical players that are in our VIX futures and in the VIX ETPs. So we know them quite well, and they see it as a huge benefit. John, do you want to add anything?","John Deters","Yes, yes. Thanks, Chris. Patrick, I think this is a \u2013 I\u2019m glad you asked about it, because it\u2019s an interesting one for us. It\u2019s been inspiring for the team, for the product development team to receive the feedback they have. I think it\u2019s different and contrast quite markedly from our ETP futures launch, where the word spread largely through a press-driven process. Here, word is really spread by word-of-mouth. It\u2019s almost been viral in its distribution in terms of how people learned about it because this is \u2013 there hadn\u2019t been a lot of pickup in the press.","And it\u2019s, I think, because we\u2019ve created a very elegant structure that taps into the ETP ecosystem, and we\u2019re catering to a massive underserved credit market. And so I think we\u2019ve tapped into something really special with this product design. And we look forward to launching it this summer. We\u2019re right on track with development. As we said during our announcement, we expect a summer launch.","Chris Concannon","I\u2019ll just add Our partners have been exceptional in this launch, both market as well as iShares, BlackRock. They\u2019re excited about the product. They\u2019re side by side with us reaching out to the clients. Their distribution network is quite impressive, and certainly, our early days of discussion through their distribution network and the skill set of their sales force is quite helpful. So we\u2019re excited about the partnership, we\u2019re excited about the product and we\u2019re very excited about stepping into this space, this credit space that today, we haven\u2019t really dabbled in, in a big way.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Brian Bedell.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks very much. Maybe, just moving to the stock buyback, just looking at your evaluation, it\u2019s the cheapest I\u2019ve seen in almost ever. It looks like about two standard deviations below it\u2019s average on a relative PE basis, say, with S&P, certainly, the peers. Maybe, if you can just talk, Brian, about the capacity to accelerate the pace of the buyback into that $225 million remaining authorization and particularly, if you think the volume story on the VIX and the index side might actually improve in the near-term?","Brian Schell","Yes. So, on the buyback, I think we\u2019ve been very clear certainly reflective of the first quarter and second quarter as well as dialogue conversations we have with our board as far as their point of view. We do think that the share repurchase is a very good opportunity to deploy capital, certainly at these levels. So absent anything else or something that we\u2019d expect, we continue to see that trend continue. I will say though that \u2013 and we\u2019ve been, from a kind of leverage standpoint, as far as with the aggressiveness and accelerating it, we\u2019ve obviously done it with, obviously, cash on hand that we \u2013 as we\u2019ve been able to grow it and cash flow from operations.","So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any expectations unless you\u2019d see something differently that we\u2019d go out and borrow, significantly increasing our leverage to be able to do that, all else being equal. But like I said, we\u2019ve said and consistent with what we\u2019ve said and what you\u2019ve seen also in the first couple of quarters is that this is a good place to deploy the capital. And certainly at this level, that would be no change.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point.","Chris Allen","Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask on some recent SEC actions on July 31, they issued a stay against the fee changes proposed by the consolidated tape. And this, I think, follows June when they pushed back on a fee increase request, asking for more information. So I was wondering how you\u2019re thinking about \u2013 your view on how the SEC\u2019s thinking about market data fees. Is that factored into how you\u2019re thinking about SIP data moving forward? And is there any impact for proprietary data fees as well?","Chris Concannon","Chris, it\u2019s Chris. I\u2019ll answer that. Really, as we think about it, first, we look at our proprietary market data and continue to see organic growth there. That\u2019s the result of zero fee adjustments. So we\u2019re excited that our fees set a while ago, which is an aggressive fee, much lower than the competition continues to attract new users and new subscribers, not only here in the U.S., but obviously, internationally as well. So when we think about our growth prospects in market data, we first look at the proprietary and really think about the proprietary market data across all of our platforms, both futures, options, European and FX.","Really, with regard to the SEC and their activity around the SIP, there continues to be discussions around the prior rule filing that is being discussed with the SEC on the SIP. The recent action around the CTA, it\u2019s really around an interpretation around an interpretation, kind of in the weeds interpretation of the CTA and how you interpret around display and non-display functions in the CTA plan.","So I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t look at the CTA and the SIP as being a huge growth engine for market data. We certainly see them as flat to down over time. And all of our focus is on the proprietary data side. But really, the stress is the proprietary data from all of our platforms across all the various asset classes. We continue to see healthy growth across all those platforms. But back to the SEC discussion, I think those discussions will continue to play out. But again, the recent action on the CTA is really around an interpretation on how to treat certain platforms that distribute the CTA market data.","Chris Allen","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And as that was the last question, I would like to return the floor to Debbie Koopman for any closing comments.","Debbie Koopman","Thank you, Keith.

Please.","Deborah L. Koopman","Good morning. And thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. And thank you for your patience. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our CEO, will provide an update on our strategic initiatives for 2014, and Alan Dean, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will review our second quarter 2014 financial results.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise after this conference call.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Ed Tilly.","Edward T. Tilly","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Trading activity in the second quarter reflected low market volatility and investor complacency. Overall volume in options and futures at CBOE Holdings averaged 4.8 million contracts per day, down 14%from the first quarter and 3% from the second quarter of 2013. Despite the low-volume trading environment, CBOE posted solid financial results and continued to deliver long-term value to our stockholders and market participants.","We raised our quarterly dividend, increased our share repurchase authorization and continued to advance our strategic growth initiatives so that CBOE is well positioned to benefit as market conditions improve over time. So now an update on our strategic initiatives for 2014: leveraging and developing proprietary products, broadening our customer base and optimizing revenue in commoditized products while maintaining the highest standards in market regulation.","Turning first to trading in our SPX and VIX product lines. Second quarter average daily volume across our SPX complex was down 11% sequentially and 13% from the second quarter in 2013. ADV in SPX Weeklys, the fastest growing product in that complex, was down 11% from the previous quarter, but up 20% from the second quarter last year. VIX options volume declined 21% from the previous record-breaking quarter, but rose 11% year-over-year.","Average daily volume in VIX futures was off 19% from the previous quarter, also a record, and 8% from last year. Low volatility throughout the quarter obviously dampened trading in both SPX and VIX products, but we don\u2019t extrapolate when volume is driven by extraordinarily low or high volatility, nor do these temporary fluctuations inform our strategy. We remain focused on our long-term growth trajectory.","The longer view shows that year-to-date through June, trading on our SPX complex is down just 3% and trading in SPX Weeklys is up 38% from last year\u2019s record volume. Year-to-date through June, VIX options trading is up 17% and VIX futures are up 10% over last year\u2019s record pace.","In the first quarter, when the VIX Index was relatively low, but not extremely so, we continued to see double-digit growth. And in July, which included days when VIX spiked, VIX options volume increased 15% and VIX futures rose 48% from the previous year. This is more in line with the growth that we experienced over the last few years and more of what we would expect going forward.","While current levels of the CBOE Volatility Index tell us the market doesn\u2019t expect much risk over the next 30-days, there is far less certainty looking out beyond that 30-day period. It\u2019s important to remember that the VIX Index is not simply a measuring stick for risk, but rather represents the cost that investors are willing to pay to hedge that risk, through SPX options.","As we look at VIX futures prices over the next three to six months, we see the market expecting a return to more normal levels of volatility. And, as VIX returns to its historical norms, we expect to see even greater participation in VIX futures and options trading. Some firms, such as Blackrock and others are already advising clients to use VIX futures and options in order to hedge against or profit from potentially rising volatility.","In the meantime, we continue to grow the VIX customer base by leveraging our educational expertise. While second quarter trading conditions were less than stellar, educational opportunities abounded. When volatility is at extremes, be it extremely high or low, media and marketplace attention becomes hyper-focused on VIX, its level, what it means, and why it matters. It is an extraordinary opportunity for CBOE when virtually every financial network, publication and twitter stream is dominated by VIX news and commentary.","During such times, the world turns to CBOE for context and meaning. As the go-to place for all things related to VIX, CBOE is uniquely positioned to effectively leverage every opportunity to highlight our products and connect with investors through thought leadership, educational tools and trading resources, and a robust social media platform that increasingly drives the discussion around volatility and our VIX products.","CBOE\u2019s ability to effectively communicate in and with the marketplace is integral to our ability to develop and nurture new product lines. Looking back on the early decades of equity and index options trading, we see that growth in our user base was gaining steam amidst slower trading periods, as investors paused and digested new information about the markets and our products, eventually returning to the market in greater numbers.","Four indicators lead us to believe that VIX trading is similarly poised for renewed growth. First, the demand for VIX futures market data has increased dramatically over the last six months, meaning more firms are positioning to trade VIX futures and to enter the market in a more meaningful way when volatility returns to the marketplace.","Second, the mix of market participants continues to shift from banks and traditional floor-based market makers to include proprietary trading firms and CTAs, which tend to view VIX futures as a trading vehicle rather than as a part of an equity derivatives book. This approach tends to generate significantly more volume, particularly in more active markets.","Third, despite low levels of volatility, the number of new Trading Permit Holders at CFE continues to increase, portending even greater interest and use of VIX futures going forward. Finally, we are already seeing increased participation and trading opportunities provided by 24-hour trading in VIX futures, which we expect to fuel even further growth as volatility levels revert to historic norms.","We are very encouraged by the early response to our Extended Trading Hours initiative in VIX futures. As you may recall, we lengthened the VIX futures trading day by 5-hours and 45-minutes late in 2013 to accommodate the demand for additional trading time domestically, and to enable European-based customers to access trading in their local trading hours. Subsequently, an average of 7.7% of VIX futures trading took place in non-U.S. trading hours. On days, when overseas events triggered volatility, volume in that period rose as high as 15%.","In June, we further extended VIX futures trading to nearly 24-hours to accommodate trading in Asian market, as well as a growing worldwide user base. In July, our first full month of 24-hour trading, 10.2% of all VIX futures trading took place outside of U.S. trading hours. And, when global events triggered higher volatility, volume in non-U.S. trading hours rose to 20.7%. Year-to-date through July, average daily volume in non-U.S. trading hours rose to 8.1%, from 7.7%through June. ","We are also encouraged to see that trading in the new timeframe is coming from a good mix of customer participation early on, both domestically and internationally, indicating that a broad and diversified user base is accessing VIX futures during extended trading hours. We look forward to launching extended trading hours for SPX and VIX options later this year.","The new extended trading hour sessions for those products is planned to run from 2:00 a.m. to 8:15 a.m. central time, Monday through Friday. The target start date is the fourth quarter of 2014, pending SEC approval and completion of necessary systems enhancements. CBOE is actively working with Trading Permit Holders and other interested customers to assist them in preparing to participate in extended trading hours for our two most active index options.","Diversifying our VIX product line represents a significant, untapped, opportunity for us to continue to grow volatility trading. Earlier this year, we launched futures and options on our new short-term VIX Index VXST. Obviously, the recent low-volatility environment has posed significant headwinds for a product of this nature, but we and many of our customers continue to firmly believe in the inherent utility of a short-term VIX product.","We continue to see examples of how short-term VIX products will be used as investors better understand VXST. In the days following the events in the Ukraine last month, we saw both the short-term and the VIX Indexes\u2019 spike, with VXST spiking higher. Not surprisingly, we also saw a corresponding increase in trading as customers used short-term and regular VIX products, alone or in combination, depending on their market views.","As market participants continue to see how VXST responds to unanticipated market events, as well as to targeted events, such as Fed announcements, the utility of Short-term VIX options and futures becomes clear. To that end, we have launched targeted educational and social media programs to more broadly expose customers to VXST, and how it relates to VIX, so that they better understand it and eventually trade these Short-term VIX products, much as they do our regular VIX products.","We are also preparing to launch our next tradable VIX product in the form of futures on the CBOE\/CBOT 10-year U.S. Treasury Note Volatility Index, the first volatility index based on U.S. government debt. The VXTYN Index is calculated by applying our VIX methodology to futures options data from CME Group's 10-year U.S. Treasury note contract. We began disseminating the index values in May 2013 and, pending regulatory review, intend to launch futures on the index by the end of this year, with options to follow.","We very much look forward to introducing a VIX futures product that will enable customers to better manage interest-rate risk. In June 2014, CBOE and C2 accounted for 30.4% of all options traded, up nearly a full percentage point from March, when our two options exchanges accounted for a combined market share of 29.5%. CBOE increased its industry leading market share by almost 0.5 a percentage point, to 28.4% in June from 28% in March.","CBOE continued to hold the industry\u2019s leading market share. In multiply-listed options only, CBOE accounted for 20.7% market share, on par with its market share in March of 20.8%. CBOE continues to lead all 12 options markets by a margin of several percentage points in both multiply-listed options and total options trading.","Clearly, we see considerable opportunities on the options landscape and in the volatility space going forward. As we begin the month of August at CBOE, our team is prepping for a busy fall season of marketing and educational initiatives and events. We are particularly looking forward to our 3rd annual CBOE Risk Management Conference Europe, which will be held September 3, through the September 5, just outside of Dublin.","We have much to share this year with European RMC participants, who are among our most active and sophisticated customers. This year\u2019s conference will reflect the increased focus on the performance of the small-cap sector by highlighting our Russell product line, which includes options on the Russell 2000 Index RUT and Russell Volatility options and futures RVX. The conference will also feature strategies for short-term VIX and VXTYN, as well as, strategies employing our SPX product line.","Going forward, we continue to capitalize on the favorable operating leverage inherent in our business through disciplined expense management and prudent allocation of capital, while continuing to grow our company through developing new products, expanding our user base, and optimizing our market share in commoditized products.","On that note, I will turn it over to Alan Dean to report on our financials.","Alan J. Dean","Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. Although our second quarter results fell below last year\u2019s record second quarter, it was a solid quarter, particularly considering the challenging market conditions.","I'll start with a summary of the second quarter. Operating revenue came in at $143.9 million, down 5% compared with last year's second quarter. Adjusted operating income was $69.7 million, representing an operating margin of 48.4%, a decline of 280 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2013. Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders was $42.6 million, 9% below the second quarter of 2013, resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.50, a 7% decrease versus $0.54 per share for the same period last year.","Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the second quarter of 2013 included certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck. There were no non-GAAP adjustments in the second quarter of this year.","Turning to the details of the quarter, as shown on this chart, the variance in operating revenue was primarily driven by lower revenue from transaction fees and regulatory fees, offset somewhat by higher market data fees.","Transaction fees decreased $8.2 million, or 8%, compared with the second quarter of 2013 reflecting a 4% decline in trading volume and a 4% decrease in the average revenue per contract or RPC versus last year\u2019s second quarter. In addition, there was one less trading day this quarter versus last year's second quarter. Trading volume declined year-over year in each product category except equity options, which increased 11%, while exchange-traded products declined 17%, index options fell 6% and futures contracts were down 9%.","Our blended revenue per contract, including options and futures, declined to $32.2 from $33.4 in last year's second quarter. The RPC decline was mainly due to a shift in the volume mix, with lower-margin, multiply-listed options accounting for a higher percentage of trading volume in the quarter versus last year's second quarter. In addition, volume-based incentives increased in the second quarter of 2014, primarily as a result of higher trading volume in equity options that qualified for the volume-based incentives at CBOE.","As I mentioned earlier, equity options volume increased 11% in the quarter and this category accounts for a greater share of volume-based incentives. While there are a number of variables that impact our revenue per contract, keep in mind that all of the volume tiers used in determining volume-based incentives are based on relative volume thresholds reached each month versus nominal contracts per month, which was used in prior years. This methodology tends to curtail the changes in revenue per contract, either up or down, as trading volume changes.","Overall, revenue per contract in our options business declined to $27.5 compared with $28.9 in the second quarter of 2013. The revenue per contract on equity options and exchange-traded products declined by 13% and 6%, respectively, while the RPC for index options was relatively unchanged year-over-year at $0.67.","Conversely, revenue per contract at CFE, our futures exchange, increased 6% to $1.64 from $1.54 in last year's second quarter. While multiply-listed options represented a higher percentage of our trading volume during the quarter, the percentage of transaction fee revenue contributed from these contracts fell due to the lower revenue per contract.","As depicted on this slide, in the second quarter, multiply-listed options accounted for 66.1% of total contracts traded versus 65.3% in the second quarter of 2013. Trading in our highest-margin index options and futures contracts represented 33.9% of total contracts traded, down from 34.7% in last year's second quarter. Converting the volume into transaction fees, you see that in the second quarter of 2014 index options and futures contracts accounted for 81% of our transaction fees, up slightly from 80% in the second quarter of 2013.","The lower trading volume industrywide also impacted our regulatory fees, which declined by $0.7 million. As we have told you, our goal is to align the revenue we collect from regulatory fees with our regulatory expenses. Based on our year-to-date revenue collected and expenses, we are reducing the rate per contract assessed for CBOE and C2's options regulatory fees, effective today.","Consequently, we expect regulatory fees to decline in the third quarters and fourth quarters compared with the second quarter of this year. To give you some context, assuming industrywide consumer volume, customer volume is the same in the third quarters and fourth quarters of this year as it was in the second quarter, regulatory fees would go down by about $0.5 million in each of those quarters.","On the plus side, revenue generated from market data fees increased $2.1 million as a result of higher market data revenue from both OPRA and CBOE's market data services. The increase in revenue from OPRA resulted from an increase in CBOE's share of industry transactions. CBOE and C2's share of OPRA revenue increased to 24.4% from 20.9% in last year's second quarter. The increase in revenue from CBOE's market data services was primarily due to an increase in subscribers.","Moving down the income statement to expenses, this next slide details total adjusted operating expense of $74.2 million for the quarter, up $0.6 million, or 1%, versus last year's second quarter. This increase primarily reflects higher expenses for depreciation and amortization, facilities costs and other expenses, partially offset by lower costs for outside services. The higher depreciation and amortization expense is directly related to our increased capital spending this year, which I will touch on later.","Core operating expense of $48.5 million was down $1.1 million, or 2%, compared with the second quarter of 2013. Looking at the details, the key drivers were lower expenses for outside services, offset somewhat by higher expenses for facilities costs and other expenses. The year-over-year decrease in outside services was primarily due to lower legal expenses.","In light of the uncertain market conditions, we are in the process of scrutinizing all expenses, as we always do when we see lackluster trading volume over a prolonged period. Based on our expected cost reductions and year-to-date results, we are lowering our guidance for core expenses to a range of $186 million to $190 million. While disciplined cost management is very much a part of our culture, we push even harder to gain operating efficiencies when trading volume languishes.","Looking at volume based-expenses, royalty fees increased by $0.2 million, or 1%. While the key driver of royalty fees is the trading volume in our licensed products, it also includes fees related to certain order flow for multiply-listed options directed to CBOE and fees associated with our market data sales. Higher fees associated with these two items accounted for the increase in royalty fees.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.1% versus 38.4% in last year\u2019s second quarter. This brings our cumulative effective tax rate to 39% through June, which is in line with our guidance. Based on what we know now, we still expect the full year tax rate to be in line with our guidance of 38.5% to 39.5%.","Taking a look at the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $145.1 million, compared to $191.1 million at the end of March and $221.3 million at the end of December. The decrease in cash primarily reflects cash used to repurchase shares and tax payments made during the quarter.","In terms of capital allocation, our track record of solid earnings and strong cash flow generation allows us to both invest in our business and increase our cash returned to shareholders. Through the first six months of this year we have used $31 million to pay regular dividends, nearly $44 million for a special dividend payment and another $97 million to purchase our stock.","Capital expenditures through June were $28 million, more than double our spending through June of 2013. This increase accounts for the higher depreciation and amortization expense I mentioned earlier. To date, capital expenditures are in line with our guidance range of $47 million to $50 million for the full year, so we are reaffirming our guidance.","During the second quarter of 2014, we repurchased over one million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program at an average price of $50.57, totaling $51.1 million. Since the inception of our plan through June 30, we used over $230 million to repurchase nearly 6.4 million shares at an average price of $36.26. At quarter end, we had $69.7 million available based on our share repurchase authorizations at that time.","Our capital allocation continues to be disciplined and balanced. We were pleased to announce that the Board increased our quarterly dividend rate by 17% to $0.21 per share from $0.18 per share, effective with the third quarter dividend payment. This increase is our fourth consecutive since we instituted a dividend payment in September 2010, following our IPO. Since that time, we have more than doubled our quarterly dividend.","The Board also increased the share repurchase authorization by $100 million. We plan to continue to return cash through our share repurchase program. Taking into account this most recent increase and buyback activity through July 30. We have approximately $150 million available under our share repurchase authorization. These initiatives underscore our efforts to maximize value for our shareholders.","In closing, we will continue to focus on being well positioned to take advantage of more favorable market conditions, while being nimble enough to adapt during lower volume periods. We remain very optimistic about our long-term growth prospects and we believe we are well positioned to generate even stronger financial results as market conditions improve and trading volume picks up.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Debbie.","Deborah L. Koopman","","At this time, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get everyone's questions asked. Please feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits we will take a second question.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. You may begin.","Richard H. Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.","Yes, good morning, guys. Well, Alan you met the consensus but even the Patriots don't win the Super Bowl every year. Anyway, so my favorite question on the VIX open interest really isn't a question anymore because you are at record levels as you ended the quarter, but Ed as you talked about volatility you talked about going back to normalized levels. I guess my one question would be, if anybody knows about volatility it is you guys. And what do you think is the normalized level of volatility? And what do you think are the factors that are keeping it lower I guess \u2013 than the normalized level that you believe it should be at?","Edward T. Tilly","Yes, Rich. Great question. We do watch volatility and although I think the public and we couldn't be more appreciative of the visibility in volatility that VIX has on all the financial news networks. From a trader's perspective we look at the shape of the volatility curve overtime.","And, so in my prepared remarks we see that upward sloping normal curve back to historic levels. So if you look out from today's level of 2014 or 2015 or so, we go over time in the next couple of VIX's futures contracts up to 2015 even 2016 toward the end of the year. So that's approaching our more historic level of 2017 and 2018 in VIX.","And, days like yesterday couldn't give better examples for us how we are in a great position and poised for volume as we return back to more normal levels. We traded 1.4 million contracts in VIX options yesterday, 380,000 VIX futures, set a record in extended trading hours for VIX futures overnight surpassing the old record. That is happening right now. That session isn't even closed.","So we do look to and expect the market to return and trend back to that historic level, 2017 and 2018. It's what we are seeing if we look at the term structure in VIX. And we have a great look into the market's expectation and the cost of hedging risk overtime.","Richard H. Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.","","Okay. So I guess you don't believe there's any environmental factor that is really changed the outlook for the long term?","Edward T. Tilly","Well, no. As we said in the first quarter when we were setting records and really we were enjoying some higher levels of volatility, we said look \u2013 that is not a trend line nor is a sub-historic level. And while it has been somewhat extended in months now as opposed to weeks, days like yesterday reaffirm our position that we are on track. The message is getting out there.","Your open interest comment, as we have been teaching you, people accumulate volatility and holding volatility whether it's ETNs, our futures, our options, and taking those positions preparing for moves in the market that will inevitably come and we saw that yesterday. We saw that this morning and the overnight session reaffirms it. The world is seeing that as well.","Richard H. Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.","Great, thanks, Ed. Thanks for the color on the VIX. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS. You may begin.","Alex Kramm \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Edward T. Tilly","Good morning.","Alex Kramm \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","I guess this is for Alan. Obviously appreciative of some of the more expense controls here in this environment. But it looks like in general you are already running a very, very tight ship so almost to the point where sometimes people wonder if you are under investing. But can you give us a little bit more sense of where these incremental cutting's coming from, what areas? Because again all of these monthly line items look pretty small as they are already and then maybe even a little bit more on the trajectory. I mean is this something that is going to happen very quickly in the third quarter, or how should we think about the trajectory of expenses for the next two quarters?","Alan J. Dean","","Good question, Alex. Let me address the under investing part first. You notice we didn't change guidance on our CapEx for the year. And we felt that all of those the projects in our capital guidance spending this year critical and are important to achieving our strategic objectives so we didn't touch them, didn't reduce them. And that's the way we approach expenses, expense reduction.","And one we \u2013 when we reduce expenses we'll look to delay things, pare things back. We will touch on many line items here at the exchange all again keeping in mind our overall objective of not impairing our growth prospects in the future. So, I would expect that many of the reductions that would account for our reduction in our guidance and core expenses to happen rather quickly, some may be delayed.","At this point in time I really can't go into by line item because I am in the midst of the cost reductions. But the playbook that we refer to is similar to this one that we have used in the past. So we will look at, as an example, travel and meetings. Do we have to \u2013 is there anything we can pare back there? Or consulting costs is there something that we can delay until next year? So that is outside services. That's a couple of examples of things that we look at.","Alex Kramm \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Okay. That's a start. Thank you.","Alan J. Dean","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.","Jillian R. Miller \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.","","Thanks, guys. So you mentioned four different indicators that give you confidence your VIX futures product is still in fairly rapid growth phase. And I was specifically thinking about the increased data usage and number of trading permits. I was hoping you might be able to give a little but more detail there. Like can you tell us how many VIX futures data subscribers there are today versus last year, or two years ago or how many trading permits are outstanding today versus a year ago like something more quantitative might be helpful, thanks.","Edward T. Tilly","","Let me start with permits. I think what\u2019s important for us is seeing renewed interest in let let's say someone tries trading VIX futures it may or may not work. But then the interest in us and our CFE business development guys going out and finding new users who turn around and start trading is really what we are focused on. That said, there are new users that we measure each and every month. And we couldn't be more encouraged by that pipeline and the amount of trading permits holders that are signing up.","And more importantly the amount of those trading permits holders that are actually engaged in and trading regularly. So, it doesn\u2019t \u2013 we are interested in every trade, obviously, but watching the new entrants come in and participate in the extended trading hours and that's really more of the turnover that we\u2019re looking at. And so the actual number of trading permit holders, although it is up this year, its important for us to make sure that they are engaged and getting that market data and engaging in our markets each and every day. And I think Ed will speak a bit on the market data aspect.","Edward L. Provost","Hi Jillian its Provost. So we have a fully dedicated person who sells CFE market data. He does that domestically and internationally and the international aspect of his sales effort has been of great focus in the last six months. We have seen good growth in the number of subscribers to CFE market data. Some of these are current users who are transitioning from prior carriers and a good number of them are new customers.","So it gives us great confidence that even though volume in the VIX products over the last several months has not been as strong as we might like because of market conditions, there is a continued and growing interest internationally in the product and I think that is largely driven by the 24-hour trading. So we are very optimistic given the interest in the subscribing to the CFE market data.","Jillian R. Miller \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Corp.","","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Edward T. Tilly","","Thanks Jillian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Bolu of Credit Suisse. You may began.","Christian Bolu \u2013 Credit Suisse Group AG","","Good morning, guys.","","Edward T. Tilly","Hi Christian.","Edward L. Provost","Good morning.","Christian Bolu \u2013 Credit Suisse Group AG","Thanks for the updates on the interest rate VIX. Could you just speak about your appetite to launch or relaunch VIX products on other asset classes outside equities and interest rates? And maybe just rank which of those asset classes would have the greatest potential. Thank you.","Edward T. Tilly","Sure. We would love to. So what we've seen and really the power of volatility product is when it is truly negatively correlated. And we have experimented, as you know, in commodities and commodities tend to have rising volatility as the trend in that underlying commodity is moving. So for example, gold has a higher volatility when there is a sense of a scarcity to the upside as well as an anticipated move to the downside, so it's not always negatively correlated.","And the securities in S&P 500, in the Russell contract, the negative correlation is really the power of the hedge, and we saw that most clearly on days like yesterday. So as we look at the opportunities we look out over those that the market has grabbed and embraced as hedging vehicle. Now we think there's a terrific case to be made as pure trading vehicles. So when we relaunch or we look at commodities again it will really able in being able to point at look at the trading opportunity, the high volatility of volatility, no matter what the asset class is.","So a lot of that education is probably in the second phase when we go back to the commodity space. We are very encouraged, as you asked your question, about getting into fixed income and our partnership with using CME\/CBOT market data for the 10-year note, couldn't be more excited. It brings us to completely new users, but what we've learned from broadening and VIX futures, will allow us to get into these other asset classes and attack the pure trading aspect of trading volatility.","Christian Bolu \u2013 Credit Suisse Group AG","That's a very good color. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you and our next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo. You may begin.","Christopher M. Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","","Thanks. I just want to follow-up on that last question a little bit. As you guys roll out more of these newer VIX products, how do you envision the uptake playing out? And I guess what I'm wondering is, do you think the uptake is going to follow the same path as the original VIX through the ETPs or potentially take some other form?","Edward T. Tilly","I think it will be a combination. So if we look back at the success that we had in VIX in the S&P 500 really the futures served as a hedging vehicle for options. And if we look our short-term VXST, which I know Ed wants to speak to, we look at even early options interest outpacing the interest in futures so again the futures are serving as the hedging vehicle and a level to trade even the short-term.","So as we look out and we are expanding, I do think and expect that overtime we will see some ETPs dedicated to short-term, would not surprise me if the major banks and institutions see some early success in any asset class, there could be an ETN to follow. We know there is great interest, but in order to manage that ETN to replicate the strategy that the underlying is providing, there needs to be some critical mass in either the futures or the option so that you can the option so that you can replicate and you can sell that strategy to your customers.","So we are encouraged, there is interest and we will follow the very successful roadmap that we have seen in our original VIX contract and extend that to short-term, to Russell, to interest rate and into commodities.","Christopher M. Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs you may begin.","Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Edward T. Tilly","Hey.","Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","So when we kind of take a step back here and we think about the growth of the VIX futures product at CFE broadly, it does feel like there's a little bit more beta to it than we have seen in the past. And I fully appreciate the fact that lower vol, higher vol, that matters a lot still for the growth of the product, but I guess I'm trying to understand do you think that is a fair assessment, A? And B, given the fact that you are rolling out a number of new products and you have a number of new initiatives in place, when we look over the next 12-months, what are the key products that you think will drive the organic growth in this business, so maybe calling out two or three things?","Edward T. Tilly","So going out over time I think what we are most encouraged, I wouldn't call it a new product actually, I actually, I would call it a new touch point or new access, we couldn't be more pleased with the extended trading hours and the uptake, as Ed Provost said earlier, not just domestic. And we know that we have domestic access into extended trading hours, but the international feedback we are getting on having these markets open could not have a better example than overnight last night to this morning's open.","Breaking a record and being touch and satisfy demand for not just that delta-1 hedging of the S&P 500 but rather offering exposure to volatility around the clock. Setting a new record today, coming off of our lows yesterday, coming into uncertainty this morning before the fed number, so that there is a demand to access the world\u2019s benchmark of volatility as measured by VIX. So, but that said I would let Ed make a couple of comments as well.","Edward L. Provost","I would just add to that Alex that our international efforts in not to down play our domestic efforts which are continuing and we think is tremendous untapped potential domestically, but Ed referenced earlier on our RMC in Europe where we have a significant audience following the volatility products, both with respect to the S&P and the Russell products. Just last week we were in China speaking to several hundred people from a combination of federal agencies, futures organizations and potential market markers and they are developing markets.","We will be in Australia before the end of the year working with our partner down there who has been a licensee of our VIX methodology for several years helping them further develop their volatility product. We think that is good for our product, because our VIX product is as I mentioned the global proxy for market volatility. So again, general market conditions is going to be probably the biggest driver, but education globally will be the key that we focus in.","Edward T. Tilly","So and you asked other opportunities. So I don\u2019t want to undervalue I think the opportunity we have at our RMC to actually focus on Russell as well, there has been great interest as you know in small caps and the difference is Russell has a higher volatility, I think there is an educational opportunity for us to raise the awareness of accessing volatility in a very liquid market by trading Russell VIX. And I also think obviously our partnership with the CME really allows our business development guys to be exposed to a whole new asset class which is bigger than what we\u2019re currently focused on.","It will be a longer runway, this won\u2019t be right out of the gate, it\u2019s not our expectation, but boy the potential is terrific to make even marginal inroads compared to where we have with the 500, because it\u2019s just such a bigger market. So we are encouraged, we\u2019re still on-track as I had mentioned in the prepared remarks for later this year to launch the BXTYN futures, concentration on Russell and really spotlighting the difference between 500 and the 2000, but we are really poised to do it all.","Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Got it. Thank you for pretty concrete answers. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is form Niamh Alexander of KBW. You may begin.","Kyle K.

Just on the royalties, this question is for Alan, they were just a bit higher than expected for the quarter. I appreciate the color that the increase was result link to order flow for certain multi-list options but could you just give me some more color there? Is this a good ratio to think of going forward as far as fees per license contracts, or is there another way we should think about this?","Alan J. Dean","Yes. It\u2019s a good question, there was an anomaly this quarter in royalty fees and we've seen it happen in other quarters, particularly last year, still the best correlation to royalty fees is our volume and our proprietary products index in futures products. I think you will see some variation from quarter-to-quarter, but I don\u2019t have a better metric for you. I think you would be conservative and safe if you use the metric that occurred in this quarter which was higher than what we saw in last quarter. So I think you will see some variability, but it should be a conservative estimate if you use this quarter\u2019s correlation.","Kyle K. Voigt \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right, thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Gaston Ceron, Morningstar. You may begin.","Gaston F.

Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Inc.","Just had a quick follow-up, I think likely for Alan on the CapEx. I know I asked about this before I think a couple of quarters ago, but now that we are about halfway through the year and you've got a decent chunk of your stepped-up CapEx in the books here, just curious if you have any better feeling as you look out further into 2015 and beyond whether we are likely to stay at these elevated levels, or whether there is hope for this thing kind of trending down a little bit?","Alan J. Dean","Yes, good question, Gaston. I don't have more concrete \u2013 a better estimate that I had before of spending in next year and year before. If you look at our capital spending prior years was around $30 million to $35 million this year it jumps up $47 million to $50 million. I would expect it to drop back a bit next year, but we are in the midst of the planning process for next year and beyond. So if it does change I don't think it would be at a level that would be shocking to you. So I expect it to go down a bit, maybe not by much, maybe not back to the $30 million to $35 million level, but to be at $50 million again, that is possible but unlikely. But I am not sure.","Gaston F. Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Inc.","Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Worthington of JP Morgan.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Debbie Koopman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please begin.","Debbie Koopman","","Thank you. Good morning. And thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our CEO, will provide an update on our strategic initiatives for 2014, and Alan Dean, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will review our first quarter 2014 financial results. Following their comments we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A is our President and Chief Operating Officer, Ed Provost. In addition, I would like to point out that this presentation will include the use of several slides. We will be showing the slides and providing commentary on each. A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","As a preliminary note, you should be aware that this presentation contains forward-looking statements which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold, and what we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a full discussion of the factors that may effect any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise after this conference call. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Tilly.","Ed Tilly","","Thank you Debbie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before discussing CBOE's progress in the first quarter, I will take a moment for a few words about high frequency trading, as it relates to, or more to the point, how it does not relate to the options market. We operate in a highly regulated transparent market with matching algorithms and fees that are clearly designed to benefit retail customers. It's important to note that the option market is in many key ways fundamentally different than the equities market. One result of these differences is that the option market does not cater to high frequency trading practices described in the Lewis book.","For example, dark pools do not exist in the options market. The make or taker transaction pricing model is not the dominate fee structure in the options market, and even less so at CBOE. In customer orders primarily trading as quotes that are supplied by dedicated liquidity providers. At CBOE, our size-based matching algorithm, primarily rewards larger sized bids and offers, not the fastest bids and offers. Additionally CBOE does not house it's primary data center in a CBOE-owned building for which we can derive significant revenue via co-location. Further, our rule book makes clear that CBOE employs very traditional options order types, and does not offer particularly exotic or complicated orders in our marketplace. While no one can say for certain how the current analysis of HFT might shape market structure, it remains our view that the potential market impact to CBOE will not be material. We also believe there could potentially be some positive benefits that accrue to CBOE, if reforms lead to increased trading in lit markets.","With that I'll move on to our first quarter results. Double-digit volume increases across each of our product categories in the first quarter of 2014, resulted in record revenue and earnings for CBOE Holdings. Average daily volume for options and futures combined was 5.6 million contracts per day in the first quarter, up 15% over the previous quarter, and 29% over the first quarter of 2013. Options volume averaged 5.4 million contracts daily, up 14% over the previous quarter, and 29% over 2013. Indexed options trading led by strong trading in our SPX complex, and record volume in VIX options increased 17%, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.","Moving on now to our strategic initiatives for 2014, which fall into three main categories. Leveraging and developing proprietary products, optimizing revenue and commodotized products, and broadening our customer base, while maintaining the highest standards in market regulation. As outlined in our last call, we plan to grow SPX trading in 2014 through intensified educational and marketing initiatives aimed at the following user groups. Users of SPY options and SPY weeklys who lack awareness of the benefits of SPX relative to SPY, institutional investors, such as OTC users, pension funds, asset managers, and insurance companies, who are just beginning to trade listed SPX, and overseas investors, who can use SPX and SPX Weeklys to hedge global economic risk, or to efficiently take a position in the US market. I am pleased to report that average daily volume in the first quarter for our SPX product line was nearly 878,000 contracts, up 8% over the previous year, and 7% over the previous quarter. SPX Weeklys continue to post double-digit gains as average daily volume reached a new high of 277,000 contracts, up 59% year-over-year, and 33% over the previous quarter. Weeklys trading has brought a growing base of retail and semi-pro customers to our SPX Marketplace, and we see significant opportunity to further develop this new user base.","Turning now to trading in VIX options and futures, which posted all-time volume records in the first quarter. VIX options volume averaged 774,000 contracts per day, up 35% over the previous quarter, and 22% over the first quarter of 2013. Average daily volume in VIX futures was nearly 203,000 contracts, an increase of 32% from the previous quarter, and 33% from last year. We seem to field a question or two in every call regarding our view of the growth trajectory for VIX trading, so I'll take a few moments here to provide some color. The broad sustained waves of growth in VIX trading are consistent with what we have seen in early stages of a groundbreaking product line, one that not only changes what people trade, but where and how they trade it.","CBOE has developed three such product lines. Equity options, index options, and now VIX futures and options. It has been our experience that early growth in a game changing product line is measured not in years, but in decades. In previous calls, we've highlighted new VIX users, and today I'll take a bit of a deeper dive. It's helpful to think in terms of vega when sizing the growing volatility market. Vega refers to how the price of an option can move in response to a 1% change in its implied volatility. Trading in VIX contracts now averages between $200 million and $250 million in vega daily. This is roughly 10 times the vega traded through OTC vol swaps, and about 1.5 to 2 times the daily vega traded on the listed SPX options. Anyone who trades in options or manages a portfolio has volatility exposure. VIX futures and options clearly have become the preferred means for managing that volatility, but we are still in the early stages of growing that marketplace.","Many customers are just beginning to determine how pure volatility trading fits into their various investment frameworks. And as more investors enter this market, they continue to find compelling new trading opportunities that further expand the marketplace. So for instance, there's a growing recognition among asset managers that SPX and VIX derivatives are complimentary risk management tools, that can be used to construct very nuanced and precise portfolio hedges. SPX options provide directional exposure,, while VIX futures and options provide a more dynamic hedge in fast changing markets. The whole notion of harvesting risk premium has taken on a new meaning as sophisticated traders trade VIX and SPX derivatives as interchangeable components of their alpha-generating strategies.","Volatility arbitrage though not new, has taken on a new dimension, as several new hedge funds have begun to deploy strategies involving VIX futures and options. We've seen the VIX universe continue to expand in surprising ways. For instance, a major investment group that principally trades energy and interest rate products, recently became a Trading Privileged Holder, or TPH at CFE. Other new users include European investors trading VIX products against fee stocks, a measure of volatility of the Euro Stocks 50. And banks in Brazil, now actively using VIX products for macro hedging. We also see increasing numbers of customers that sell implied volatility short, which has been an active topic in many trading forums.","It is important to note we are still in the early stages of developing previously-identified customer segments globally, such as hedge funds, CTAs, proprietary trading firms and institutional investors. Many customers in these categories are early adopters meaning there is considerable room to further expand every category of VIX user. Quite simply, we believe investors of every type can potentially benefit from the added dimension of pure volatility provided by VIX futures and options, and that education is the key to unlocking that potential.","We continue to see tremendous demand for education in VIX trading. As an example, CBOE's Options Institute recently conducted seminars on VIX options and futures in New York, San Jose, and Chicago, where over 600 individuals registered for three hour courses. Our online classes are also highly subscribed and VIX-related webinars attract more viewers than any other topic. Additionally, giving the ongoing mainstreaming of VIX trading, the Institute sees particular demand for VIX-related content from retail brokerage firms.","Our social media programs similarly reflect the great interest for all things related to CBOE volatility VIX. VIX topics dominate online chatter and VIX related blogs generate more page views than any other topic at the Options Hub, our online social media center. In one recent week, when our content was predominantly VIX related, the site had a record 13,000 page views, more than double the usual number. CBOE's Risk Management Conference brings us face-to-face with some of the most active and sophisticated VIX customers. This year's event drew more than 320 participants, and record corporate sponsorships for a content-rich program, focused on options and VIX-related strategies and trends. A Round Table held at RMC, VIX success drives vol market forward, featured leading industry authorities. I think it's fair to say this group was extremely enthusiastic about the evolving uses of VIX options in futures. We now look forward to holding similar sessions at our Third Annual RMC Europe, which will be held September 3rd through the 5th, just outside Dublin.","Broadening access to our marketplace is another avenue for future growth at VIX trading. As you know, we extended the VIX Futures trading day by 5 hours and 45 minutes late in 2013. The added hours respond to demand for additional trading time for US customers, and enable European based customers to access VIX futures during their local trading hours. I'm pleased to say that some 15,000 VIX futures contracts per day now trade outside of regular US trading hours, accounting for 7.4% of the product's total daily volume year-to-date. On certain days when overseas events triggered overnight volatility, we have seen the percentage rise as high as 15%. Pending regulatory review, on June 22nd, we plan to further expand our extended trading hours to nearly 24 hours, which will accommodate Asian market hours, and a growing worldwide user base. We also look forward to extending trading hours for VIX options, as well as SPX options later this year pending regulatory approval.","New product development represents a significant opportunity for us to continue to grow VIX trading. As you know we launched futures on our new short-term VIX index, VXST, in February followed by the launch of short-term VIX options last month. Short-term VIX futures and options leverage the most compelling features of SPX Weeklys, and VIX futures and options, including weekly expirations that enable traders to fine-tune the timing of their volatility trades. Short-term VIX is generally more volatile than VIX, which sets the stage for additional trading opportunities. While we would like to have a better volume story at this point, we have not had the liquidity provide our participation we expected early on, which has impacted market quality. Our concentration over the next 30 days will be working with liquidity providers who plan to trade, but are not yet actively quoting in this market.","We believe traction will grow as market quality improves. In addition, CBOE is working with issuers of exchange traded products, or ETPs, who have expressed interest in developing products linked to VXST futures, it's similar to what we saw in VIX, with VXX and other ETPs. So despite a slower start than we had hoped, we remain very optimistic on the inherent utility of these products. Other VIX product developments in the pipeline for 2014 include futures on CBOE, CBOT, 10-year Treasury notes volatility index, the first volatility index based on US government debt. The VXTYN Index is calculated by applying all of our VIX methodology to futures options data from CME Group's 10-year US Treasury note contracts. We began descending into index values in May of 2013, and pending regulatory review, intend to launch futures on the index by the end of this year. Diversifying our VIX product line across asset classes is an area where we see significant head room for growth. We view interest rate volatility as an exciting new frontier in the volatility marketplace.","Turning now to equity options trading where CBOE continues to hold the industry lead in market share, in March of 2014, CBOE and C2 accounted for 29.5% of all options traded. As of March 31st, CBOE held 28% of total industry market share adjusted for dividend trades, up slightly from 27.9% total market share at the end of December. In multi-listed options only, CBOE held 20.8% market share, up slightly from 20.3% at the end of December. In both cases, CBOE led all 12 options market by a margin of several percentage points.","We are pleased but never complacent with our overall performance in the equity options marketplace. We closely monitor the daily changes in this very fluid arena, and are prepared to quickly modify our CBOE and C2 models in response to competitive pressures. Clearly we see considerable opportunities on the options landscape and in the volatilities base going forward. We continue to capitalize on favorable operating leverage inherent in our business, through disciplined expense management, and prudent allocation of capital, while ceding our companies future growth with programs aimed at developing new products, expanding our user base, and optimizing our market share in commoditized products. On that note, I will turn it over to Alan Dean to report on our financials.","Alan Dean","Thanks Ed, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to report that CBOE Holdings is off to a strong start this year, posting record revenue and earnings per share for the first quarter, driven by growth in trading volume and disciplined control of operating expenses. Let me start with a recap of our first quarter results. We delivered operating revenue of $157.9 million, up 11% compared with last year's first quarter. Adjusted operating income was $84.6 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 53.6%, a 270 basis point improvement over the first quarter last year.","Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders was $50 million, up 14%, with the first quarter compared, with the first quarter of 2013, resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.58, a 16% increase versus $0.50 per share for the same period last year. Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the first quarter of 2014 and 2013 include certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the Appendix of our slide deck.","Turning to the details of the quarter, as shown on this chart, the growth in operating revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from transaction fees and market data fees. Transaction fees increased $13.7 million, or 14%, compared with the first quarter of last year, due to a 31% increase in trading volume, offset slightly by a 13% decrease in the average revenue per contract, or RPC, versus last year's first quarter. The growth in trading volume was driven by volume gains across each of our product categories, with trading volume from equity options up 37%, exchange traded products up 38%, and indexed options up 18%, and futures contracts up 34%. Our blended revenue per contract including options and futures, declined to $0.329, from $0.378 in last year's first quarter. The decline was primarily due to an increase in volume-based incentives in the first quarter of 2014 for certain multiply-listed options traded at CBOE under our volume incentive program, reflecting the impact of fee changes implemented in February and March of 2013.","In addition, the product mix shifted in lower margin multiply listed options accounted for a higher percentage of trading volume during the quarter compared with the first quarter of 2013. As a result, the RPC in our options business declined to $0.281 compared with $0.333 in the first quarter of 2013. The revenue per contract on equity options and exchange traded products declined by 42% and 25% respectively, while the RPC for index options was unchanged year-over-year at $0.67. CFE's revenue per contract of $1.62 for the first quarter was relatively unchanged from last year's first quarter. While multiply-listed options represented a higher percentage of our trading volume during the quarter, the percentage of transaction fee revenue contributed from these contracts fell, due to a lower RPC and the strong growth in trading volume from our higher margin proprietary products.","As depicted on this slide, in the first quarter of this year multiply listed options accounted for 65.3% of total contracts traded versus 62.1% in last year's first quarter. Trading in our highest margin index options and futures contracts represented 34.7% of total contracts traded, down from 37.9% in last year's first quarter. Converting the volume into transaction fees you can see that in the first quarter of 2014, index options on futures contracts accounted for 81% of our transaction fees, up from 76% in the first quarter of 2013. As Ed noted in his comments, we continue to focus our growth initiatives on our proprietary products that generate the highest return.","Looking at revenue drivers outside of transaction fees, most of our other revenue line items were relatively unchanged this quarter, compared with last year's first quarter, with the exception of market data fees. Revenue generated from market data fees increased $1.6 million, as a result of higher market data revenue from OPRA, reflecting higher share of industry transactions, and a rate increase for OPRA terminals. CBOE and C2's share of OPRA revenue increased to 24.5% from 18.9% in last year's first quarter. In addition, we saw higher revenue from CBOE's streaming markets, reflecting an increase in subscribers as well as rates.","Moving down the income statement to expenses, this next slide details total adjusted operating expense of $73.3 million for the quarter, up $3.2 million or 5% versus last year's first quarter. This increase primarily reflects higher employee costs and royalty fees, offset somewhat by lower expenses for outside services. Core operating expense of $47.7 million was unchanged compared with the first quarter of 2013.","Looking at the details, the key variances were higher employee costs, offset by lower expenses for outside services. The increase in employee costs was primarily due to higher salaries resulting from staff additions, mainly in regulatory services, as well as an increase in the provision for incentive compensation, which is aligned with our growth in pretax income. The decrease in outside services is due to lower legal expenses. Overall, through March core operating expense annualized is tracking in line with our guidance range, and we are reaffirming our guidance range for core expenses of $191 million to $196 million for the full year. Looking at volume based expenses, royalty fees increased by $2.7 million, or 21%. This increase primarily reflects the growth in trading volume in our licensed products, and to some degree fee adjustments that occurred in conjunction with the extension of our S&P licensing agreement on March 8th of last year.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 39.9%, versus 38.3% in last year's first quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate reflects the recognition of a discrete tax charge in the first quarter of 2014 versus the discrete tax benefits recognized in the first quarter of 2013. The tax charge was primarily due to a change in New York state tax law effective for 2015, changing to market based sourcing, which impacts our New York state apportionment factor increasing our deferred tax liability. Although the effective tax rate exceeds our annual guidance, we see this as a timing issue. Based on what we know now we still expect the full year tax rate to be in line with our guidance of 38.5% to 39.5%.","Taking a look at the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $199.1 million, compared to $221.3 million at the end of December. Our solid financial performance, along with a strong balance sheet, has allowed us to return a substantial amount of capital to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. For the first quarter of this year we have generated approximately $88 million in cash from operations, paid out nearly $16 million in regular dividends, and $44 million in a special dividend, used about $12 million for capital expenditures, and another $39 million to purchase stock.","Under our share repurchase plan, we repurchased over 700,000 shares in first quarter, at a total cost of $37 million, at an average price of $52.99 per share. Since the inception of our plan, we have used over $179 million to repurchase 5.3 million shares, at an average price of $33.55. At quarter end, we had $120.8 million available under our current share repurchase authorizations. We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize stockholder value by reinvesting in our business, and returning excess cash to stockholders through consistent and sustainable dividends and share repurchases. We will continue to be disciplined in our repurchase activity, which will vary based upon stock price and other factors.","In closing, our first quarter results demonstrated continued financial and operational discipline and execution, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth and adjusted operating revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We're very pleased with our strong start to 2014, and we believe we are well-positioned for continued growth as we execute on our strategic plan. With that, I will turn the call back over to Debbie.","Debbie Koopman","","At this point, we would be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the Q&A queue and if there is time, we'll take a second question.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). The first question is from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Richard Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","","Good morning guys, and congratulations on I think the 15th consecutive beat.","Ed Tilly","Thanks, Rich. Good morning.","Richard Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","","Good morning. And don't kill me for asking this question, but I have got to turn back, since you spent a fair amount of time on the VIX futures, that the open interest at the end of March was, just say it's still down from peak levels. I know you explained, Ed, that's this tail hedging strategy, where you actually tell people, as the VIX rises to lighten up. But I guess the question is, given everything that you doing, that you outlined in the prepared remarks, that factor is, that the factor of just growth isn't outweighing sort of this strategy of lightning up at higher volatility and adding with lower volatility? And also, if you could, maybe the percent of high frequency traders in VIX futures?","Ed Tilly","","Rich there aren't going to be any more questions left after that.","Richard Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","","Okay. Just take the first one.","Ed Tilly","","We'll get them both for you. So I think to your point, beginning in 2013, the VIX futures volume actually began to be less correlated with the VIX futures open interest, as we increased the diversity of the VIX market participants, right? So today more sophisticated traders, the vol arbs funds, they employ strategies involving VIX, SPX, OTC variance, VIX-linked ETPs. So if you grasp that rolling 12-month correlation on a month-over-month change in the futures versus the open interest since 2007, you will see in 2013 much to your point that the correlation turned negative, right? Indicating that the open interest really isn't driving the VIX futures volume.","Rather, what we've seen, and I think I've hinted on the last couple of calls, if you look at and track and kind of overlay volume of VBX or the vol a vol, as it relates to the VIX futures average daily volume, you see it correlated a bit more than open interest. So historically VBX is high 80s, 86-ish. And then if you look at where we're today, April you'll see the VBX actually low, it is almost 70. There's less volatility in volatility right now. When we ask our product development guys and our research guys to look at cause and effect, we actually point to a lower vol of vol, rather than a change in open interest. And as we saw in the first quarter, as volatility increases in the vol of vol increases, our volumes go up. So maybe if I can get Debbie to run you some VVIX numbers and kind of show you what we're talking about, that might make much more sense than us going back continually to the open interest, and how it's not correlated to the growth in VIX. Coming off another record quarter, it kind of reinforces what we've been telling you all along. Volatility in the marketplace, good for CBOE. Volatility of VOL very good for VIXs futures and options.","I think your second question was percentage of HFT in CFE futures. In earlier on discussions with the entire investment community, we did give some top end estimates of what we viewed HFT at CBOE and CFE, but with the ongoing debate, there is really not a consensus of defining HFT. And therefore, difficult to kind of gauge how trading would be impacted. So we're kind of hesitant to put forth numbers at this time. But really, at the end of the day, if we defined HFT, much the way it's defined in the Lewis book, we would not be impacted materially in any way at CBOE or CFE. And as I said in my opening comments we actually see the potential for some upside as more and more trades would be transacted in the lit marketplace. So I hope I've given you kind of our look at the first two questions of the day.","Richard Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","","All fair points, Ed. Congratulations on your consistency here of the results.","Ed Tilly","","Thanks, Rich.","Alan Dean","","Thank you, Rich.","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question is from Mike Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Mike Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Thanks guys. Alan, just on some of the expenses, I guess mostly on the trading side, it just looks like if I look sequentially, the royalty like fee rate and the volume incentive fee rate, it looks like it decreased a bit. So I just wanted to understand, does it have to do with changes in pricing, changes in volumes? And I guess more importantly, just in terms of the outlook, are these like run rates more normal, or is it back to where it was over the last couple of quarters?","Alan Dean","","Good question. I think if you look at the rate per contract under royalty fee this quarter and compare it to the first quarter of last year, I think it's really close, if not identical. And that could account, could be caused by anomalies in the way that we recognize or pay the royalty fee. Other than the change that went into effect March 8th of last year when we extended our contract with Standard & Poors, there's really nothing new that happened since last March 8th, and I don't anticipate anything continuing the rest of this year. Probably the biggest thing that could impact that rate per contract in royalty fees is a product mix, so not all, we don't pay the same rate per contract on all products, and if a higher one happens to trade more in a quarter than a lower rate per contract one on the royalty fee side, then that could impact that rate. So you'll see slight anomalies quarter-over-quarter but there's really nothing new going on there.","Mike Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Alan Dean","","Sure. Thank you, Mike.","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question is from Chris Allen of Evercore. Your line is open.","Chris Allen \u2013 Evercore Partners","","Good morning guys.","Alan Dean","","Good morning.","Chris Allen \u2013 Evercore Partners","Just a quick numbers related question. Just on the futures RPC, I know it's flattish year-over-year, but we tend to look at more sequential basis, obviously a nice jump up in terms of trading volumes, and also nice jump up in futures RPC, so I'm just wondering if there's any explanation from that, whether it's customer mix or something else?","Alan Dean","","Yes, a lot has to do with the mix within the product. So if we're, because not all participants in the product pay the same. So if a higher fee category happens to trade more during the quarter, that will impact RPC. But I want you to know that on January 2nd, we did increase customer fees on VIX futures slightly, and I expect that had some impact on our revenue per contract and futures in the first quarter.","Chris Allen \u2013 Evercore Partners","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good morning guys. Wanted to touch base on the short term VIX product, it sounded like there was a fair amount of enthusiasm about this product early in the year. And it sounded like from your comments, this had a little bit of a softer start, so maybe spend a minute on what it is that the liquidity providers are not seeing in the product, or if there's anything that you need to change structural about it to see a better uptake would be helpful? Thanks.","Ed Provost","","Alex, Ed Provost, I will take that one. We remain very enthusiastic about the product, every conversation that we have with potential customers of the product are very positive. Because we chose not to bring up a VIX weekly, but rather to create a new spot index of VXST, it became a new product, and that triggers technology work that needs to be done by the liquidity provider community, and even on the flow side, it requires products to pass through the compliance areas to get approval, because indeed, it is a new product as opposed to a weekly end of VIX, which would be an extension of an existing product.","So those are some of the reasons why we have not had as much market maker participation early on as we had hoped, and why some of the significant players in the VIX have not been active in VXST. So I just think it's a question of it being a new product, we are as optimistic as we've always been that it will be a key contributor to our VIX, to our volatility product mix. But we've acknowledged it's a litter slower out of the gate than we had hoped for, but we continue to be very optimistic.","Ed Tilly","","Ed, let me add a little bit to that. I commented on market quality in the prepared remarks, and really what we mean by that is when we look at the bid\/ask spread, and the size of the display market, very, very important, and key driver in attracting the end user to our contract. Really the market quality is really different than what we see in VIX futures. For example VIX futures are tick wide. The sharp term VXST can be three, four, five ticks wide. So what we're working on, and Ed was referring to the dedicated or liquidity providers that are in the market day in, day out, those are the ones that we have to incent to get into the marketplace first. Then the end user, the hedger, the speculator will come to the marketplace. It's a pattern we seen time and again when we launch new product categories, did. Ed and the business development guys that's what they're working on, getting those liquidity providers, the dedicated day-in day-out users of the contract into the marketplace, better market quality, and then the daily users will come after.","Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got you. I guess it is just you are going to switch the product to the weekly as opposed to launching your new product, I'm not sure if there's an actual benefit to having a new product, or just an extension of the existing, so it creates more volume sooner?","Ed Tilly","","It's a great question. Now we have not ruled out a weekly contract. Rather, this contract was brought to the marketplace because to this so responsive to the short term to market driven events. Using a nine day weekly contract in our VIX methodology to come up with a very volatile number that reflects the state of the market in the short term was really how we preferred to launch. And it's what our users said they were interested in us bringing to the marketplace. So we are nowhere near giving up on this concept, but it certainly to your point does not rule out offering another alternative, a weekly contract based on the 30-day.","Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm \u2013 UBS","","Good morning. Wanted to maybe spend a little bit outside of VIX. It seems like you're really focused obviously on broadening the VIX franchise, but how should we look at this from your perspective, like when you think about the SPX business or even the multiply-listed business, do you still see growth opportunities there? And if you do, like what are you actually doing to kind of spur those or catalyze those growth opportunities? Thanks.","Ed Tilly","","Well, Alex, in my prepared remarks, I spent a fair amount of time kind of defining who we see coming into the marketplace. So the greatest opportunity remains here domestically. That demand is by no way satisfied for all things VIX, or VIX related. And then to the educational and the globalization, I think if you take a look at the numbers that we see, when there is volatility in the non-US trading day, our trading before the open or after the close for that matter, before we even incorporate the Asian trading day, where we're averaging roughly 7% ADV in VIX futures, but on the days when there is uncertainty we double the percentage, right? So March 3rd, a day back in January, last Friday in the economic news, we go from 7% to 14%. There is demand across the globe. And our educational and business development efforts reflect that, but I want to continue to say every opportunity that we get, the growth, the greatest opportunity is to continue to expand domestically, and then the global demand will come as we are focusing our efforts in a much broader way. Ed, do you want to add anything?","Ed Provost","","No, I would say consistent with what you said, Ed, every stop we make, both in the state and outside of this country, where we talk about both VIX futures and options we find again a level of interest that is amazing. And we have no reason to believe that there is any limitation in the, immediately anyway, in the upward growth of this product. Our RMC Conference which we had here was a phenomenal success, and we are very optimistic that we're going to set a new record in Dublin, when we have our September Conference there. I mentioned in these calls before, that we're looking at doing a RMC in Asia. So we continue to be very optimistic that VIX is in its infancy, and its growth curve will continue much as it has up until now. So we're very, very optimistic on the VIX front.","Ed Tilly","","Ed, why don't you give a little color as to the participants in RMC in March, and how at the 320 or so attendees, how we saw new faces.","Ed Provost","","Yes. It's a good point. So we have averaged in the last few years upwards of 300 or so participants in the US Conference this year we had 320, which was I think the second highest we've ever had. Major participants include public pension plans, insurance companies, hedge fund portfolio managers, obviously all institutional oriented. A significant portion I think the number is about 70% of the people are new attendees, so it is not the same people coming back and enjoying the warm weather in Florida or California, but rather new people coming to try to understand how to use this product. Sometimes people from the same firms, but new faces learning how to use volatility products. So again, that demographic analysis is very important to us in understanding exactly who it is that is coming to these conferences, how we need to modify our agenda from year-to-year, but we continue again to be very optimistic, and I would encourage you, you on the phone, to if you get the opportunity, to attend a RMC and see the actual users of these products, you would be very, very impressed.","Alex Kramm \u2013 UBS","","And real quick, sorry, since my question was mostly focused on VIX, it's not a follow-up, but on the non-VIX products are there still development and product development efforts outside of VIX that you can talk about? Because I'm sorry, maybe I didn't ask the question correctly, but that's what I was trying to get at, as well?","Ed Tilly","","Sure. The product development pipeline here it never ends. We have a team committed to working with liquidity providers, discount brokerage firms all sit around in our product development committee and come up with, in an attempt to fill the gaps from the demand side. What it is that we can bring to the marketplace to satisfy that demand in those gaps. So we have a full product line. And as contracts go from the idea stage and approach implementation we'll be sharing them with you but we do have things coming forward. I think the one we focused on today, which we're most excited about, is later this year, the VXTYN, and that is bringing volatility to the ten years. So yes, there is a pipeline. We never stop, and it is all driven by our end users, both institutional and retail.","Alex Kramm \u2013 UBS","","Alright. Thanks for that, too. Bye.","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ken Worthington Hi. Good morning. Ed, you may a teeny tiny little investment in Tradelegs earlier this year, and it wasn't something we had really seen before from CBOE. Can you talk a little bit about the appetite for investments going forward, and maybe the philosophy and opportunity for growth through acquisition?","Ed Tilly","","So we haven't actually changed the way we view potential investments in outside opportunities. Anytime that we have an add-on business, one that CBOE perhaps has not designed in-house, we where can interact with our customers at any stage of their trading, either from the decision stage as we've made an investment in a front end, to risk management, and in this case, Tradelegs is an opportunity for our end users primarily institution at this point, to become smarter in their trading strategies. We're going to look at them very closely. And if it fits that core goal of CBOE to touch that investor earlier or later in the process, we will take a look at it. Has to make sense for us, but we look at opportunities that, not daily but on a regular basis. Alan, do you want to add anything?","","Alan Dean","","The other opportunities that we pay very close attention to involve new product opportunities, so if we can find through an investment in a company, or an idea, or some IP that would lead to a product that we could trade, that we could charge pricing, premium pricing on, well that interests us as well. Of course we are open to any other M&A activities that we believe would enhance shareholder value, but beyond these smaller one-offs that we have invested in now and then, we really haven't seen any other opportunities. Ken Worthington Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question is from Niamh Alexander of KBW, your line is open.","","Niamh Alexander \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","Thank you for taking my question. If I could just go into customer groups, and I have asked a few times before, it's the retail participation like we're seeing some good activity levels from some of the online retail brokers and some of the non-onlines so far in the year, I was just wondering if you think maybe that was part of the strength in the first quarter as well, that you're starting to see a re-engagement there. I know you see it kind of coming through the brokers, but there's probably a large portion of the brokers just given the size of the market where you can tell that you're starting to see retailer engagement. It hasn't completely gone away, but do you think you're finally seeing it start to really take off and from growth here?","Ed Provost","","Hi, Ed Provost. Yes, as your own analyst reports have noted, the retail brokers have had a good quarter, there's obviously confidence back in the market among retail investors. But to be honest with you, while we have seen an increase in retail flow, our general mix of retail versus institutional remains fairly consistent. We're seeing growth both at the retail level and in the various areas of institutional participation, including the hedge fund or a more sophisticated active institution, as well as traditional institutional, including the pension plan players, as well.","And I would say also that we have historically been a primary destination for retail order flow, given our market model, which is very accommodating to retail. So we benefited from the renewed growth of the retail space. We don't talk about it, the retail as much, because it is not so self-limited by Board mandates, and things like that, and the area is so well serviced by the retail firms who are very option centric. But we're very optimistic that there is continued growth potential in the retail space, as well as institution. But again, we often focus on the institutional side, because we think that has the most untapped potential.","Niamh Alexander \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","Okay. I'll get back in line. Thanks.","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question is from Christian Bolu of Credit Suisse.","Christian Bolu \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Thank you for taking my questions. Just a quick one on interest rate VIX with CME, just help us understand how market participants currently get exposure to interest rate\u2026","Debbie Koopman","","We can't hear you. Can you\u2026","Christian Bolu \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Hello. Can you hear me?","Ed Tilly","","That's better now.","Christian Bolu \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Sorry about that. Question was on interest rates VIX with the CME, if you could just help us understand how market participants currently get exposure to interest rate volatility? And if there are any conflicts with CMEs options about. I asked the question because that seems to be a growth area for them?","Ed Tilly","","So the exposure in volatility in interest rates now would be much the same as exposure in volatility in a single line stock, meaning every time you trade an option you have volatility exposure. So similar to any of the single names or ETFs here at CBOE that do not have a VIX futures contract tied to it, would be the same way you can gain exposure in interest rates, just using basic option strategy. So this obviously is a coordinated effort with CBOE to bring VXTYN to the market, so we have the support of CME, and certainly we'll be using their option data and our VIX methodology to first launch a futures contract and then hopefully an options contract based on the futures. So this is very much as I said a coordinated effort, but today the volatility exposure would be very traditional in that you would be using options strategies in the ten-year option.","Christian Bolu \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question is from Kenneth Hill of Barclays. Your line is open.","Kenneth Hill \u2013 Barclays","","Hi, good morning everyone.","Ed Tilly","","Good morning.","Kenneth Hill \u2013 Barclays","","You guys have given a lot of good detail today on many so of the education efforts you have driving some of the growth in the SPX and the VIX products, but as you increasingly look to penetrate groups like hedge funds, commodity trading, prop firms outside of those education efforts, what kind of things can we expect to help grow in those segments, is there perhaps maybe more hiring to be done on the sales front, and even in other geographies as you extend some of these trading hours over time?","Ed Provost","","Ed Provost again. We have in New York a very committed and dedicated team that's primarily focused on the institutional space, and specifically the hedge fund community. Our business development staff has grown over the last several years, consistent with the overall growth in our market. We have areas, we have people who are specialized in certain customer types, such as hedge funds. We have certain people that are specialized in certain product types, like volatility. ","So we have a very sophisticated calling program, where we engage not only current users but potential users, both domestically and abroad. We record all of the visits we have so that there is a communication across all of our sales force to understand what the open issues are, what kinds of questions are coming up. ","So we're very, very engaged in one-on-one meetings. We, of course, have talked often about our RMC, where we engage in a number of clients. And then we partner with other organizations and are participants again not only in the US but globally. We are in front of our customers on a regular basis and believe that is the way, the best way to get our message across. So we're very, very focused on the institutional community. Probably a lot more than we are on the retail, because I go back to my earlier comments where the retail community is very much self engaged through the options boutique firms who service them so well. We think the institutional space is the one where there is still the greatest growth potential. And we think that our sales staff is very, very attuned to their needs, and is in great contact with them on a regular basis.","Kenneth Hill \u2013 Barclays","","Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital, your line is open.","","Jillian Miller \u2013 BMO Capital","","Thanks guys. Just going back to the VIX complex, you have this aggressive education plan for 2014, and I think on slide eight you have got OTC users, asset managers, pension funds, insurance companies that you're targeting, I was just hoping you could give us a general idea, I know it's not by any means an exact science, but a general idea of like what percentage of each of those user bases are already using the VIX products, versus what you think that could be or should be at some point in the future?","Ed Tilly","","It's a great question, Jillian, and I think it's unfortunately my answer is going to be very, very similar to it has been in the past, every quarter, not every quarter but when we set new volume records, as we did first quarter, it tells us that there's so much more penetration to be had, that we're still really, really early. And the traders that we see today were really first movers, and we're still enjoying the first movers, and going out and teaching them what we see in the strategies we see, in both futures options trading as I said in the prepared remarks, trading all S&P volatility exposure across ETPs, SPX options, VIX options and futures, that we're able to then go out and convert those that haven't made the move yet in any of the categories that we've been talking about this morning. So again, I think I would just tell you that we're really, really early, coming off of just a terrific quarter again in VIX futures and options, that once we, if we see a plateau in the next few years, we'll certainly look back on this one and say yes, this was still in the early stages just like we told you last time, last year at this time.","Jillian Miller \u2013 BMO Capital","Okay.","Ed Tilly","","I don't know if there's any other color you would add Ed.","Ed Provost","","No, I think back to our RICs and how the agenda is setup, starting out with some pretty straightforward simple concepts, and move towards some of the most sophisticated concepts, and the sessions that are really the fullest are the ones that are at the learning of the basics of volatility. So there's plenty of people that are coming down there and learning about volatility, and are no doubt not yet currently using the product. I think between that and the visits that we have would suggest is a significant untapped user base out there, that we're trying to get to adopt to the use of these products.","Ed Tilly","","Jillian I know your question was primarily around VIX but we see the same thing when we look at Weeklys, and I had a recent trip to a couple funds in New York, their use of weeklys and the growth of weekly use was very surprising to me. It is such an easy lay off for hedge in the short term, that is how this one fund just began using Weeklys a short time ago. So it's not just VIX, it is really the awareness of an access to all things S&P 500, and the Weekly shares that story, much the same way as trading VIX futures and options do.","Jillian Miller","","Thanks guys.","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question is from Gaston Ceron of Morningstar Equity. Your line is open.","Gaston Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Equity","","Hi good morning.","Ed Tilly","","Good morning.","Gaston Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Equity","","I just wanted to go back to the seemingly never-ending HFT topic for a second. I hear what you said about I see very limited or I think you said no material impact on you guys from HFT activities. I was wondering would there be any kind of spillover affects into options though, if HFT were curtailed in some material way in the equities world, what would be the kind of spillover affect into options?","Ed Tilly","","Great question. I think the issue is first defining HFT. So let's just say in the broadest sense, or if you use the enough fluff piece book, and define HFT that way, if there was some curtailing of HFT in the frequency of trading, we could see the markets widen a bit in the underlying equity markets. Assuming that the debate does not include an entire national market structure debate, which I think there could be some benefits we can talk about those as well. But just the pure HFT, the ability to change your market in a ratio that currently exists today, and we curtailed that ratio, we cut that back a piece, we could see the spreads widen a bit in the equity market. The result not surprisingly may be a slight widening of the markets in the equity space.","That's probably the impact that we see at this point. I know it's very, very simple, but it would show up in the bid\/ask spread we can make an assumption in the options space. Now, that said, if the debate is broadened, and there's a market structure debate on dark pools, for example, that do not exist in the options space, and there was a movement to curtail dark trading and those trades showed up in the lit markets, then I think my answer is completely different, and the opportunity for all market quality would improve. Volumes would improve in the lit marketplace, and I think market quality and options would improve as a result. So we're so early in the debate and the potential changes to market structure, it's just how you define HFT, and then really how broad the market structure discussions and changes may be.","Gaston Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Equity","","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Chris Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Thanks. Hey guys, just a kind of a big picture question on your margin, great quarter, record quarter for margin, nice leverage in the model. I guess what I'm wondering though, as you guys are at 53 percent-ish today. If we look at the pure play futures operators, they have margins kind of in the 60% zone. So as your business continues to migrate more towards proprietary, do you guys think you could get the margin up to that level, or is there something maybe structurally that prevents you from getting there, whether it be having to support all the secular growth we're talking about on this call, or having to operate the multiply-listed options business, which might really hamper the margins? Any color on that would be helpful.","Alan Dean","","Sure, Chris. Alan here. I think there is room to grow margin, although that's a nice number, and I'm proud of the number we generated in the first quarter. Our first and foremost we're looking for profits to shareholders, and that's our focus. But the limitation really is just the variable expenses. So the royalty fees, trading volume incentives, some compensation is somewhat variable and tied to profitability. And that would be the limit, the top end limit to our operating margin percentage. There is room to grow, and it will happen in periods when we have high volume in our premium products like we had in the first quarter, and we've seen in other quarters, as well, if you look back historically four years we've been a public company, the big operating margin percentage quarters were always those quarters where we had big SPX and VIX volume. So there is room to grow, and there's no reason why it can't go higher.","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question is from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","","Just a follow-up and to put Alan on the spot here for a second, the D&A, $8.6 million in the quarter, if you run rate that out it's $34.4 million. Just trying to see what's going to jump to get to the $38 million to $40 million range, because that would imply close to $10 million a quarter in D&A?","Alan Dean","","Yes. The D&A is tied to our capital purchases, and when we put things into service we still believe that the guidance of $38 million to $40 million for D&A is good, and so that would imply higher D&A the remainder of the year, and so that's how we see it right now.","Richard Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","","Okay. Just wanted to say Go Bruins, that's really why I got back in the queue.","Alan Dean","","Oh, wow.","Ed Tilly","","Rich I thought you had another open interest question.","Richard Repetto \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners","","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is open.","","Alex Kramm \u2013 UBS","","Rich just asked my follow-up. I'll leave it at that. Thanks very much.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question is from Mike Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, your line is open.","Mike Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Just one follow-up for Alan on volumes, two points,- when you extend the hours to Asia relative to Europe, would you expect more uptake just given the users in Asia, typically are higher users of options. And then the second thing is, when you look in the market overall, when you see certain stocks like do splits, particularly when markets are hitting new highs, and you may have more new activity on the split front, are there any type of like options strategies that you would expect, like a pick-up in trading activity around those?","Ed Tilly","","So on the extended trading hours, Mike, we of course would hope and expect to get incremental business, that's clearly why we do it. We know that in our current trading hours some of the flow coming to us is from Asia through London. But by extending our trading hours as we're going to be doing in June, we believe that we will receive incremental business directly from Asia because we'll be open during those hours. So that's clearly what our expectation and hope is.","Your second question was, let's go back to the first just for a moment. One of the nice trades that we're seeing and enjoying in Europe that we would love to see develop coming out of Asia, in the prepared comments we said there's a trade now in V stocks versus VIX. We think that is going to be we think a continued opportunity for us, and look forward to the same trade between when we look into the Asian markets versus VIX. We think that has a potential to build, and with our partner Standard & Poors are out, we actually have our key strategy guy now in Asia. So that is an opportunity for us going forward as well. And what was the second question?","Alan Dean","","With respect to splits. I guess when you talk about that, I think of the Apple split coming up, and you take a product like that that's trading at $600, $700 and you're splitting it down, what is it, seven to one, or whatever the number was. Typically we've seen industry volume in the options increase. If the objective of a split is it will draw more investors into the stock because it's a lower priced stock, I think what we have generally seen is that's favorable to option volume. So as to specific strategies, it would be tough to comment on that, but splitting a stock of that number down to a smaller more investable size, which I believe is what the corporation's objective is, would generally result in the similar increase in volume in the options space.","Mike Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over for closing remarks.","Debbie Koopman","","That completes our call this morning.

I thank them for working with us throughout this major effort.","In return we are committed to continually upgrading our technology to meet their evolving needs and to provide them with unparalleled service. With that I will turn to our an overview of the trading and volatility landscape with an update on strategic growth initiatives to increase trading and our proprietary products.","Equity markets remain strong and volatile in the third quarter as ongoing global growth concerns continued. The Federal Reserve responded with rate cuts in July, September and earlier this week but in each instance remained non-committal regarding further easing going forward. We believe this uncertainty combined with a lack of concrete plans to resolve the U.S.-China trade war continued to drive hedging activity. Index options and futures volume at Cboe climbed higher in the third quarter. Index options volume rose 13% year-over-year led by a 23% increase in VIX options trading and a 6% increase in SPX options.","SPX flex open interest also hit a new all-time record high of more than 925,000 contracts. Cboe trade FLEX options to provide investors with a customizable way to manage risk and a centrally cleared alternative to the OTC market.","Auction based strategies used by mutual funds and ETFs continued to be a key growth driver. According to Morningstar data assets under management tied to options based strategies at a record $22 billion at the end of August an increase of 24% this year and is on track for one of the biggest advances of the past decade.","Looking ahead an index options trading we responded to customer demand by adding Monday expiring options to XSP our mini SPX contract which provides our customers with a smaller notional contract able to address their more granular risk management needs. In addition we listed October 20 and November 20 Friday SPX options explorations providing greater precision around options positioning going into the 2020 presidential election. Open interest grew to over 30,000 contracts in just the first four weeks of trading.","Turning now to 3Q, 19 VIX futures volume which increased 19% year-over-year primarily driven by robust volumes in August and continued growth in the volatility linked to ETP complex. Volatility linked ETP AUM reached 4.8 billion in early October its highest level since January 2018 and continues to be driven by growth in both long and levered long funds.","Long and levered long AUM represented over 90% of total AUM versus its previous high of just under 40% in January 2018. ","Education and client outreach is key to increasing trading in and expanding the customer base for all of our proprietary products. In September we hosted our 8th Annual European Risk Management conference held this year in Munich. The event drew a near record number of participants from 16 countries to explore the latest in derivatives strategy and risk management.","Industry experts delivered over 20 different presentations with themes ranging from how changes in margin and capital requirements will affect portfolios to how institutional investors use option strategies to manage risk.","Organic growth remains our primary focus. We continue to evolve our sales and coverage teams including adding top industry talent to better address our client's needs and deliver best-in-class risk management solutions.","Now turning to European equities. As announced this morning Mark Hemsley President of Cboe Europe is expected to retire at the end of February 2020 after 11 successful years of the company. Mark's many contributions include positioning Cboe Europe for future success by establishing a strong team of trading, technology and capital markets experts while Mark remains in Cboe for several more months I would like to take this opportunity to offer my sincere thanks for his outstanding leadership, deep industry expertise and valued counsel.","David Howson currently CEO of Cboe Europe is expected to succeed Mark. Since joining the company in 2013 Dave has worked closely with Mark to shape and drive our Europe strategy and has been to the driving force behind many of our successful product launches and technology initiatives.","Dave's appointment is part of a long-established succession plan and he has the full support of the Cboe global markets board and management team. In other Cboe Europe developments we recently launched our Netherlands-based trade reporting facility and trading venue to provide customers with an EU venue to conduct equities trading and trade reporting activities for European Economic Area stocks.","Our fully operational Dutch venue enables us to continue to service our PAN- European customer base should future political and regulatory developments hamper cross-border equity trading while also positioning us to further expand our business.","While overall European equities volume remain light in the third quarter closing auction volume continued to rise in Europe. In response this past August we\u2019ve launched Cboe closing cross which we designed to bring needed competition to the post closed trading session. The new service is intended to provide a cost effective one-stop solution for customers looking to execute their post trade trading activities across 17 European markets.","In closing I'd like to thank our team for the progress made throughout the third quarter and laying the foundation for our company's ongoing growth. Their ability to successfully conclude a massive technology integration and upgrade on time and with little to no disruption to our customers is to be commended.","Our unique and expansive products set now trades on one world-class platform. With this foundation in place we are redoubling our efforts to mine the considerable opportunities we see for continued organic growth at Cboe global markets. We will leverage our technology and efficiently focus salesforce and a new initiative to revamp our educational efforts to expand our customer reach to set new standards and trading resources and with our customers to define the marketplace of tomorrow.","With that I will now turn it over to Brian. ","Brian Schell","Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. Before I begin I want to remind everyone that unless specifically noted my comments relate to third quarter 2019 as compared to third quarter 2018 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results. Overall our net revenue is up 9% with net transaction fees up 7% and non-transaction revenue up 11%. Adjusted EBITDA rose 15% with margin increasing 380 basis points to nearly 71% and finally our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 22% to $1.29.","The press release we issued this morning in our slide deck provides the key operating metrics on volume and revenue capture for each of our segments as well as an overview of key revenue variances. I'd like to briefly highlight some of the key drivers influencing our performance in each business segment.","A consistent theme for Cboe this year has been the growth of our recurring revenue streams, a proprietary market data and access and capacity fees. Combined they increased 6% in the quarter and 7% year-to-date compared to the same period last year in line with our expectations for mid to high single digit growth in 2019.","We continue to see opportunity across all of our asset classes and believe that the completion of our technology migration will provide additional revenue opportunity over the long term as it relates to the proprietary market data about 75% of this growth this quarter was a result of incremental subscriptions and nearly 85% of the growth of our access capacity fees was also attributable to incremental units.","Now I'd like to turn to our segments. In our option segment the 10% or $13 million increase in net revenue was primarily driven by growth in net transaction fees and market data fees with non-transaction fees up 10%.","Index options average daily volume or ADV was up 13% for the quarter and revenue per contractor RPC was up 2%. With the latter reflecting a change in mix within our SPX products. In multi lift options a 15% increase in ADV was offset by an 18% decline in RPC reflecting higher volume based rebates as our market share moved up over 200 basis points year-over-year and 130 basis points compared to second quarter 2019 driven by increased member order flow.","Turning to futures. 28% or $8 million increase in net revenue primarily resulted from a 17% increase in ADV and 2% increase in RPC.","The higher RPC year-over-year primarily reflects the impact of new pricing implemented in the latter part of 2018 as well as lower volume based rebates.","Futures revenue also included $2.7 million from incremental equity received as a result of an agreement with American financial exchange related to the launch of FX futures on CFE. This income was included in other revenue and is not expected to be a recurring item.","Turn to U.S. equities. Net revenue was up 6% or $4 million primarily due to higher sip market data revenue as a result of audit recoveries of a similar amount. This increase was offset somewhat by a decrease in net transaction fees resulting from a 23% decline in net capture on flat [indiscernible] ADV. The net capture decline reflects fee changes implemented in the second quarter aimed at capturing additional market share. Market share with third quarter increased to 17.2% from 15.7% in the second quarter of 2019 and was down just slightly from last year's third quarter.","Net revenue for European equities decreased 7% on a U.S. dollar basis reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lower market volumes. On a local currency basis net revenue was down only 2% reflecting a 13% decrease in transaction fees offset somewhat by a 16% increase in non-transaction revenue. The growth of non transaction revenue reflects increases in access to capacity fees and other revenue which includes licensing and trade reporting revenue. Decline in net transaction fees was due to lower market volumes and market share offset somewhat by favorable net capture. The higher capture resulted from continued strong periodic auction and LAS volume. We attributed portion of the lower volumes and market share to the ongoing uncertainty around the timing and final outcome of Brexit and Swiss equivalency.","Net revenue global FX decreased 4% this quarter reflecting a 12% decline in market volumes offset somewhat by a 7% increase in net capture primarily reflecting the impact of fee changes made in 2018. In addition market share of 14.9% was down 70 basis points year-over-year.","Turning to expenses. Total adjusted operating expenses were about $97 million for the quarter down 3% versus last year's third quarter. The key expense variance was in compensation and benefits primarily resulting from a decrease in incentive and equity based compensation. Decline in incentive based compensation is aligned with our year-to-date financial performance versus targeted performance.","As a result of the year-to-date decrease primarily in compensation and benefits relative to our original expectations we are adjusting our full year 2019 expense guidance to be in the range of $390 million to $395 million down $15 million to $18 million from our previous guidance range.","With respect to our 2020 expense guidance we still expect a range of $420 million to $428 million which it takes into account among other things achieving our targeted incentive compensation in 2020, the absence of approximately $6 million in favorable expensive adjustments in 2019, transitioning to our new corporate headquarters in 2020 and moving our trading floor in 2021 which creates some short-term duplicate expenses. The benefit of synergies expected to be realized in 2020 from the C1 technology migration and the continuation of investing to support organic growth initiatives which Ed referenced to earlier.","We plan to finalize our 2020 expense guidance on the next earnings call once we have completed our 2020 business plan including any potential negative P&L impact from the amount of software development expense versus capitalized. With the final technology migration complete we are reaffirming our run rates energy target with a high degree of confidence. Chris Isaacson and his team concluded the technology of migration in line with the updated plan established in May of 2018. We expect to exit 2019 with $80 million of run rate synergies indexed to 2020 with $85 million. Note that the remaining $5 million of run rate synergies in 2020 will be reflected in a reduction in cost of revenues versus operating expenses.","Turning to income taxes. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 24.1% below our prior guidance and lower than last year's third quarter rate of 26.4%. The tax rate decrease was primarily due to benefits related to tax reform and recognized upon the completion of our 2018 U.S. federal income tax return.","We are adjusting our full year 2019 tax rate on adjusted earnings guidance to be in a range of 25.5% to 27.5% down from 27% to 29%.","We are also adjusting our guidance for capital spending to $35 million to $40 million down from $50 million to $55 million due to a shift in timing for leasehold improvements associated with their Chicago headquarters relocation. We now expect those dollars to move into 2020.","Furthermore we are reaffirming our guidance range for depreciation, amortization of $35 million to $40 million for 2019. Before I review our capital allocation activities we discussed the potential sale of our headquarters building in our last earnings call. I'd like to note that the cash proceeds from the sale the potential sale is expected to be less than $30 million and are not likely to be received until sometime in 2021.","Turning to capital allocation we remain committed to a disciplined and consistent capital allocation strategy that includes reinvesting in our business complimenting our organic growth, potential acquisitions and providing steady distributions to our shareholders through increased dividends and opportunistic share repurchases in order to maximize shareholder value.","During the third quarter we returned over $40 million to shareholders through dividends and $52 million through sharing purchases. Furthermore, earlier this week our board increased our share repurchase authorization by $250 million including this new authorization and share repurchase of over $55 million in October we had approximately $313 million of share repurchase authorization available at October 30th, 2019.","During the quarter we also used $50 million to reduced debt under our term loan agreement. Our debt now stands at $875 million and we have $250 million in availability under our revolver if a short-term funding need arises. At quarter end our leverage ratio stands at 1.1 times down from 1.2 times at the end of the second quarter and we ended the quarter with adjusted cash of $151 million.","In summary, Cboe is executing on a strategic initiatives and setting the stage for both short term and long term performance with our continued focus on defining markets globally, growing our proprietary index products, growing our recurring revenue streams, leveraging our freedom technology resources to focus on organic growth initiatives, disciplined expense management to leverage the scale of our business, delivering on our synergy targets, maintaining balance sheet flexibility and the capital allocation plan that allows us to invest in the growth of our business by returning capital shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.","With that I will turn it over to Debbie for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Debbie Koopman","Thanks Brian. At this point we are happy to take your questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits we'll take a second question. Keith? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Richard Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Repetto","Yes. Good morning Ed. Good morning Brian. First I want to give a shout out to Mark. I know he's been a big contributor to the European success over a decade now. So we're going to miss some. Next --","Ed Tilly","Thank you.","Richard Repetto","Next I guess Brian on the expense guidance you certainly outperform this quarter your load guidance for the year when we run through the numbers and take a look at what the guidance for next year that 420 to 428 compared to the midpoint of this year, I mean it still looks like an 8% increase at the midpoint. I mean it's and I would expect you'd still get some what you call carryover synergies. So could you walk us through how you're looking at where these the expense increases at least initially right now that you got a in those numbers? ","Brian Schell","Richard just to clarify you are talking about for 2020? ","Richard Repetto","Yes.","Ed Tilly","So as you look through the if you think about the math of how we're kind of getting to kind of that consistent kind of range that we put out there for 2020 when we walk back through I kind of gave you a list of items that you need to factor in your calculus for 2020 is and I'll walk through just briefly again is when you look at some of the items that we had a favorable impact of with a senior leadership departure there were some accounting adjustments there. I think we quantified that to $6 million, $7 million previously. When I personally like to add back what I'm hoping to target to make on incentive compensation for the entire organization. That's another you know quantify that call it $10 million to $15 million that would just rehab right back on to the expense base rolling forward.","When you look at the impact of the and we've laid out a table and thanks to Debbie Koopman working with the finance team and helping the analysts and the investment in you understand laying that table out today fully understand the timing and how those expense synergies hit our income statement is we're looking for all round here roughly $20 million of benefit coming into 2020 that we didn't get the run rate benefit of in 2019.","That's largely offset if you look at our historical core growth expense rate growth of roughly it's been ranging over 4% to 6% over time and if you take even at the low end of that roughly the 4% on a base of roughly $400 million that's largely offset the synergies that we incremental synergies back to realize.","So that puts us in the low for ten to fifteen range of expenses into 2020 and then we've as you've heard us talk about with the incremental investments that we're focusing on what we want to do as far as continuing to plow our efforts back into the organic growth of the business that's going to require additional operating expense.","We've talked about some of the duplicate short term expenses of some of the occupancy that we have and a little bit of a wild card there is and this is a really high-class problem to have with the wonderful world-class technology team that we have is that the efficiency of which they develop technology and how we look at our software capitalization process we do follow GAAP.","We absolutely follow GAAP but the spend that they have is such a smaller footprint and the speed of which they develop and implement it doesn't allow for a large accumulation of dollars on any one project such that it triggers our software capitalization development threshold. So that it enters the balance sheet and therefore it's just immediately expensed.","So while on a cash flow basis it's much much more efficient over time. It doesn't show up and it shows up as a short-term GAAP expense issue as if we're spending more money where in reality the benefit the organization is actually better from a cash flow standpoint and it just doesn't show up in a P&L basis until say 5-6-7 years down the road when the amortization of what has been capitalized eventually runs off.","So it's a wonderful problem to have and we'll highlight it for everyone and try and model that out but I shake my head look at Chris you're killing me but anyway so but it's a wonderful problem to have again with the efficiency and so that very quickly as you add those four, five, six items back into the run rate from 2019 we very easily get back to that range. ","Richard Repetto","Okay. Thanks for running through that and I won't make any smart guy comments about ","Alan being conservative. ","Brian Schell","I am sure he is listening.","Richard Repetto","I am sure he is. He is proud right now.","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from Kenneth Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Worthington","Hi, good morning. With the new technology launch for C1 what changes have you seen in trading metrics thus far and are the changes to trading functionality protocol that are now being implemented or contemplated for SPX or VIX as a result of the migration and then you mentioned the opportunity for new data access and other products as a result of the migration. So can you update us on your thoughts or even timing here?","Brian Schell","Yes good morning Ken. Thanks for the question. I'm extremely pleased to report on the successful migration and what we've seen thus far. As Ed mentioned we're now at a common world-class platform across our equity options and futures exchanges and what we've seen in the first four weeks today is the end of the fourth week post migration what we've seen thus far is the more deterministic platform. As Brian mentioned we're actually now already on weekly software releases.","So we've now found a new normal operations which allows us to better respond to our customers in a more agile way. There's better capacity, better risk controls and improved complex order handling as a major part of this integration we also made some pretty material enhancements to the VIX settlement process to improve liquidity.","You're asking about SPX and VIX, very pleased to report October 16, we had our first monthly VIX settlement as a result of those changes we traded almost 128,000 contracts right at the mid market. Those changes included providing better certainty for convergence of a traded settlement.","We have a lot better visibility and access into the auction because we're providing more granular market data to market participants. We improved the clarity of the rules around settlement and we are enforcing them systematically and this has all led to increased participation by members resulting in about a 40% tighter spread around the auction and so as a global leader and volatility we'll continue to engage with customers to see how we can continue to improve this process but extremely pleased about the overall migration what we're seeing thus far as well as that first VIX settlement.","You asked also about 2020 in the data platform. The data platform is really the one of the key initiatives we very excited about for 2020. Let's say we have really five goals with that platform. One to enable better data-driven decision making for us and our customers. Two to provide actionable insight within across all of our markets.","We want to standardize and monetize our historical data in a better way. We want to facilitate new tradable products and finally better define and measure our increased sales and distribution efforts that Ed and Brian both talked about across our customer segments and geographies but especially in our products.","So that data platform we're just getting started and we just finished migration. So we're in the design phase right now but we think this data platform is going to give us better visibility and the product usage, highlight capital and efficiencies that we can help solve and give us better cross market analytics and this is really us doubling down on previous investments we've made. Smaller investments if you think about investments that Cboe made with Livevol for enhanced derived data and even a previous effort in our FX market around liquidity management that has driven growth in that business line. We're extremely excited about this for 2020. ","Kenneth Worthington","Chris I think you left out the Silexx and FLEX integration and we called out flex and the growth of open interest. So maybe if you can touch on that a bit too because it does add color to enhancements for SPX and the product offering in a much bigger way. So maybe just a couple words on that.","Brian Schell","Yes. Part of the integration came we obviously bought Silexx about two years ago 2017 and we immediately saw the opportunity there to have Silexx as the front end to be used to enter flex orders and we showed you the flex growth this year that's been tremendous and with the migration Silexx is now the front end for all flex for our customers and on the first day on the first week we traded more than 100,000 contracts through the Silexx platform on FLEX and where we expect that we'll continue to add more features and functionality for FLEX. There's already a laundry list that folks have brought forward and we're excited to work through that list as we enter 2020.","Kenneth Worthington","And then I'd like to want punch one more of the points you made and I can't stress enough how capital efficiencies in recognizing potential offsets among our product sets that make or break the adoption of a new product and certainly we expect with capital efficiencies and identifying those margin offsets should increase existing customers being able to engage with new ways of our existing products in much bigger ways. So a lot of information coming as a result of the completion of this platform but it is a 2020 effort and it's what we want to deliver to the marketplace. ","Kenneth Worthington","Okay. Great. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Michael Carrier","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Hey Brian just two clarifications on the guidance in 20. So you mentioned that 10 to 15 million in incentive comp. I guess just not wanting you to predict volumes but just what environment or maybe metrics do you need to meet or hit that level just given that obviously 2019 was tougher for the whole industry and it seems like incentive comp is on the low side. So just want to make sure that's tied into like a similar kind of revenue environment for your expectations and then just on your tax guide, you mentioned the lower for 19 does that flow into 20 or too early to tell but any guidance there would be helpful. Thanks. ","Brian Schell","Thanks. Good questions for clarification for 20 and so on the 2020 I would just say that again this is all contingent upon a 2020 business plan and what we work with our board as far as where we are and what are those targets and as we set our compensation and what our target should be that is not final and obviously the extent that we can disclose things that we will and we can in our proxy things of that nature but broadly I would just say that it will have to be, it will be a better environment growth.","We are largely focused on growth and that incentive comp is there to be make sure it's an alignment with growth. So I can't really provide you the clarity on what those numbers are other than I can assure you that as [indiscernible] this sounds we are paid to grow this business and net shareholder value and so there's an expectation that the numbers that we deliver are better than where they were previously. So I don't mean to be flipped but I just don't have a specific metrics to give you on that number as far as those metrics go. ","Ed Tilly","Let me take it a little higher though Brian and kind of answer the question a little bit repeating what we said last quarter and well we've identified the demand from our customer base for more knowledge and product use case that investment in our team has already started and so the restructure redefined global client services team is really built and has been built over the last six months to better align the sales and coverage with our customers\u2019 needs. That's where it starts. If we align and we're going to tell our board that there's an organic growth story for 2020 and we have the team on the field ready to go that's how the incentive comp and that's how the structure changes and that's what we're going to be presenting to our board in the December cycle for a business plan for 2020 but it is an organic growth story that's already started with the people. ","John Deters","Michael this is John and just while we're on that topic also there's a an intentional tie-in here with what Chris was talking about in terms of our data platform build out in 2020 which is that we need to be able to understand very precisely where to target our global client services teams efforts and then once they've targeted those efforts in a particular area to benchmark our performance how are we doing reaching those clients and educating them. So all of this is really a kind of a holistic effort to accelerate our organic growth into 2020. ","Ed Tilly","The follow-up on the tax rate if you look at our tax rate and what's driving the lower numbers lower effective tax rate and I think if you look at in context for where we were in 18 where we've guided for 19 and then just a peak at 2020 and think about that the the lower numbers of what you've seen have largely been driven by discrete items that aren't necessarily as predictable clearly year-over-year and if you look at 2018 for example we had close to 4% of discrete items that kind of lowered our rate and if you look if you back that out that was roughly 29% an effective tax rate. If you look at the midpoint of 2019 and where we are and you look at the discrete items of where we are and we back those out we get close to that 28% - 29% level as far as where that kind of run rate goes. 2020 will largely be indicative of the level of discrete items that we have but I would say it's anchors around closer to that 28% - 29% range of what we've seen in 18 and 19 I know some of the other exchanges have talked about the foreign derived intangible income benefit that they've received and they recognize that benefit with some clarity around the 2018 tax return as they've updated their returns and received some final technical guidance. We do not have as large of a benefit from that just given the relative composition of our revenue base. There is some. It's marginal and it's just not the same order of magnitude as the other exchanges. So we don't expect that same continuation similar to what others have reported going into the 2020 rate. ","Michael Carrier","Alright. Thanks for all the color. ","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from [indiscernible]. ","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning everyone. I just wanted to follow up on Ken's question earlier about the C1 impact of the migration. In any color in terms of what the impacts may be from a depth of book perspective impact on spreads in the market just looking for something to kind of quantify market quality impact and also can you give us an update in terms of the key products for the trade continue to trade on the floor where they currently stand in terms of percentage of for based trading whether you've seen any impact from the initial migration? Thanks. ","Ed Tilly","Yes. Thanks Chris. I'll take that question. So yes I'd say it's a little early to draw any firm conclusions given we're just four weeks in and but it will just I want to offer thanks to our customers on the day after migration we all the customers are traded on Friday traded on Monday. So liquidity metrics I don't have any hard and firm market quality metrics to give you. All I can say is that the break between floor and electronic trading is roughly the same maybe a percentage or two higher or lower depending upon the day. We continue to see market share and volumes that are basically identical to what they were. For instance if you look at October the 11th the Friday after migrations of five days in our market share and our volume were basically identical to what they were on October the fourth which was pretty amazing from my perspective.","Thanks to our customers engagement and a great effort by the Cboe associates. So a little early to say on exactly how market quality metrics are going to be going forward. We can probably provide a lot more color on the next call on that. I did provide some quality metrics around the VIX settlement as I said 40% tighter spreads leading into that critical settlement. So what we've seen as far as positive but too early to have any firm conclusions. ","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Hey good morning everyone. Just wanted to shift gears to equity business for second. I think you gave a decent amount of color on kind of like the quarter-over-quarter pricing decline and the net capture decline. I just wanted you to flush it out maybe a little bit more and the reason why I ask is I mean obviously third quarter is a good volume quarter. Your volumes were up 11% quarter-over-quarter. But if you look at it in terms of the revenues for the whole segment even including the pickup and market data revenues to back out the orders I mean I think you may $3 million left quarter-over-quarter. So just wondering what you are doing exactly there because the math doesn't seem to make sense.","Brian Schell","Alex that's a fair point and we knew that going in that this is a versus managing it I'll call it quarter-over-quarter or either consecutive or year-over-year is that we announced we were very clear that we were not happy with the market share that where we were call it the second quarter of the prior year and we made those pricing changes and it was a series of pricing changes on the various exchange medallions and where we wanted to reestablish a higher number than where we were sitting and we looked at that as a long-term play is that we know that shorter term we could potentially have a slip in the overall net revenue number with some of the pricing changes we're making but we believe that the long term value of that business requires a level of market share that's closer to where we are today and such that it continues to promote the value of our market data, the value of our access capacity fees. So you have to look at it in combination over a longer term trend versus a quarter-over-quarter change is the way I'd encourage. It's certainly why we look at it so we encourage people to hopefully take that same point of view and they're looking at the value overall of what we're doing to manage that business. ","Ed Tilly","and Alex Brian covered it well but even today this was all in preparation for we would launch a retail priority today on the edge X book. The market share gain has primarily come on edge X where we're trying to invite retail back to that market now with this new feature that's not really based on lower net capture or buying the market shares based on functionality and priority. We're quite pleased with the progress we made in the third quarter exactly as we intended to do and as Brian said this is a long term investment in a business that we're committed to and we will continue to compete for that market share and to capture as we go along.","Alex Kramm","Make sense. It is competitive. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. Maybe just to go back on the expenses for 2020 and think about it in a different lens adjusted operating margin lens. So solid margin this quarter as we think about 2020 in that expense outlook is it possible to improve on this margin or do you view this third quarter as a high point and then just the different components of that maybe if you can comment on to what extent you think trading volume could improve as the results of the better liquidity and functionality of the new system and then Brian I just wanted to talk about the duplicate expenses from the headquarters transition that's in the 2020 number.","Brian Schell","Okay. I think there were [indiscernible] so I am going to try and maybe duplicate [indiscernible] I will try to group the expense questions together hopefully at those and then I think we'll move the trading volume\/improvement to liquidity as the last item will try to address and I'm sure the team look at me and they probably don't want me to but anyway. so we'll let's talk about the improve margin. So the margin that we have is that we have a margin threshold and we don't manage the business by I have to have X percent of EBITDA margin.","Again they are a short-term measure of how effective you were and maybe a particular quarter over a period of time and so we're looking at that, I think it's better to look at margins over at least on an annual basis versus any one quarter we had some if you look at for example we had some other income that hit this quarter that aren't kind of always part of the core run rate of what we're doing.","There were certainly activities that we did to earn that that income and if you back out some of those items the EBITDA margin was probably closer to that. It probably declines by a 150 basis points roughly of that 68.5% to 69% versus closer to 71 that we reported and a measure I do like to look at is as you look at performances what is the margin on the incremental revenues over different periods and in this particular quarter and you see this a lot or certainly we've seeing this when you introduce synergies and you're becoming more efficient a lot of times the margin on an incremental revenue is in excess of a 100% which we did in this quarter and that is reflective of the activities that we're doing, the cost discipline and a bunch of different circumstances but again that's nice to claim in any one quarter when it goes up like this and again that is not something it is inconsistent or said a better way it is something we would expect to see in an environment where we're seeing synergies starting to show up in an organization over the long term.","So are we targeting a excess of 70% margin in the future that would be great to achieve but that's not something we're driving. When we go into growth mode and we put in investment mode there may be some quarters where that margin may be slightly lower but as with all scale businesses when you see that incremental check up in volume at any one period of time you better see a very efficient margin on that incremental revenue which I think we've been able to continue to demonstrate over time.","On the duplicate expenses we'll provide a little bit more guidance to that as we roll in on the next earnings call as far as the overall order of magnitude and how that impacts the run rate but again that's just something that we want to provide some clarity on as far as that reconciliation coming out of 19 into 20 and again that's a short-term impact of more of a 2020 as we carry some of the costs of both locations really preparing ourselves for much more efficient 21 and 22 which is actually one of the primary reasons of moving the headquarters location and the trading floor is that this is a long-term benefit that we will achieve that won't show up on the expense side in 2020. ","Ed Tilly","So before I turn over to Chris for another comment I think on the system enhancements in the migration to one common platform I think it's important for us to look at volume doesn't originate with a technology upgrade. It really allows our customers to express their best market and to express how it is they like to be represented in the marketplace know better I think than this technology integration. So I think we'll get the best of their desires and their expression of risk going forward. More importantly I think if you refer back to our prepared remarks is the street the world is looking for us to provide with them the ability to hedge what is going to be certainly at this point looking forward and uncertain 2020 the listing and the open interest in November, October and November SPX series that's a first, first the demand to list and second the adoption of a new cycle and series around a presidential election and answering that need.","That's more telling to us and how we look at a potential evolve 2020. I'd also say there's a pickup an interest around the primary which we've never seen. So we're going into 2020 ready and I want Chris actually to be able to punch the readiness from a systems perspective but most importantly the team on the street as I said we've got the team who's going to be out in front of our customers explaining to them the opportunities the products use case is in what is already setting up to be uncertainty but Chris really I don't want to minimize though the importance of having this upgrade and having it completed. ","Brian Schell","Yes. I mean as that mentioned it's all about customers being able to manage their risk and represent their best interests and the technology should facilitate that. We believe it will facilitate that better over the long term with the massive migration as this was for us and our customers. Honestly they are still adjusting. These are the first few weeks. The new system feels a lot different to them than the old system and so they're still tuning on their side and I honestly expect that through probably the next month or two as they get the feel for it but ultimately I mentioned the hence risk controls better complex who are handling we believe it the functionality the technology is going to facilitate more trading over the long term and I mentioned already with those better risk controls, better safety also new features and functionality such as with flex to help facilitate those new products that are really catching on. ","Brian Bedell","That's great color. Thank you so much. ","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good morning. Maybe just sorry to do this but just one more on expenses. Just the long term organic expense growth rate that you mentioned that 4% to 6% historically and that's also kind of shaping that 2020 guidance but look at your peers globally most of them growing expenses in the 4% organic expense growth range just wondering if you could provide more color as to whether or not that that's 4% to 6% long-term growth rate is the right range going forward. How often that is that's under review by the management team and then also if you think it is yes where is the incremental expense been going versus your global [indiscernible] or a certain segment that requires more investment.","Ed Tilly","I mean that's a great question and I think that over time is that I don't think I have necessarily any incremental insight into \u201cthat longer-term nature of it\u201d I think that what we do focus on is I just go back to our strategy of what and I don't think that's a strategy all of a sudden it changes in 21 or 22 and I think it's been a consistent theme of this organization is driving our investment, driving our efforts into the growth of the proprietary product suite of what we do today and whether that's going to come in the form of technology, whether it's going to the form of and whether that's through a incremental hardware spend but we have such an efficient hardware footprint right now but that typically has not been a big expense driver as far as that growth rate goes.","If I look at the impact of our technology refresh from that hardware standpoint again that's not necessarily a big driver that's going to continue to contribute to a higher 4% to 6% growth rate in the long term. So I would say it's more around the activities that we have versus being able to identify that's going to show up in compensation cost. It's going to show up in facilities or it's going to show up in XY and Z it's more of I think what you would we look at it is what are the activities initiatives and projects around growing that core growth rate versus looking at specific line item is here's where I would expect it to see.","Ed Tilly","I think there's also a penetration aspect to the expense Brian and kind of touched on it a bit. We're distributing this unique product set way more broadly this is not a mature product and in order we want that face time. We want that interaction and we're willing to go out there as Brian points out and spend the money and the time to grow this product. We are not at the end of a life cycle in SPX VIX futures or VIX options and I think it's a big difference when you compare us to our competitors and what it is they look to a long term organic growth. It's a little bit puzzling to us. Organic growth for us is truly that we are growing this product.","Brian Schell","Yes. Again I think the point there is that it's you have to have that longer-term perspective. So, is that if there is something that we believe has a real strong growth potential that we need to pursue.","You could potentially see that expense number tick up in any one particular year but we have to hold ourselves accountable and make sure that has the appropriate return on that investment.","Ed Tilly","And by the way I think that growth profile, organic growth crop profile and our I think our performance goes beyond strictly the proprietary products are the way we look at data and growth and data when we target mid to high single digits that requires some investment.","And we do that because that data typically the data we sell supports incremental trading in our venues and our proprietary products.","So, it's this beneficial cycle. If we were looking at the whole complex in a low to mid single digits growth trajectory, that just implies very different expense growth profile.","Kyle Voigt","That's really helpful, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from f","Alex Blostein","Hey, good morning everyone. I was hoping to get your perspective on trends we've seen in October quite a challenging month for the industry as a whole but when I look at the proprietary products at Cboe big features, exceptions, SPX options. Things seem to be underperforming whether the cash markets or sort of other derivative buckets.","So, looking to get a little more color sort of what's going on underneath the hood whether the migration has caused any sort of temporary slowdown because if we look at kind of external metrics whether it's like ETP AUM or VIX term structure.","It doesn't feel particularly different than what we've seen in the past but the volumes look a lot weaker. So, kind of trying to get a sense what's going on. Thanks.","Ed Tilly","Hey Alex, I can't believe we made it this far into the call without a macro market observation from us. It's what we live every day we absolutely love it. So, happy to do that and I think you're right.","So, let's take the last week Monday and Tuesday of this week and compare those proprietary products the ones you outlined and we stack them together. You comparing them to Wednesday and yesterday and we see the effect in our volumes and just a small change or small adjustment in the market.","So, to your point 1.5 million to 1.6 million that product stack compared to yesterday 2.5 to 2.6 million contracts. It's a massive change in a short period of time and it's just a small change in the perception of the market.","And it's whether or not this upward trend that we've observed over the last months will continue or not and what happens on a small and slight correction.","Liken this to the observations that we had in the probably the second quarter call when we were looking back on the January and February volumes, this is the same. If you missed the rally at the end of last year started around Christmas Eve and continued through February, you played catch-up in the entire month of January and there was very little interest in hedging.","You're chasing the upside and how we measure that and what our observations is we look at the interest in buying upside calls as opposed to hedging and the engagement in our VIX complex and as SPX how the money puts. So, three weeks ago call buying was at a one-year low everyone was focused on downside and since then call volume demand insures to a one-year high.","So, that's that catch up. We look at the trends in the marketplace and we understand what how our customers are engaging and while no model can predict the future, we do see patterns in the past and we look how our customers are engaging going forward.","So, I go back to the observation in the demand and in and around the anticipated uncertainty for 2020 and I am very comfortable after watching yesterday and the day before that there is customers ready to engage back into hedging when you're done chasing.","And so, that's the color over the last two weeks or so and more to comment in real-time is as often as we can update you we'll be happy to do that but that's what we do.","Alex Blostein","Got it. But that migration itself didn't really have much to do with the protocol.","Ed Tilly","I would say it had nothing to do with volumes because you just see the engagement, it's instant, when there's a need to come back and hedge and if again if it's global risk dollar-denominated you come to Cboe period.","Alex Blostein","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And then next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Thank you. Can you guys give us your thoughts on the outlook for RPC kind of across the complex and then related to that with a migration of C1 might we see better stability in multi-list RPC.","Ed Tilly","So, I would look at let's start with we'll start with U.S. equities. We've already talked about you heard it earlier comments about the competitive nature of that. And so, and with we don't see that competitive environment changing in any way.","Chris Isaacson highlighted our continued focus on continuing to bring functionality and in competitive and we talked about the retail priority and things that we are doing to continue to enhance our position and what we do and the benefits we provide to our customers not just through a pricing change.","So, but we don't expect that pricing environment to necessarily change or be radically different from the U.S. equity standpoint. From the U.S. options, we will talk it from the multi-list standpoint that is also obviously an equally competitive environment.","We've seen some of the benefits of I would say the various technology of what we're doing to where we are with respect to the Cboe migration platform and particularly when we see the multi-list we've actually seen an improvement on there.","But when we look at the factors influencing RPC or we look back in the third quarter, we have seen an increased concentration of the larger participants and the mix changes and market share on BCX, Ajax and C2 and we've seen a little bit of a shift in mix.","Also on the with when we saw the slight decline in the multi-list, you see the higher volume with the market maker rebate years resolving an increased volume based rebate. So, we've seen that happen and that's not a bad thing that's a good thing as far as --.","Brian Schell","Very hard to predict.","Ed Tilly","And very hard to predict as far as where that goes. So, have we potentially bottomed out? I think that we probably hit that bottom a while ago with respect to that whether it's a $0.05 or $0.06 net capture but it's obviously offset by incremental volumes and market share that we see within the multi-list.","With respect to FX, that's also a very competitive environment and we will see some ebbs and flows quarter-over-quarter. Again that's we've seen some growth in that business due to what we've done uniquely as far as our curated liquidity, the different products that we're bringing.","We've talked about full amount and what that's done and the different pricing around that. So, that's been a very nice growth story traditionally as well even though we may see some macro ebbs and flows that may depress some of the volumes. We continue to see reasonable efforts there from that standpoint.","John Deters","I just add on European equities as we've introduced new trading mechanisms like periodic auctions and Cboe LIS. The larger the trade size the less frequent the trades, the higher the capture is on that and that's helped us even as people are waiting for what's going to happen with Brexit though the RPC has gone up in the European equities business.","So, as we think about capture, yes we're definitely very competitive in the multi-list or competitive markets. But we're also looking at introducing and trading mechanisms that potentially can offer higher capture because they're providing more value in those trading situations to our customers.","Brian Schell","And then to wrap up on the proprietary. As Ed mentioned earlier, as far as where we believe where we are as far as our growth cycle, again this is not a ratchet up the price because we need incremental revenue and show that growth.","This is a unit story, this is a volume story, this is a secular story of how do we move that organic needle and it's not to RPC as far as a revenue standpoint. So, that's not a lever that we anticipate being a big driver for us going forward showing up in the revenue line item.","There may be adjustments due to some volume rebates and things that we've mentioned that would show up. There might be some mix shifts that might show up but largely it's not something that we're specifically planning on driving incremental revenues through price adjustments at the RPC line-item.","Operator","Thank you. And then the next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer & Company.","Owen Lau","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just following up Chris's comments related to ethics and retail priority program. Given the backdrop of zero trading commission, what has your conversation with the online brokers and other bookish firms like have been like over the past month?","So, in terms of allocating resources, do you think rebate would be more important than execution quality going forward in terms of getting the trade? And then finally, how are you going to position Cboe to capture any additional opportunity if there's any. Thank you.","Chris Isaacson","Yes. Well, and thanks for the question very astute questioning there. So, I think retail brokers are very focused on execution quality and that's the reason that we're bringing out retail priority today is they want a faster time to execution for their retail limit orders.","The marketable limit orders are already going to wholesalers but the retail limit orders can come back to the exchanges with the enhanced priority which will improve their time to execution. The zero commissions and how will impact those retail brokers and their order routing, I think they're going to continue to be very focused on execution quality.","In fact, in 2020 there's additional disclosure regime coming out around a rule called rule 606 that will demand more disclosure about routing practices which I think is a positive development. And there may be more scrutiny or focused on payment for order flow.","But this is why we are excited about retail priority. We think it's a win for retail brokers. It's a win for retail customers that they'll get a better trading outcome and we also look forward to bringing potentially in 2020 some newer type of functionality for institutional orders as well.","John Deters","Owen, I just -- this is John. I just I'd add it's a great points by Chris and I think a high level the way we think about this trend playing out. It's sort of a natural progression and it is a step zero is quite an absolute number. So, it takes people by surprise.","But if you wind the clock back 10 years 15 years, this has been going on. And we were sort of we meeting exchanges broadly, we were some of the first to feel the impact of competitive pressures. And our execution fees and equities have come down quite dramatically to a point where that's not the really the crux of economic conversation with the retail brokers.","More to Chris's point, it's around execution quality. Because if you're getting compensated through basically monetizing the bid-as spread, you have to make absolutely sure that your customers aren't in some way being disadvantaged.","So, you have to have the right algorithms in place, you have to have the right data to back up that analysis, and that's where we really help about the retail brokers. They're great friends of ours overall. They're democratizing finance that should grow the pie and that's what we like to see over time.","Owen Lau","Thank you very much, that's very helpful. ","Operator","Thank you. And as there are no more questions to present, now I would like to return the floor to management for any closing comments.","Debbie Koopman","Thanks. The second bit of call this morning. We appreciate your time and continued interest in Cboe Global Markets.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded.

During the course of the call this morning, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ed Tilly.","Ed Tilly","Thank you, Debbie, and good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on our strong third quarter of 2018 at Cboe Global Markets where we increased our adjusted earnings per share by 19% year-over-year to $1.6 with net revenue of $271 million. Our solid financial results enable us to continue to invest in our long-term growth while returning nearly $84 million of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Trading and SPX options continue to grow at a double-digit pace, increasing 12% for the quarter over Q3 2017. We saw trading volume in VIX options and futures slowly build month over month throughout the quarter then surge in October as volatility increased. And investors around the world turned to Cboe to manage the risk.","Other volume highlights for the quarter included ongoing success in our FX market where average daily notional value for the third quarter rose 19% from the prior year. We also saw continued growth in our European equities business with increase in market share and volume.","I\u2019ll look now at the volatility landscape throughout the quarter and beyond. As major stock market averages hit all-time highs and we are now in the longest running bull market in history, we saw the VIX futures term structure returned to its normal upward sloping shape along with steady volume increases in our VIX product complex.","As we expected, the lingering effect of the February market shock that led to a flat VIX term structure in the second quarter was unsustainable. And we began to see growth in trading strategies used to capture volatility risk premium, volatility hedges and return of large trades in VIX options.","The return of higher volatility in October that led to record volumes in SPX options and VIX futures was fueled by an 11% decline in the S&P 500 comparable to the move we saw in February. Yet the VIX index and VIX futures suggest that the current volatility environment is substantially different than what we experienced earlier this year.","We expect to see changes in the VIX index when markets move and risk expectations change. We believe the difference this time is that the correction was not compressed over just a few days as it was in February, rather we saw an orderly repricing of risk that has occurred over a period of weeks allowing traders to monetize hedges in both SPX and VIX options and reposition their exposures tactically.","Regardless of market conditions, we remain focused on our commitments to product innovation, seamless training solutions and leading-edge technology. Product innovation remains the cornerstone of our growth strategy. I\u2019m pleased to report on our entry into the growing corporate bond marketplace with the successful launch of futures on Cboe iBoxx iShares High Yield Corporate Bond Index IBHY on September 10, and Investment-Grade Corporate Bond Index IB on October 8.","Cboe Corporate Bond Index features were designed in collaboration with Markit and Blackrock to enable Markit participants worldwide to hedge positions and gain exposure to key segments of the roughly $8.8 trillion Corporate Bond market. We were encouraged by the strong market quality we saw right out of the gate which we see as a testament of its design and utility of the products and to our close collaboration with our liquidity providing community.","Volume and open interest continue to build in line with our expectations for these early days of trading. We are enthusiastic about our prospects to steadily increase use of these products and look forward to further expanding our presence in the space with additional products going forward.","Turning now to Cboe Europe where we are 10 months into MiFID II and the solutions we put in place for this new regulatory regime continue to see strong adoption. Our periodic auctions book has established itself as a leading non-continuous platform while our relationship with BIDS Trading continues to blossom.","Our Block Trading platform, Cboe LIS powered by BIDS technology logged another record quarter with \u20ac200 million and daily volume. We continue to diligently prepare for a Post-Brexit World. We are in the process of establishing an EU venue in Amsterdam which will allow us to effectively serve our customers in the absence of an agreed exit deal between the UK and the EU. We\u2019re currently working with the Dutch regulators and preparing to onboard customers to our new venue. We are also monitoring Brexit negotiations and will be prepared to respond as quickly as possible to any developments that can cause us to alter our strengths.","Turning now to the final migration of Cboe exchanges onto Bats proprietary technology, we are now fully engaged in a multi-phased migration of Cboe options exchange and are on track to reach our migration target date of October 7, 2019. We are pleased that we are now less than one year away from our ultimate goal of providing our customers with a single world class trading experience across all our equities, options, and futures markets.","Given the recent attention on equity market data fees, I\u2019ll take a moment to provide our views on an important matter before closing. First, I would like to reiterate that Cboe\u2019s growth strategy as it relates to market data revenue has been and remains focused on expanding our user base. We are confident in the value proposition offered by our suite of competitively priced market data products across asset classes. These offerings are tailored to meet the needs of our customers and we will continue to innovate in this arena to meet customer demand.","With regard to the recent SEC opinion which did not involve Cboe directly and the SEC order which implicates some Cboe filings, we believe the SEC exceeded its authority in issuing the order and last week filed a motion requesting the SEC to vacate its order. We stand by our products and our fees and are hopeful the SEC roundtables clarified some of the misunderstanding concerning exchange market data fees and that our motion requesting the SEC to vacate the order will prevail.","While litigation could likely take years to resolve, we remain focused on building upon the product development and growth initiatives that drove our strong third quarter and our continued strong volume through October.","In closing, I would like to thank our team for continuing to lay the groundwork for future growth with a successful rollout of Cboe Corporate Bond Futures by continuing to provide seamless trading solutions for our customers and by advancing our technology integration. I look forward to all that we can accomplish to power of the potential of our customers and shareholders in the months and the quarters to come.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian.","Brian Schell","Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to third quarter 2018 as compared to third quarter 2017 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.","We report another quarter of solid financial results. In summary, our net revenue was up nominally with net transaction fees down 3% and non-transaction revenue up 5%. Adjusted operating expenses declined 3%, adjusted operating income of $171 million grew 2%. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 19% to $1.6. It\u2019s worth noting that these results were achieved despite a decline in volumes in our proprietary products reflecting our more diversified mix of revenue.","The press release we issued this morning and our slide deck provide the key operating metrics on volume and revenue capture for each of our segments as well as an overview of key revenue variances. I'd like to briefly highlight some of the key drivers influencing our performance in each segment.","In our options segment 2% or $2.5 million increase in net revenue was primarily driven by increases of $3.4 million in net transaction fees from our multi-listed options and $2.4 million in access fees offset somewhat by $4.9 million decline in net transaction fees from index options. Index options average daily volume decreased 14% for the quarter reflecting a 47% decline in fixed options of offset somewhat by a 12% increase in SPX options. However, as Ed mentioned, Index options volume improved month over month throughout the quarter in both VIX and SPX.","The impact of a decline in index options ADV was offset somewhat by a 10% increase in RPC resulting from a shift in the mix with SPX options accounting for a higher percentage of volume as well as pricing changes implemented at the beginning of the year. The 6% ADV increase in our multi-listed options business was primarily driven by higher industry volumes. Our market share was down from last year\u2019s third quarter as we continued to focus on optimizing our overall net transaction fees reflected in an 11% increase in RPC for multi-listed options for the quarter.","Turning to futures, the decline in net revenue resulted from a 28% decrease in ADV and a 3% decline in RPC, offset also somewhat by growth in non-transaction revenue. RPC was lower year-over-year due to a shift in the volume mix with fewer block trades which have a higher revenue capture. However, third quarter RPC was up 4% compared to the second quarter, reflecting the impact of fee changes implemented on August 1, as well as a more favorable overall mix.","VIX futures volume picked up in the second half of the third quarter and surged in October as volatility heightened setting a monthly volume record for October. VIX futures had ADV of 420,000 contracts in October up 79% versus the third quarter and 58% above October of last year.","Turning to U.S. Equities net revenue grew 2% primarily driven by increases in net transaction fees and exchange services and other fees. As we expected, SIP market data revenue fell 12% and proprietary market data increased 27%. As an industry los cost provider we plan to continue our focus on efforts on growing our proprietary market data by attracting new customers and innovating to meet client needs.","We continue to expect downward pressure on SIP market data revenue, apps and auto recoveries due to initial consolidation and historical trends. Net revenue for European equities increased 21% on the U.S. dollar basis and up 22% on a local currency basis reflecting growth in both net transaction and non-transaction revenues. Debt transaction fees were the key growth driver reflecting favorable net capture and higher market share on relatively flat market volumes.","The higher capture resulted from strong periodic auctions volume and LIS volumes which have higher relative net captures as well as price changes implemented January 1, this year. Net revenue for Global FX grew 20% this quarter as we maintained our strong market share at 14.8%, up nearly 2 percentage points year-over-year. The growth reflects favorable market volumes, stronger market share, and a disciplined pricing schedule.","Turning to expenses, total adjusted operating expenses were $99 million for the quarter down 3% compared with last year\u2019s third quarter. The key expense variances or one lower depreciation and amortization primarily result of the accelerated pace recognized in 2017 and the retirement of certain assets in 2018 and two, lower travel and promotional expenses due to target reduction and advertising related expenses.","We are reconfirming our full-year expense guidance to be in the range of $420 million to $428 million. While we expect to be at the lower end of that range, it will depend on fourth quarter volume levels as about a third of our compensation and benefits expense is variable and will suffer just based on our financial performance and other metrics. For the third quarter we realized $5 million in pretax expense synergies primarily from compensation and benefits bringing year-to-date expense synergies to $12.2 million.","Turning to income taxes our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was approximately 26% slightly below the low end of our annual guidance range of 26.5% to 28.5%. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the third quarter of 2017 was about 36%. The decline primarily reflects the favourable impact of corporate tax reform.","We are reaffirming we expect the annual effective tax rate on adjusted earnings to be within our guidance range of 26.5% to 28.5% for the year with the tax rate for the fourth quarter expected to be at the higher end of that range. In addition, we are reaffirming our guidance for CapEx of $35 million to $40 million and for depreciation and amortization of $43 million to $48 million.","Moving to capital allocation, our strong financial results, cash flow generation and financial position enabled us to continue to invest in the growth of our business while also returning capital to the shareholders. We returned nearly $84 million to shareholders this quarter to nearly $49 million of share repurchases of our common stock and $35 million of dividends.","Year-to-date through September we have repurchased approximately $1.3 million shares of Cboe common stock under our share repurchase program for nearly $141 million representing 1% of shares outstanding. We ended the quarter with adjusted cash and investments of $138 million and our leverage ratio was unchanged from last quarter at 1.6 times.","In summary, Cboe delivered solid quarterly results and continued to demonstrate our focus on growing proprietary index products, expanding into new asset class by launching the first broad-based U.S. corporate bond index futures, growth in a diverse set of revenue streams, disciplined expense management, leveraging the scale of our business producing higher profit margins and integration plans that continue to be on track and ongoing focus on capital allocation by continuing to return capital to shareholders to quarterly dividends and share repurchases.","We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter results in our outlook for 2019 on our fourth quarter earnings call in February.","With that, I will turn the call over to Debbie for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Debbie Koopman","Thanks Brian. At this point we\u2019d be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits we\u2019ll take your second question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Richard Repetto","Yes, good morning Ed, good morning Chris, and Brian and Red Sox, Ed did you mention the Red Sox?","Ed Tilly","Rich I was about to, outstanding, what a season man. Okay can we take the next question please?","Richard Repetto","I wanted to start off positively and I guess, the first, I know you are going to get a lot on market data questions, but I guess I\u2019ll start off on the volume and the sustainability of volume. Is that what you are pointing to on Slide 6 and 7 that increased volume that the VIX spike was different, much different than February? And then can you point us to any other anecdotal, or factors that would say that, hey, you know that the stuff we saw in October might be a little more sustainable than the drop off we've seen after February? Thank you.","Ed Tilly","Yes, thanks Rich, great question. So 6 and 7 are exactly to your point. The difference is you look at that spike and in the prepared remarks really happened in a short period of time and did not give the market time to adjust in an orderly way as risk was being repriced. So yes, those two charts warn just a big spike and the difference and then the term structure difference as a result.","What\u2019s different this time aside from a 30 or 40 day reprising risk going forward is the shift in the term structure in the back months. That indicates to us that the market is saying that the events that caused the correction in October, that 11% correction or so, we\u2019re not through that information. We haven\u2019t digested all that information yet. So Fed language around rates going forward haven\u2019t fully absorbed what that means, elections and the outcome and the uncertainty around a shift perhaps in partisan power.","Trade talks and the President's continuing making comments in the marketplace around trade, we don\u2019t know, the market is saying, I haven\u2019t seen past these events, I\u2019m shifting the cost of risk over time. That is a more sustainable and orderly adjustment to the market. What we then look for and what we hear from our customers are a shift from, hey, I\u2019m going to capture roll down premium as a normal market environment to, I mean strategies that will employ strategies at an elevated VIX level between 17 and 22.","What am I going to do differently this time that I wouldn\u2019t have done in a spike scenario in February? So we think that this is a much more healthy move in the market, more sustainable and the months to come as certainly returns to the marketplace perhaps we\u2019ll see another shift in the VIX term structure. But for now, I think that this uncertainty an elevated follows here to stay.","Let me go one more step into the weaves and if we look at single stock volatility, single stock volatility is at a really a high we haven\u2019t seen since August of 2015. What does that imply? Correlations are low and individual stocks that worry about EPS has raised volume. So the entire marketplace is in a higher volatility environment than it has been in the past. Hope that helps Rich.","Richard Repetto","Yes, very helpful Ed, thank you.","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from Daniel Fannon with Jefferies & Company.","Daniel Fannon","Thanks, good morning. I guess to start with market data, you mentioned the SIP revenue being down in the quarter and kind of continued to be down going forward. I mean, just thinking about volumes in the fourth quarter and shouldn\u2019t that be somewhat of an offset to that trend? And then I guess just looking at the rest of your market data, could you give us a sense of kind of how you\u2019re thinking about growth in those businesses beyond some of the headwinds I guess as we think about the traditional kind of equity side?","Chris Concannon","Sure, it's Chris, I\u2019ll take that. So with regard to the SIP I think we\u2019ve always mentioned that the SIP is relatively flat to down over the last ten years actually. So we don\u2019t look at the SIP as a growth engine of market data revenue. Obviously fluctuations of market share does determine our share of the SIP based on the SIP formula, so as market share moves the sharing of the revenue in the SIP will move with it. Now in higher vol. we tend to see a higher market share for the exchanges versus the over-the-counter market and that can lead to higher revenue as a result of the formula and sharing of the SIP revenue.","Looking at our market data across the entire complex and I'm including our FX strategy, our European strategy, our future strategy, our proprietary product strategy, and equities, we are looking at a very competitively priced market data offering with multiple types of offering from top a book [ph] to depth of book [ph] products all of which are in large demand by our clients and priced we think highly competitive in the market.","So it's really a growth strategy by adding users not a pricing strategy unlike some other competitors that we see in this space. So we continue to use the competitively priced offering that we have both in equities and options and we see hopefully adding users as a result of those competitive prices.","Daniel Fannon","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks good morning folks. May be just to get back on to the October trends on the volatility, maybe just a different way of looking at it, can you talk about the customer usage dynamics as opposed to sort of the market conditions but more of to, what extent you've seen a shift in the types of customers and types of strategies that are being used and are you seeing more people come back to it that were previously dormant during the summer? And then looks like we're seeing a mix shift towards SPX options from VIX options in October compared with what we saw in the first quarter, so if you're sort of weaving that in as well.","Ed Tilly","Sure, so really I think you laid it out right. If you look at the different products and what are the users doing, I think in VIX options we saw a great monetization of long haul positions that have been put on in the months prior to October. Again hedging, using the increase in large VIX trades that we saw basically after the last earnings call, what a great time to monetize those positions. So we saw a lot of that in the VIX option complex. We also see just the outright buying of VIX puts, this is a mean reverting contract and a term structure that is in backwardation which is really on not a normal state.","So we see a lot of the outright buying and puts and saying look at I am going to take a position and just selling this asset that seems to be elevated well beyond its mean. So that's a difference that we had not seen over the last quarter. SPX options to your point are - this is the easiest market to monetize a hedge in SPX options. Not surprisingly, you've seen the open and close in the range and even the overnight range. That makes it really, really a market that's easy to monetize hedging positions in SPX.","And then in the VIX futures, again, if you look at VIX options just look at the asset class vol when we're in this backwardation selling that front month is a strategy. VIX is beyond, VIX futures are above its mean taking a position we see our customers doing just that, and then also rolling out of that front month into back month when back month is cheaper. So, there's a lot of strategies that we have not seen over the last quarter that our customers are employing now.","As for the mix shift, SPX has continued to grow all year and VIX options have really picked up what we did to everybody 800,000 contracts in October. That's pretty remarkable return to VIX option strategies. So all in all the complex is very healthy, but we will see that rotation in and out of SPX and VIX as market conditions and expectations of risk change.","Brian Bedell","I mean even if the curve inverts a little bit here like it had done in late October just a little bit, you don't see that as impacting a flat curve or inverted curve instead if that's a headwind on the futures?","Ed Tilly","We haven't got there yet, we're still. You're right. These last three or four days of an upward move in the market has lessened the backwardation. We'll, go to flat, flat if you recall from the last earnings call is the most uncertain market from a trader's perspective, really no long lasting opinion on vol. The difference this time again back to Rich's question is the shift in the back month.","We think that the market's saying the uncertainty is sustainable. So again strategies around 17 to 22 will become really interesting and we think we'll hear a lot about that in our risk management conferences in the next few months as opposed to roll down premium strategies from front month 13 and mid-month up in 15 and 16.","John Deters","In terms of VIX, this is John in terms of VIX options. A lot of the strategies Ed was just describing are incremental in this market environment. So the strategies that we've been seeing people employing long VIX calls they just still alive out of the money VIX calls are still reasonably priced because of the orderly move we've seen. So that's still an impactful strategy people are using for hedging their exposures to equity baskets.","Chris Concannon","Yes, and this Chris. I'll just add that not only did we see a record VIX futures month in October, but we're also seeing growth in the ETP complex during the month of October. So we're growing AUM in that complex as well as seeing added futures volume in the complex and really comparing October and higher vol that we've seen versus February. February was like a bird strike, it was a real spike in the VIX complex that is much harder for traders to handle versus a much more orderly increase in VIX throughout the month of October.","Brian Bedell","Okay, that's great color. Thanks, I'll just get back in queue for a different question. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. ","Michael Carrier","Hi, thanks a lot. Maybe just a question on the European equities, so you guys are seeing good strength both on the revenue side, the market share I just want to o get your sense, when you look at the outlook, I guess you view the sustainable as some of the competition come back in or are some of the changes with method, you are just making it like the haves and have nots and you think that, you can continue to opportunistically gain in this environment?","Ed Tilly","All right, it\u2019s a great question. We're very excited about our opportunity in Europe. It took us several years and hundreds of thousands of man hours to build out our method solutions and our partnership with BIDS was built out took us at least a year to build that strategy out. So it would take substantial investment by the competition in Europe to build out all of the various offerings that we have that provide literally MiFID solutions for our members. And that's part of the growth that we're seeing in Europe, but also the continued growth is in our LIS exchange book we're seeing higher market share, at higher capture rates as well.","So, in terms of MiFID's overall goal of moving flow from the over-the-counter market to the exchange market, that has been successful and we're seeing and feeling the benefits of that. I don't see many of our competitor, I'll call it our exchange competitors with offerings any new offerings that will come into the market. Many of them have offerings that compete with our products while we continue to grow market share against those offerings, so our large in scale offering or periodic auction, they are our alternatives in the market and we continue to grow against those alternatives.","So we're excited about Europe. We do have as Ed mentioned on his prepared remarks, we do have a Brexit strategy laying in wait. We can execute when we get clarity around Brexit. But we feel good about even with a Brexit, a hard Brexit we'll be prepared with our method strategy to go forward.","Michael Carrier","Alright, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you, a nd the next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citigroup.","Ben Herbert","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to touch on non-U.S. customer growth and particularly volatility products, just if you're seeing any pickup in interest there or the pace of the education cycle?","Ed Tilly","I think the first look we get at is really in the European trading hours and the direction from where that floor originates difficult. Some of our European customers come through a New York trading desk, but I think what is most useful for us, most telling for us when there's market uncertainty, perhaps in the European hours or even the Asian trading hours are extended trading hours VIX futures really spike. We've had some amazing days in October in excess of 40 and 50,000 contracts before the U.S. market opens, difficult to track origination other than the conversations we have with our customers because as I say some of the European desks some of the Asian desks come through a New York route.","But key to us is the utility of this product being open near 24 hours a day and I think from our perspective that just shows the reach of the liquidity and the usefulness of being open near 24 hours a day. What I will tell you is we'll get some firsthand feedback we're having our first risk management conference in Tel Aviv next week, so hearing directly from those that are making their trading decisions primarily outside of the U.S. trading day will be very telling. We have a very, very big turnout in excess of 130 people signed up for our first ever risk management conference in Tel Aviv. Chris, anything to add?","Chris Concannon","Yes, I would just add, when we look at Europe and our growth opportunity we're fairly excited about our current user base in the VIX complex. We just had a risk management conference in September in Dublin, where we got to have intimate conversations with those users and some of our new users in the complex and they were unfazed by the February events. And really looking at the end of a bull market a true 10 year bull market and looking to put on hedges on their portfolio and lock in some of the long years of return. So, very encouraged by our growth opportunities throughout Europe and some of the current users in Europe.","Ben Herbert","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to kind of dig into pricing power, a topic we talked about in the past. You called out again some areas where you've changed prices. Behind the scenes we've seen a bunch of others as well. Maybe talk about how you're approaching the leveraging of pricing power and what I'm really curious to hear is, how much revenue growth we might expect in a typical year all else being equal from price increases?","Chris Concannon","Hey Ken, it's Chris. I'll take that question. I appreciate the question, a little bit sensitive about the word pricing power. We certainly don't exercise pricing power in the market data world. We offer a very competitively priced product. If you're, I think you're referring to some of the pricing moves that we've made this year across our complex. We have made some pricing moves in equities where we certainly don't have any pricing power and our market share declines that you've seen in 2018 are a result of us not moving price, not moving on capture, but we have had the benefit of higher volumes and higher revenue across our active equities complex.","If you look at our recent pricing in VIX futures and our recently announced pricing in VIX futures for customers, the customer range, we did make some adjustments in our VIX futures complex. Those adjustments have been optimal for us in terms of repricing a number of our clients that we're on an old pricing schedule on putting in tiers, so people have incentives and we've seen the benefit of those incentives certainly in October. And the recent pricing for customers was really trying to match our customer fee schedule to our member fee schedule introducing frequent trader. So, some of our larger clients, our larger customers will have incentives volume incentives that are built in similar to our member fees.","Ed Tilly","And then I think specifically to the second part of the question, we've always anticipate that the greatest increase in revenue will come from new customers and the expansion of adoption of our products going forward rarely, and I can't even historically I look back that we don't count on our growth coming from a pricing power certainly, but even from the movement upward in price it really is further adoption.","Chris Concannon","And if you look at our VIX option strategy, where we compete aggressively with the over the counter market, the swap market in particular, we have repriced to capture large blocks. We did that in 2017. We continue to look at that opportunity. We've had the benefit of that pricing here in both October and now in November. So we are using price as a leverage to increase volume and not leverage to increase our capture.","Ken Worthington","Okay great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Thanks, hey guys. Can you give us an update on the improvements you've made to the VIX settlement process and in particular wondering whether there's still more work to be done there, and then related to that, have you noticed any volume leakage from certain customers as a result of the new settlement process?","Chris Concannon","So great question, because we've put a lot of work into this area, really focused on increasing the liquidity of the auction. When we looked at the liquidity in the auction earlier in the year we wanted to increase not only the participation of our members but also the levels of liquidities that they were providing into the auction. Most of our work was around transparency in the auction, where the imbalance information was being disseminated, how it was being disseminated, and then putting in place certain rules that we worked closely with the SEC on to ensure that clarity around our market makers participation and providing liquidity into the auction.","Providing offsets to published imbalances was a key, and so not only did we work on the transparency of the imbalance, but also rules that assisted our market makers to come in and offset those imbalances. We've seen, what I'll call healthy settlement auctions over the last several months as a result of some of these moves and as a result really the most material change was moving SPX to hybrid and providing for an electronic market maker offering where we saw more market makers moving in with streaming prices during the auction, so that that was a huge assist to the liquidity that we needed in the auction.","And with respect to what's coming, the largest change to our auction will come with the migration to the C1 platform where we will be using Bats technology to run the auction. We'll be publishing the specs and discussing those recent changes in the coming future, but we think the enhancements that we've made to our liquidity and our liquidity providers has helped a great deal in the most recent auctions.","Chris Harris","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hey, good morning guys. I was hoping to learn a little bit on what's going on in the non-transactional side of the options business. I think, legacy Bats talked about opportunity grow market data in that part of the market, that part of the business and it's been kind of flattish over the last couple of quarters. I guess so what's going on there and do you guys still expect to see some growth there? And on the flip side the active season multi visitor options have actually been growing pretty nicely. So maybe kind of dissect the trends in both buckets and what should we expect going forward?","Chris Concannon","Alex, can you repeat the second part of the question?","Alex Blostein","Yes, so the access fees in the multi visit options was kind of the opposite of what we've seen in market data, that\u2019s actually been growing, so what's kind of been driving the growth there?","Chris Concannon","Great, it's great question, so as it's a healthy balance of growing share and charging for people to show up to put share on your platform. So we've had a, I can think a very healthy balance of trying to grow share and making our platforms attractive as far as they compared to some of the other platforms in this space and you have to appreciate that we are doing migrations at the same time.","So when it comes to charging for non transaction revenue we're very sensitive, when we're trying to have our clients migrate platforms. So we've been hesitant to be very aggressive in the non-transaction space in options while we go through these very large migrations. With regard to the transaction fees, we made a decision to whole price and not be as competitive on price.","And we've seen some market share decline in the multi list options space, but that's obviously offset by higher volumes and higher capture. So we were happy with our strategy in our multi list options business as we did reap the benefits of the higher volumes that we're seeing in 2018 as compared to 2017. But again you have to appreciate we're in a migration strategy here in 2018 going into 2019 and we've been very cautious on how we're charging for not only market data, but also access to those platforms.","John Deters","Alex, this is John. I think, when you look at options market data really opera's is the big driver there and that\u2019s the Chris\u2019s perspective on market share. But let's say Opera has been a data stream that hasn't been growing in value as robustly as the SIP data on the equity side. It's another reason I think why we're very encouraged by the trends thus far 2018 year-to-date in terms of multi list and overall options volumes when you have OCC clearing over 550 million options contracts in a month in October, the whole market is appreciating the value of options a lot more and while it's a lagging metric, I think we'll see options market data becoming more valuable to the market.","Alex Blostein","That's helpful thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good morning and maybe just another question on VIX, when you're thinking about the ability for Cboe to drive adoption of all trade from here, I know you have your big risk management conferences, but outside of that can you talk about selling more directly into end clients instead of more relying on your bank partners to drive adoption? And I guess more client segment of the VIX user base, do you see as having the longest runway for growth from here?","Ed Tilly","I think it's a great question and before I turn it over to Chris just on the business development plan going forward. I think if you look at the easiest conversion for us are those that already employ basic overwrite strategy. When I say those, these are not small individual customers, but rather they are funds that already are engaged in the SPX complex. That is really - the lowest hanging fruit for a conversion into and recognizing the benefits of having a multi approach and strategy to hedging, one that doesn't involve direct hedging into a ball complex and not just the SPX. We've talked about that rotation, but that's the easiest. So we're really talking about advisors and really in the insurance industry that has S&P 500 exposure embedded in many of the contracts. Those are the easiest to convert because they get the power and the utility of derivatives to begin with.","Chris Concannon","I mean, I think that it\u2019s we are dependent on our relationship with our bank partners. They are a wonderful sales force in the VIX complex, in the vault complex, so we will continue to rely on our bank partners in the distribution of the product. But we have taken a direct distribution. We do think it's critical to our long term strategy to have direct distribution, so whether it's here in the U.S. talking to pension funds, insurance companies or even the consultants that are employed by those pension funds, we are now actively engaged in conversations with those users.","When you go and look at Europe we are having direct dialogue with the end users throughout Europe. It's a wonderful opportunity for us because we are talking to the same institutional clients with our large in scale offering through our partnership with BIDS. So we are establishing direct relationships for both equities and now our VIX complex and our SPX complex in Europe and so it is a direct sale. We do that sale with our bank partners. They ultimately are bringing the products to our exchanges but we are now engaged in the direct sale of our products to the end user.","Kyle Voigt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous.","Vincent Hung","Hey, so I don't want to bring back the angry Chris from last week, but anything, what issue if you think resonated with the commission at the round table based in the way you saw things play out? One of the issues is that these debates sound really new to the commission. They have probably hurt their soul behind closed doors over the years, so it's hard to get a sense for what is incremental to this debate?","Ed Tilly","Chris, I think maybe you can start with the willy-nilly approach that SIFMA taken in their attack on the industry?","Chris Concannon","Great, thanks. Great question. I was expecting a market data question, so I might be prepared. So yes as you point out this is a long running debate. This debate goes back over a decade and it has been obviously engaged at the commission level and with our clients. It likely won\u2019t be resolved in the near term because of the litigation that's involved NASDAQ and NYC litigation is underway already, so it could take several years to resolve the specific market data debate. So we have a long road ahead.","As you think about it, SIFMA was hired by large investment banks, by HFTs by dark pool operators, internalizers, people that compete directly with us to challenge all of our filings or a handful of our filings, those challenges were quite random. While half of the filings were market data related, the other half were largely related to access services and products that we offer connectivity on. Some of those filings included filings that actually lowered fees and some of them include filings that we had no fees associated with it. In fact some of our filings were renaming products specifically. So as we look at it we sit in a fairly unique industry, I've spent most of my career in the exchange space.","It's quite laughable when I hear someone say it's not a competitive space, it's a space where you have your own competitors, can see what you're doing through SEC filings, you have your regulator that can influence what your strategic direction is. You have your largest clients, competing against you by offering dark pool and internalization strategies.","And you have your largest clients every five to eight years introducing a new consortium an exchange or a new consortium to directly compete against you. So when you think about a brute ECN [ph] back in 2002 and Bats itself was a consortium, Direct Edge was a consortium, Philadelphia Stock Exchange was a consortium, NSX was a consortium.","So you can see there's random new entry into this space and the Justice Department ironically finds the level of competition to be fierce and approves the consolidation of exchanges on a regular basis. So you\u2019d really have to be an ostrich with your head in the sand to conclude that there was no competition in this space.","As I think about the roundtable, the roundtable was actually quite helpful because it was the first time really in the debate where the exchanges were able to provide unique information and data that really laid out the competitive offerings of these products and really the optionality of many of the products that the clients have. So I thought the roundtables were helpful for the exchanges given the unique information that was provided. Ironically, much of the data that we are able to provide will assist NASDAQ in New York in laying out their groundwork for their litigation that there is in fact competitive pressures on price and on the offering.","And now if you take a step back and look at the economic rents involved here, you have some of the largest investment banks having record revenues, you have some of the largest brokers enjoying record earnings and margins as a result of consolidation and you have with higher volatility HFT's enjoying unique margin growth as a result. So when you look at our fees, really what the analogy that comes to mind is a bunch of golfers sitting around drinking gin and tonics complaining about the tips they have to pay the caddies at the Country Club.","So it's a unique debate that we're having given the economic rents that our clients are enjoying in this quarter. So when I take a step back and look at this, this is a debate that will continue, a debate that will go on and on, and my answer has gone on longer than necessary. Ed is starting to look like Rip Van Winkle at this point, so I'll end it right there.","Ed Tilly","And just shy of angry Chris which was really good.","Vincent Hung","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Hey maybe a follow up to that last one, when you think about the market's data. When you think about the market data debate is there a risk that you could win the battle but lose the war in terms of alienating the broker dealer community that you depend on for distribution in order flow and not just in U.S. Equities, but all of your other contracts and you were just talking about how you, they are a partner kind of distributing and educating people on VIX, so is there that risk that you might come up against?","Chris Concannon","It's a great question, one that we are careful about. When you think about the pricing that we have in our offering, we are one of the most competitively priced exchanges in the space. Our prices are lower than the competition. Many of the filings that have been challenged where we had no price and we are offering a small price increase for the first time. So when I think about our offering, when I think about the size of our markets and the efficiencies that we provide, I'm confident that our clients aren't terribly offended by our taking a position that we have some rights to charge for these offerings.","Recently we're able to get a product offering through the SECs process approach for that is a wonderful offering for our options clients and our options market makers. It is priced and it's priced competitively, but it allows for risk management, buying options, market maker, a critical risk management for an options market maker. So, many of our offerings were offerings that were provided by client demand, priced very reasonable.","I think we were caught up in what was really a SIFMA challenge of all exchange filings across the board somewhat indiscriminately. So when I think about the battle, it's a battle of exchanges that are trying to defend their ability to price product. But it is as you pointed out a battle with some of our largest clients, but we're very confident in the competitively priced products that we offer on the transaction side and on the non-transaction side.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is a followup from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks very much. My follow up is for happy Chris actually. Just on the market data, maybe if we just looked past the litigation, let's say the litigation gets resolved favorably for the exchange industry, I've just making that assumption and everyone sort of comes back to the table and looks at the long term picture of the SIP versus proprietary data. I mean what's your view of how the SIP could potentially be restructured?","I guess if you were to think about a way that could be restructured, how would you envision that happening or just you know more realistically, the interplay between SIP and proprietary market data for the industry in the long term?","Chris Concannon","Sure, it's a great question and one that was obviously the roundtable spent a lot of time talking about. As I think about the SIP, you have a congressionally required offering through statute that the SEC has to wrestle with and will wrestle with for years to come. It would require major SEC rule writing to change the structure of the SIP that's one option.","The second option is, the industry and the exchanges come to the table and achieve some compromise on a new structure whether it's new offerings within the SIP or structure of the governance of the SIP, that would require all the exchanges to file NMF [ph] filings under the plan for the SIP, so each exchange would have to agree to that, those new structures and make filings.","I think there is an opportunity to do something on the SIP. We had for a long time been expressing our willingness to be very flexible with regard to the SIP governance. Certainly if you'll listen to the roundtable, there was I think an openness among the exchanges to think about adding additional information to the SIP or thinking of new ways to structure the SIP.","So I do think I'm encouraged by exchanges coming to the table and making offerings of compromise in light of, what I'd call a fairly public attack on exchanges that is coming from DC. And so, I do think there's an opportunity for compromise on SIP structure down the road. Unfortunately, the litigation puts us all in a position where it's difficult to negotiate when you're involved in litigation which could take many years.","Brian Bedell","It's interesting so it will be really pushed down the road quite a bit until litigation gets resolved effectively?","Chris Concannon","No, not necessarily, but if you're involved in litigation, you're going to be very cautious where you compromise with the same parties that are filing briefs against you in litigation. So I do think, it's a difficult time and if there are continued public assaults on the exchanges, it's hard for us to come to the table feeling in the mood of compromise. And so, I think we're in a difficult time. I think we\u2019re passing the difficult time when it comes to public debate and hopefully go behind closed doors and have an open dialogue around SIP structure and things that we can do creatively on the SIP.","Again, I don\u2019t think any of the exchanges except maybe IEX who is new to the SIP, looks at that revenue and thinks it\u2019s a long term growth driver for our businesses and the SIPs are moving it faster speeds than ever before, so when it comes to this notion that there is a two tiered market, there is really not when you\u2019re talking about SIPs moving at 30 mics again that\u2019s faster than IEX moves, so the SIPs are faster than IEX. So I think, when we think about the two tier market it doesn\u2019t exist at that level. But again, I think the exchanges expressed a willingness to compromise, I\u2019m encouraged by that. I just hope that the public assault gets turned down a notch.","Brian Bedell","Okay then just quickly on the spikes contract by Miami options exchange, and Chris you tried to launch a volatility lookalike at when you were at Bats just a quick comment on whether you think that has any potential to get going and challenge the VIX or not so much?","Ed Tilly","So this ED, let me start with that and spikes actually is the contract that you\u2019re referring to that that Bats was going to bring to the marketplace. But really as the recognized leader in listed volatility trading with our futures contract it's a bit puzzling this late in the game after an approval what exactly the VIX, I'm sorry, the spikes contract would be using for hedge. There is not a futures contract, so that's not the first time in the industry that there's a VIX lookalike introduced to the marketplace.","We've got very successful ETP products we commented on that earlier. Hedging in those ETP products really it fuels our VIX futures complex today. So if there's any success in spikes absence futures contract, I would expect hedging to incur in our VIX futures complex similar to ETPs.","Chris Concannon","I think there's only going to be more VIX lookalikes that doesn't raise any concerns for us. We benefited by the adoption in any and in a variety of ways to volatile exposure.","Ed Tilly","We're all for our customers recognize the utility of mixing in volatility into their hedging strategies I think we will benefit as a result.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you and the next question also is a follow from Rich Repetto with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Richard Repetto","Yes, I know the call has gone on quite long and at the risk of let nagging Chris out of his cave again, I got a question, there's a certain SEC Commissioner has made comments about exchanges and a number of the licenses, the medallions you hold, could you just briefly go through the reasons why you have as many medallions as you do?","Ed Tilly","Sure, there is a really good analyst that wrote a piece on this Chris.","Chris Concannon","I think I read it. So Rich, it is a great question. Look, if you think about the way exchanges are regulated in the U.S., it is a fairly unique business model unlike most businesses. We have a standard pricing and a standard model that we have to deliver in a single exchange license. The SEC has really never allowed unique pricing by client and really never allowed unique structures within the exchange, same exchange model. So we are building exchanges for certain client demands, certain market models and certain pricing models by exchange and that's really part of the development of exchanges.","Obviously the SEC chose to introduce Reg MS [ph] and its top of book protection and that has certainly influenced the value of introducing another exchange on top of a single exchange model. So as exchanges consolidate, they don't migrate on to one platform and one exchange because each exchange has a unique business mix, each exchange has a unique client demand imbedded in it, and each exchange has a unique pricing model as you can see across all the different exchanges that we operate.","Now in light of the transaction fee pilot, we have talked about introducing a fifth exchange and we obviously have six medallions that we can use. Again, it would be, we view the transaction fee pilot as a price control pilot that would once again restrict pricing of exchanges requiring us to introduce an additional exchange book to have additional flexibility on how we price. And then last, I'll mention a commentary around exchanges. I've been in this space for a while and going back, probably in 2005, I don't - this might come as a surprise to you Rich, but sometimes I don't have a great filter on what comes out of my mouth.","Richard Repetto","That doesn't surprise me.","Chris Concannon","In fierce competition, someone at the SEC called and said that it is important to compete but it's important also to remember investor confidence and the integrity of the national exchanges is the most important piece of this investor confidence. So when I think about the public debate and the dialogue, we have to take into account investor confidence in our national markets because it's just not appropriate to attack so aggressively that we damage that investor confidence.","Richard Repetto","Understood, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And as there are no more questions, I would like to return the floor to management for any closing comments.","Debbie Koopman","Thank you. That completes the call this morning. We appreciate your time and continued interest in our company. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."],"4249":["CBOE Holdings, Inc.

I am pleased to report another year of record financial results at CBOE Holdings. Despite low volatility and lower trading volumes industry-wide in 2015, CBOE Holdings posted record volume in our index trading complex led by all-time highs in SPX options and VIX futures. We also significantly expanded our premium products and global customer reach, while forming new alliances to complement our core strengths and diversify our product offering.","The ability to further develop trading in our premium products, while optimizing our operational efficiency, drove new annual highs in revenue and earnings, making 2015 our company's fifth consecutive year of record financial results, enabling us to reward shareholders through increased dividend payments and share repurchases. CBOE continues to lead the industry in all options trading by a significant margin. In the very competitive and fluid multi-listed options arena, CBOE implemented pricing changes that resulted in lower market share, but higher revenue per contract in 2015.","At the close of the year CBOE ranked 2nd among the 13 options exchanges with a market share of 15.7%. We further adjusted pricing in 2016 and, for the month of January, CBOE ranked 1st among all options exchanges with a market share of 16.8% in multi-listed classes. Our mission for 2016 and beyond is to be the leader in providing innovative products that facilitate and enhance trading in a global marketplace. Our strategy is straightforward; continue to develop unique products, expand our customer base, form alliances that leverage and complement our core business, and continue to define and lead the options and volatility space globally.","While product innovation is central to our value proposition, we are equally committed to further developing our current products. CBOE's S&P 500 Index, SPX options, remain the most actively traded U.S. index option and, after 32 years, continue to thrive and grow. Average daily volume in our SPX options in 2015 rose 6% for a third consecutive year of record volume. Gains were driven largely by strong Weeklys trading, a product that has attracted retail investors to our largely institutional SPX marketplace. We've seen a strong start in 2016, with January SPX average daily volume increasing 19% compared with the prior year and 33% compared with December.","As recently announced, we plan later this month to introduce SPX Weeklys with Wednesday Expirations. Wednesday Weeklys, in addition to end-of-week expirations, will increase opportunities to trade SPX and enable investors to better target specific expirations. Wednesday Weeklys will also align with the Wednesday expirations of VIX Weeklys futures and options, providing greater trading flexibility for the increasing number of customers who use both VIX and SPX products.","Turning now to VIX futures and options. Historically low levels of market volatility dominated much of 2015, punctuated by significant volatility spikes in the third quarter. While VIX options average daily volume was down 9% from last year's record pace, VIX futures posted a sixth consecutive record volume year with a gain of 2% over 2014. Elevated volatility, and less certainty in the marketplace going into 2016, have driven dramatic increases in VIX trading. In January, VIX options and futures trading was up 34% and 19%, respectively, over January 2015.","Expanding our VIX offering and marketplace is a major opportunity and priority in 2016. We continue to leverage our VIX methodology to create new products, as evidenced by the debut of VIX Weeklys futures in July of 2015, followed by VIX Weeklys options in October. VIX Weeklys options averaged 35,000 contracts per day in 2015. We expect continued growth in 2016, given our ongoing business development efforts and the inherent utility of Weeklys trading.","In other VIX news, we plan next month to begin overnight dissemination of the spot VIX Index. As you know, VIX measures the real-time implied volatility of the S&P 500 options. Our implementation of extended trading hours in SPX, from 2 a.m. to 8:15 a.m. Central Time, enables us to calculate and disseminate VIX in that time period, thus allowing market participants to view volatility during the overnight session through the same lens used in regular U.S. trading hours. Overnight dissemination of VIX will yield valuable real-time volatility information when news breaks overnight and will allow overseas investors to reference VIX during their regular trading hours, further cementing the role of VIX as the world's gauge for market volatility.","Leveraging partnerships with index providers is key to product innovation at CBOE. We became the sole U.S. provider of major FTSE Russell Index products in 2015, beginning with the Russell 2000 Index RUT options in April. I am pleased to report that January was a strong month in RUT options with average daily volume of 106,000 contracts. We plan in 2016 to further leverage our concentrated index options liquidity pool, while expanding our customer base through joint marketing and educational efforts with our FTSE Russell partners.","Last quarter we launched options on the Russell 1000 and the Russell 1000 Growth and Value Indexes and we plan to launch options on the FTSE 100 and FTSE China 50 Indexes next month. The global exposure afforded by our exclusive U.S. offering of FTSE Russell products, as well as MSCI products, brings a growing international dimension to our index options franchise.","CBOE continues to identify synergies and form alliances that leverage our strengths and enable us to efficiently diversify our product and business lines across new regions and asset classes. In the fourth quarter, we announced our partnership with the London Stock Exchange Group and major dealer banks in the launch and development of the CurveGlobal interest rate platform, which will trade on the LSE Derivatives Market and clear through LCH Clearnet. We anticipate a second quarter launch of CurveGlobal with trading in futures based on major European interest rates. Additional products, including potential new products from CBOE, are expected to follow.","Also in the fourth quarter, we teamed with Environmental Financial Products, EFP, for the December 11th launch of the American Financial Exchange, AFX, an electronic marketplace for small and mid-sized banks to lend and borrow short-term funds. CBOE now hosts, operates and is helping to develop AFX, which saw a total value of $326 million of unsecured overnight loans transacted in January, its first full month of trading. We anticipate increased trading in 2016 with the expected participation of additional banks and with new product offerings. AFX plans to launch a 30-day, unsecured loan product, as well as other new products, including a new transaction-based interest-rate benchmark for U.S. interbank lending called Ameribor.","CBOE continues to leverage the marketing and educational efficiencies afforded by a comprehensive suite of CBOE Index options and volatility products. In support of an increasingly global product line, we are actively engaging a worldwide customer base through an ambitious educational agenda and by facilitating access to our products and markets through trading technology.","Last quarter, in collaboration with the Singapore Exchange, SGX, we launched the CBOE Options Institute at SGX, the first extension of our educational facility. We also expanded our Risk Management Conferences, RMC, with the first CBOE RMC Asia, which successfully debuted this past quarter in Hong Kong. I'm pleased to announce today that this year CBOE plans to establish its first international business development outpost with the opening of an office in London.","In what we see as groundbreaking opportunity to expand options and volatility trading, CBOE last week made a majority equity investment in Vest Financial, an investment advisor that provides options-based services through packaged products and develops technology solutions for options-based investments. The Vest managed account platform is accessible through financial advisors and designed to provide investors with access to the same investment tools and protections available to institutions and high net worth individuals.","Our investment in Vest allows for enhanced integration of CBOE's proprietary products, strategy indexes and options expertise within Vest's platform, which substantially reduces the complexity of options trading while providing investors with targeted protection, enhanced returns, and a level of predictability unattainable with most other investments. Vest also plans to launch Unit Investment Trusts, Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Products.","I'll close here by thanking the entire CBOE team. As a result of their ongoing efforts, we significantly expanded our product line and increased index trading throughout 2015, despite challenging conditions. We are obviously pleased with the uptick in trading we saw in January, but regardless of the ebb and flow of trading volume, our team remains focused on developing new products, expanding our customer base, and forming alliances that complement our core strengths.","Maintaining that focus enables CBOE to continue to define and lead the options and volatility space globally, an approach that continues to serve our customers and shareholders alike. We are energized by the early year-to-date momentum and by the significant opportunities in 2016 to write the next great chapter in CBOE's ongoing growth story.","With that, I will turn it over to Alan Dean.","Alan Dean","Thank you, Ed, and good morning. Thanks to everyone for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results. This morning, I will walk you through our financial results for the quarter and then provide guidance on certain financial metrics for 2016.","While CBOE Holdings produced strong results for the quarter, we do have a difficult comparison","against last year's record-setting fourth quarter. A brief summary of our results for the quarter are shown on this slide. Adjusted operating revenue was $154 million, down 8% compared with last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income was $73.9 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 48%, down 540 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders was $48.9 million, a 9% decrease compared with 2014's fourth quarter, while adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 8% to $0.59.","Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the fourth quarter of 2015 include certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck.","Turning to the details of the quarter. Adjusted operating revenue decreased by $12.5 million, primarily due to a decline in transaction fees resulting from lower trading volume versus the fourth quarter of 2014. Let me also note that adjusted operating revenue excludes $2 million, included in other revenue that represents the recognition of revenue to adjust for incorrect coding of transactions by an exchange participant related to prior periods.","Transaction fees were down $11.9 million or 10% from last year's fourth quarter, due to a 25% decline in trading volume, partly offset by a 20% increase in the average revenue per contract or RPC. Our blended RPC, including options and futures, was $0.408 compared with $0.34 in the fourth quarter of 2014. This increase resulted from a shift in the mix of trading volume towards our highest RPC products, index options and VIX futures, as well as an increase in RPC across each product category.","The RPC in our options business increased to $0.349 compared with $0.284 in last year's fourth quarter. The RPC on equity options and exchange-traded products increased by 43% and 36%, respectively, while the RPC on index options rose 4%. The RPC increases were primarily due to fee changes made earlier in the year and a decrease in volume discounts and incentives.","On the futures side, CFE's revenue per contract increased 4% to $1.69 from $1.62 in the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily resulting from a more favorable mix of trades by account type, as well as fee changes. As this slide depicts, the contribution from our highest-margin index options and futures contracts accounted for 40.9% of total volume in the fourth quarter versus 35.3% in 2014's fourth quarter. Converting the volume into transaction fees, you see that index options and futures contracts accounted for 83.1% of transaction fees, down slightly from 83.7% in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, proprietary products accounted for 82.9% of transaction fees, up from 81.8% in 2014.","Looking at other variables influencing operating revenue, access fees declined by $1.3 million or 9% compared with last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to a decline in the number of market maker permits. For the full year 2016, we expect to see a modest decline in access fees, which is consistent with my previous comments on this line item. On the plus side, exchange services and other fees increased by $2.4 million. This increase mainly resulted from higher fees for systems services and revenue contributed from Livevol technology services, which we acquired on August 7th. For 2016, we expect exchange services and other fees to increase to about $47 million, which tracks the fourth quarter run rate and is primarily due to the addition of Livevol.","Now turning to expenses. This slide details total adjusted operating expense of $80.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, up $2.4 million or 3%, compared with $77.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted operating expense excludes $1.9 million of severance expense in the fourth quarter of 2014. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015.","This next slide details core operating expense of $49.7 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of $3.2 million or 7%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily driven by a $4.4 million increase in professional fees and outside services, offset somewhat by a $0.7 million decrease in compensation and benefits. As was the case in previous quarters of 2015, the increase in professional fees and outside services was primarily attributed to our outsourcing of certain regulatory services to FINRA, which occurred in December of 2014. The decrease in compensation and benefits, primarily reflects lower salaries due to the staffing reduction that occurred in 2014 in conjunction with our regulatory services outsourcing.","Volume-based expenses, which include royalty fees and order routing, were $18.1 million for the quarter, a decrease of $2.1 million or 10%, primarily reflecting a $1.5 million decline in royalty fees and a $0.6 million decline in order routing. The decrease in royalty fees was mainly due to lower trading volume in licensed products, which includes index options and VIX futures.","Before I move on to taxes, I want to comment on other income and expenses, which increased by $3.5 million on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the dividend declared by the Options Clearing Corporation in December. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 36.7% for the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with 39.4% in 2014's fourth quarter. The change in the adjusted effective tax rate, primarily resulted from the preferential tax treatment on the OCC dividend income we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of 2015 was 38% compared to 38.2% for 2014. We expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 38.5% to 39.5%. Additionally, if OCC declares a dividend in the fourth quarter of 2016 comparable to 2015's fourth quarter, we would expect our effective tax rate to be lower in the fourth quarter compared with the first three quarters of the year, due to the tax treatment related to the dividend income.","Let's turn now to a few highlights relating to our balance sheet and capital allocation. In 2015, we generated more than $245 million in cash from operating activities. For the year, our free cash flow was $206 million and we distributed $208 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while also continuing to fund strategic investments and our growth initiatives that Ed highlighted.","For the year, we returned more than $73 million through dividends and more than $135 million through share repurchases. We repurchased over 2 million shares through our share repurchase program, at an average price of $61.63, reducing shares outstanding by nearly 3% in 2015. Since our share repurchase program was implemented in August of 2011, we have reduced our shares outstanding by 8%.","At December 31st, we had cash and cash equivalents of $102 million and $57 million remaining on our share repurchase authorizations. Our capital management framework remains unchanged. We are committed to funding the growth of our business and then to return capital to our shareholders through sustainable quarterly dividends and share repurchases. We are confident in our ongoing ability to enhance shareholder value.","Moving to our guidance for 2016, core expenses for the full year 2015 came in at about $195 million and in line with our guidance. You might recall, we started 2015 at a range of $195 million to $199 million and pulled back on expenses in response to lackluster volume we experienced earlier in the year. For 2016, we expect core expenses to be in a range of $211 million to $215 million, representing an increase of 8% to 10% versus 2015 and an increase of 6% to 8% compared to the high end of our original 2015 guidance.","The increase in 2016, primarily reflects higher expenses for outside services, largely related to our regulatory services agreement, and higher expenses related to the addition of Livevol. However, both of these items also contribute revenue that is expected to offset the incremental expenses. Excluding the expense increases related to these particular items, our core expenses would be up by 4% to 6% compared to 2015, which is in line with our baseline objective.","We expect regulatory revenue to increase by about $3 million, reflecting the higher expenses we plan to incur to carry out our obligations as a regulator, and we expect exchange services and other fees to increase by about $5 million, primarily due to Livevol. We also plan to increase spending to support our business development and marketing efforts.","Moving on, capital spending in 2016 is expected to be between $47 million to $49 million, up somewhat compared with the $39 million we spent in 2015 as we continue the development of our new trading platform, CBOE Vector. As we stated previously, this project is being done in three phases. Phase one is the build out of new systems for CFE, which is on track to be up and running in the third quarter of 2016, with CBOE and C2 to follow.","Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be between $46 million to $48 million, compared with $46 million in 2015. The year-over-year projected change reflects additions to capital and lower depreciation expense relating to certain regulatory software that will be fully-depreciated at June 30, 2016, which corresponds with a planned transfer to FINRA systems. Following this systems transition to FINRA, certain expenses are expected to shift from depreciation and amortization to outside services, accounting for part of the increase in outside services I mentioned in discussing core expenses.","We are off to a strong start in 2016 and are excited about the opportunities we see ahead, as we continue to focus on the strategic initiatives that Ed outlined, while also effectively managing expenses and deploying capital.","Thank you for your interest in CBOE. I will now turn the call back to Debbie, so we can take your questions.","Deborah Koopman","Thanks, Alan. At this point we would be happy to take your questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue, and if time permits we'll take a second question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Rich Repetto","Yes. Good morning, Ed, good morning, Alan. I guess the question is, you have done a very good job at increasing the RPC on the non-proprietary products, the multi-listed options and ETP. So but the market share is declining. Can you talk about what the strategy -- I believe you have sort of -- you have some price modifications in January and can you just talk about the outlook there because you said that this has been important to you in the past?","Ed Provost","Yes. It remains important to us. What I have said in the past is, it's our goal to stay at or near the top in multi-listed market share for CBOE and we have been able to do that. In the face of that the 13th options exchange came online last November. The 14th is due I think later this month. And so competition is ramping up and how they are competing as you know is through price and so we -- in 2015 we did lose some market share but RPC as you said went up nicely and we think overall revenue was better. Our market share got to the point where we -- keeping our goal in mind of being at or near the top of market share in the multi-listed category, we felt like we needed to change fees in order to maintain that position and we did that on January 1st. Based on the feedback that we received from our customers both in discussions with them and their actions, our market share as Ed highlighted in his comments jumped in January which was exactly what we hoped would happen. We expect RPC to decline consistent with the message that I have been saying for years, but related to the future, hence I don\u2019t expect precipitous decline, although we are one more up into the quarter so it's really hard to give anything definitive on there. While RPC is important our key focus is optimizing gross revenue by employing competitive pricing and extracting value where we see opportunity. And to restate something I have said before, the multi-list category supports market data revenue, exchange services and accessories, three important revenue categories for us. And so I was pleased with the uptick in market share in January, cementing our current leadership role in what I think over the long run RPC should decline with 14 options exchanges trading all these options.","Rich Repetto","Thanks for that insight. I will get back in queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Fannon","I guess I would just -- a little bit of comment on the environment in January and over time we have seen good and bad volatility in the market and just wanted a sense of how you guys are -- your customer are kind of acting in the current environment? How you kind of see this level of volatility being maintained and what that might mean for your kind of trading and the sustainability of it?","Edward Tilly","I will take a first observation. I think and what we have shared with you is the end users perception of risk over time and I think you're right. We are in a riskier environment than we have been for the majority of 2015 with the exception of the spikes we saw in and around August and the difference in strategy and the way our users employ our various products. When the downturn in the market is a result of something unforeseen, or something -- a new risk in the marketplace the index complex and specifically VIX really shows that in volumes. So August the surprises to the market were of course were making new all-time lows in oil. Uncertainty about China's growth going forward. It was front page news everyday and that risk profile was a changing risk profile and the volatility of VIX complex certainly reflected that in its volume. What's different in January and continues here in early February is the risks are the same. The headlines are the same. It is still uncertainty in China. Certainly we are still making new [Volvos] or trending lower in oil and that's reflected in very flat volatility surface in and around 21 maybe upward sloping somewhat to 22.5, 23 index. It's just reflecting a riskier environment. So where do our volatility traders or those that employ our various products what they look for? Well each of our products SPX primarily and VIX service different environments differently and provide different utility depending on the profile going forward. When there is an unperceived spike and you have a VIX position on, VIX calls outperform hedging in the SPX. If your perception of risk going forward is rather flat, maybe trending down, SPX puts are the favored hedge. So we see that continuing, as I say, we have real-time [or] into the risk profile as priced by our users by looking at the volatility surface over time. And what the market is telling us is we are in for a riskier next at least six months and as those perceptions change or evolve you will see it first and you can see it in real-time in the surface of volatility looking at those futures contracts. So I will use my interpretation of our data and it says that to ensure portfolio of the S&P 500 expect higher levels of movement in uncertainty certainly over the next six months.","Dan Fannon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Hi, Alan, maybe just on the guidance. When you talked about the expenses you mentioned the Livevol and then the regulatory and then the core in that 4% to 6% range. Can you just give us a little bit of color as we go through this year, if you have an environment where maybe the bad volatility is around, how much flexibility do you have with that range? And then it sounds like at the high end you are kind of expecting a fairly like decent environment just given that range. Just wanted to try to figure out how much flexibility you have if the volumes aren't as strong as what we are seeing right now?","Alan Dean","Yes. Mike, we do have flexibility, just it's the same level of flexibility approximately that we had last year and I am expecting the $211 million to $215 million assumes a robust year in volume consistent with our growth that we've seen in the past. So in 2015 we went from one -- we started expense guidance of $195 million to $199 million. Then we dropped and I am looking at Debbie here to help me out. I think we went from $190 million to $194 million and that was in July after the spring volume. So that was 8%, 9% drop in expenses and then we went back up as the year got better. So [incentive] comp came back and we reinstituted some things that we had delayed or cut. So I like to call it temporary short-term expense adjustments for a short-term problem and that's the kind of ability that we had to impact expenses and the intention is to, while we do implement these expense reductions to not impact our growth profile, that's important to us. So the same level of expense reduction in 2016 that we saw in 2015 is about what we can do.","Michael Carrier","Okay. It's helpful thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hill of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Ken Hill","So I wanted to ask international, so for you guys do you -- at the Asian Investor Risk Conference and in the extension of the options you said too and then your people making out an effort there as well. I was wondering, if you could disclose any volume stats or kind of trading outside the U.S. dollar setting? Normally you guys provide the VIX futures which has kind of trended around that 7% to 10% range of total volume. I was wondering, if there is any update to that and how you see that progressing next year?","Ed Provost","Ken, Ed Provost. Yes. We are very happy with how we have made a greater penetration internationally. Ed mentioned in his opening remarks that we didn't [drive] to the point of making a commitment of establishing our first business development output as we are calling it in London that reflects a broader customer base that we have outside the U.S. the extension of trading hours and the like. We are -- from everything we can know and that is from engaging our customers directly, hosting conferences overseas, participating in other peoples conferences, see an increased interest in our product both SPX and volatility. The expansion of our trading of our hours for the dissemination of the VIX spot will be helpful in that regard as well. So we continue to see greater interest and expect that the portion of our overall volume becomes from the extended trading hour session to grow. We certainly see that in absolute volume numbers but there are certainly trades of time where we see percentages much in excess of our historical norms. So we couldn't be more optimistic and again its consistent with what we are doing overseas. I will in speaking about Asia even expand that to the Asia-Pacific Rim because we are not involved in Singapore with the options institute and in Hong Kong with the RMC we still are quite active in Mainland China. We have relationships in Japan and we start a fair amount of time in a very developed Australian market. So we feel very good about the international appeal of our products and those will continue to expand.","Edward Tilly","Yes. I think I will add to the VIX futures, we also see -- certainly had an interesting January when we look at for the first time in the U.S. and certainly in the listed option market the ability to trade SPX in this options not just the futures and had a pretty interesting January and drew some interest in trading SPX in this options during our extended trading hours. So that almost more than doubled the average in 2015 to about 7,000 contracts per day in January. So again another opportunity for growth going forward. And then again highlighted in the prepared remarks, and having a spot VIX disseminated from 2 a.m. to the start of U.S. again, spot VIX really serving as a trigger for trading decisions and having that available from 2 a.m. till the open in the U.S. is really a nice change also for us.","Ken Hill","Thanks for the detail there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein","Alan question for you around the capital management, you guys have been pretty active in the market in the last couple of quarters. Just kind of curious to hear your thoughts around the relative value and how you are thinking about the pace of buybacks compares given the [indiscernible] given the fact that the valuation of the stock has been on the higher end of historical ranges? So how much does that matter to you guys when you are purchasing shares versus uses of capital?","Alan Dean","Well it does matter to us and you said we have been more active in the capital markets the last couple of quarters. I think we've been pretty consistent over the past three or five years even in our activity in share repurchases with a few blips when we were out of the market. But -- and -- so I think we've been consistently -- but consistent in the story that we have told shareholders and analysts and what our capital allocation policy is now. And I've also been consistent saying that we are opportunistic in how we buy our stock. So with a lot of analysis that goes into shares that we buy at one place rather versus another how we view our stock price. And so just generally speaking we will buy more stock when the price of our stock is lower and less when its higher. The bottom line is we believe, our Board believes that in the future of CBOE and the growth potential and the growth profile and so that makes the share repurchases I think a great way to return capital to shareholders. So that's the mindset that goes into our share repurchase program. And as long as I am on the topic I will just restate what our policy, our goal is and our goal is to reinvest in our business to ensure future growth and you have seen that during the year both in capital expenditures and the acquisitions that we made this year. And then secondly pay regular dividends and grew all those dividends along with our business, you saw that this year when we increased our dividend by $0.02 per share last summer. And you have seen consistent activity in our share repurchases. So that's the policy, that's the program. And finally I will say that our Board's very active in how we return -- in thinking about how we return capital earnings to our shareholders and we talk about it, think about it, every quarter. So I will end with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Worthington","When thinking about VIX futures and VIX options how important are ETFs and ETNs at driving volume in volume growth for the products? Maybe both directly as ETFs kind of grow and rebalance and if indirectly as volume from ETFs and ETNs drive other VIX trades?","Edward Tilly","We just got a great deal of thought on this internally and part of the story on the growth of VIX futures, certainly one of the key drivers was the introduction of ETNs and when Barclays introduced EFX, that rebalancing of the Barclays was required to do either by perspectives or by their internal list controls drove a great deal of these futures and options trading. And that was really part of -- a big catalyst to the growth story in and I will just say cash spinning 2.5 years ago now. So we are -- still an important driver but not the key driver any longer. I think the utility of VIX options and the amounts of liquidity in VIX futures and the ability to click and trade VIX futures around-the-clock, I would say that those strategies have replaced I think the key drivers in VIX futures and options volume. But I don\u2019t -- we love that volume with the growth of ETPs and ETNs that feature volatility exposure, all of that -- primarily most of that hedging shows up in some fashion and the other part as we have seen really equities within the SPX. So we rely heavily on the balancing and trading in and around ETNs and ETPs but not as much as we did a couple of years ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Just a question now on the RPC and the proprietary products. You commented on the equity options but on the proprietary, both VIX futures and proprietary -- and index options we know with the higher volumes that we are seeing so far this year, just if you can give some color on the direction that you think RPC may take in the first quarter? And then Ed just a real quick question on the VIX futures volumes, just in last week or so looks like they are sort of at normally low relative to the really strong pace in January, can you help us give any commentary on that?","Ed Provost","I will start with the RPC and the proprietary products. Two things into one's RPC and VIX and SPX and RUT. The first one is whose trading. So for instance in our VIX futures day traders receive a discount. So if there's more day traders trading VIX futures in a particular period, then you could see RPC drop and there's other discount programs in SPX as well for example. The other factor that influences RPC and it\u2019s obviously is pricing and we -- you can go on our website and look at the fee changes that we made January 1st in all of our products including our proprietary products. And we look for pricing opportunities to grow RPC and our proprietary products in a way that we think will not impact the growth of those products because I rather take a 10% growth in volume driving revenue rather than 10% growth in RPC driving revenue as the trade -- trades and traders tend to come back. So I don\u2019t want to push them away. So in January RPC -- I don't know of anything that would lead me to tell you that January RPC was extraordinarily affected by the volume or other factors there just because of Vector hitting in the month. So I expect RPC to continue at rates but they could be impacted by either rates or participants.","Edward Tilly","Let me, just the observations that we are hearing from The Street. I think you probably heard us describe VIX Q4 in [dashboard] options and futures trading, and I think the drivers -- I think I have touched on them before. There is really no new risk out there and the trend that began in the fourth quarter of moving from perhaps no risk onto cash continues. So there is a lot of money on the sideline and then I think the most telling again if you look at large pure volatility VIX futures trader kind of flat curve. So the [John Spreaders] and those that have been trading up and down the curves that enjoyed in August and then at the end of the fourth quarter, again that flat curve doesn\u2019t -- as we know doesn\u2019t last for long periods of time. But certainly where we find ourselves today even they cross a little inverse re-degradation on the curve over time. So I think those three factors are probably the most recent passed over the last few days. Again you cited January was pretty traffic, so we love those comparables when we look back to January but a few days here in February we are not going to trend line as 170,000 or so contracts yesterday. Yes, it's up in January but not horrible. So I would go back to those three factors, cash a little more risk of, no new risk on the horizon and a flat curve.","Brian Bedell","So, you would like volatility either to take another leg up here or a decrease in volatility and reset and then another serve in volatility to [indiscernible]?","Edward Tilly","Life is a tough word. We don\u2019t want to root for things that are surprising the market much, but I think normal will be staying in that upward sloping curve or trending more towards historic level. That's what the market is used to seeing and when we don\u2019t see what you are used to you look for other alternatives and as I say what was most interesting to us when we listened to practitioners now, it's not whether or not you use VIX futures or options to hedge. It's when you use VIX futures and options and when do you use SPX and it's becoming almost matter of fact that you use them in tandem and those are tools that you go to. And as I said I think on the second question or so, it's interesting that the conversation now has not -- is not CBOE explained vol, it's our practitioners telling us when they use our volatility contracts versus when they use our traditional SPX. I think that's going to be the most interesting story in the evolution of hedging and how the CBOE products are continuing to be the go-to to hedge either global volatility or U.S. exposure and that interchange between running in and out of SPX or trading in and around a volatility complex. So it's really a cool developing story and we look forward to telling it as we learn more.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Allen of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Chris Allen","I just wondered, if there was any way to provide some color just in terms of the percentage impact to the price changes, if you kind of assume the same levels of volumes from '15? And also like how are you guys thinking about the at risk fees and the market data fees moving forward? How susceptible they are to market share from here you are positive or negatively?","Alan Dean","The changes that we made on 1st January for this relative to our multi-list category, I don\u2019t expect a precipitous change in the RPC and in the equity in the ETF categories of our options. And although it's hard to take the volume where they had in 2015 and so well we had the new fee schedule roughly to your RPC because the changes that we made were designed to attract new participants to our market which will impact the RPC. So the goal is to optimize revenue, have more revenue from maintaining a market leadership role on site. I know -- I wish I could directly answer your question Chris, but it's the best I can do at this point after a month is just say I don't expect a significant, i.e., just a more precipitous decline in RPC. So that was your first half of this question. What was your -- access fees. So again access fees, again the story that we have talked about over the years I believe were over market and access fees and that was -- I think that was the very first question on the very first earnings call 5.5 years ago. And I said at that time I expected the access fees to decline and they have. Last year they went down more than in the past and it was users -- it was more users becoming more efficient with how they use bandwidth rather than not needing permits. So it wasn\u2019t a reflection of market share or a decline in interest in SPX or VIX, it wasn\u2019t added at all. It was more users becoming efficient. Now going forward 2016 I expect a modest decline, a small decline in the way we are looking at access fees for 2016 compared to 2015. Now market data revenue is composed of two parts. About a half or a little less than half is OPRA, Options Price Reporting Authority. The consolidate fee for all of options, prices and quotes going out and not in. And so that is impactful by market share it certainly is and our declining market share in 2015 certainly impacted that half of market data revenue. But there is another -- the other half of market data revenue which has shown pretty good growth over the past few years and did in 2015 as well and that's the CBOE options proprietary data fee which showed a nice uptick in 2015 compared to 2014 and our CFE data fee which increased slightly over in 2015 over 2014. So the market share will impact half of market data revenue. Well that sure was a long answer to that question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead.","Kyle Voigt","I don\u2019t want to belabor this point, but I just had a quick question on the VIX term structure. I know you had say the inverted term structure last year is kind of a key reason as to why the VIX options [indiscernible] volume low a lull in the first half of the year along with high vol-vol. In January we saw that same inverted term structure for most of the month and I believe it's currently inverted. I am just wondering, if you are hearing any different from your clients this time around or seeing anything different in trading patterns to suggest that this is just a different environment that we are in this year versus last year? Thanks.","Edward Tilly","We haven't heard a lot about this but the biggest difference that we are hearing in term structure is flat to your point, you are right. But I think the difference we are hearing is the amount of cash on the side line, I think that's probably the change in what we did not hear last year. Last year was a lot of head scratching on risk going forward, is it going to continue the choppiness going to continue, if that vol strip is going to remain flat. I think this year there is just cash and waiting and looking. I don\u2019t think that's -- well I should say historically that is the last one. You will accept a new level of risk at 22 over time is your new outlook on risk and its normal, isn't going to be the right word because historic level is low, but if that's what you are going to accept, we are going to place strategies with that assumption in mind. And again back to the utility of having this suite that is so different and flexible and the way that\u2019s its said, if VIX doesn\u2019t serve the purpose that is if you are not expecting a spike from 22 to 28 meaning there is not a new risk assumption on the horizon the utility of SPX puts is maybe your hedge of choice. So we will see that I think changing or actually people taking a position over the next -- fill in the blank, the next month, months, on how they are going to employ, on how they are going to hedge going forward. So yes, the biggest difference again, probably more cash than we have heard in the past on the side line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Wong of RBC Capital. Please go ahead.","Andrew Wong","On your education efforts CBOE is really the only exchange that actively focuses on educating users on products and kind of creating a curriculum so to speak, around how to trade or use CBOE products effectively And it makes sense given that VIX is a bit more novel than something like a vanilla equity option. But how do you measure the response with respect to these efforts at your conferences? Clearly we see it in the volume growth particularly during overnight hours, but is there some kind of internal measurement or guidepost you use to determine how well your education efforts are working in creating an incremental volume or more interest in your products?","Ed Provost","Andrew, Ed Provost in response to that. So yes, we are very probably initiatives that we have been engaged in and really since the very beginning. While at the very beginning we were focused on the broader option product is highly focused on our proprietary products now through our options institute, our risk management conferences and the other engagements we had globally. We measure the -- measuring many respects, obviously we measure the number of attendees that will be for us at the institute at are now three RMCs, so we are holding around the world and we engage them. During the conferences we take surveys of those people relative to the quality of the conferences and then we follow up with them about their trading activities post conference. And again while it's always difficult to be real precise as to its direct impact we see representatives and various institutional users sending new participants every year suggesting that they find great value in what we are teaching and it gives us every bit of confidence that we are expanding the knowledge base of the use of both SPX and VIX both domestically and internationally. So it's something that continues to grow because there is a demand for it. We will speak again from time to time on the base actual product. But we are very, very proprietarily focused tapping our base SPX, of course our Russell products and our MSCI products as well.","Alan Dean","Andrew this is Alan. I will add that the education efforts certainly is one of CBOE's successes to be proud of. One aspect of it that Ed didn\u2019t mention that I like is the fact that people pay to come to these education [sites] and it is a revenue source for us. And so it is an amazing thing that they want to come to hear our instructors teach them about our products.","Edward Tilly","I may add one more I think what you are just saying Ed. Ed uses just a perfect example of those RMC conferences and I think it's important to point out that we have banks hosting their clients which is a pretty cool phenomenon. If a bank is listening to our strategies and the various practitioners their strategies, for them to host their clients to our conference is pretty telling as an endorsement of the utility of the suite SPX, VIX, Russell, MSCI. So another indicator when we are being endorsed by sponsors.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Please go ahead.","Alex Kramm","I apologize my line dropped at one point, so this might have been answered already. But just want to go back to the guidance for a second here. So you were talking about revenue offsets and if you look at the fourth quarter clearly Livevol's already in there. There is also the cost run rate to some degree. But when you talk about those revenue offsets for Livevol $47 million if I heard you correctly, that's not really assuming much growth of the exchange services line. So just wondering, why you are not more optimistic about that acquisition? And then secondly you mentioned regulatory fees is another driver of the cost guidance going up, is there revenue offset or did you talk about that? I mean because that\u2019s a phenomenon that\u2019s been going on for almost a couple of years now. So any more help will be helpful. Thank you.","Alan Dean","What I believe I mentioned but the exchange services -- exchange fees and other services line item we expect to be $47 million which I think is $5 million over our results for 2015. So that\u2019s pretty significant and that represents the fourth quarter run rate for the entire year. We acquired Livevol in August and so there is a partial year of expenses and revenue. And although -- and Livevol for us in 2016 will be accretive and it will be positive for us. So that\u2019s a good thing. On the regulatory fee side we expect regulatory fees to be up by about $3 million year-over-year and they like to fluctuate by volume and other factors, so that\u2019s another factor offsetting the increase in expenses. Finally depreciation and amortization, although we are off a little bit year-over-year, I will bet that our depreciation and amortization is lower than what you have in your model and that\u2019s because part of the increase in expenses is coming from FINRA and that\u2019s because we are switching over to the regulatory systems. That meant that we had accelerated amortization on our own capitalized programs that we had here. So that now goes away June 30th. So if you factor out Livevol and FINRA then we are up 4% to 6% over the $195 million in 2015. If you compare -- if you back out Livevol and FINRA and compare it to our original guidance that we started 2015 with we are only up about 3%. So I think the number is right there and certainly we spend a lot of time thinking about that number, both in our business plan preparation for the year and our preparation for this press release this month.","Alex Kramm","That's very helpful. And just to clarify on the Livevol when I said $47 million doesn\u2019t seem to be much growth and I mean off the fourth quarter run rate. Because you would assume that this is a business that hopefully grows from the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s why I was a little bit surprised. So I don\u2019t know if you have to say anything else there.","Alan Dean","Well we expect Livevol and what I am trying to give you a reasonable shot at what I am seeing in our guidance. I hope I am wrong on the low side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","So, Washington has been busy the last couple of days talking about market structure and they focused primarily on equity market structure, but they are talking about maker-taker and payment or float to retail brokers and access fee caps. I was curious if you guys are hearing of any of that conversation spilling over into options?","Edward Tilly","We haven't and our comment rather that we stand aligning with the timing of the market structure committee. We represent that we have the same position that we always had on SEC and fee caps specifically that the market should be allowed to raise competitive forces to determine fees whether its equities or options and then ultimately as you know we file everything, we file with the SEC and there is an opportunity for the SEC then to challenge an exchange on a one-off basis if they see some fee unfair to the end user. So while we haven't leaned over yet we are of course taking a much more proactive position in support where we haven't -- to your comments we haven't been asked while we are certainly providing our opinion and it shouldn't surprise you on where we are coming out. So I would say the same answer both on maker-taker and [PFAF]. Nothing specifically directed to the options industry and as you know that from an impact for CBOE whether it's in those proprietary products or our primary exchange fee maker-taker really isn't an issue for us and PFAF really would not become maybe a competitive issue if it was applied evenly throughout the industry. So really our focus in on fee cap and while we are monitoring all of the potential changes for the equity market structure, the big one for us not surprisingly would be keeping our eye on fee caps.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Vincent Hung","So, maybe I missed this, but based on the limited experience I saw, is the VIX Weeklys option complementary contract or is it substitute right now?","Ed Provost","This is Ed Provost, Victor, thank you for the question. We see the VIX Weeklys contract is very complementary to the longer duration contracts which have traded for years. We see more existing users using that to manage volatility around event risk. And I am contrasting that with SPX where when we introduced a Weekly contract we drew a healthy new customer base, retail customer base into SPX and away from SPY. In the case of VIX it's not so much drawing a significantly little customer base for giving existing VIX users the opportunity to manage volatility around specific events. So we are very pleased with how that's evolved. It may bring some additional new customers in, but that's probably not most likely scenario. We think it's more likely to give greater opportunities to existing users.","Edward Tilly","I'd say the other user base that we are able to attract now, the only alternative in shorter dated volatility contracts has been in the ETN space. So VXX the most successful volatility ETN has had a weekly contract where you are able to -- kind of to Ed's point you are able to pinpoint activity that you have targeted in the short term by using a short dated VXX contract. Now for the first time we actually do have our VIX contract and the ability to attract those users who are looking for the short term. So if it\u2019s a substitute perhaps we are going to be able to make a case that we can substitute those that only had VXX in their toolbox to use a short dated Weeklys VIX contract.","Vincent Hung","Okay, thanks. And just last one for me. I have a broader question. What do you think of the Deutsche Boerse volatility contract? Do you see it as a competitor or just another indicator increasing demand for volatility hedging? I ask because they are continuing to see increased contract volume.","Edward Tilly","Love it. We view and every other opportunity we can with all of the exchanges that have taken a methodology license with us and our partner, Standard & Poor's, with the opportunity to really highlight the utility of this asset class called VIX and the differences between B stocks and VIX what a wonderful trend. So if there was the liquidity in B stocks now you can imagine perhaps selling B stocks and buying VIX and then that interplay back and forth and before long it would be terrific if we can see that across the globe. So no, anything that heightens the awareness in the utility of a listed volatility contract we are a champion and we will be meeting with all of those who have taken a license for our methodology coming in March at FIA. We do that every year. So we will be sharing the path to success on listed vol with everyone who is willing to listen. So no, we are -- a big endorsement for us when there is interest in B stocks.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Our S&P 500 Index product line, which includes SPX, SPXpm and SPX Weeklys, carries our highest options rate per contract. Second quarter average daily volume in SPX rose 12% over the prior quarter and 10% over last year's second quarter, while trading in SPXpm increased 17% against the previous quarter. SPX Weeklys continued to be one of the year's fastest-growing products. Through June, in SPX Weeklys, trading is up 46% over the previous year, while the second quarter volume rose 54% over the previous quarter and 65% over the second quarter of 2011.","We continue to design new SPX products to respond to specific customer needs. Last Friday, we launched SPX Variance Strips or V-Strips, which are aimed at qualified professionals, including OTC users. V-Strips are designed to trade a portfolio of SPX options series that replicate implied volatility in a single transaction and employ quoting conventions similar to those used for trading OTC variance swaps. After execution, each V-Strip is broken down into its components, which might include as many as 1,000 SPX contracts, which are then transmitted to and cleared by the Options Clearing Corporation.","As you can imagine, the unique construction of the V-Strip necessitates the support of highly customized trading technology. Our systems teams responded with the creation of a new patent-pending technology called  BasketWeaver, which employs reverse engineering to deconstruct the VIX into its component parts. It is a wonderful example of how systems development is leveraging to power product innovation at CBOE.","Moving on to our volatility franchise, trading in options and futures on CBOE's volatility index or VIX continued to provide tremendous growth through the quarter despite relatively low volatility and low marketwide options and futures volume. VIX options volume rose 22% over the second quarter of 2011 and the dramatic growth in trading in VIX futures shows no signs of abating.","VIX futures volume for the second quarter was up 40% over the previous quarter and up a stunning 91% over the second quarter of 2011. Year-to-date through June, trading in VIX futures is up 75% over the same period last year. Monthly trading in VIX futures broke the 2 million contract mark for the first time in May, and set successive all-time monthly volume records in May and June. Keep in mind that VIX futures are 10x the notional size of VIX options. VIX futures growth is fueled in part by some 45 exchange traded products or ETPs tied to the VIX index. Total assets under management in volatility ETPs grew to $5.7 billion as of June 1 compared to $2.8 billion in December 2011.","We continued to expand our VIX product line in the second quarter. On June 18, we introduced the CBOE Interest Rate Swap Volatility Index, which is calculated using options on OTC interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps and swap options are the most actively traded derivatives in the OTC market. We believe the index will provide -- prove useful in managing interest rate volatility risks and thereby increase CBOE's presence in this very dynamic area.","Turning now to our second strategic initiative, the optimization of revenue and market share in commoditized products. As mentioned earlier, we achieved considerable market share gains year-to-date, largely due to the success of our Volume Incentive Program or VIP, which we implemented in January and have continued to monitor and refine. CBOE's second quarter market share in multi-listed products, excluding dividend trades, was 22.6%. This represented a slight decrease of 60 basis points from our significant first quarter gains, but an increase of 210 basis points over last year's second quarter. Our year-to-date market share through June adjusted for dividend trades, was 22.9%, an increase of 150 basis points over the first half of 2011. Moreover, CBOE's total market share for all U.S. options trading in the second quarter was 29.8%, an increase of 290 basis points over the second quarter of 2011.","The next strategic initiative I will touch on today is the expansion of our customer base through targeted business development programs. Customer education is particularly significant to CBOE, where developing new frontiers in options and volatility trading is the centerpiece of our growth story. We are committed, in particular, to building ongoing relationships with customers through educational programs aimed at their specific options and volatility trading needs.","Today, I will highlight the expansion of 2 CBOE mainstays that have become leading brand names in options education: the CBOE's Risk Management Conference and The Options Institute, CBOE's world-renowned educational facility.","The CBOE Risk Management Conference, now in its 28th year, is an industry-leading event that provides an educational forum, where sophisticated practitioners examine the most current trends and concepts in risk management. RMC has proven to be a win-win for our customers and to CBOE, and attendees appreciate RMC for its substantive, content-rich program, and we value the opportunity to meet and work with customers who are likely to be early adopters of new products and services.","We are absolutely thrilled this year to leverage the success of the conference to increase our visibility overseas with the first European Risk Management Conference, which will be held between September 5 and 7 in Ireland. We believe that there is tremendous potential to increase the use of our products, particularly our SPX and VIX product lines among European investors and we expect the RMC Europe attendees, much like their U.S. counterparts, to be at the forefront of new trends in options and volatility tradings. We very much look forward to beginning this new chapter in RMC history.","Now, an update on the CBOE Options Institute, the world's only standalone facility dedicated to options and volatility education. The Options Institute annually conducts over 400 educational series, including regular classes, webcasts and seminars. The Institute's multilayered program uniquely provides us with a multitude of customer touchpoints that enable us to continue to interact meaningfully with customers as their trading and educational needs change and grow.","Often, these relationships are initially formed at the collegiate level. The Options Institute enjoys long-standing relationships with universities around the world and we are pleased to announce that it is currently developing an Options Lab, aimed specifically at college curricula. The Institute, this year, also initiated partnerships with organizations outside the traditional options trading community, including media outlets, such as TheStreet and Investor's Business Daily to further expand our educational and marketing reach. We are particularly proud of the Options Institute's faculty and staff, which include former traders, academics and noted authors, bloggers and experts in options and volatility trading.","Turning now to trading systems development. As announced in our first quarter earnings call, we have begun the rollout of CBOE Command, our company's next-generation trade engine technology. Throughout its 2012 rollout, which will culminate in the fourth quarter move of our service to New Jersey, significant upgrades will be added to CBOE Command, each resulting in an even more robust trading platform. Ultimately, Command will provide customers with the most comprehensive array of options and volatility products in the world, and place at their Command, new customized ways to access and trade those products.","Since our last call, the rollout of CFLEX 2.0, was completed as was the previously mentioned BasketWeaver system. I'm pleased to note that these new Command functionalities help to leverage trading in our proprietary product lines, in particular by creating a more efficient way to trade an existing product, as is the case with CFLEX 2.0 and SPX FLEX Options, or by allowing us to roll out a new product concept, as was the case with BasketWeaver and SPX Variance Strips. Our entire organization is very enthusiastic about Command and we look forward to reporting its continued rollout in the weeks and months ahead.","Looking ahead, we see considerable growth opportunities in the options and volatility space for the remainder of 2012 and beyond. A June 2012 Tabb Group study, tellingly calls, and I quote, \"The U.S. options trading a standout from the crowd.\" And it calls for future growth in the U.S. options trading as a foregone conclusion and predicts that the the buy side trading will lead to volume growth. The report notes that firms are investing in options trading infrastructure and expanding their options trading capabilities to include new products, new markets and more complex strategies. Tabb calls it no surprise that volatility products are gaining the buy side's attention.","It is gratifying to note that our company's ability to leverage proprietary products to successfully compete in commoditized products and to prudently manage expenses enables us to continue to invest in future growth initiatives. We are well-positioned to benefit from anticipated growth in the options and volatility space as a result of our continued interest in leadership in education systems development and volatility in index option trading. Our solid financial position, our pristine balance sheet and strong cash flow leave us well-positioned to continue to grow our business, capitalize on opportunities and return value to stockholders.","With that, I want to turn this over to Alan Dean who will report on our financials. Thank you for your attention. Alan?","Alan J. Dean","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill highlighted, we reported solid financial results in the second quarter as we continue to focus on delivering industry-leading profit margins and growth rates. I'll provide a closer look at our financial performance, starting with a top-down review of our P&L.","As seen on this slide, operating revenues increased by 10% while diluted earnings per share was up 22%. We achieved strong operating leverage, reporting an adjusted operating margin of 49.8%, 280 basis points higher than the prior year period, a function of our revenue growth and effective expense management.","Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the second quarter of 2011 included certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck.","As shown on this slide, operating revenues increased by $12.3 million or 10%, primarily driven by increases in transaction fees, exchange services and other fees and market data fees, offset somewhat by a decline in access fees. Transaction fees contributed $8.6 million of the revenue increase, representing a 10% increase compared with the second quarter of 2011. The growth was driven by an 8% increase in trading volume and a 2% increase in the average revenue per contract or RPC. We experienced higher trading volume across each of our product categories, with the strongest growth coming from our highest margin products, index options and VIX futures, which also had a positive impact on RPC. RPC increased to $0.314 compared with $0.308 in last year's second quarter, primarily due to a shift in the mix of products traded, with index options and futures accounting for 28% of trading volume versus 26.2% in the second quarter of 2011. RPC also increased sequentially, up 12% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, due to a shift in the mix of trading volume, as well as modifications to our Volume Incentive Program.","As most of you know, we implemented significant changes to CBOE's transaction fees earlier this year, including introducing a new Volume Incentive Program or VIP, and revamping our liquidity provider sliding fee scale to exclude our proprietary products. As anticipated on a year-over-year comparison, the fee changes significantly decreased the RPC and equity options, increased the RPC for index options and VIX futures and resulted in moderate changes to the RPC for ETF options. The fee changes were designed to drive incremental volume to our exchanges, leverage the strength of our proprietary products and maintain competitive pricing across all of our service areas and we are very pleased with the results that we have realized.","The market share gains we have achieved as a result of our Volume Incentive Program accrue far-reaching benefits to our business, powering the growth of Market Data fees, while providing support for access fees and exchange services and other fees, as well as allowing us to reduce Trading Volume Incentive expenses. As always, we will continue to monitor our fees to ensure that we are competitive and make prudent adjustments accordingly.","Exchange services and other fees increased by $3.6 million or 84% versus last year's second quarter, again resulting from fee changes we implemented at the beginning of the year. Based on year-to-date results and our outlook for the second half of the year, we are increasing our revenue guidance for these fees to be in the range of $27 million to $29 million for 2012. The growth of market data fees was primarily due to higher OPRA revenue allocated to CBOE, and increased revenue from CBOE's market data services.","Similar to what we saw in the first quarter, CBOE's market share gain resulted in a higher share of total options transactions cleared, which was the basis for allocating OPRA income.  Access fees for the second quarter were down $900,000 or 5% year-over-year. The second quarter decline reflects the impact of our 2012 fee adjustments, as well as an increase in the number of permits holders taking advantage of our sliding scale pricing, which gives us a full year commitment to those trading permits. Access fees are in line with our expectations, tracking at the low end of our guidance range of $64 million to $67 million for the year.","Moving down the P&L to expenses, this next slide summarizes adjusted operating expenses, which were $66.5 million, up $2.8 million or 4% compared with last year's second quarter. Core operating expenses for the second quarter were $45 million, up 8% from $41.8 million in the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to increases in employee costs, outside services and travel and promotional expenses. The increase in employee costs primarily resulted from higher expenses related to salaries and self-insurance. Outside services were up due to an increase in legal fees, consulting fees and contract programmers. The increase in travel and promotional expenses primarily reflects our ongoing branding initiatives, which are focused on elevating the CBOE brand, and more specifically, building awareness for VIX products and SPXpm.","Volume-based expenses, which include royalty fees and Trading Volume Incentives, increased by $300,000 versus last year's second quarter, reflecting a $1.6 million increase in royalty fees, offset significantly by a $1.3 million decline in Trading Volume Incentives. The growth of royalty fees is directly related to higher trading volume in our license products, the one expense item I like to see go up. The decrease in Trading Volume Incentives was primarily due to changes in the criteria for contracts that qualify for the quantity-based fee waivers. Our success in bringing more customer order flow to CBOE allowed us to make these adjustments.","Our revenue growth, combined with our focus on expense management and operating efficiencies, resulted in adjusted operating income for the quarter of $66.1 million, a 17% increase versus 1 year ago. This represents an adjusted operating margin of 49.8%, up 280 basis points compared with the 47% in last year's second quarter. I think it bears repeating, we achieved our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin and the second highest ever reported.","Our effective tax rate was 41.4% for the quarter and year-to-date, which is equal to the effective tax rate reported for the first 6 months of 2011. The effective tax rate for the second quarter increased compared with last year's second quarter due to a higher provision for uncertain tax positions, offset somewhat by the benefit of a new tax apportionment method enacted by the state of Illinois.","","Turning to the balance sheet, as shown on this slide, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $127.1 million compared to $148.6 million at the end of the first quarter. The reduction in our cash position since the end of the first quarter is mostly due to estimated tax payments made during the quarter. During the quarter, we also repurchased nearly $22 million of our common stock, paid out about $11 million in cash dividends and spent nearly $12 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for the first 6 months of this year were $19.5 million. On an annualized basis, our current run rate would exceed our guidance of $30 million to $35 million for the year. However, this is due to timing and more of the expenditures skewed towards the first half of the year. Therefore, we are holding our current guidance on capital expenditures. Year-to-date, we have generated nearly $87 million in cash flow from operations and have continued to return capital to stockholders. Through June, we have used nearly $53 million to purchase shares and return more than $21 million to stockholders in dividends. As of July 31, we had $3.3 million remaining on our $100 million share repurchase program approved in August of 2011.","Our strong financial position allows us to return capital to shareholders through increased dividends and share repurchases. Earlier this week, our board approved a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend and authorized another $100 million in share repurchases. Since our IPO just 2 years ago, we have returned nearly $600 million to stockholders, and as our actions show, we remain committed to allocating capital to enhance stockholder returns.","We believe the combination of dividends and share repurchases provides us flexibility to efficiently deploy capital, which is particularly important in light of the uncertainties surrounding tax changes. Along with our board, we will continue to evaluate all alternatives to enhance returns to our stockholders.","As we noted in our press release, we are maintaining our 2012 guidance that we provided in February 8 with one exception. As I mentioned earlier, we are raising our revenue guidance range for exchange services and other fees by $3 million.","Looking ahead, our focus is on being well-positioned to take advantage of volume upticks, while being nimble enough to adapt during lower volume periods. We believe we are in the best position ever to do just that. We have a solid debt-free balance sheet, strong free cash flow and a clear focus on creating value for our stockholders. We are successfully managing our business for the long term, while delivering consistent and solid top line and bottom line results. We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and are confident in our future success. With that, I will hand the call over to Debbie so we can take your questions.","Deborah Koopman","At this point, we will be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits, we'll take a second question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I guess Bill, the first question is or the question is on volatility in the VIX, and you built the franchise on these products and they continue to grow. And I'm just trying to get an update on the customer segments and what's the run rate going forward. Where is the new growth coming from? And I'm going to apologize, but I got to sneak another one in. Can you comment on the night -- as an elder statesman in the exchange business, what can we do to prevent things and how is this going to impact, you think, trading going forward?","William J. Brodsky","No, let me lead with the second question, although, I've learned a long time ago, you don't talk a lot about an issue if you don't have all the facts, and I don't have all the facts. But I would say that look, our understanding is that the SEC and [indiscernible] are reviewing what happened yesterday. We're obviously reluctant to get ahead of the regulators on this, but from the accounts that we've seen, it appears that there was a technology glitch in the trading algorithm. All markets have rules to address these types of situations and it appears that the rules were used uniformly, once the problem was made known. It's very hard to predict, so everything is going to happen here. This isn't even 24 hours old, so I really think that we ought to just let the facts come out and then see what happens. On the second question, on the volatility issue, we are extremely enthusiastic about the continued growth of VIX. It is very gratifying and it's really part of what we've been telling people all along, and that is that we spend a lot of time educating people. We see growth in various segments, we see growth from the individual customers side. We see tremendous growth on the professional and institutional side, as I mentioned in my remarks on the Tabb survey, and we're also seeing growth because of these exchange traded products, where quite frankly, that's the product that individuals and others can go to, to let the sponsor manage the volatility portfolio for them based on whatever they view as their volatility needs. So we are supporting all that and in fact, one of the main reasons we're doing our risk management conference literally 5 weeks from now, is that we want to bring our whole volatility suite of expertise to the European Community directly in the conference. I will be there. We are very enthusiastic based on the success of our risk management conferences that we've been having here for many years, but particularly in how we've been able to use that as a launching pad for VIX education, to bring that to the broader community.","Operator","The next question is from Howard Chen of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bill, you continue to execute well in both better and worse volume environments. I mean, you noted that the 8 straight quarters of earnings growth, but just on the environment, industry options, open interest levels are at or near the weakest levels since the financial crisis, what does that mean to you, if anything? And what's your level of concern that that's an indicator of weaker volume growth to come?","William J. Brodsky","Howard, it's a fair question and I've been in this business a long time and there were periods where you have these dips and things come back. And it's very hard to predict when they'll come back. I can think of a year ago, July, when we thought things were really dreadfully slow and then all of a sudden, August shut the lights out. So it's hard to predict when the changes will occur. But it's never a straight line. Ed Tilly will support me on this in terms of some data that may be helpful to you.","Edward T. Tilly","Howard, just to point out, we do track open interest as just one of the many matrix that we use to follow volume, and open interest does ebb and flow. We can look quarter-over-quarter where open interest will decline only to return the next quarter. And just specifically for CBOE, a little difference for you if we look across our product line. Yes, the multi-list options open interest has declined June to July. It has declined from March to June. But for CBOE, a little different story if we look out into our index complex where open interest is pretty much unchanged between June and July and up actually, from March to June. And then for our futures complex, open interest continues to increase. So a little different CBOE look but we're not at all at this point alarmed at the open interest change month-over-month or quarter-over-quarter.","Operator","And the next question is from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to quickly touch base on expenses. Alan, I think you left your guidance unchanged here. As I look at the current run rates, you're clearly still within the guidance, I mean on a year-to-date basis. If I just assumed the $45 million core, we would get to the high-end if we stay here, so maybe just talk to the trajectory. I mean, outside services were pretty high this quarter. You're still building out all this Secaucus stuff. So how is it going to flow through the remainder of the year?","Alan J. Dean","If you take our core expenses for the 6 months ending June 30 and multiply it by 2 and annualize it, I think we're just under the low end of our annual guidance. However, as you noted if you take our expenses for the quarter and project a trend, the continued growth rate year-over-year, then we'll wind up somewhere in the middle of our annual guidance range that we provided during February and we reaffirmed today. So that's how we see expenses for the year and consequently, we are maintaining our expense guidance, and think we'll wind up somewhere in the middle of that range.","Operator","The next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A question on your exchange service and other fees. I apologize if you already covered this, but your full year guidance, I believe is, you upped that to $27 million to $29 million. If that kind of run rate what you're doing first half of the year, that puts you over $30 million. So are you expecting some slowdown in that in the back half of the year?","William J. Brodsky","Obviously, we were conservative in the guidance that we gave for this revenue line item last February for the guidance that we gave to you entire year. We were concerned about the pushback from our customers, and how they would respond to these free increases even though we believe the fee changes we made were competitive. We believe that VIP helped mitigate some of that pushback, our volume incentive program. And even with 2 quarters behind us, we're still a little concerned that we will experience some degradation as the year wears on. And so consequently, if you annualize results for this line item, using results for the first 6 months, it is somewhat higher as you noted, than the guidance we are providing but it's just our concern about the last 6 months of the year, given the changes that were made in this line item.","Operator","The next question is from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So you guys have launched a bunch of VIX-related products, I guess trying to leverage the success of the underlying franchise and I know this quarter, you mentioned that you had the NASDAQ-100 futures launch. It's hard kind of in outside looking in to gauge what all these launches have amounted to from a revenue perspective. So I was just wondering if you might be able to give us an a idea for, apart from the original VIX option and futures, how much do you earn from all these various VIX-related products you've listed over the past couple of years?","Alan J. Dean","Certainly -- Jillian, this is Alan. Certainly, the VIX option in the future, that's what's the main driver of the increases in revenue, what we're seeing. And we have launched many products. They all start out as benchmarks and hopefully, they turn into products. There have been a couple of notable successes and the VIX emerging markets index is one that we're seeing some traction on and is starting to get my attention in terms of contributing to our top line. And we're also seeing licensing revenues starting to increase in our other revenue category. And it's almost getting to the point where I would give more granularity on that but not quite. But it's growing nicely, and so that's what I'm seeing from a P&L point of view. Ed or...","William J. Brodsky","I can add a little bit to that, Jillian. I think the success of VIX and the satisfying the demand for VIX exposure, overall volatility exposure, is really being satisfied by the liquidity and the ability to cover volatility in the S&P 500. And we see even a global interest in exposure, in using the VIX product line of the S&P 500. So not surprisingly, any competing product to VIX, the S&P 500 VIX, really has some uphill fight, whether it's global or our own domestic products. So again, our line here is to educate, bring new products to answer a broader range of users' demand but we will continue to do just that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Deborah Koopman","I don't see any further questions.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Debbie Koopman. Please go ahead.","Deborah Koopman","Good morning and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call.","On the call today, Ed Tilly, our CEO, will provide an update on our strategic initiatives for 2015. Then, Alan Dean, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will review our first quarter 2015 financial results. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A is our President and COO, Ed Provost.","In addition, I'd like to point out that this presentation will include the use of several slides. We will be showing the slides and providing commentary on each. A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the investor relations portion of our website.","As a preliminary note, you should be aware that this presentation contains forward-looking statements, which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold, and while we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a full discussion of the factors that may affect any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after this conference call.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Tilly.","Edward Tilly","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Despite the first quarter's challenging volume conditions, we made significant progress in expanding our suite of premium index products.","We secured the rights to trade numerous Russell and FTSE Index products at CBOE, began exclusive trading in Russell 2000 Index options, and launched options on two well-known MSCI benchmarks. We also expanded our global customer reach with extended trading hours for SPX and VIX options. I'll discuss more about these developments, after a brief update on volume.","Our first quarter results reflect the impact of lower trading volume experienced at CBOE Holdings and industry-wide, as well as a difficult comparison to last year's record first quarter results. Overall, CBOE Holdings' volume fell 15% in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2014. The decline generally mirrored trading levels in futures and options industry-wide, with the exception of a sharper decrease in VIX options.","At the time of our last call, we saw the flattened term structure as the primary factor weighing on VIX options trading, while at the same time SPX option volume was setting new records. Term structure was certainly a factor at that point, but there was a larger change occurring with regard to investor sentiment.","Many risks that investors were concerned about, falling oil prices, deflation, global economic slowdown, political unrest overseas, seemed to be resolving; and more local risks, such as the Fed's plan to raise interest rates, kept getting pushed farther into the background.","Traders came to regard sharp drops in the market as buying opportunities rather than signaling a new bear market. What makes volatility trading, whether its VIX options, VIX futures, ETN volatility contracts and OTC VIX options, a compelling risk management tool is that it tends to work especially well as a hedge against sharp market declines, often referred to as tail events.","In the absence of real concerns about a sharp, sustained market pullback, it makes sense that traders would find fewer uses for volatility products and use other index options, such as SPX options for directional exposure to stock prices. I should note that SPX volume was up 1% in an otherwise down quarter.","Nothing we learned about the current lull in trading has caused us to alter our expectations or strategic initiatives related to the ongoing, long-term growth in VIX options trading. Buy-side customers and sell-side brokers alike, generally expect volume and open interest to pick up, as market conditions change. We see the decline in VIX options volume as generally cyclical rather than structural.","We have seen cycles like this before, they're part of trading. And while we don't like them, we expect them. In the meantime, an ongoing disciplined approach to cost-management enables us to weather the inevitable volume troughs, while continuing to lay the foundation for future growth. As a result, CBOE's forward progress is undeterred, despite current volume challenges.","We're particularly enthusiastic about the recent progress made to advance CBOE's ongoing index growth story. I'll look at that here through the lens of CBOE's unique position and our innate ability to collaborate, connect and create.","Thus far in 2015, CBOE leveraged new partnerships with index providers to significantly expand and diversify our premium index product line across new assets and markets. The products resulting from these agreements create new trading opportunities for our customers and pave the way for new volatility indexes as well.","Our December 2014 licensing agreement with MSCI made CBOE the sole U.S. exchange to trade options on several MSCI indexes. Our recent launch of options on MSCI EFA and Emerging Markets indexes brings an added global dimension to our index options franchise, and introduces new trading opportunities across our unique product set.","Last year, nearly 100 million options traded industry-wide on the popular EFA and EEM ETFs. Our ability now to also offer cash-settled European-style options on these indexes will especially appeal to institutional customers. We created additional trading opportunities by aligning the option settlement times to match the futures trading on the indexes.","Last quarter we also entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with the London Stock Exchange Group, making CBOE the exclusive provider for listed cash-settled options on more than two dozen FTSE and Russell Indexes, including the flagship Russell 2000 and FTSE 100.","As you know, CBOE previously traded Russell 2000, RUT options, on a semi-exclusive basis. In 2014, RUT options were CBOE's third most actively traded index option, trailing only SPX and VIX options. Over 12 million RUT contracts traded at CBOE and C2 and more than 22 million contracts traded industry-wide.","Under the new agreement, CBOE became the sole provider of RUT options on April 1, and we now look forward to launching FTSE 100 index options as well as other Russell and FTSE products, later this year.","The addition of MSCI, FTSE and Russell options to a product suite anchored by SPX options and VIX futures and options, enables customers to hedge and trade global volatility, the global stock market, the broad U.S. stock market, the U.S. small cap market, European and Asian international equities and the world's emerging markets at CBOE.","These products are often used in tandem, which creates additional trading opportunities. Each index enables us to create related volatility options and futures using our VIX methodology, thereby growing our VIX product line and offering still more trading possibilities. We believe these trading synergies will foster a further concentration of index traders and liquidity at CBOE, while enabling us to leverage significant cross-marketing efficiencies.","We continue to expand CBOE's customer reach, domestically and abroad, through customer engagement, investor education and a broadened access to our marketplace. Education goes hand-in-hand with product innovation at CBOE. Each new product is supported by new educational content, allowing us to form new connections with an existing customer base.","Our exclusive agreements with S&P, LSE Group and MSCI, in parts were predicated on CBOE's educational expertise and ability to efficiently connect with index customers globally across a range of channels, including The Options Institute, CBOE TV, CBOE.com, CBOE's social media platform and CBOE's Risk Management Conferences, RMC.","I should note here that this year we are expanding our RMC program beyond the U.S. and Europe, with the first RMC in Asia. RMC showcases our premium index products and attracts sophisticated and influential market participants who tend to be early adopters of CBOE's products and services.","I am pleased to say we made it easier for customers to connect to CBOE by further increasing access to our premium products. In early March we extended trading hours in VIX and SPX options with an additional session that runs from 2:00 AM to 8:15 AM Chicago time. The new session enables overseas customers to access VIX and SPX options during local trading hours and satisfies the stateside demand for additional trading time.","In other VIX news, I am pleased to announce that, pending regulatory approval, we plan to introduce Weekly VIX options and futures at CBOE and CFE. We plan to launch the futures this July, with the options to follow. The new VIX Weeklys products will complement VIX futures and options, the same way that SPX Weeklys complement our standard SPX product.","VIX Weeklys will also respond to customers who tell us they are looking for volatility exposures that more precisely track our benchmark VIX Index. The closer VIX futures and options are to expiration, the closer they track VIX.","By filling the gaps between monthly expiration, we are providing investors with 40 new opportunities to establish short-term VIX positions, and fine tune the timing of their hedging and trading activities. For the first time, investors will be able to trade expiring VIX and SPX contracts each week, which we believe will create even more trading opportunities.","CBOE's ability to collaborate, create and connect with the marketplace has created a unique culture of innovation, not only in product development, but also in trading technology. Systems development is deeply embedded in our value proposition. While every exchange aims for faster, more efficient trading technology, CBOE's systems have always been uniquely developed in-house to power innovation.","I am pleased to announce today that development of the next generation of trading technology is currently underway at CBOE. The new platform, called CBOE Vector, is designed to provide streamlined access to the most comprehensive array of options and volatility products in the world, and to the deep liquid markets in which they trade.","We are leveraging our in-house trading and technology expertise in building a customized state-of-the-art platform that responds to the trading needs of our customers and that best supports CBOE's unique product set.","We have supplemented our experienced systems team with top developers in our space to ensure that every aspect of CBOE Vector is on the cutting-edge and that we have the bench strength needed to drive the optimal performance of our current system, CBOE Command, throughout the completion of the new platform.","Incorporating input from customers, we are developing an advanced architecture that delivers best-in-class functionality, low latency, ease of use and trading efficiency. The new platform will be engineered to provide greatly increased transaction speeds, while handling constantly increasing message traffic and industry demand for additional functionality, such as risk controls.","The build out for CBOE Vector calls first for the implementation of new systems for CFE, which we plan to be up and running in the second half of 2016, with CBOE and C2 to follow. Ed Provost can provide more color on our new platform in Q&A, but I want to stress here that CBOE Vector is integral to our ongoing index story.","We view it as both a state-of-the art trading platform and engine for growth, designed for maximum flexibility and scalability, enabling us to quickly respond to a rapidly changing marketplace and to efficiently roll out new products and trading opportunities.","I will close here with a graphic representation of the opportunities created by our progress already in 2015. We expanded our proprietary product offering to cover new asset classes and regions around the world, increased trading hours to improve global access and extended our global customer reach.","Importantly, we also enriched CBOE's unique eco-system for the development and support of new tradable index products going forward. More than any one product, CBOE's unique value proposition to our customers, shareholders and index-provider partners lies in our ability to optimize the utility of new and existing index products through unrivaled options and volatility trading opportunities, educational expertise, an efficient network of customer outreach channels, deep liquid markets and customized trading technology.","This comprehensive approach to a singular area of focus has fostered a multitude of new opportunities for CBOE in 2015 and beyond. We look forward to providing updates in the months and quarters ahead.","With that, I'll turn it over to Alan.","Alan Dean","Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone.","I will start this morning with a review of our results for the quarter, and then I will wrap up with some comments on our focus for managing expenses and capital allocation going forward.","CBOE's first quarter results reflect the downturn we saw in trading volume both year-over-year and sequentially. Operating revenue came in at $142.8 million, 10% below last year's first quarter. Adjusted operating income was $69.5 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 48.7%, a decline of 490 basis points compared against our all-time high of 53.6% in the first quarter of 2014.","Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders was $42.3 million, a decrease of 15% versus the first quarter of 2014, resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.50, a 14% decline compared with $0.58 per share for the same period last year.","Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 include certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck. All the numbers I will be referencing are on a non-GAAP basis.","Now, let's review our results in more detail, starting with operating revenue. As shown on this chart, the decrease in operating revenue was primarily driven by lower transaction fees. Transaction fees decreased $14.1 million or 12% compared with the first quarter of 2014, reflecting a 15% decrease in trading volume, offset somewhat by a 3% increase in the average revenue per contract or RPC versus last year's first quarter.","Trading volume declined year-over-year in each product category. Equity options were down 17%, options on exchange-traded products fell 9%, index options decreased 20% and futures contracts were down 8%.","Our blended RPC, including options and futures, increased to $0.34 from $0.329 in last year's first quarter. The increase in RPC primarily reflects the net impact of higher RPC generated on index options and futures contracts, offset somewhat by a shift in the mix of trading volume towards lower-margin, multiply listed options.","The RPC in our options business increased to $0.284 compared with $0.281 in the first quarter of 2014, reflecting a 6% increase in the RPC for index options and a 1% increase for options on exchange-traded products, primarily resulting from fee adjustments made this year and lower volume discounts and incentives.","The RPC for equity options decreased by 5% year-over-year and increased by 13% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. The sequential increase in the RPC for equity options is due in part to fee changes implemented for 2015. While we also saw a decline in market share due to these fee changes, it was share that was low-to-negative margin for CBOE.","Revenue per contract at CFE, our futures exchange, increased 5% to $1.70 from $1.62 in last year's first quarter, as a result of fee changes and lower volume rebates. With respect to the shift in volume mix, multiply listed options represented 66.7% of total contracts traded in the first quarter, up from 65.3% in first quarter of 2014.","Despite the shift in the mix of volume, transaction fees generated from our proprietary products represented a higher percentage of our total transaction fees year-over-year. In the first quarter, index options and futures contracts accounted for 81.3% of our transaction fees, up from 81% in the first quarter of 2014, driven by the higher contribution from futures contracts.","Looking at some of the other factors influencing operating revenue, access fees declined by $1.5 million, reflecting a decrease in trading permits. Regulatory fees were also down by $1.5 million, which is attributed to lower trading volume industry-wide as well as the elimination of regulatory fees related to CBSX, our stock exchange, which ceased trading in 2014, and a lower rate for our options regulatory fee compared with the first quarter of 2014.","On the plus side, other revenue increased by $900,000, primarily due to higher fines assessed to trading permit holders for disciplinary actions, which can only be used to offset regulatory expenses. In addition, market data fees increased by $900,000, primarily as a result of higher revenue from CBOE's market data services, reflecting an increase in subscribers and rate adjustments.","Turning to expenses, this next slide details total adjusted operating expenses of $73.3 million for the quarter, unchanged compared with last year's first quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter reflect the net impact of lower costs for compensation and benefits and royalty fees, offset by higher costs for professional fees and outside services, depreciation and amortization and technology support services. There were no adjustments to operating expenses in the first quarter of 2015.","Core operating expenses of $47.9 million were also relatively flat year-over-year, with an increase of $200,000 or 1% compared with the first quarter of 2014. The increase in core operating expenses primarily reflects increases of $4.6 million in professional fees and outside services, $600,000 in technology support services and $500,000 in travel and promotional expenses, offset by a decrease of $5.4 million in compensation and benefits.","The decline in compensation and benefits largely reflects lower expenses related to salaries, stock-based compensation and the provision for incentive compensation. The increase in professional fees and outside services as well as the decrease in salaries is primarily attributed to the company's outsourcing of certain regulatory services to FINRA, which occurred in December of 2014.","In response to current trading volumes, we are taking steps to cut or delay certain expenses and capital projects, as we have done during previous volume downturns. Based on our cost reduction initiatives and year-to-date results, we are lowering our guidance for core expenses to a range of $190 million to $194 million from our previous guidance of $195 million to $199 million.","While disciplined cost management is a continuous focus at CBOE, when volumes decline, we push even harder to realign expenses against revenue. With that said, we will remain diligent in our efforts and will look to reduce expenses further if volume continues to languish. Conversely, I would look to wind down some of the cost reductions, when I see a sustained improvement in volumes.","Looking at volume-based expenses, royalty fees decreased by $1.7 million or 11%, reflecting the decline in trading volume for licensed products, which include index options and VIX futures. On our last earnings call we told you that we expected the rate per contract for royalty fees to be $0.14 for the first quarter and $0.15 in the following quarters. The rate per contract came in higher at $0.146, due to a shift in the volume mix among licensed products.","Looking out to subsequent quarters, I would expect a continued divergence in the rate per licensed contract, if the volume mix stays the same as it was in the first quarter. However, if the volume mix is more aligned with what we saw in 2014, I would expect the rate to be closer to our guidance.","Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $138 million compared to $148 million at the end of December. The decrease in cash compared to yearend primarily reflects cash used for share repurchases, dividend payments and funding our share of the contribution to the OCC capital plan.","Our business continues to generate a significant amount of cash. Through March, we generated net cash flows from operating activities of over $78 million versus $88 million in the same period last year. This decrease primarily reflects lower net income.","In the first quarter of this year we used nearly $18 million to pay dividends and another $34 million to repurchase our stock. At March 31, we had approximately $58 million available under our share repurchase authorization. We will continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchases and look for sustainable growth in our annual dividend payments.","Capital expenditures through March were $8 million. I look for capital spending to pick up in the back half of the year, so we are reaffirming our guidance for capital expenditures of $37 million to $40 million for the full year, which takes into account the development of our new trading platform. Against that backdrop, it is important to point out that our guidance for both capital expenditures and core expenses now reflects the addition of a major new project, which was not included in our prior guidance.","We are very disciplined in how we use our cash, particularly given the current headwinds we are facing. However, our priorities regarding the use of cash have not changed. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth, as evidenced by our plans to invest in a new trading platform. After that, we expect to return our free cash flow over the long-term to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","While the near-term environment is challenging, we have encountered business downturns in the past and historically have always emerged even stronger. Our entire team is confident that our focus on managing expenses, while investing in future growth, will create long-term value for our market participants and shareholders.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Debbie.","Deborah Koopman","Thanks. At this point, we will be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue, and if time permits we'll take a second question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill.","Rich Repetto","I guess, I since I have one question, it has to be a follow-up on the comments on sort of the cyclical and secular debate on the volume. I guess, the question is, is there any other evidence, a survey at customers, or anything like that, because it appears what you're saying then is that the volume growth, at least, in the VIX options was related to just this tail hedging. And I guess the other right along with this is at this environment, I'm not sure what's normal or abnormal? Whether past year or right now is normal going forward?","Edward Tilly","Well, it's a long answer, Rich, and I'm glad you asked it, because not surprising to you, I'm sure, is we've spend a great deal of time looking at VIX options, and you know our relationship with the trading community, we're able to really dig deep, and really have our biz development guys, and our research guys go out and ask our best customers, what do you see, what's going on, what's trading, what's not trading and why?","And I think importantly all that dialog, we've heard nothing that would imply structural problem or contract design flaw. But in order to better understand really the entire VIX option decline, I think it's important to put that in context. This is a quarter, where overall industry volume was down 9%.","So our time with the buy and the sell-side customers, they made comments like volume maybe moving from listed to OTC, your regulatory changes, big changes in January forced banks to increase their capital reserves, and then some other smaller comments. But the one factor that we heard more and more and over and over cited the most consistently was just overall complacency in the market.","As for the two comments that I mentioned, we actually benefit from a robust market for OTC VIX options. The layoff business comes to our floor that drives volume in the listed market. And unfortunately, we're told that the OTC VIX options activity is down as well. As for changes in bank capital requirements that might be affecting overall industry volume, they are not specific, so we kind of discounted that.","And then in the prepared remarks, we made comments that we've seen volume down in ETF and ETN volatility options, our VIX options are down, OTC volatility options are down. And without the absence or really with the absence of concerns about a real sharp sustained market pullback, VIX in all of these volatility option contracts continue to suffer.","We've seen perceptions change overnight. That's not unusual for us, but the go-to-contract and strategies for tail risk hedge are just now working in this environment. So what do we do? We're committed to the business development efforts. We're going to continue to grow the base of VIX users for futures and options. And when sentiment changes, and it always does, we'll have a larger base, better informed base, and we'll see the volumes return.","Rich Repetto","You were well prepared for my question.","Edward Tilly","Well, Rich, we were looking at this for a quarter or actually for the last two months, and this is really appropriately on everyone's mind.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James.","Patrick OShaughnessy","I want to talk about some of the new products that you've launched over the few months, the FTSE, the MSCI. Can you talk about what the sales process and cycles like to try to get new customers to trade those products, because clearly it's still very early, there 's not much of interest yet in some of those products. Kind of what's the process like and what are your expectations?","Edward Provost","Of course, we have out product of FTSE contracts yet. MSCI is a product, which appeals to the same set of institutional investors that we reach out today. So whereas when we talked about the volatility options on the 10-year bond and going to a whole different set of users, that was and will continues to be a challenge, because it's a different rolodex than we have been dealing with historically.","MSCI, and when we bring up the FTSE contracts, those are going to be people that we have and continue to be engaged with. It is a combination of face-to-face engagements with all segments of the institutional community and we look at these primarily as institutional products, so that would include hedge fund, managed money, mutual funds and people like that and we do those in various environments ranging from again direct one-on-one visits. We are engaged with them at conferences where we participate as speakers and as sponsors.","And then of course, as we often refer to in our own Risk Management Conference, which is a continually expanding proposition. We get a real captive audience of all of the natural users of our index products. So it's more of the same on those products, again contrasting those net set of products with the volatility products, which we have launched, it's tied to the CME product where your user set is quite a different group of users. So it's all of the kinds of education engagements that we have been conducting routinely and VIX and SPX will apply to those products as well.","Edward Tilly","Just following-on as far as new products, we're actually looking at the launch of the VIX Weekly as a new product launch. This really is a true weekly contract based on the 30-day number. So we're looking forward to launching that futures contract and then options to follow. That will take a more a real house rollout of a product, if you will, because it's an extension of a weekly on a very well-known 30-day contract. So a lot in the pipeline; can't wait to get that weekly contract launched. And really, again, go at the short-term demands from our customers to have a weekly volatility contract.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Just wanted to follow-up. Just on, I guess the CapEx and just your thoughts on the trading platform. Just wanted to make sure we understand based on that initiative, the timing of it, maybe the resources, and then how we think about like the current cash, the cash generation, and then what you guys have been doing, say, over the past couple of years in terms of buyback levels and the dividend and the increase feature.","Alan Dean","CBOE Vector, as stated, it's included in our guidance for CapEx as well as core expenses. But it wasn't there in the guidance that we came out with three months ago. So we got there by cutting other things. I can't be specific about what the cost of vector is, but what I can tell you that it's included in the guidance. It's a multi-year project.","And in 2016, the two items that will be impacted most by CBOE Vector, our CapEx and depreciation and amortization. So as we rollout CFE in the second half of 2016, the amortization of that project will begin. And CapEx for 2016 will obviously include the continued support of that project. And at this point, I would guess that we'll be somewhere in the $40 million to $50 million range for CapEx in 2016. Although, at this point, it's a guess on my part, but from where I see that's what it look, or stated differently, I think it will be slightly higher than this year, but slightly lower than last year on a CapEx.","Cash generation, no change in cash generation our approach to capital allocation. So invest in our business as we need to, to ensure our future growth. Dividends, want to see those dividends grow their business, followed by stock repurchases, and that's our preferred method of returning capital to shareholders. But I'm not ruling out other things. We've done special dividends in the past even a tender a few years ago. So I won't rule out any approach to capital management. And as a matter of fact, the continuing stories don't hold on to shareholder cash, return it to when we can.","Edward Provost","Let me just add a little bit of color, since you went back to the CBOE Vector. This is something we've been doing preliminary design work for over a year, and we're very excited about our progress. It's going to be a completely new systems architecture design from the ground up to accommodate or growing proprietary product line and the ongoing evolution of market structure. So our technology people can be more excited about what we're doing.","In fact, we've challenged that step to build a best-in-class trade engine that emphasizes increase processing speed, while improving upon what we think to be an already leading industry functionality. Specifically, we're going to be focus on increasing risk monitoring tools, provide a more efficient processing of quotes and trades, and providing increased systems stability, which seems to be such a hot topic across the industry these days.","As Ed mentioned in his opening remarks, we're going to begin this with a rollout second half in our all electronics CFE. Following that, we will implement this in CBOE and C2. And in CBOE, we will be adding the necessary functionality to accommodate our hybrid market model. We have handpicked within our current systems staff some of our sharpest developers to begin this project, and we have gone outside and brought in some very, very skilled people, who have experience into developing advanced trade engine technology.","But probably as important is that we are committed to maintaining the CBOE Command platform as we will be using that platform for the next couple of years at least in the exchanges, which are not yet going to be going on the CBOE Vector. So we're very, very excited about our progress to date and where this will take us.","Edward Tilly","I think that's balanced approach, but I think for all of you to look inside of CBOE, we've been so excited to bring new products to the marketplace, and that's really how we view innovation and we really relied on a system that has served us so well. And to really unleash these tech guys here, who have been just dying to do some stuff and cutting edge and change the industry, this is an amazing opportunity for us. And Ed said, we're going to rely on the in-house expertise.","Of course, Alan is going to be watching the checkbook, but this is really exciting, and the early architectural returns are really cool. I cannot wait to give you updates on the next calls on how this is coming along, the excitement from when we unleash this to our end-users and allow them to give their input on what's going to make the mix of our cool unique products with a system that's unmatched in the industry, so it's really exciting stuff, but Alan's got the eye on the deliverable for sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm","Maybe just on the expanded trading hours, a little bit more detail on what you've seen so far, since the options rolled out? Who is trading? What have you learned? And also how that's different from the futures rollout, I guess, last year?","Edward Provost","Yes, it's very much what we had anticipated. So as you know, and we've talked about in the past, we anticipated and saw a pretty quick development on the futures side, because the futures world was much more accustomed to 24-hour trading. Securities side of our business, not quite as a custom. However, we've seen very good success in our 2 A.M. to 8.15 A.M. session, averaging about a thousand contracts a day, across both our VIX and SPX products. This better be the option products.","And we are seeing even in the last couple of weeks, additional large broker dealers finalized their operational efforts to try to get prepared for this. So it was a bigger effort on the part of the broker dealer community than there was on the futures side, and getting prepared for this. We moved ahead notwithstanding some of those not being fully prepared and they are coming online.","So we are seeing a good number of small trades, so the volume that I've represented doesn't represent two or three large trades, but rather a good number of small trades making up those thousand contracts. So we're just in Europe with our sales team. A lot of very positive comments about interest in trading these products, so we couldn't be more pleased.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","So I want to follow-up on Vector. Can you give us some more details on the enhancements and specifics on the platforms? So how do transactions piece change and any other quality metrics? How do you expect Vector to compare to kind of the metrics at other exchanges? How does risk management change? How does maintenance cost change? Like just a little bit more, so we can fully understand or maybe better understand, how big a deal this can be and what it could mean for CBOE?","Edward Tilly","So the system's architecture is key. So our CBOE command platform, which is a derivative of CBOE Direct, which we originally designed in the early 2000, was based upon what at that time was the most advanced architecture that the industry knew. And we believed at that time and for many years that was the leading trading platform in the industry.","As time has moved on, we have made substantial modifications to that, both enhancing the hardware and the software, adding functionality, the leading functionality, adding risk management tools, which are in place today. But as you continue to build on a system that was originally designed some years back, you lose a little bit of the efficiency, because the path of orders enclosed through the system is not as direct as you would like.","So there is a certain layering of, and I want to get over my skews in terms of the technology, but there is a certain layering that exists in the original architecture, which we are trying to eliminate, so that the path of message traffic through this system is much more efficient. So that drove our decision to rather than continue to refine and enhance our current platform to really start from scratch.","We would expect, and again, at the end of the day, once the system is built, we'll see if our proof-of-concepts play out. But we have expectation that our system speed will match, if not exceed, all of which is in place today in the industry. And most importantly it will eliminate any caps that may exist in the current technology.","Risk management tools, which again, we have experienced, was because we've incorporated those in our currently technology are constantly evolving. We've made modifications to the first risk management tools that we put in our system many years ago. And by being able to build those into a new system, we think we'll be able to enhance those.","So we're very optimistic on both, performance, functionality changes. It will be easier to change our system, when the market model changes. Although we are currently planning on our market model, as it exist today, but we'll be able to make modifications in the new system in a much more easy and efficient way, given the way we are designing it.","Alan Dean","And the cost side, the way we're looking at this is, while the project is underway, while development is underway of Vector, we'll have double maintenance, if you will. So I'll have programmers, developers, not only maintaining command, as you heard Ed say, we're committed to do, but we'll have other programmers developing the software for CBOE Vector. But all those costs are included in our guidance that I gave you. So I think we're doing a pretty good job of managing that.","Now, looking forward, there is a software for each new exchanges rolled out. I expect our maintenance cost, and I don't mean hardware maintenance, I mean developer maintenance of the system, how long it takes to make changes to the system, how many people you need devoted to maintaining the software of each exchange, I expect that to decline.","I can't put numbers on that right now. I don't think it would be fair for me to do that. But as I get clarity on that in the future, I'll point it out. But we won't see that for -- it will start in 2016, and really the significant savings won't happen until well after that. So overall from a financial point of view, this is no brainier as far as I am concerned.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","So just a follow-up, I guess, a question on expenses. When I think about the trends in the P&L over the last couple of years, you guys are essentially keeping the core expenses flat year-over-year, up only looks like low single-digits versus 2013, which is great of course.","But when you kind of take a step back, and Ed, taking your comments on the increase in cyclicality, I guess, for the VIX product, and your need to investments in new strategies and new products, and today you guys are doing I think a lot more on the new product from than you did a couple of years ago. I guess the question is how sustainable is the current kind of flattish expense backdrop for the firm as a whole, not just for this year, but I guess for the next couple of years?","Alan Dean","It's a good question, absolutely. Our stated goal on core expenses is to hold the growth, the rate of inflation 3% to 5%. And I think we've done a pretty good job at that. So it's not flat expense. But at the same time, this volume that we're seeing now is not new. We had a similar downturn last summer and a couple of years before that, we've reacted the same way each time we've caught delayed expenses, reduced expenses, where we can.","And sometimes those expense reduction stick and will follow into the following year and sometimes because it's only a delay in expenses, they don't. We're not holding back on anything on any expense item. We need to spend the money. We're spending the money to ensure our future growth. No doubt about it. Same goals in CapEx. So 3% to 5% of growth in core expenses, I think is a reasonable goal and even given our marketing goals.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christian Bolu of Credit Suisse.","Christian Bolu","Just a quick follow-up on the decline in VIX options. And as you noted, you've done lots of analysis on drivers here. It'd be useful for us to get a sense of maybe changes in trading strategies over time. Maybe what was the most popular trading strategy on the VIX options in 2014 and how has that changed so far in 2015? I ask the question, because we hear that activity in yield enhancing trading strategy seems to be on the decline a little bit.","Edward Tilly","I think there are a couple of factors. If we drill down above the overall complacency in the market, what has changed? And I think the end-user from that perspective, VIX options specifically were in amazing tail risk hedge. And if you look at the first few months of the year, a little different story over the last month I'd say, the higher vol-of-vol.","So the cost of using an out-of-the-money VIX call, let's say, the 30 delta call, which is a perfect tail risk hedge, last year in an environment where the volatility of VIX calls was roughly 60 or 70. In February that volatility was 110, 120. So the cost for that tail risk hedge, as measured by the price of a 30 delta option in VIX, was extremely expensive when looking at 2014 levels. So we lost that hedge.","We would look over in the SPX, and we might assume that they showed up in the SPX, where that volume was up on the quarter. But certainly they did not show up in a big way in VIX option. So that's one player that didn't show up. The ones that were there that we're actually hedging using VIX, unlike 2014, where we would see a downturn one day likely followed-up the downturn for a number of days.","The ability to monetize your hedge in 2014 was much easier than the choppiness that we see this year. So take yesterday as a perfect example. Markets down at 1 point, 15 to 20 S&P 500 points, no one thought they'd come in today or the sentiment is, not expecting to come in today and seeing a follow-through. Well, sure enough, markets up again.","So it's very, very difficult to monetize a hedge this year compared to last. There's just not that long-term expectation that we're entering into a sustained bear market or out of the slow grind-off that we're seeing today. So those are kind of the two primary differences. And I think all of that is important to recognize that trading hasn't stopped in VIX. It's just down from 2014, which was a great year.","So what do we do, we get back to the Street, we continue to teach and tell the story, knowing that expectations over time will change, macroeconomic drivers will change and the utility of VIX will certainly be back in the marketplace. And what we plan on is with a bigger user base that's more well-informed, and we'll have seen another different market as backdrop and their ability to use VIX going forward.","Christian Bolu","So just on your point about the high VIX or VIX being headwind from a cost perspective, dose that change how you think about what the ideal conditions are for VIX trading, in terms of the absolute levels of VIX and then the levels of VVIX?","Edward Tilly","Can you just say that one more time?","Christian Bolu","I'm just trying to get a sense, I think historically you've said, it could be wrong here, but VVIX over a 100 tends to be a good trading environment and VIX around 18 tends to be a good environment. Does this change the way you think about that?","Edward Tilly","So two different numbers. So VIX at 18 still pretty good, that's pretty much a sweet spot. We like that. But vol-of-vol, which is the measure of the volatility of VIX option, so if you take our same VIX methodology and you overlay that methodology on VIX options, and we look at the vol-of-vol, that actually gives you the relative price, real-time prices. What our users are willing to pay for VIX options exposure that became very expensive in the first quarter.","Now, that's a good driver, high vol-of-vol of VIX futures. Our VIX futures are really only down similar to the industry's average. So I think that higher vol-of-vol really help support the VIX futures trading, but it really made VIX options much more expensive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Ed, maybe if you can comment a little bit more about some of the transitioning and the over the counter we're hearing that as well, there is some substitution effect, that you did mention, obviously the benefit of the laying off the risk on the listed market. Do you view that as a one-for-one-type of substitution or is there something else that's driving the OTC trend that could be unfavorable from the listed perspective?","Edward Tilly","We certainly recognize that there is OTC trading of VIX options, just like these OTC trading in SBX and other index options and ETPs and single stock. And we maintain and have been very vocal that we prefer all trades to go with markets and exchanges where investors can benefit from transparency, competitive price discovery, the potential of a price improvement, whereas OTC is not subject to price discovery, price improvement or trading reporting functions.","We have heard reports that it might be cheaper to trade VIX op exchange, that's your substitute idea. But since the private transactions OTC, it's kind of difficult to speak directly to the all-in cost of trading OTC, since every trade is negotiated separately and kind of priced differently, so are our fees all-in, are they part of the bid spread, it's very, very difficult to look at a bundled OTC fee compared to listing.","So we do see and hear that there is definitely OTC trading in VIX, but again I think in the prepared remarks I pointed to, we benefit from that layoff business. I'd love a big OTC VIX market. Unfortunately, it's shrinking as well. The utility of an OTC VIX is no different then that of the utility of listed.","So we've seen that OTC volume decline. And obviously then the layoff business that we would benefit from in the listed market declines as well. So we have definitely heard those comments, but unfortunately that volume is shrinking as well, so nothing new really to report on how we benefit from OTC trading.","Brian Bedell","And then just as you were asking, answering that last prior question on the monetization of the VIX hedges, how much do you think you need the cost of volatility to go down from sort of current levels to make that monetization?","Edward Tilly","Now, the cost of volatility is actually down. So VIX is down from where it was in February and the beginning of March. As I say, we're up on that 120, 115, 120 area. So that part is cooperating. But what's not, as again, I look through yesterday, there is no long-term worry, there is no long-term concern on the macro U.S. market right now. And again, would love to, not looking forward to seeing fall through on a down day, but its certainly the expectation of our traders that, I'll just show up the next day and everything will be back to normal, and sure enough that's what's going on this morning.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Rutschow of CLSA.","Rob Rutschow","Most of my questions have been answered. I was just curious about the -- it looks like the $30 million loan to an affiliate. Could you just tell us what that is and what the reserve is for?","Alan Dean","The investment at OCC. You want to know what it is. Rob, you broke up a little bit.","Rob Rutschow","What the loan was for and does that impact capital return in anyway this year?","Alan Dean","So yes, we did send $30 million order to the OCC as a part of their recapitalization plan, that rule that they followed is still working its way through the SEC. No, I don't expect any impact, any change in either the level of capital return to our shareholders or how we approach things, no impact at all, and so non-event as I far as I am concerned.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Wondering if you would comment at all on how deep the VIX customer pool is? And I guess, the reasons I am asking is kind of curious about whether the minor pullback we've seen is broad-based among a lot of different users, and traders and customers or is its been fairly concentrated among kind of the few large players?","Edward Tilly","A couple of ways, we have seen very, very large traders not participate after expiration in January. Those are the big, big traders. I mean, multiple 100,000 contract prints, and they were out of the market after the January expiration. Now, interestingly, about a week-and-a-half ago, we saw one of those large traders come back in a very, very big way.","You may have seen the headlines. This was 500,000 or 600,000 contract trade, so that was the first time that large trader has come back. And again, we point to a change of market conditions. We went to pricing of those options that this guy uses and finds it useful, and that we can look at the cost of that insurance and the cost of that upside protection as one of those drivers. But as I said, first return about a week-and-a-half ago in a very, very big way.","What's also changed is the utility that those from the credit market have found in using the term structure of VIX as a hedge for their exposure. That went away right around that flatness in the volatility curve coming out of that first quarter and that first earnings call of the year. So that trader hasn't come back either. But the big guys, first return encouraging, as I say, about a week-and-a-half or two weeks ago, and that's a very, very big deal.","The rest of the users we do see the assets under management in the notes that are sponsored by major financial institutions. Those investments are up. And as a result, again, I think one of the causes for our VIX futures volume to just mirror the decline that the rest of the industry has seen in the first quarter, so little different answers depending on product and depending on users.","What we need to do is really push out the strategy into the pension funds and the insurance industry and reeducate on, okay, the price of insurance now is back to normal levels, the volatility surface looks like it did in the middle part of last year. But again, it is managing the overall complacency in the market in general.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Stratton of Citi.","Neil Stratton","I just had a question for Alan on expenses. You mentioned the ability to flex your spend up and down depending on the backdrop, so the question is what timeframe would you need to either tighten or loosen the string, so to speak. And just for example, if you were to go another three months with a tough backdrop, would that be the time to sort of rethink about the spending outlook?","Alan Dean","There is not a timeframe. It could be next week, it could be next month. Actually it's continuous. We always look at expenses. And what we look at is volume, volume trends, product mix, those things that affect our revenue. We have been responsive before on the expense side, as you mention, and when we see lower volume, and that behavior will continue, and the line items that were impacting our employee costs, professional fees outside services travel, and promotion.","We look for items that could be scaled back or delayed. And we are looking for a short term solution to what I view is a short term problem, and so no timeframe. If its really horrible volume, it'd be sooner. If it's mediocre volume, probably push it out a little bit, or it's really dynamic. But the commitment to watch expenses is there.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Debbie Koopman for any closing remarks.","End of Q&A","Deborah Koopman","Thank you. That completes our call this morning.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that CBOE Holdings posted record fourth quarter financial results, capping of a record setting performance for 2012, despite the year\u2019s well known macro challenges. ","CBOE\u2019s total options volume for 2012 was down 8% compared to volume declines of 12% in the US options industry, 14% in the US futures trading, and 19% in the US stock market. Our total options and futures average daily volume in the fourth quarter declined 4% from the same period in 2011, offset by 11% increase in average revenue per contract, driven by higher growth rates in our proprietary product lines.","Our ability to leverage our higher margin products and to effectively manage our resources enabled CBOE to continue to invest in future growth initiatives and to return increased value to stockholders in 2012. ","I am pleased to report that our total stockholder return for 2012 was 19%, up from 15% in 2011. Moreover, we began 2013 well positioned to continue to grow and shape the options and volatility space.","Alan will take you through the numbers, so the balance of my remarks will focus on how we intend to lead the industry\u2019s secular growth and to further expand opportunities that are unique to CBOE.","More than anything, a singular focus on options and volatility trading is what has enabled CBOE to continue to lead and define the industry it created 40 years ago this April. We remain at the forefront by providing investors with innovative solutions to meet their evolving investment needs.","Helping customers to execute success is more than a tagline. It is a company-wide vision and mission that translates into customer and stockholder value through a sustained investment in three key areas, product development, trading technology, and investor education. ","Turning first to product innovation. There are several developments to note with regard to our proprietary product lines, options and futures on the CBOE volatility index and the CBOE","S&P 500 options complex. The growth story of VIX options and futures in 2012 was made more remarkable given the backdrop of historically low volatility and low trading volumes throughout the world\u2019s markets. Average daily volume in VIX options rose 53% in the final quarter of 2012 and 14% for the year, posting a sixth consecutive record volume year. VIX futures more than tripled the fourth quarter and rose 99% for the year posting a third consecutive volume year. We are of course thrilled with the volume, but even more gratified to see that it is increasingly driven by a broader user base.","Historically, growth in VIX futures and options parallel the growth in exchange traded products, or ETPs, tied to the VIX. While ETPs continue to be a meaningful driver of volume, customer research confirms significant growth in both the number and types of participants using our VIX products. Specifically, we now see significant activity among proprietary trading firms, hedge funds, CTAs, pensions, endowments, and registered investment advisors. We believe that the growth of VIX user base from a core group of early adopters to a broader more diverse customer base that we see today is due in large measure to CBOE\u2019s ongoing commitment to investor education. ","CBOE\u2019s options institute has greatly increased its VIX related curricula to keep up with customer demand and our annual risk management conference which will be held next month in Carlsbad, California continues to showcase the evolving state-of-the-art in VIX trading.","In our last call, we touched on other fronts to expand our VIX customer base, including plans to launch a London hub. I am pleased to say that the hub was launched on February 1st, providing our European customers with an economic and efficient connection to the CBOE\u2019s futures exchange trade matching engine. Pending regulatory approval, we plan to begin rolling out expanded trading hours in VIX futures in May, which will allow European customers to access a longer trading session in their local time zone and we will also meet the demand from US customers for expanded trading hours.","Moving on now to our S&P 500 product line, which includes our flagship SPX contract, SPX Weeklys, and SPXpm. Each offers a unique way to trade options on the S&P 500 and each carries our highest options rate per contract. Although trading in our SPX complex was down 7% for 2012, SPX Weeklys continue to shine brightly as one of our fastest growing products up nearly 70% over 2011\u2019s record performance. We look forward to moving SPXpm from C2s all electronic environment to CBOE\u2019s hybrid model on February 19th, which will expose Xpm to a broader base of likely users, including our very active SPX trading crowd on the floor of the CBOE. The migration also unifies all our S&P 500 products on a single exchange, making it more straightforward to access our entire S&P product line and easy to execute spreads between and among those products.","On December 10, 2012, the CBOE futures exchange launched an S&P 500 variance futures contract, which is based on realized or actual variance of the S&P 500 index and mirrors the quoting conventions and economic performance of the over the counter variance swaps. Much isn\u2019t written about the futurization of the swaps market and our S&P 500 variance product which was customized to meet the needs of OTC variance swap market users. The S&P 500 variance trading is a major focus for CBOE in 2013. Not only is there great opportunity for an exchange traded S&P 500 variance product but we believe that the CBOE is a natural home given the close relationship between variance, volatility, and SPX trading. We are working closely with customers to ensure the specifications of our variance futures are aligned with the OTC variance market. We are encouraged to see some trading and even as we continue to fine tune the product. ","Moving on now to multiply-listed options. As you know, competition in this space is fierce and fast changing. CBOE\u2019s total market share for the year, excluding dividend trades was up 1.6 percentage points over 2011, reflecting positive customer response to the volume incentive program we introduced in 2012. However, market share declined in the fourth quarter to 26.5% from 29.3% in the third quarter, and 26.7% in the fourth quarter of 2011. ","We know we can never rest on yesterday\u2019s winning strategy in this hyper competitive environment and made numerous adjustments to our VIP program to counter the erosion in market share. I am pleased to report that we began to see an increase in market share following the implementation of our most recent changes made on February 1st. We are determined to lead the daily battle for market share by leveraging our strengths, our unique product line, competing in complimentary market products and innovative pricing programs. ","In addition to our recent changes to VIP, we made even more radical changes to our C2 options exchange. C2\u2019s growth was hampered in recent quarters largely due to the resurgence in popularity of traditional payment for order flow models over maker-taker models. We elected to retool C2 entirely, not merely just as another payment for order flow model, but as an innovative alternative that provides a pricing plan unlike anything else in the options industry. C2\u2019s new DPM centric model launched on February 1st features a unique spread based pricing plan, in which fees and rebates are based primarily on C2\u2019s market width at the time of the trade. Tighter spreads are rewarded with lower fees and rebates are also based on the width of the spread. Although feedback from C2 participants is very positive, we are not expecting to see immediate results. Unlike a simple fee change, C2 offers an entirely new approach to pricing, consequently it takes a bit more time on the front end for firms to fully acclimate to the new C2. Ultimately, we believe spread pricing in combination with C2\u2019s new DPM model will provide the maximum incentive for order flow providers to route orders to C2. We look forward to reporting on the results of these changes made to both our options exchanges going forward in 2013.","Long term secular trends, independent studies and our own customer research consistently point towards strong ongoing growth and options in volatility trading. Volume in the first month of January was encouraging. Industry wide trading volume rose 8% over 2012 and equity options trading rose 4% and Index options volume driven primarily by CBOE\u2019s products was up 53% from the previous January. VIX options and futures both soured to new monthly volume records in January. VIX futures\u2019 average daily volume was up 241% and VIX options\u2019 average daily volume was 85% over a year ago. While we are hesitant to read too much into a single month of trading, we believe that 2013 holds great growth opportunities for our company, given greater retail participation in the market and continued migration of many forms of OTC trading to exchange markets, the futurization of swaps and increased globalization. Moreover, we believe CBOE is uniquely positioned to benefit from the realization of these major growth drivers. We are thrilled with the opportunities before us in 2013, which in many ways is a momentous year for CBOE.","As I mentioned earlier, this April marks the 40th anniversary of CBOE and the options industry. Shortly thereafter, Ed Tilly will assume his new role as CBOE\u2019s CEO, Ed Provost will take over as CBOE\u2019s President and COO, and I will move into my new role as Executive Chairman. ","We are in the midst of what I would call a very deliberate and measured transition process, which, I am happy to say is going smoothly as planned. Ed Tilly, Ed Provost and I continue to work very closely together to insure that when the transition is completed our company leadership is well positioned to begin the next great chapter in CBOE\u2019s history.","Thank you for your attention. I will now turn it over to Alan.","Alan Dean","Thanks Bill. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. This morning I will take you through our fourth quarter results, as well as provide guidance on certain financial metrics for 2013. ","We ended 2012 on a strong note, posting record fourth quarter financial results. Our operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $130.1 million, up 8% compared with last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income was $64.9 million, representing a 49.9% of operating revenue, a 300 basis point improvement in operating margin. Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders was $38.9 million, up 17% compared with the fourth quarter of 2011, which translates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.45. ","Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2011 include certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck.","Turning to the details of the quarter, as shown on this chart, the growth in operating revenue was driven by increases in transaction fees, exchange services, and other fees and regulatory fees, offset somewhat by lower access fees. Transaction fees increased $3.8 million, or 4% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter, due to an 11% increase in average revenue per contract, or RPC, compared with last year\u2019s fourth quarter, offset somewhat by a 6% decline in trading volume. If you recall, we lost two trading days in the fourth quarter when all US exchanges closed due to Hurricane Sandy. While total trading volume declined for the quarter, volume in our index options and VIX futures contracts increased, which had a favorable impact on RPC and transaction fees for the quarter. ","Our blended RPC, including options and futures, increased to $0.355, primarily reflecting a shift in product mix towards our higher margin index options and futures contracts, as well as an increase in the revenue per contract generated from these products. The RPC in our options business increased 3% to $0.322 compared with $0.312 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The increase was a result of index options accounting for a higher percentage of total options volume, as well as a 6% increase in revenue per contract for index options to $0.67. At the same time, the contribution from CFE, our futures exchange, has become more meaningful and we are realizing the benefit of the higher RPC it generates. For the fourth quarter, the RPC for futures contracts was $1.44, a 9% increase compared with last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","As this slide depicts, index options accounted for 31.4% of all contracts traded in the fourth quarter of 2012, in comparison with 28% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Futures contracts accounted for 3% of total volume, up significantly versus its contribution of just less than 1% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Converting the volume to transaction fees, index options accounted for 59% of transaction fees and futures contracts accounted for 12%, up from 55% and 4%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Exchange services and other fees increased by $3.6 million versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter, as a result of fee changes we implemented at the beginning of 2012. The $2.3 million increase in regulatory fees resulted from CBOE raising its options regulatory fee and C2\u2019s implementation of an options regulatory fee in August of 2012. Keep in mind, revenue derived from regulatory fees, as well as fines can only be used for regulatory purposes. We increased these fees in response to higher expenses we are incurring to carry out our obligations as a self-regulatory organization and also to account for lower trading volume. ","Continuing down the income statement, this next slide details total adjusted operating expense of $65.2 million for the quarter, which was up $1.4 million or 2%, compared with last year\u2019s fourth quarter, primarily due to higher costs for outside services. Adjusted operating expense for the fourth quarter of 2012 excludes $5 million accrued for an estimated liability related to the resolution of a previously disclosed SEC investigation. We are engaged in ongoing settlement discussions with the SEC staff on the resolution of this matter, however no agreement has been reached.","Core operating expense was $46.3 million, an increase of $4.8 million or 11% compared with the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting increases in outside services and employee costs, offset somewhat by lower travel and promotional expenses. Outside services were up primarily due to higher legal expenses pertaining to litigation activity. The increase in employee costs was due to a higher accrual adjustment for incentive compensation compared with 2011\u2019s fourth quarter. The decrease in travel and promotional expense was driven by lower costs incurred for advertising. ","Volume-based expense, which includes royalty fees and trading volume incentives, was $12.7 million for the quarter, a decrease of $2.1 million, or 14%, versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter, representing decreases of $700,000 of royalty fees and $1.4 million in trading volume incentives. The decline in royalty fees was due to the impact of higher expenses recognized in the fourth quarter of 2011 to adjust for another accrual of expenses. Trading volume incentives were down due to lower trading volume in multiply-listed options contracts and changes in the criteria for contracts that qualify for the quantity-based fee waivers.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 33.1% was down significantly from last year\u2019s effective tax rate of 39.2%, primarily as a result of tax benefits recognized during the quarter. The effective rate for the current quarter includes the benefit of significant discrete items relating to prior years totaling $5.4 million, or $0.06 per share as well as the recognition of other discrete items. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter included the impact of an increase in the Illinois tax rate effective January 1, 2011. This slide gives you the details of the tax adjustments to GAAP results. ","In 2012, our strong cash flow generation enabled us to repurchase shares of nearly $53 million and return more than $114 million to stockholders through dividends which included the payment of a special dividend of $0.75 per share, or $66 million in the fourth quarter. There were no share repurchases made under our share authorization in the fourth quarter of 2012 or to date this year. Thus, we have $103.3 million remaining on our existing share authorization. A few days ago, we announced that we declared a dividend of $0.15 per share over the first quarter of 2013. ","Our capital position remains strong. We ended 2012 with cash and cash equivalents of $135.6 million and a debt-free balance sheet. Our capital deployment strategy and priorities remain unchanged. Our first priority is to fund the growth of our business. Then we will look to repurchase shares to enhance our EPS growth and stockholder returns. Finally, we will look to show steady consistent growth in our annual dividend payout.","Let\u2019s now move to our 2013 guidance for certain financial metrics. For 2013, we expect core expenses to be in the range of $189 million to $194 million. The increase versus 2012 primarily reflects higher expenses for stock-based compensation and regulatory services. In our ongoing effort to maintain the highest standards for regulation and compliance we have increased resources devoted to regulatory services, primarily additions to staff and enhancements to our regulatory systems. At the same time, effective January 2nd of this year, we increased the options regulatory fee, which is designed to cover these costs. We expect the additional revenue generated from regulatory fees to offset the incremental costs with no impact to our bottom line.","Turning to stock-based compensation. This year we are granting additional shares of restricted stock. In the first quarter of this year we expect to record approximately $3.2 million of accelerated stock-based compensation to recognize the expense for certain executives due to provisions contained in agreements regarding their employment. Accelerated stock-based compensation is not included in core expenses and will be reconciled as a non-GAAP item. Excluding continuing stock-based compensation of approximately $18 million, core expenses are expected to increase 2% to 5% compared with 2012\u2019s comparable expense of $167 million.","Since stock-based compensation will fluctuate a bit quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of stock grants, the appendix includes a slide that provides guidance by quarter. In 2013, capital spending is expected to be between $35 million to $40 million, up versus the $30 million we spent in 2012. This increase primarily reflects additional capital spending to enhance our systems and software for regulatory services.","In conclusion, as we enter 2013, CBOE Holdings is strongly positioned in terms of our innovative products and services, operational performance, and financial condition to accomplish our strategic objectives. While we are investing to further strengthen our business, we see opportunity to continue to gain long-term margin improvement. Our financial strength affords us the flexibility to invest in growing our businesses and pursue new opportunities, while we continue to deliver value to our stockholders.","With that, I will turn the call over to Debbie so we can take your questions. Thank you.","Deborah Koopman","At this point, we would be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits we will take a second question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Richard Repetto from Sandler O'Neill, your line is open.","Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","Yes, good morning Bill, good morning Alan.","William Brodsky","Good morning, Richard.","Alan Dean","Good morning, Richard.","Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","Congrats. I think this is the 10th straight quarter to be here but \u2013 if we are keeping track correctly. ","William Brodsky","We weren\u2019t keeping track, but it\u2019s nice to hear.","Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","Alan, well \u2013 I will leave at that. My question is on \u2013 you did a good job, Bill, of outlining the changes in markets, what you are doing to respond to that. I guess, I just wanted to understand on Slide 12 a little bit more, this designated primary market maker model, how it differs and the spread-based pricing, how it differs from what \u2013 is that C2 and what\u2019s that CBOE as well?","William Brodsky","Yes. It\u2019s really quite innovative. As I said, we are working with the industry to educate them. We had a big meeting with them last week and it was very well received. But I\u2019ll ask Ed Tilly to give you a little bit more detail on that.","Edward Tilly","Hi, Rich. Good morning.","Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","Good morning.","Edward Tilly","So, let me dive in to C2 and it is a different story. Just to remind you from our last earnings call that we told you we weren\u2019t really happy with the C2 market share. Remind you that, we developed C2 as an alternative model. So, what you are seeing is completely new to the industry and I will give you a little bit of a highlights. As you pointed out, we saw the share moving from the \u2013 paying the liquidity provider to post, that maker-taker model, back to the traditional model that pays for flow. So, we had a choice. We could have got into the race VIP, that is just to continue to make payments from the exchange for orders or come up with something completely different, which is at the end of the day what we did. ","So we are trying to reward liquidity providers with lower fees for posting tighter markets and tying customer rebates to the width of the spread. So, that\u2019s different than CBOE. So if a customer trades at a very tight market the liquidity provider pays very little deposit and the rebate is small. But if a customer trades in a light quote, we raise the rebate and raise the fee of the liquidity providers. And as Bill pointed out in the prepared comments, this is new to the industry, it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time to get used to. But we think providing fee incentives for tighter markets we would reward either competitive quoting that aligns us with liquidity providers and customers. We didn\u2019t want to continue to participate in the race of just purely paying for flow without offering incentive to tighter markets.","Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","Got it. And C2 was a maker-taker, if I got it correctly?","Edward Tilly","It was, Richard, you are right, and it continues to be in EPF classes. We do actually quite well on C2 and maker-taker spider for example on IWM, this is really for the multi-list single name classes where we put in the industry\u2019s leading liquidity providers as DPMs to lead the way. ","Richard Repetto - Sandler O'Neill","Great. That\u2019s very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller from BMO Capital Markets, your line is open.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks, good morning everyone.","William Brodsky","Good morning, Jillian.","Alan Dean","Good morning, Jillian.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets","I just wanted to get a little bit more detail hopefully on the pricing change that you made February 1st. Like what exactly did you change? I know in the past you guys have lowered multi-list fees and then kind of set that with higher index fees and that were kind of neutral in terms RPCs. I am not sure if that\u2019s kind of what happened again this year. Any guidance on the 2013 rate per contract would be helpful?","Edward Tilly","Jillian, on February 1st, we modified our VIP rebate, increased the rebate and also modified a customer fee that we had in place for certain exchange traded products and for certain order sizes. That was February 1st. The way I am looking at RPC for the year, for 2013, is if volume is similar in the multi-list products for 2013 compared to 2012, I would expect RPC to be similar relative to two years. What if multi-list volume increases, I would expect RPC in those multi-list products to decline and if multi-list volume declines, I would expect RPC in those products to increase. ","CBOE is uniquely positioned with more than 70% of our transaction fees generated by our proprietary products. However, we must and we will remain competitive pricing on those multi-listed products. So the fee changes that we made on February 2nd were changes that we thought we had to make an order to remain competitive and defend our market share and also to defend other fee categories in our P&Ls, such as access fees, exchange services and other fees, and of course market data revenue was driven by market share. So, that gives you a recap of how I am looking at RPC and the changes we made on February 1st.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Just to clarify one thing. So there weren\u2019t any direct changes made to the index category, it was all associated with the equity and ETF?","Edward Tilly","That is true.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Edward Tilly","On February 1st, yes.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets","Got it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs, your line is open.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks good morning, everybody.","William Brodsky","Good morning.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs","I was wondering if you guys could give us a little bit more color on the, obviously very significant volume growth you are seeing in VIX futures? You highlighted a number, I guess, new adapters and just kind of going through different users that are picking up the product. Maybe you could spend a little bit of time on kind of giving us more sense on who \u2013 which one of these, I guess, maybe, is driving the incremental market share and the outlook there?","William Brodsky","Alex, this is Bill Brodsky. We are seeing, as I said, new users coming in. VIX has become the bench for volatility of equity markets globally. So, we are seeing business coming in from Europe. We are seeing business coming in from pension funds, from institutional investors in the US. We are seeing it coming in from CTAs. We have a team of people in our futures exchange that are geared to educating a whole variety of different types of users. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have our \u2013 I think it\u2019s our 29th or 30th Annual Risk Management conference next month in California, and we will have a tremendous emphasis on the whole volatility line at that time.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got you. But no specific category there you highlighted pretty broadly?","William Brodsky","I would tell you, it\u2019s a variety, but it\u2019s institutional. When I say institutional, it\u2019s a lot of professional type investors and I think Ed Tilly is going to add another aspect to this.","Edward Tilly","Yes, I think, Alex, what we have seen I think is most significant is the volume that we have shown you over the last couple of years, really starting about two years ago, introducing \u2013 when Barclays introduced the first ETP into the marketplace, a lot of the futures volume and a lot of the layoff business into the VIX options was really driven by the incredible growth in assets under management in that category. That\u2019s no longer as in pass vote to the growth that we see on the CFE today. And as Bill points out, asset managers, hedge funds, everyone looking for any volatility exposure, the pure play, moving away from ETP is in our futures exchange. We have got retail traders coming into VIX futures and VIX options. It\u2019s really an incredible story. ETP still play a very very important role but less and less a percent of our overall volume and less and less of a growth story in the recent last 6 months to 12 months.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got it, yes, that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s what I was trying to get to. On the fee side of the equation, it looks like the RPC ticked down sequentially, I think down about 10%. Is this just a function of volumes or there is something else going on, or I guess, how should we think about the rate per contract and the overall category volumes continue to creep higher?","Edward Tilly","Well, you are referring to RPC in 2012 compared to 2011?","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs \t","No, just CFE for the fourth quarter.","Alan Dean","CFE.","Edward Tilly","Oh, CFE. Alan, thank you. That had to do with certain aspects of our fees schedule in CFE related to day trading and also to CBOE permit holders who receive different rates than non-CBOE permit holders when they traded CFE. So, we saw higher activity in those two areas which had the effect of slightly lowering RPC in the futures exchange.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs \t","Got it. So the fourth quarter is a decent run rate you would say, actually when volume stay as robust as they have been.","Edward Tilly","I would say that would be a pretty good place to begin. Although if you look at our history of RPC and CFE, it\u2019s been a little bit on lower demand. So, it is hard to predict, but not a bad place to start off.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs \t","Got you. The last from me, it\u2019s just on capital. You obviously talked about back in the fourth quarter to make the special, still (inaudible) $35 million of cash. I think in the past you talked about $50 million working capital needs, is that still the number and I guess should we expect you guys to resume buyback in the first quarter?","Alan Dean","Yes. What I said in the past is $40 million to $60 million of working capital is kind of our minimum, so that $50 million is right in the middle of that. Our share reauthorization of $103.3 million stands and we will \u2013 our approach towards that with share repurchase hasn\u2019t changed. We are opportunistic and when the time is right we will resume.","William Brodsky","Alex, you got a lot out of that one question.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Thanks, guys.","Alan Dean","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from J.P. Morgan, your line is open.","Kenneth Worthington - J.P. Morgan","Hi, good morning. I have got one question with ten different parts.","William Brodsky","Is it the golden times J.P. Morgan kind of thing going on here?","Kenneth Worthington - J.P. Morgan","Just on, really C2, I thought that the SPXpm product was kind of the flagship product. I may have misinterpreted that, but how does pulling that product kind of impact engagement on C2? I see the retooling and it\u2019s innovative. But if the retooling doesn\u2019t work, what are the levers do you have to pull to kind of jump start C2?","Edward Tilly","Let me just restate. SPXpm and C2 is actually perfect timing. We were looking for an electronic version of the S&P 500, the big macro $1,500 underlying product and we launched C2 in and around the same time when we were trying to compete with (inaudible) pricing model which is relatively new to the marketplace. So, it was more of a perfect storm than a flagship. The index complex here is our key driver, whether it\u2019s on CBOE or C2. For our shareholders, it\u2019s the same. So, what can we attract, how do we attract users to C2 if this big product moves to CBOE and are successful in the hybrid trading environment as we anticipate it will be. Well, we changed the market model. The anchor tenants now are our new DPMs and as I repeat, the biggest liquidity providers in the industry, that\u2019s our new draw to C2, coupled with unique pricing that returns the incentive to liquidity providers for posting tight markets and still pays our customers when they interact with that flow. So, I don\u2019t think I would over play the move of SPX for us, for CBOE, for Alan as he is looking to see how we doing. That\u2019s going to be in our complex, rather it\u2019s the importance that we place on naming these five big liquidity providers to our new pricing model on C2. And if it doesn\u2019t work, to follow-up and answer your \u2013 or to complete the question, we will come up with something new and completely innovative just as we have done with this pricing scheme and we will keep you posted.","Kenneth Worthington - J.P. Morgan","Awesome. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James, your line is open.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James","Hi, good morning, guys.","William Brodsky","Good morning, Patrick.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James","Alan, a question for you. I feel like every quarter you kind of have a separate view of where exchange services and other fees are going to go and they keep kind of staying in there really really strongly. Do you have a view on kind of some of the non-transaction fees in 2013, what\u2019s the outlook for those?","Alan Dean","Well, we gave as much guidance as we could. Last year, we gave you guidance on exchange services and other fees because we dramatically changed the fees that we had in place for those items in 2012 compared to 2011 and I was conservative in my guidance and fortunately it turned out to be a lot better than we expected. There were no significant changes in exchange services and other fees in \u201913 relative to \u201912, so we didn\u2019t give you any guidance. So, the only thing that can change there is utilization and that\u2019s very difficult to predict. ","Other non-transactional revenue items, I think you need to focus on looking at our regulatory fees and I talked about that in my prepared remarks. If you look at our history of the options regulatory fee, it\u2019s up dramatically from where it was a year ago and we implemented a options regulatory fee for C2, and that fee both of those fees, and every customer contract and every U.S. options exchange, so on a matter of word\u2019s rate. So, that\u2019s a significant change and we did that because our regulatory expenses are increasing, I talked about that in our core operating expenses as well as our CapEx is going up as well, we are capitalizing more software related to the enhancement of our regulatory systems. So, I think that\u2019s an area that you should look at and focus, but it\u2019s volume-based, you know, the regulatory fees. I can\u2019t predict where that fee would be for 2013.","Those are the two main items in the non-transaction. Access fees, we didn\u2019t give you guidance on access fees. We didn\u2019t make any fee changes at all to access fees for 2013, for 2012, so just like exchange services and others, that can only go up or down based on usage utilization. Utilization of access fees held pretty steady in 2012. I can\u2019t predict, I don\u2019t know how it will be for 2013. We hope it will be stable to grow, maintaining market share, certainly a foundation for that fee, and I have talked about that many times. And so, I think those are the material non-transactional line items on the revenue side. Hope that helps.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James","All right, very helpful, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo","","Good morning everybody and, Bill, congratulations on your retirement from the CEO post.","William Brodsky","","Thank you, Chris.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo","","I want to follow-up here on the VIX, the institutional update that you guys kind of referenced here. Curious to get your perspective on what the appeal would be for an institutional investor to use the VIX as opposed to say hedging with S&P 500 puts, and then along that line, can growth in VIX here actually cannibalize your S&P 500 volumes overtime.","William Brodsky","","I am talking a shot at the first one. The guy that I look to in this business is really one of the leaders, Larry McMillan who wrote the foundation piece on this. I think there is a view by those who understand how to hedge macro portfolios, but you can hedge a portfolio much less expensively with VIX than you can with SPX puts. And so, this is part of the whole learning process that we are going through in terms of how you ensure if you're long, a large portfolio of equities and you want to protect it. You configure whether you are better off with out-of-the-money put or VIX. And this is part of the excitement of what we are doing in this product and that is that people are learning as they go along. And Larry wrote a very interesting comment there. I can't tell you exactly when it was specifically on that point.","Edward Tilly","","And then, I would add from a traders\u2019 perspective, the VIX, the future specifically eliminates some of the Greek exposure that traders may or may not want in their portfolio. The daily \u2013 the game of managing a position in SPX, if it\u2019s just a pure volatility exposure, the VIX future is that, but then to your cannibalization issue, for us, at the end of the day, our professional traders know that VIX is driven by the strip of options in the S&P 500. ","So as they are trading and their portfolio includes SPX and VIX and VIX options, at the end of the day, they own or are assured the components that make up this strip and the pricing in the SPX and they drive the volume back and forth into from one complex to the other. Think of it just like the biggest customer in the CME futures contract and the S&P 500, other traders on the CBOE is not cannibalizing, that's their underlying. So, the same way the strip of options in SPX provides the pricing for the VIX futures and the VIX futures provides the pricing for VIX options.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo","","Got it, okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Freeman from Barclays. Your line is open.","Roger Freeman - Barclays","Hi, good morning. Just what would you say was the biggest obstacle that you face in getting the SPXpm to really take off on C2 and then let you to add it on the CBOE? And then, just quickly on VIP 2.0, can you clarify what the sort of adjustment is versus 1.0 that has gotten you some share than trailed off a bit? Is there a customer segment that you are targeting there?","William Brodsky","","So, Roger, let me start off on the first part, and Alan will do the second. The interesting thing about SPXpm is that we had decided to put it on C2 for a whole variety of reasons, but what was really happening parallel to this is we are waiting for the SEC to approve C2 weeklies, which we came up with the concept of trading a weekly option. We did it on the Hybrid system in CBOE and it took off bigger than anything we expected. So, a lot of the interest that might have been in SPXpm really started with the weeklies, and by the time we brought out SPXpm, the weeklies already had become a very popular thing. So, it's just more almost the accident of the sequencing of these events more than anything else. And we are very enthusiastic by the way, we are saying February 19th is when we are going to cut over and have SPXpm on CBOE. I think that will make a big difference.","Edward Provost","","Let me add a little bit Roger to what we see in the difference in how SPX is traded versus SPXpm, and compare that perhaps to a single name equity class. Very, very few of the orders that we see in SPX are single-line, meaning one strike at a time. Complex orders, orders that involve more than one strike or spreads are really the way in which people trade, customers trade SPX, the institutions trade SPX. ","Also, our customers reference the futures prices over at the CME and get engaged in these multi-leg strategies, very difficult to replicate on a screen, on SPX, on C2. So, we think by adding liquidity that's found in SPX on the trading floor, surrounding that contract in a hybrid form, meaning brokers can interact with the market makers who are also streaming quotes into the complex really gives us the best opportunity to test and to realize the demand for SPXpm. And then I think you had a VIP question \u2013","William Brodsky","","The biggest change that we made on February 1st related to VIP that I think has the most effect and in the highest cost is that the prior version of what we did is when a firm reached a customer volume threshold, then they would begin earning a credit from that contract on, that was the old version. And the change we made on February 1st was a response to our competition. ","We said once the firm reaches the volumes threshold, we will give them that credit for that customer \u2013 for all the customer contracts not only after that, but the contract won during the month. But that change, which is a direct response to our competition, I think will have the biggest and is having the biggest impact in helping us recapture that lost market share.","Roger Freeman - Barclays","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander from KBW. Your line is open.","Niamh Alexander \u2013 KBW","Hi, thanks for taking my question and for updating on the VIP 2.0. You made it clear that you don't like to see the declining market share, but also maybe that you want to be number one. Is that something that you still want to be? And then, just help me understand, when we have seen the publicly traded competitors, they have gained share, but their effective fees have actually been increasing, not decreasing. So, is it that it's a different customer that they seem to reporting away from you or help me better understand what is going on that they can kind of take share and raise fees as far you are kind of losing share and now you are, it seems like you are cutting fees a little bit.","William Brodsky","","Yes, this is a little bit of speculation, but I think while you might have seen the revenue per contract increase as they gain market share is because they switch from a maker-taker structure in which the spread that they were collecting was lower than their traditional structure. That\u2019s I think was probably a catalyst and why an exchange would have switched from maker-taker to traditional, because they could drive an increase in RPC. And that's some speculation, but that's what I believe now. ","As far as staying number one in a multi-list side, I think it is important for CBOE to stay a leader in all options products categories. It\u2019s a foundation \u2013 being number one is a foundation not only for transaction fees, but for all those other revenue items, line items that I talked about. And so, I think it is important for CBOE and it expands our leverage, the more contracts that we can pump through our trade engine lowers the per cost of that and of operating the system, the per contract cost. And so, yes, I still believe that, and that's our goal.","Niamh Alexander \u2013 KBW","Will this new pricing will be effectively the lowest price in the market?","William Brodsky","","No. The way we are looking at is about equal with our competition.","Niamh Alexander \u2013 KBW","Okay, thanks for taking question.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Howard Chen from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Howard Chen - Credit Suisse","","Hi, good morning everyone. Bill, I guess I will throw out a boarding one that has been asked yet. This merger announcement between ICE and New York Stock Exchange Euronext, you have been all at this for a very long time, but from a competitive position, do you view this good or bad for you? And second, how does this impact you and the boards just participate in industry consolidation more in the near-term than the longer-term? Thanks,","Edward Tilly","","As to your third find, I do not view the potential consolidation is having any major impact on us. We compete with MISC, two operations AMEX and Arca and I see that as basically no change.. I think you have to keep in mind that ICE's main motivation in the transaction was to get a hold of the life. That was their goal. So, we look at NYSE as a very vibrant competitor and we will continue to compete with them. What was the other question?","Howard Chen - Credit Suisse","Your desire to participate in industry consolidations, just generally we have seen a couple of these deals in the industry come in clusters.","William Brodsky","Sure. First of all I, think the general view is that we continue to outperform in our space by a variety of metrics, including total shareholder returned last year if you ignore the 30% premium that put on top of the NYSE's price on December 20th. But we are certainly always conscious of the fact that our size relative to our peers causes this kind of speculation. But there are always compelling reasons for consolidation. Our goal is to enhance shareholder value, but we also are very bullish in our own opportunity for organic growth and I think we continue to show that our organic growth continues to outstrip our peers.","Howard Chen - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks for the thoughts.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Ken Leon from S&P Capital IQ.","Ken Leon - S&P Capital IQ","","Thank you, and my question here is when you look at transaction fee revenue, particularly the fourth quarter year-over-year, your share of fee revenues coming from equity and ETPs have gone from 41% down to roughly 28%. So there's a lot of good positive things happening in the other products and the institutional market. But what does this speak to in terms of either your position, let's say, in ETPs or something about the retail market that impacts equity, where is it positioned possibly for future growth or we are seeing CBOE make a concerted transformation really with products more for institutional markets?","William Brodsky","A lot of comments and a lot of questions there. I will give you my reaction to that shift in transaction fees. It used to be that 25% of our volume was indexes and it represented 50% of our transaction fee revenue and, of course, that metric has changed dramatically in the fourth quarter. ","And along with CFE, the VIX contract really growing incredibly. And some that's a function of two things. First of all, VIX both the future and the option growing incredibly, still on this hockey stick type growth curve, continued increasing interest from multiple users driving that volume. So, that has the impact of increasing the revenue from that category and that's good. On the other hand, if you look at revenue per contract in the multi-list category over the years and in our previous charts, we have a historical chart of our own RPC in a multi-list category, it's been a slow decline in RPC, and I think that will continue in the future because competition is so fierce in that category. And so, the combination of a lower RPC on a negative side, and on a positive side, the tremendous growth in VIX and a strong year on SPX really is the driver of that change. ","So, let me add on I think part of the question was how does CBOE position itself? Is this a deliberate move to move our mix from the multi-list classes into the proprietary complex? And I think we haven't spent any time this morning -- Ed Provost is here, if you want more detail, but our move to \u2013 eventually trade 24x5 to open up a hub in Slough, England to attract users outside of the U.S. trading hours is really directed right at that VIX futures volume, and it allows us to expand other proprietary products if we decide to do so in the future. ","But it is with that mix in mind and shifting being reliant so much on competitive products into what we do best and that is the institutional hedging exchange with the SPX complex and the volatility complex. But I just offer that, that this is the driving force behind increasing to 24x5 in the London hub.","Ken Leon - S&P Capital IQ","","Fairly understand. Thanks.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Akhil Bhatia from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.","Akhil Bhatia - Rosenblatt Securities","Hi, good morning, do you guys, I know it\u2019s early days, but do you have any color on the early adoption in the London hub and how it's being received?","Edward Provost","","Ed Provost here. So the London hub is up and ready for connectivity. We are engaged in discussions with a number of potential users. No one has established connectivity up to this point, but then again we've only been up and running for the last several days. So we are very optimistic given the enquiries we've received that we will see same connectivity in the very near future. We are very optimistic about it.","Akhil Bhatia - Rosenblatt Securities","Okay, great, and just a last one, it looks like the BOX Exchange is trying to launch a S&P related linked contract. Any thoughts upon how that might violate your exclusive with S&P?","William Brodsky","This is Bill Brodsky, we are looking at that as it relates to the site of products. We and S&P are always looking at whether there is a violation of the contract, but at this point, I am not going to get into it. It's a pending filing and we will decide whether we will comment on it or not.","Edward Provost","","I think we are more interested in the BOX filing from the investors' perspective and further fragmentation of liquidity in Spiders. As you know, the minis are going to start. That takes some time to get used to from an investor's perspective, changing the multipliers. We would prefer certainly to see how the retail community adjusts to trading minis before BOX launches a larger multiplier on their contract. We are very mindful of the slow and steady education process that's required around the minis, before we contemplate going to a large contract. So that's what we would prefer. As Bill says, we will be commenting, but in regard to S&P, it is a different issue. We are more concerned with the customers and their confusion and fragmentation of liquidity among different contracts representing the same exposure to S&P 500.","Akhil Bhatia - Rosenblatt Securities","Okay, thanks you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Gaston Ceron from Morningstar Equity Research. Your line is open.","Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research","Hi, good morning. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just real quick here, I know you spoke about the dividend policy a little bit at the beginning of the call. I am not sure if I missed there, or if you didn't mention this, but I was wondering, now that you have paid the special dividend last year, how will you think about that going forward, whether special dividends will remain part of the capital playbook or if it's something that you will review annually or if this was strictly a one-off?","William Brodsky","It's certainly the tax issues that were in play at year-end. It was a key driver on the part of our Board in deciding to do what they will do. I cannot predict if we will do a special dividend every year or never again. But what I can tell you is that our stated policy for dividends, for returning capital to shareholders, what our Board has told me is that they want steady, sustainable regular dividends growth in that annual dividend, supplemented by stock repurchases and don't hang to cash unless we can communicate to shareholders why we are hanging on to that cash. So that fundamental belief policy hasn't changed.","Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research","And then, just very quickly. Just following up on the C2 questions. I was wondering, from now, going forward, what would be your approach to product launches on C2, I mean, how will you sort of use or market there. How as kind of your experience with SPXpm kind of altered and how any future products might deal on C2? ","William Brodsky","","I think as just to kind of restate, C2 really provides us an opportunity to test different models and pricing. We get the broadest liquidity base really relying on the established CBOE. So, I at this point, don't see an exclusive launch for new products on the C2. The liquidity base and the liquidity providers in the penetration in the marketplace and all the major institutions on CBOE and a Hybrid trading model, which allows the interaction with brokers, their ability to query for debt outside of electronic markets, really are a better incubator for new products because of the interaction, the human factor with brokers able to provide liquidity in excess of what's found on the stream. So I don't look for us to launch exclusive on C2.","Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research","Okay, great. Good to know, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Ditmire from Macquarie. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. My question is some of the larger exchanges over the last couple of years, to build out big data centers and today have a lot of excess capacity, does an exchange like CBOE have any opportunities to kind of leverage some of those investments and take advantage of that. I know you guys in general are more of a (ramp or a spy) when it comes to things like data centers, any thoughts?","Alan Dean","","Ed Alan here. While in a way we, capturing some of that revenue and the exchange services and other fees line item. And so, that's part of the same kind of similar revenue that building a big data center would generate courses on a much smaller scale than what you're seeing in New York or I believe in NASDAQ. ","I think the difference is that the underlying \u2014 the reason for building those data centers is you want to place your computers close to the computers of the host exchange that has the underlying security being traded. And that value we haven\u2019t identified as a big potential for us, although I won't close it out in the future you never know. And yes, you're right we have tended to rent versus buy in our move of our data center off to the East Coast. And but if we have talked about that whole issue here in the past, haven't identified a big opportunity other than what we did in that revenue line item so far.","Gaston Ceron - Morningstar Equity Research","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question is a follow-up Jillian Miller from BMO Capital Markets, your line is open.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets","In January, we've seen index volume very strong and ETF volume has been weaker like the S&P options up over 30% year-over-year and Spiders down 23%. Maybe you can just give us an insight into what's driving that market dynamic and whether that mix of business is sustainable longer-term because that kind of have a does kind of have a significant impact on your overall rate per contract?"," ","William Brodsky","Jillian, I don't know if we know of any certainty, but my guess is that we have in some respects, different user groups. The Spider tends to be much more retail. The SPX, as Ed Tilly, said is not only institutional, but it's very sophisticated where most of the trades are not single strike trades, but multiple legs and related to VIX and other things. So, I think we like to watch it over time, but again I think that there are just different user groups that use these things.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, thanks.","William Brodsky","Okay, thanks.","Operator","","I am showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over the management for closing remarks.","Deborah Koopman","","Thank you. That completes our call this morning. We appreciate your time and continued interest in our company, and we look forward to speaking with you in the future.

[Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Debbie Koopman. Ms. Koopman, please go ahead.","Debbie Koopman","Thank you, Keith. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our Chairman, President and CEO will discuss the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Then Brian Schell, our Executive Vice President and CFO will provide an overview on our second quarter financial results and updated guidance for certain financial metrics. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A will be our Chief Operating Officer, Chris Isaacson and our Chief Strategy Officer, John Deters.","In addition, I'd like to point out that, this presentation will include the use of several slides. We will be showing the slides and providing commentary on each. A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","During our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements, which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold. And while we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.","Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a full discussion of the factors that may affect any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after this conference call.","Also note that references made to the planned migration of the Cboe Options Exchange is subject to regulatory review. During the course of the call this morning, we will be referencing non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings material.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Tilly.","Ed Tilly","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on financial results for the second quarter 2019 at Cboe Global Markets, which were primarily driven by higher trading volume and proprietary products compared to the second quarter of 2018 offset by flat to lower trading volumes industry wide in U.S. equities, European equities and global FX.","We remained focused throughout the quarter on executing our strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth and value to our customers and shareholders. I will highlight those efforts after touching on the trading and market volatility landscapes. Despite an almost 6% selloff in May, the S&P 500 pared losses in June to end the quarter up a modest 4%. The June rally continued into July, touching new highs on July 26, representing a 20% gain year-to-date.","The VIX futures near record volume in May, the fifth highest month in its 15-year history, was offset by a slow April and June as traders lacked conviction during the markets grind higher. In July, short-term consumer confidence remained cautiously optimistic, but we believe concerns over global slowdown in growth and escalating U.S.-China trade tension had investors revaluating risk. Rising long-term uncertainty led to a steepening in the VIX term structure in July and a renewed focus on hedging.","Downside protection became a notable theme, and while the VIX index hovered around year-to-date lows, and VVIX neared five-year lows, many investors were looking to VIX holds [ph] and SPX puts as cheap portfolio protection. Further demand from retail investors to hedge downside risk was seen in volatility linked ETPs.","Average AUM and volatility linked ETPs increased 42% in the second quarter averaging $3.7 billion versus $2.6 billion in the first quarter. A significant portion of this increase came from the continued growth of ETPs based in the APAC region. This contributed to a quarter-over-quarter increase in VIX futures open interest and VIX futures volume during global trading hours.","Expanding our global footprint, continues to be a main focus and I'm happy to report that in June we received jurisdictional approval in Switzerland allowing Swiss trading privilege holders direct market access to CFE. Direct market access is an important step in increasing accessibility to our products in regions outside the U.S.","Turning to XSP, our many SPX options contract, which is 1\/10th the size of SPX and the same size as SPY, continues to demonstrate the value of our SPX products suite. Q2 2019 ADV is up 119% from Q1 2019 and up 314% from Q2 2018. Demand continues to build from investors looking for the increased risk management granularity provided by a smaller notional contract. Post jurisdictional approval and the growth in XSP are a direct result of customers' feedback as we continue to focus on the needs of our customers with a goal of providing solutions for all of their risk management needs.","Turning now to the U.S. equities market, I'm pleased to note that Adam Inzirillo, a long time veteran of the U.S. equities trading is joining Cboe to head our U.S. equities business, which at present is a very dynamic segment of our company. At our last earnings call, we described our plans to increase trading on Cboe EDGX Exchange with fee changes aimed at attracting additional order flow and with the introduction of execution party to retail limit orders.","I'm pleased to note that after the implementation of some recent fee changes, our U.S. equities market share rose above 17% in July from 15.7% until the second quarter and we are prepared to launch retail priority on EDGX pending regulatory approval and customer readiness. Both changes are designed to benefit individual investors and make EDGX the go to place for retail trading.","Now turning to European equities, where overall market volumes were lighter during the second quarter compared to the previous year's quarter, we believe the lower volatility globally compounded with the shifting political and regulatory landscape in light of Brexit left many market participants on the sidelines. Brexit preparations remain a top priority. In light of the ongoing political developments, we have shifted our strategy to ensure we are well prepared for any potential political and regulatory outcome.","In May we announced plans to launch our Dutch venue on October 1, with all European Economic Area stocks available for trading. Additionally, our UK venue will continue to trade UK as well as EEA stocks. This week we announced plans to launch Cboe Closing Cross, a new post-close trading service that will bring valuable competition to the post-close trading session in Europe. The new service is scheduled to launch on October 16, and will serve as a cost-effective one-stop-shop for customers to execute their post-trading activities across 18 European markets.","Much as our Cboe market close proposal was developed in response to customer demand for an alternative closing option in the U.S. equities market, European market participants have also long expressed a need for a trading alternative giving their increasing closing costs, option costs and volume. We are pleased that Cboe closing costs will bring much needed choice and competition to this growing segment of the European market and we are prepared to bring similar benefits to the U.S. equities market through Cboe market close pending regulatory approval.","Turning now to technology, we are now nearing the planned completion of our migration of all Cboe exchanges to BATS technology on October 7, which will allow us to maximize our value proposition of providing a superior, unified trading experience across all our equities, options, and futures markets. The completion of the migration is expected to also provide our customers with a more efficient and user-friendly trading experience that includes greater bandwidth, significant latency reduction, enhanced risk controls, and improved complex order handling.","Just as we have with every successful phase of the migration to date, we continue to work very closely with our customers on the integration of our C1 exchange and remain laser focused on the execution of a seamless technical and operational integration of this final platform migration. Completion of this major undertaking not only enhances our efficiency and value proposition, but will also enable us to focus the considerable talent of our technology team on new growth initiatives.","One such initiative is the development of a state-of-the-art research and data platform that we believe will help fuel the long-term growth of our company. We intend for the new platform to combine data derived from existing Cboe assets with new functionality created in-house to glean actionable trading insights for our customers across all of our business lines.","This is a very exciting project for our team and one that leverages unique Cboe strengths, technology, research and development, to provide tailored trading strategies for our customers and to inform the creation of new Cboe proprietary products. We view the platform as a natural area of innovation for us and we look forward to moving from concept to design and build phase upon the completion of the C1 migration.","In closing, I would like to thank our team for the progress made throughout the second quarter in laying the foundation for future growth. We continue to tackle market defining initiatives as we rolled out unique equity trading services, made headway on the final migration of all of our markets onto a unifying state-of-the-art platform expanded our global footprint and began design of a unique research and data platform, all of which we believe will create growth opportunities going forward.","With that, I will now turn it over to Brian.","Brian Schell","Thank you, Ed and good morning everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results. Overall, our net revenue was relatively unchanged with net transaction fees down 1% and non-transaction revenue up 1%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 3% with margin increasing 230 basis points to 68.4%, and finally our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.13.","The press release we issued this morning and our slide deck provide the key operating metrics on volume and revenue capture of each of our segments as well as an overview of key revenue variances. I'd like to briefly highlight some of the key drivers influencing our performance in each business segment.","Our recurring revenue stream of proprietary market data and access and capacity fees combined increased 6% in the quarter and 8% year-to-date compared to the same period last year, in line with our expectations for mid-to high single-digit growth in 2019. We continue to see opportunity across all of our asset classes and believe that our migration to BATS technology will provide additional revenue opportunities over the long-term. As it relates to proprietary market data, about two thirds of the growth this quarter was a result of incremental subscriptions and nearly 100% of the growth of our access capacity fees was also attributable to incremental units.","Now I'd like to turn to our segments. In our Options segment, the 3% or $4 million increase in net revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue in market data and access and capacity fees, with non-transaction fees up 10% net transaction fees and options were flat with index options up 2% offset by 9% decrease in multi listed options. Index options average daily volume or ADV was up 6% for the quarter, offset somewhat by 2% decline in revenue per contract or RPC. The RPC decrease was primarily due to a mix shift with many SPX options accounting for a higher percentage of volume. In our multi-listed options ADV was up slightly, but RPC was down 8% reflecting higher volume-based rebates.","Turning to futures, the 4% or $1 million increase in net revenue resulted from a 7% increase in RPC and relatively flat ADV. The higher RPC year-over-year primarily reflects the impact of new pricing implemented in the latter part of 2018 as well as lower volume-based rebates.","Turning to U.S. equities, net revenue was down 5% or nearly $4 million, primarily due to lower SIP market data revenue offset somewhat by an increase in access and capacity fees. The lack of growth in net transaction fees reflects flat industry ADV and lower market share offset by higher net capture. SIP market data revenues fell 14% in the quarter, while our proprietary market data revenue was up 1%. SIP revenues fell due to lower market share as well as a decline in audit recoveries versus last year's second quarter.","Net revenue for European equities decreased 4% on a U.S. dollar basis, primarily reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. On a local currency basis, net revenue was up 1% reflecting a 6% decrease in transaction fees offset by 14% increase in non-transaction revenue. The growth in non transaction revenue reflects increases in access and capacity fees and other revenue which includes licensing and trade reporting revenue. The decline in net transaction fees was due to lower market volumes and market share offset somewhat by favorable net capture. The higher capture resulted from continued strong periodic auctions and LIS volume.","Net revenue for Global FX decreased 10% this quarter reflecting a 15% decline in volumes offset somewhat by higher net capture, which was up 4%, primarily reflecting the impact of fee changes made in 2018. In addition, we grew market share to 15.2%, up 30 basis points year-over-year.","Before I move to adjusted operating expense, I'd like to point out two acquisition related expenses incurred in the second quarter, which are included in non-GAAP adjustments. First, we classified our Chicago headquarters location as property held-for-sale and based on our valuation analysis recorded an impairment charge of $6.1 million. The marketing of our headquarters building and planned relocation is a result of a reduction of Cboe's employee workspace requirements in Chicago close to BATS acquisition and is projected to be completed in the second or third quarter of 2020.","Second, based on an anticipated restructuring of Cboe Vest, we recorded an impairment charge of $10.5 million. We are in the process of negotiating a sale of the majority of our shares in Vest, which will result in Cboe's ownership changing from 60% to approximately 25%. Please note that there are no assurances that the potential transactions will ultimately occur.","Turning to expenses, total adjusted operating expenses were just over $103 million for the quarter, down 3% versus last year's second quarter. The key expense variance was in compensation and benefits, primarily resulting from a decrease of over $6 million in incentive and equity-based compensation and about a $2 million decrease in wages and payroll taxes, offset somewhat by an increase of about $4 million in deferred compensation plan expense. Decline in incentive-based compensation is in line with our year-to-date financial performance.","The deferred compensation expense is directly offset by deferred compensation income reported in other income, so there is no impact to net earnings. This expense on income is based on the change in valuation of our deferred compensation plans. As a result of the year-to-date decrease primarily in compensation and benefits relative to our original expectations, we are adjusting our full year 2019 expense guidance to be in the range of $405 million to $413 million, down $10 million from our previous guidance range.","With respect to our 2020 expense guidance, we still expect a range of $420 million to $428 million which takes into account the benefit of the synergies expected to be realized in 2020 from the C1 migration later this year and a continuation we are investing to support the growth of our business. We plan to continue to invest in enhancing our customer facing business development team to drive greater engagement in our proprietary products, as well as development of an enhanced research and data platform which Ed referenced previously. We are maintaining our run rate expense synergy targets as we expect to exit 2019 with $80 million of run rate synergies and exit 2020 with $85 million.","Turning to income taxes, our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 27.7%, below our prior guidance of being at the higher end of the annual guidance range of 27% to 29% and lower than last year's second quarter rate of over 29%. The tax rate decrease was primarily due to excess tax benefits related to equity awards. We are reaffirming our full-year tax rate on adjusted earnings guidance to be in a range of 27% to 29%, but we now expect the rate to be at the lower end of the 2019 guidance range.","We are also reaffirming our guidance for depreciation and amortization and capital spending. For capital spending we now expect to be at the lower end of our guidance range of $50 million to $55 million reflecting a shift in the timing of expenditures associated with our pending headquarters relocation.","Turning to capital allocation, we remain committed to a disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy that includes reinvesting in our business, complementing our organic growth with potential acquisitions and providing steady distributions to our shoulders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases in order to maximize shareholder value. During the second quarter, we returned nearly $35 million to shareholders through dividends and earlier this week our Board increased our third quarter dividend by 16% to $0.36 per share from $0.31 per share.","In addition, we utilized cash on hand to repay the $300 million senior notes, which matured on June 28, 2019. Our debt now stands at $925 million and we have $250 million available and availability under our revolver if the need arises. At quarter end, our leverage ratio stands at 1.2 times down from 1.5 times at the end of the first quarter. We ended this quarter with adjusted cash of nearly $136 million.","Our remaining share repurchase authorization in the third quarter dividend increase reinforced our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders and to increasing shareholder value. We remain committed to maintaining investment-grade balance sheet and strong financial positions that enables us to continue to make prudent investments in our business to drive long-term profitable growth.","In summary, Cboe is executing on our strategic initiatives and setting the stage for both short-term and long-term performance with our continued focus on defining markets globally, growing our proprietary index products, growing our recurring revenue streams, disciplined expense management to leverage the scale of our business, completing our integration plan and delivering on our synergy targets, maintaining balance sheet flexibility and a capital allocation plan that allows us to invest in the growth of our business while returning capital to shareholders through an increased quarterly dividend and potential share repurchases.","With that, I will return it over to Debbie for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Debbie Koopman","Thanks, Brian. At this point, we'd be happy to take your questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits, we'll take the second question.","Keith, we're ready for Q&A","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Rick Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Repetto","Yes, good morning, Ed and Brian and I believe Chris is there as well. First, I want to congratulate you on adding Fred Tomczyk to the Board. He's got a lot of experience in the retail industry and a good leader.","Ed Tilly","Thanks Rich.","Richard Repetto","Anyway, so my question, I guess, is that one, will be broad on the new research and data platform, it seems like you're going to dedicate some resources there. And of course, you've heard the LSE [ph] repetitive deal, I guess the question is, are you able to compete on these - from a market data standpoint with a larger platform that sort of aggregates market data across a number of content providers? And how important is, sort of, market data initiative? I guess, is this going to be where we see more focus on it from exchanges going forward or is this just the beginning of a trend, the trend has already been going on for several years?","Chris Isaacson","Yes, Rich, this is Chris, good morning. We just -- there's the new data analytics platform that we're going to be focused on post C1 migrations is just a recognition that we have been very focused on the trading platform for the last two-and-half years, and now we will have the time and resources to invest in research and data platform. They'll primarily be focused on helping us launch new products and better understand our current markets and our current customers in a much more data driven way than we do today.","As you know, we've made investments, both in raw data and the market - real time market data and new products we brought out across our exchanges, as well as derive data with offerings like Livevol. But this is us going to really invest more into a data platform to make that data available, first, internally to all the business units to make better data driven decisions, and then ultimately enhance our derived data offerings for those across the street, for those of our customers, both existing, as well as new customers that we may not touch directly today.","So this is still in the early phases. As Ed mentioned in his comments, this is really in the concept phase and now we'll get into design and build post C1, but we're quite excited about it.","Ed Tilly","Rich, think of - you've asked us and you've asked Debbie to help you understand the size and the potential of the market out there. Knowing our customer and any more transparency we can have into their strategies, use case, penetration globally, that's really what we're after. So it's a little different effort for us. We have such a unique product set and we've always told you and tried to describe to all of you how these contracts are used interchangeably when one contract is used over the other.","All of that transparency helps us pinpoint the direction of our sales effort going forward. So it's all the things and the metrics that you've been looking for over the years. We're going to get better at that and that is what we're out to accomplish with our new effort.","John Deters","Rich, this is John. I'll follow-up on Chris and Ed's comments just with the strategic perspective. You mentioned the LSE [ph] deal; great deal, bold deal. A lot of diverse data there, that all makes sense given the footprint, LSE's [ph] existing footprint in data services. We're a different kind of Company. We're interested in data, but we're interested in data that relates directly to our markets, either as inputs or outputs, so that it has relevance to our existing customer base and that will continue to be our focus. We're market operators and the data that we provide to the marketplace relates to those markets.","Richard Repetto","Thank you, very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Yes, hey, good morning everyone. I would love for you guys to flush out your closing cross announcement in Europe a little bit more, I have to admit, I'm not as familiar with the lay of the land over there. So obviously, what are the incumbents doing in terms of pricing and economics they're getting? What exactly are you planning here? And then, what's the lay of the land in terms of brokers already offering something like this over there which in the U.S., I don't think it's as big in Europe. I think there's another exchange that has an offering already out there. So, I know it's a long question, but I think you know what I'm getting at. Just give us what are you thinking about - and how are you going to undercut pricing, et cetera?","Chris Isaacson","Hey, good morning Alex, this is Chris. I'll take this one as well. So we're quite excited about this. I mean, this is really a parallel effort we've been going on in the U.S. with our Cboe market close. But Cboe closing cross in Europe is we think a very good opportunity for us given the - as we shared on this slide the percentage of volumes going off at the close in Europe in the high teens. They're actually 20% percent now.","So, there likely are offerings already off exchange and we're not sure exactly all of the offerings in there, some from competitors. But we think we're quite excited about this one we're doing, because it's very simple and involves an at-limit order type, firms enter the prices at which they want to execute and all the details of how that will operate, we announced yesterday.","And this, really just is a recognition of our customers coming to us in typical fashion which we operate. They view this as a problem, as prices around executions at the close are going up. The domestic or home exchanges are charging more for that monopoly event. And so, we think we can compete in this area with a very elegant and simple solution that we launch on August 16th.","There will likely be other competitive solutions; that's okay. We embrace competition here. But we think the elegance of our solution, as well as our incredible network of trading 18 markets in Europe as well as the massive amount of customer connections will make the uptake of this pretty strong from the start.","Ed Tilly","But our motivation really simply as we've said in the prepared remarks, the Cboe market close in the U.S., this is really where CCC was born. It was customer demand to have an alternative, plain and simple. So when the SEC, hopefully when the SEC ultimately approves our U.S. version, we'll be off in all of our venues offering an alternative to the existing. So, looking forward to it.","Chris Isaacson","One more point on Europe as well. I think it's important to understand brokers are restricted by MiFID II from crossing on their own books. And so this is an offering that is being requested by our customers, and we think it will have pretty immediate relevance.","Alex Kramm","And then no, sorry color yet on kind of like fees or how much relative to the whole market the fees are going to be or how much your revenue captures maybe you are going to be different in the auctions versus your - during the market time?","Chris Isaacson","Yes, this is Chris. So, we said in the announcement, we plan for it to be free of charge till the end of the year, and then we'll reevaluate from there. We think we expect an uptick, but we want to make sure we facilitate that with the right pricing at the start.","Alex Kramm","All right, thanks again.","Ed Tilly","Thanks Alex.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan?","Kenneth Worthington","Hi, good morning. You've been highlighting your pursuit of a big deal for at least the last six months, and you've given us updates on whether it's live or not. So I guess part one is, do you still have a live deal? And more broadly, maybe given LSE [ph] Refinitiv, how are you thinking about the need of size and scale? So exchange consolidation continues, they're getting bigger, they're getting more efficient, they're broadening their foot prints; how important is size and scale today versus a couple of years ago? And where does M&A stand as a Cboe priority today versus where M&A maybe stood a few years ago?","Ed Tilly","So let me -- I don't want to correct you, but I don't think we've got it on large deals. I think what we've been referring to is we are always looking at things and ways to touch our customers earlier in their trade process or later in their trade process. And tuck-in or bolt-on deals are always important to us. That's a bull [ph] versus buy.","Broadly speaking, when we talked about M&A over the last quarters, it was responding to questions; has Cbeo's view on M&A changed? We said; well, in light of the completion of a systems migration and full integration of BATS, our Board, our balance sheet are in a different position to be still same outlook, very choosy and looking at any global deal not needing to engage like perhaps all of our other competitors, our growth still best potential is our organic growth story, our penetration in the U.S. market and existing products and the globalization of these incredible benchmarks and brush [ph] for any exposure to the U.S. So that remains our number one focus.","We do look at larger scale M&A, but it was with a much more -- I don't to presume anybody else is not a disciplined approach, but we just don't need to engage in large scale M&A. So we're really-really choosy. But, John, specific to Refinitiv we gave a couple opening comments on that and then we'll come back to scale and answer that question.","John Deters","Yes Ed, Ken, thanks for the question, so this is John. I think in terms of scale with respect to our business, you've seen the quarter, the expense discipline, the performance with a very clearly defined business plan and a very tightly controlled organization expense wise, I don't think that scale really is necessary in that context.","I hear it referred to often and as an enabler of the next big deal, and that just becomes really a kind of self-perpetuating cycle where you get scale so you can do the next big deal and potentially lose focus on really what it is you do well at your core.","The compensation and benefits line that Brian talked about and how that may vary with our performance, you can't have that kind of performance based culture and alignment unless you have a very-very clear vision of what your business is about. And so, that's incredibly important to us and it will continue to be important to us.","Again, the LSE [ph] deal from our perspective makes a lot of sense for them. We're happy to see them continue to strengthen their business because we're partners with them on many levels. Cboe Global [ph], FTSE Russell even in Europe where we utilize their clearing facilities, but we've got a different approach.","Kenneth Worthington","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","All right, thanks and good morning. May be just given the Vest impairment in multiple like passing current investments and growth initiatives that you guys have in place; can you maybe just provide, like an update on some of the key investments and initiatives, maybe which you're seeing good traction which are maybe playing out less than expected, maybe just how you track some of those initiatives and investments over time?","Brian Schell","Well, we can start with Vest, but I'm directly [indiscernible]. I mean, some of these that we've kind of highlighted, Vest was a little bit of a \u2013 the effort that we talked about, and I'll let John talk about this more, was say a little bit more of a stand outside and fully integrated Cboe. The couple that we've - the smaller ones that we've done more recently respective to Silexx and with Livevol, we're seeing the fruits of that actually showing up in, I've mentioned it now over the last couple of calls, you see the increases in our market data. You're seeing some of the increases in our - although bulk of these are more of the capacity and access fees with Silexx and some of the things we're doing there and everything else.","But that is integrated in our business. So there isn't really a separate, call it, segment that I'm tracking that separately. And so it's literally embedded, integrated within the operating segment such that it would be hard for me if you pressed me and say, well, tell me exactly what was the financials on Livevol only or Silexx only?","So those are two instances where it's literally embedded and we're very pleased with the ROI on those, except that we could measure, because they have been fully integrated and we're seeing that incremental revenue showing up in our financials right now.","John Deters","And Michael, further to Brian's point, we're quite excited for instance about Silexx, purchasing made in late 2017. As we're going through this massive integration process and finishing it up with BATS technology, we're also integrating Livevol and Silexx. And Silexx will be the avenue through which people will trade FLEX options. FLEX options has seen a very nice uptick in the first half of this year and that will go along with the platform migration in October. So we're fully integrating these smaller acquisitions as we integrate the larger ones for one cohesive strategy of organic growth.","Ed Tilly","And this I'll followup with one more point on Vest to just to sort of put that in perspective. So that investment really was meant to catalyze the development of a new segment in the fund industry within options, with options based strategies. We saw this trend was just emerging and we wanted to apply our product development expertise to catalyze the growth of that business.","We've done that. The products have been defined and now we're on to the phase where really distribution is the critical next step. We're not equipped to do that. We obviously have a different business model, others are. And so we'll look to rationalize the partners who are in the business.","That's a very different type of approach than what Brian and Chris talked about was Silexx and Livevol were those acquisitions were full acquisitions, completely integrated, thoroughly complementary with the rest of our business and enables our proprietary products suite and trading capabilities.","Michael Carrier","All right, thanks. That's helpful color.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good morning. Maybe just on the Mini-SPX contract, maybe this is completely unrelated, but it looks like the growth in XSP really coincided with CMEs, S&P Micro Futures launch. Do you think there's some benefit that you're seeing from that product launch and if so, if you can just kind of further describe the kind of relationship between the futures and options products? And then maybe just a little bit on the fee capture that you're seeing from that XSP in the risk adjusted fee capture?","Ed Tilly","Sure, that's a great question and we always, we appreciate any visibility, any more exposure of any S&P 500 products. We love to take our share when we talk about futures at CME. So, yes, there's been an incredible amount of attention on their Micro. And while we've had XSP out in the marketplace for years, really if you can just imagine us continuing to pound the table on the utility and use cases for the S&P 500 and primarily it's been SPX. But what it has left short and what's left wanting are investors who love the benefits of cash settled options, European exercise; and for many, the ability to take advantage of a 60:40 long versus short term tax rate, this is the answer. So if you're looking at the SPX with that huge notional value of that contract, think 1\/10. And these contracts and the trades that we've been seeing go up in XSP would be odd lots in SPX.","So for managing strategies where 1,340 X-line and 580 Y-line, you can't do that in SPX. You'd be in fractions of contracts. This is extremely user friendly when the granularity or notional value is needed. So, coinciding with the visibility of a Micro, fantastic. All of the benefits of our SPX and the small notional contract, that's what we're out there sharing with our investors.","Brian Schell","So on the RPC, the guidance, I'll kind of give you and it's all we've done is help to make your job to figure out what the RPC is going to be on a quarterly basis going forward is a little bit more challenging. Previously, we obviously dealt with as we looked at the RPC for the index options, yes obviously is going to be influenced by the mix of the SPX and the fixed options contracts, and that's always going to be \u2013 going to impact the overall average when you see a quarterly number.","While throw in with our many contracts here, while Ed mentioned the 10th size, the pricing of that is actually it's not proportions actually greater than the 10th, if you just kind of did a pro rata adjustment, it's greater than that. So even if they were and we don't believe this is the case, Ed talked about the incremental usage of it to be able to - for the increased utilization, it's not really cannibalization. And even if it were, if you get hung up on that or anyone gets hung up on that, the incremental pricing is actually more favorable on a total transaction basis, broadly speaking.","But it will have a -- it will look on a pure RPC basis, slightly lower, just because of the size. So that's kind of the context to think about it. Again, so it's going to influence the overall kind of averages. But again, because we haven't really dug in too much of providing explicit guidance on a contract-by-contract basis other than kind of what we've listed as far as overall filing fees.","Kyle Voigt","And maybe around $0.10 a contract or higher?","Debbie Koopman","Good try, Kyle.","Ed Tilly","That's a good question.","Brian Schell","Kyle, usually our displayed fee schedule is out there multiply by 10. And while there's going to be blends difference in customer, in the mix, you kind of understand our mix and how that bounces around, but that's the way to kind of look at it. We're very transparent as we are in everything that we do. These schedules out there, you understand the blend and the mix. It's going to change, there is evidence [indiscernible] that will give you some help into seeing what we're doing in XSP. But think, you know, this is just a great appeal for those looking for smaller notional contract. Strategies will probably not be unique to XSP, they're really just thinking S&P 500 exposure in bite size contracts.","Kyle Voigt","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris","Thanks, good morning.","Ed Tilly","Good morning.","Christopher Harris","If you guys are affirming the expense guide for 2020, I guess at the mid-point that's implying nearly 4% growth. That seems - it seems a little high given the synergies you still are expecting coming through that year. So maybe you can talk a little bit about why the expense growth is expected to be so high and maybe what kind of revenue assumptions are you building around that expectation?","Brian Schell","Sure. And I think that I'll start with kind of what's driving the -- where we expect to land call it in 2019. And whilst the results of kind of the expenses that we're seeing there, we're not really - it's not like we're putting our employees under the hammer and say: \"Oh, my gosh, you have to do X, Y, and Z and you can't travel and you can't do this.\"","It's really driven by it as we've continued to highlight the -- as we try our incentive comps to our top line results. So, to put that in the context, so in a growth year and we've been seeing that relative to 2018, their incentive comp is less than what was last year. So you're seeing a, I'll call it a lower run rate of 2019 given kind of where we originally said. So we're coming off a lower base.","And so as you think about, if I catch Brian [ph] and tell him to what you're going to actually ramp that up from where you expect to land 2019 up to 2020? So look at it in context, yes, we're going to have and we - Debbie put together a pretty detailed schedule of the synergy expectations, laying them out for 2019 and then for 2020 given the C1 migration and the synergy impact is really primarily going to happen in 2020.","So if you collectively call that roughly $20 million and you'd say, well, I'm going to normalize some of my incentive comp back to my revenue expectations for 2020 which I'm not going to give you explicitly, but let's just say we're obviously striving for growth. So if we say that $20 million benefit is going to then accrue in 2020, we are going to normalize back that incentive comp and that's going to offset a large piece of that $20 million, as well as the incremental investments that we fully expect to make that's going to show up on the OpEx line.","And again, there might be a little bit of variability as we finalize the technology investments and the software development that we go through. How much that's going to be capitalized versus how much it's going to flow through? So we obviously are continuously trying to balance that and get a handle on that.","And then, we just have to kind of call it, normalized OpEx. And if we roll that all together with, call it, a historical OpEx range of growth of course in that 4% to 6% range, you very easily and very quickly get back to that mid-point range of the 2020 guidance of the 420 to 428.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is [indiscernible] filling in for Alex. Thanks for taking the question. On the Chicago headquarters, can you help us understand the expense impact of this move to the new location in 2020 and what are your plans for using the proceeds from this sale?","Brian Schell","So on the OpEx side of it, right now the immediate impact is, it's not going to be material. Obviously, there'll be a little bit of, you'll see a little bit of a shrinkage in the depreciation as we highlighted. That will be a slightly smaller number, but kind of factor that into overall guidance as to something we thought would happen during the year. So you won't see anything material in 2019.","So think about 2020. As we transition into a potentially new location, the operating expenses should be slightly better to neutral in 2020. Over time, as we actually expect this to be even more positive because there's a significant amount of deferred maintenance that we know will ultimately need to occur in the existing building that we're in just given the age, given where we are. So it's somewhat of a cost avoidance next year down the line or call it two, three, four, five years.","But the efficiency of the new space that we're going into, with the lease rates and everything that we're kind of trying to finalize, we expect it to be somewhat neutral. So we do not expect to see an increase. And actually over time, we actually expect to see a decrease, again not material in facilities. If nothing else, probably more flat, and really through the minimization of a lot of deferred maintenance that we know this building will need and such we've taken this approach.","Again, that's just from a pure P&L standpoint. I will tell you though that some of the spaces that we're looking at from a culturally, efficiency and everything that we're looking for, I think it's actually going to be quite exciting for our overall associate base as far as a new space here in the Downtown Chicago area. So for that point we're very excited for our employees, for our clients and for our shareholders overall for that transition to happen. And ultimately we'll be very excited when we can make that announcement more public about specifically what we're doing.","Unidentified Analyst","And any plans for the proceeds from the sale?","Brian Schell","Oh, thank you. So it's going to be relatively immaterial for the proceeds. But we were just \u2013 we'll roll them in. It's not going to be something that you'll necessarily notice, that's like, oh my gosh, what are you going to do with a big chunk of cash.","There will be cash obviously, but we would just roll it into our - I'll give you the same - and I know you don't want me to launch into 70's rock song ballet about capitalization allocation of how we look at that, but we would basically just, again, roll that into our normal use of funds and it's all funds as far as where we've applied that capital allocation broadly.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks, good morning folks. Maybe if you could dive into the retail strategy in U.S. equities. Obviously you brought Fred Tomczyk on the Board and make new hire in U.S. equities. And then maybe tie that into your expectations for the market on closed proposals, whether you think the SEC may be closer to approving that given that you're launching it in Europe? And kind of any sense of to what extent you think you're going to increase market share in U.S. equities as result of these efforts?","Ed Tilly","So let me start with market close. With each quarter, we're in front of you, we're hopeful that this is the quarter that we're going to share with you that the SEC is reaffirming the approval, we received cash about a year ago. So, we're still hopeful and from Chris Isaacson and operational team is ready to go and our customers, as I spend time with them, that is one of the first questions is when do I get to use Cboe's market close?","So the demand is still there, the readiness is there. It is amazing when we look at the approval process and our 3C approach Europe versus the extended approval process here in the U.S. But nonetheless, we're still optimistic and ready.","So as far as the share, Chris, is going to do some detail, but remember, in the last call we said there is a balance always between our capture and our share and we set out to affect that balance in a positive way on share. We executed on that plan of late, but Chris, I invite you to give some more color.","Chris Isaacson","Yes, just as we said on the last call, we had - our capture was higher than we expected, while our market share was lower than we had expected in the last call. And so we said we're going to reinvest some of that capture raised market share and Bryan Harkins' team have done exactly that.","Market share as you saw on the slides is, for July was little over 17%. And we're eagerly awaiting the approval of retail priority on EDGX as well, getting ready to approval and the customer readiness. Hope to launch that very soon, which we hope will grow market share even further as we don't just add economic incentives, but actually execution priority incentives for retail customers to put their order flow there.","Another thing we're doing overall to hopefully improve market share or equities markets is a new lead Market Maker program that we rolled out actually just yesterday to try to attract more ETP listings, especially large transfers. We're very excited about that.","And so, that's a full core press. It's a very competitive business, U.S. Equities, which we're fully committed to and we're going to try a lot of things as we are always balancing net capture as well as market share, but we like the trajectory we're on.","Ed Tilly","And thanks for recognizing the addition of Adam and Fred. So the way we approach this talent does go all the way up to the Board. We have an incredibly engaged Board and you're right, adding Fred Tomczyk and having the Board, have the perspective of a dynamic leader who's very familiar with the retail space will be helpful as we lay out our plans going forward. Thank you.","Brian Bedell","And it sounds like with your initiative, you're able to potentially grow that share with Vest with revenue capture decline. And if you kind of it is balance, but is it fair to think that you might be able to achieve that?","Ed Tilly","It's always a balance, Brian, but our goal is to obviously grow revenues over the long-term, our net revenues over the long-term. Some of that has to do with providing better functionality that will increase execution quality for our customers.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And next we have a followup from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Yes, hey guys. Just want to rattle off a couple of follow-ups if that's okay. One, regular fees have been running a lot higher this year and as though, I don\u2019t know if you've talked about this, but can you just - is this a good run rate, I think $9.4 million or something? And why is this higher? And then if you can just talk about the equities market share gain, I'll try as well on that one on the revenue capture, I mean, any sort of help you can provide from what you've seen so far in July you obviously left that pie chart very empty on that slide? And then I have another follow-up, but go ahead on those two first.","Debbie Koopman","You are breaking up a little bit\u2026","Ed Tilly","Give us a while, Alex, because we're out of bounds anyway. So what's the third?","Alex Kramm","It's not a quick line one, I just wanted to, since you obviously launched new sales effort on the co-options business or proprietary product business with some key hires a few months ago?","Ed Tilly","Yes.","Alex Kramm","Just wondering if you have update in terms of something that you're seeing already moving in the direction where even how you would be measuring success of some of those key hires making an impact I guess with new client gains, et cetera?","Ed Tilly","Cool, I will take the last. Why don't we start with regulatory fees and equity rev capture as much as we can?","Brian Schell","Sure. So, again, I assume you're looking on a kind of net basis versus in an obviously taking up Section 31, which obviously is influenced by the rates that SEC sets. So on the regulatory fees, I think if you look at year-over-year, yes, it's an increase. But that sometimes is influenced by fines, sometimes it's influenced by a number of things that obviously is not anything you can run rate project. But if you look at it sequentially versus the first quarter, it's actually down.","So I didn't \u2013 don't look at that anything more than noise, which is one of the reasons why we didn't highlight it. And again, on the options side, it may have been a little bit higher as we continue to - some of the expenses that we are working through with, some are related to the migration as well on our reg side with the Org [ph] fees. They are slightly higher expense as we ramp up.","Some of the expenses as we deliver some of that, which first line we would expect to [indiscernible] be decline going forward which you see as declining expense also on our income statement that the clients would get the benefit of as well. So I wouldn't read too much into that as far as the run rate goes given the variability to it.","On the revenue capture and equities, we intentionally didn't include that for July only because the data was incomplete and we just hadn't finalized that and we hadn't gone through our QA just to make sure it was there. So we just didn't want to put out a number too prematurely. It wasn\u2019t \u2013 we weren't really trying to hide it, we just - we have a cycle and a cadence of releasing that. So we just didn't issue that. So we will be issuing that guidance in our normal process.","Ed Tilly","So then, if you think about the Global Client Services team and the way of what we've outlined for you on the last call, it really is taking -- somewhat looking at the market, imagine yesterday, right? You have a 60 point move in the S&P 500. You've got a confused or a scrunchie faced user\/investor looking at that move in the market, saying, \"How do I derisk the situation that I find myself in?\"","We need a sales team who is completely armed and looking at our user team across the globe and different segments in customer use case. That's what we're gearing up for. We're about - I would say 40% of the way on the new hire and appreciating those that have \u2013 of our client services team that have brought us to where we are today, who've done an incredible job getting us to today. But tomorrow, the sophistication, the use cases, the change in the market is so fast, so violent and we are the go-to exchange when those market events happen.","Yesterday is a perfect example. We had 30 days leading up to an announcement that everyone knew we had low - almost 5-year lows in VVIX. The increase in large block calls in VIX, those were all on the uptake. We need a team out there that can articulate the why's and the history of what happens when we see a large move. So that's the goal. So about 40% there on the hires and we can't wait to keep you up-to-date. And then of course, the new data analytics platform really getting to know those customers better is the goal for everything we're building for the organic growth story and can't wait to tell you more.","Alex Kramm","All right, thanks again guys.","Ed Tilly","Thanks Alex.","Operator","Thank you. And as there are no more questions, I would like to return the floor to Management for any closing comments.","Debbie Koopman","Thank you. This completes the call this morning. We appreciate your time and continued interest in Cboe Global Markets. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for this conference call, Ms. Debbie Koopman.","Deborah Koopman","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our CEO, will provide an update on strategic initiatives for 2013; then Alan Dean, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will review our third quarter 2013 financial results.

Tilly","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning. I'm happy to report another strong quarter at CBOE Holdings, driven by increased trading volume overall and in our higher-margin proprietary products, in particular. Our team continued to execute on CBOE's company-wide goal: to maximize market share in multiply listed options, while developing and promoting the higher-margin proprietary products that distinguish CBOE in the global marketplace.","Our business continued to grow as a result posting a 7% increase in operating revenue and a 9% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter. Alan will take you through the financial results in more detail after I run through the highlights for the quarter.","First, I'll look at options volume and market share. Total options average daily volume at CBOE Holdings grew 5% from the third quarter last year and declined 7% from the second quarter 2013. Year-over-year volume increased 20% in index options and 18% in ETNs and ETFs, offset by a 10% decline in equity options.","CBOE continued to increase its industry-leading market share. Excluding dividend trades, CBOE accounted for 28% of all options trading in September, up from 26.9% in June. We garnered 20.9% of multiply listed options, up from 19.7% in June.","Throughout 2013, we've noted the ongoing growth of VIX futures and options trading, despite prolonged periods of low market volatility. More recently, as VIX reacted to October's government shutdown and the threat of default, we saw the effects of spikes in volatility in VIX trading. Investors increasingly turned to VIX futures and options to buffer the changing political and economic winds. And on October 8, VIX volumes reached a new single day high of 1.78 million contracts, surpassing the previous record of 1.4 million contracts set on April 15 this year.","While volume spikes like those seen in October provide a glimpse into the great beyond for ongoing growth in VIX futures and options trading, it's important to note that October's gains followed yet another quarter of remarkable growth in VIX trading, absent significant marketplace volatility.","Third quarter ADV and VIX options and futures grew 21% and 48%, respectively, over the third quarter of 2012. Record volume days may grab the headlines, but the continued growth of these products, amidst historically low volatility, is to us, an even more compelling story that validates the tremendous utility of these products and the headway we have made in promoting them.","Turning now to some update on those efforts. This past Monday, we successfully implemented the first phase of our extended trading hours initiative in VIX futures, which provides for an additional 45 minutes trading session, following the regular close of VIX futures trading at 3:15 Central Time. We look forward to implementing Phase 2, which adds another 5 hours to the trading day this Monday, November 4. This phase will allow European-based customers to access VIX futures during their local trading hours. Trading will begin at 2:00 a.m. Central Time, which aligns with the 8:00 a.m. open of the London markets. We're pleased to provide extended trading hours, not only to our European customers, but to what has become a truly global base of current and potential VIX users.","In October, we hosted our second annual CBOE Risk Management Conference in Europe, where I was once again reminded that VIX is truly the world's gauge for market volatility. RMC Europe drew 150 sophisticated market practitioners, keenly interested in SPX and VIX trading. We were delighted to make true volatility-related product announcements at the conference, beginning with our plans to launch VIX futures and options on the Russell 2000 Volatility Index, RVX. The Russell, 2000 is the premier measure of the performance of small-cap U.S. stocks. Russell 2000 options, RUT, is our third most actively traded index option. RVX is calculated by applying our VIX methodology to RUT options. We are thrilled to provide customers with the ability to trade the volatility of the Russell 2,000 Index. We were working closely with our equally enthusiastic partners at Russell Investments to bring these products to market. Our plans call for RVX futures to launch on November 18, and RVX options to launch on December 2.","Our second major product announcement at RMC was the creation of those CBOE Short-Term Volatility Index, VXST. The new short-term VIX is calculated using our proprietary VIX methodology and was designed to complement VIX. Whereas VIX is a 30-day horizon, the short-term VIX looks out just 9 days, making it particularly responsive to changes in short-term volatility. Together, these 2 indexes provide an unrivaled picture of expected market volatility.","We spent -- expect to launch VXST weekly options and futures in the first quarter of 2014, pending regulatory approval. Customer response to short-term VIX weekly has been positive and enthusiastic. We anticipate investors will embrace the new product as a means to pinpoint and hedge the volatility associated with market events, such as earnings and Fed announcements and to generally fine-tune the timing of their volatility trades. We are thrilled to introduce a product that combines the most compelling aspects of VIX futures and options and SPX Weekly. To a great extent, the dramatic growth story of VIX futures and options has overshadowed the tremendous increase in SPX Weekly's trading. CBOE created the Weeklys concept in 2005 with the launch of SPX Weeklys, now one of our fastest growing products.","A recent study by the Tabb Group, U.S. options trading 2013 notes that firms are leveraging Weeklys as liquidity builds and product availability expands. Tabb predicts Weekly's volume will reach 25% of total industry volume by year's end.","At CBOE, SPX Weekly's year-to-date volume through September is up 127% over last year's record pace. Moreover, SPX Weekly's trading has created a new SPX customer base, which includes individual retail investors and what we referred to as active semiprofessionals. Both groups favor the trading precision afforded by the products' shorter-term horizons and lower premiums. Semi-pros, in particular, appreciate the SPX Weeklys, like SPY options, have point-and-click access, but represent 10x the notional value of SPY Weeklys.","Global interest in SPX and the opportunity to grow SPX options trading among overseas investors mirrors that of VIX futures and options. Overseas investors gravitate to SPX products much as they do, VIX products, for their efficiency and hedging global economic risk. Simply put, VIX has become a proxy for global market volatility, while SPX enables investors to access the broad U.S. market with a single transaction. Given the numerous synergies of our 2 marquee products, our overseas VIX marketing and educational efforts enable us to cost effectively extend our SPX marketing reach as well. Frankly, we couldn't be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to increase trading in both product lines.","I'll now wrap up by saying that our entire team is excited by the opportunities to continue to build volume and liquidity in our VIX and SPX products and to create new streams of liquidity through new products, such as a futures and options on our new Short-term Volatility Index. As we close in on the end of 2014, we remain focused on the strategic initiatives we laid out at the beginning of the year. New product development, maximizing our revenues and multi-listed products, extending our customer reach and providing the highest standards in market regulation and compliance.","With that, I thank you for your attention. And now, I'll turn it over to Alan Dean.","Alan J. Dean","Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review the key drivers of our third quarter financial results and comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2013.","Let me start with a quick overview of the key stats for the quarter. We delivered another strong quarter with operating revenue of $136.7 million, up 7% compared with last year's third quarter. Operating income was $68.4 million, representing an operating margin of 50%, a 260 basis point improvement over the same quarter last year.","Adjusted net income allocated common stockholders was $41 million, up 9% compared with the third quarter of 2012, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.47, a solid improvement versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.43 for the same period last year.","Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the third quarter of 2012 includes certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck. There were no adjustments to our operating results in this year's third quarter, but in last year's third quarter, we did have some non-GAAP adjustments relating to the tax provision, which I will discuss later.","Turning to the details of the quarter. As shown on this chart, the growth in operating revenue was driven by increases in transaction fees, regulatory fees and exchange services and other fees, offset somewhat by a decrease in other revenue. Transaction fees increased $6.4 million or 7% from the third quarter of last year due to an 8% increase in trading volume, offset slightly by a 1% decrease in the average revenue per contract to RPC versus last year's third quarter.","The growth in trading volume was primarily driven by the continuing growth trajectory of our proprietary products. With total trading volume and index options up 22%, and futures contracts up 52%, exchange rate of products also contributed to the volume gain, increasing 19% while equities declined 9%.","Our blended RPC, including options and futures, was $0.315, down slightly from $0.317 in last year's third quarter. The decline was primarily due to an increase in volume-based incentives for certain multiply listed options traded at CBOE under our Volume Incentive Program, or VIP as a result, the RPC in our options business declined to $0.273 compared with $0.287 in last year's third quarter. The revenue per contract on equity options and exchange traded products declined by 35% and 31%, respectively. On the plus side, lower RPC in these products was significantly offset by the ongoing shift in product mix towards our highest margin index options and futures contracts.","In the third quarter, CFE's revenue per contract was $1.56, a slight decrease compared with last year's third quarter, reflecting discounts provided on certain trades. Multiply listed options continue to represent a declining percentage of our trading volume and transaction fee revenue, primarily due to the tremendous growth we are witnessing in our proprietary products.","As depicted on this slide, in the third quarter of this year, index and options accounted for 29.9% of total contracts traded, up from 26.5% in last year's third quarter. Futures contracts accounted for 3.2% of total volume compared with 2.3% in last year's third quarter.","The shift in the mix of trading volume towards our highest margin products fueled much of the growth in transaction fees for the third quarter of 2013. Index options and futures contracts accounted for 79% of our transaction fees for the quarter, up from 69% in the third quarter of 2012. We continue to see the strongest growth potential coming from our proprietary products and look forward to the introduction of our new volatility products Ed discussed, as well as continued growth from our flagship products.","The $3.2 million increase in regulatory fees was primarily due to increases in our options regulatory fees. As we pointed out in our last earnings call, since the revenue drive from these fees is only available to cover expenses, we incur to carry out our obligations as a regulator. We make adjustments as needed to keep that revenue in related expenses and balance. To that end, effective September 1, we reduced the options regulatory fee for CBOE and suspended the options regulatory fee for C2. This change in addition to lower industry-wide customer volume resulted in a $1.5 million decline in regulatory revenue for third quarter compared with the second quarter. This range was split about 50-50 between the options regulatory fee changes and lower industry-wide customer volume traded by our permit holders, which was down about 13% versus the second quarter.","Assuming similar trading volume in the fourth quarter as the third quarter, we would expect regulatory fees to decline by about $1.6 million on the fourth quarter compared against the third quarter. The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to lower fines assessed to trading permit holders resulting from disciplinary actions. Last year's third quarter, there was one particularly large fine, which accounts for this variance.","Moving down the income statement to expenses. This next slide details total operating expense of $68.3 million for the quarter, up only $800,000 or 1% versus last year's third quarter. This increase primarily reflects higher royalty fees, offset somewhat by lower expenses for outside services and travel and promotional cost.","Core operating expense of $44.8 million decreased $1.3 million or 3% compared with the third quarter of 2012. The key variance accounting for this decline was lower cost for outside services, resulting from a decline in legal expenses. Overall, year-to-date through September, core operating expense annualized is tracking in line with our guidance range and where we expect to be for the full year. Looking at volume-based expenses, royalty fees increased by $2.5 million or 22%. This increase is directly related to the growth in trading volume in licensed products, as well as certain royalty fee adjustments.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 39.1% versus 24.4% in last year's third quarter. This variance was due to the recognition of significant discrete items in 2012 with no comparable benefits recognized in 2013. 2012's effective tax rate included the benefit of discrete items relating to prior years totaling $7.7 million or $0.09 per share, as well as the impact of the recognition of other discrete items that related directly to 2012 activity.","As you can see from this slide and the press release exhibits, we have broken out the adjustments to GAAP results. Based on our year-to-date results, we now expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2013 to be in the range of 39% to 39.5%.","Taking a look at the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $226.4 million, compared to $207.8 million at the end of June. Our business continues to generate strong cash flows from operations. Year-to-date, we have generated approximately $172 million in cash from operations, paid nearly $43 million in dividends, used about $20 million for capital expenditures and another $20 million to purchase stock.","After investing in the growth in our business, we have continued to return to cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. We repurchased over 306,000 shares in the third quarter at a total cost of $14 million at an average price of $45.63.","At quarter end, $89.3 million remained available on our current share repurchase authorizations. We will continue to be disciplined in our repurchase activity, which will vary based upon stock price and other factors.","Lastly, I would like to provide an update on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Incorporating our results through September, we now expect capital spending to be in the range of $33 million to $36 million, primarily reflecting lower spending than anticipated in that certain projects. Due to the change in outlook for capital spending, we are lowering depreciation and amortization to a range of $34 million to $36 million. And as I said earlier, we expect our tax rate for 2013 to be in the range of 39% to 39.5%.","In summary, we had another solid quarter, and we are off to a very strong start in the fourth quarter with record trading volumes in our proprietary products in October. We are well positioned for continued growth and increased operating leverage going forward with positive business momentum, operating and expense discipline and a healthy balance sheet.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Debbie.","Deborah Koopman","Thanks. At this point, we would be happy to take questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rick Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","But -- so with that, my one question is going to be around expenses, Alan. I'm a reasonable guy and I'm looking at -- if you look at the low end of your expenses, you -- the 1 89, that would imply $47 million for the last quarter, up from $44.8 million on the core expenses this quarter. So could you give us some color why it would increase and -- we know you've taken this under-promise and over-perform thing to a new height here. So...","Alan J. Dean","Wow, Rich, okay. Rich, if you look at where we were through 2 quarters, we're actually at the high end of our guidance if you annualized the 2 quarter results. We had a good third quarter, primarily driven to reduction in legal fees and outside services. And although I wish I could predict with high degree of certainty what legal fees would be month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter, that's impossible. It depends on a lot of things and including litigation activity and other things. So I think the range that we've given the expense range is a good range, and that's where I expect to end up for the year.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Inside the 1 89 to 1 94.","Alan J. Dean","Yes, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Real quick on, I guess, on pricing, the -- obviously, the multiply listed business becoming smaller and smaller at the percentage of overall [indiscernible] pie. Obviously, the pricing has come down substantially, and people continue to point that out. It doesn't matter as much anymore, I guess. But given that market share stabilized and your competitors seems to be not as aggressive anymore, I mean, Alan, I think you said in the past there might be areas to get a little bit more constructive again. You still believe that, or do you think that's a good range from here?","Alan J. Dean","Well, first of all, revenue per contract declined a little bit in this quarter compared to prior quarters, and that's primarily driven by a slight increase in market share. So that meant more of our customers were able to take advantage of our VIP program. So that's a good thing. I still do believe that revenue per contract in the multi-list category will continue its decline, although no one in the industry has made any significant fee changes since we responded to a competitor back in February. And I think we made another change in March. So everybody is still kind of holding firm. Now the last part of your question, are there opportunities to increase revenue per contract? There may be. Our fee schedule, unfortunately, is very complex, very long. We'll look for opportunities, but we won't be doing anything that we think will alienate our customers or endanger our business. So we constantly look for opportunities. I'm hopeful we'll find some. I wish I could be more specific with you, but that's all I can say right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A question on capital management. So clearly still, ton of cash on the balance sheet. You guys are approaching year end. You bought $14 million of stock. You're kind of kicking down the CapEx spend. I know, historically, you kind of said buy back dividends first and then maybe special in some specific situations. Could this be one of those years where, again, you guys would consider special, or if not, what's the plan, I guess, for the excess cash? Because I think, historically, you talked about kind of like a $50 million working capital number.","Alan J. Dean","Yes, I have $50 million, $40 million to $60 million as a kind of a range. I said it would be a minimum cash level for CBOE, and I still feel that way. And that low level is because we do generate so much cash on a consistent basis. And we do focus on returning capital to stockholders. And our first objective is to make sure we invest -- reinvest in our business as necessary. And then after that, regular dividends. We'd like to see that regular dividend grow along with our business. And we've been able to do that since our IPO 3 years ago. And most recently, 20% increase in our dividend from $0.15 to $0.18 per share back in August. And -- nothing is off the table in terms of what we might do to return cash to stockholders. Special dividend, we did a special dividend that was tax related about 1 year ago, but I know our board would look at that as a possibility going forward, as an alternative. Also, I -- what's not off the table is a variable dividend, like the other companies have done. I think we've looked at that all. Thirdly, we could look at some sort of acceleration of our stock repurchase program. And so the theme here is that we remain committed to returning cash to our stockholders. And we'll -- we aren't ruling out any of the different ways we could do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess just given all the technological issues that have kind of occurred across the various exchanges. I guess could you talk about the potential discussions and\/or regulatory changes, or I guess, more scrutiny that you guys might see for the industry as a whole or what you guys might be doing, kind of going forward to prevent as a group potential future issues?","Edward L. Provost","Dan, Ed Provost. Thanks for the question. Sure, we have, this year, following our issues back in April, been very, very focused on reviewing our procedures for software development testing, hardware configurations and the procedures we employed for rolling over to our DR, if that would be necessary. We were active participants in Chair White's conference in Washington on September 12, out of which came 5 different working groups. We are active participants in all of those, looking at national market systems to ensure that there's no single point of failure in the national market system. So we're actively participating both in the broader national effort and also looking internally at everything we do to ensure that we can minimize, if not eliminate, any kinds of technology issues in the future. I'm sure Alan would agree. We will make the necessary investments to ensure that we have the most stable systems in the business. We're committed to do doing that and feel like we have made great progress this year in that regard.","Alan J. Dean","Ed, if I can jump in and expand on what you said. Although we're still in the planning stages for 2014, preliminary indications are that we will increase our capital expenditures next year as compared to this year. As we look for ways to further harden our systems, we are committed to doing everything we can to improve our performance and liability. And although I can't be specific right now on what that may mean in terms of dollars, I felt that given the question, I should tell you how it's looking right now for 2014.","Edward T. Tilly","And Dan, I would just wrap that up by saying there is an SEC rulemaking document out there, called Reg SCI. Ultimately, that will dictate what exchanges need to do in these areas, and we'll look forward to seeing how that gets resolved in the long run. We have commented on it as have others in the industry. So it will be a great focus by the whole securities industry on technology and stability and eliminating some of the issues we had as an industry in 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","The Russell, the rollout of the Russell volatility futures and the index, can you expand a little bit on that? It sounds really interesting, and there's kind of -- is there a particular community of investors that kind of sought it out from you [ph]? Was it a reverse inquiry from the Russell? What would be the target group for this, and how do you plan to roll that out?","Alan J. Dean","Niamh, yes, so Russell, I think is exciting, as I pointed out in the prepared remarks. Really a different investor base. So Russell, as it concentrates the small cap of slightly higher volatility, as you would imagine, a much broader base and representative group of small cap stocks. So the investor base is different by definition. With that, we think there's always an opportunity in launching a new contract with the same methodology, the same tradable contract and methodology as S&P 500 mix. We'll get traders who not only want to isolate the volatility risk in Russell, but also allow for the trading between Russell volatility and S&P 500 volatility, much the same way you may trade S&P 500 versus Russell. So there's a natural user base just looking to hedge, take positions in Russell vol which will be different than the S&P 500, and then the pairs trade, the ability to trade Russell vol against S&P 500 vol.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Definitely helpful. And I'll get back in line with -- are you just trying to market it differently. Have you kind of a sales force targeting it to a different group of traders or whatnot? Or is it kind of going to roll to your group of market makers?","Alan J. Dean","So it'll roll out much the same way as we've done with other new contracts. So we'll launch, as we said, the futures in November 18. Jane Street will be our DPM in the futures. And then the options launch on December 2, Group One, same DPM, same specialists as our S&P 500. So we'll have a natural center of liquidity providers here at CBOE. The same physical trading pit for options and, of course, the futures will be all electronic. So we're able to go out as institutional marketing guys able to go out and tell an additional story, another chapter in the volatility evolution in trading and being able to introduce small cap vol.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Ed, you give a really helpful update on all the new growth initiatives that you've recently released and what's upcoming. I was just hoping you could just frame for us kind of goalpost and what you would call success on some of these upcoming initiatives, extended trading hours, Russell 2000 futures, the PM-settled Mini-SPX, as you evaluate over the coming months, because I know a lot of these new initiatives have a longer glide about them. So it would be just helpful if you frame that all for us.","Alan J. Dean","Sure. I'll start with the extended trading hours. It's most recent. And then since Russell is coming up end of month and then this phase 2 of extended trading hours, Monday, let's start with extended trading hours that we launched this week. We watched eagerly to see not only the volume, which is very transparent to all of you. But from our perspective, what kind of customer base, liquidity providers have we attracted in the very earliest stages of our two-phase extended trading hours, and we're pleased to see about 1\/3, a little more than 1\/3 of our current Futures users engaging with us in that first extended trading hours. And the contract the volume you're all able to see, and we couldn't be more pleased with starting at around 500 contracts on our first day and darn near 1,700 contracts yesterday afternoon so","[Audio Gap]","optimistic looking to next week beginning with our 2 a.m. launch. So we will be keeping tabs on the users, and you'll be able to see the volume as it trades because, of course, all that's real time on our website. So that's the first and second phase of the rollout of extended trading hours. I think with SPXpm, I'll turn over to Ed, as we really have historically looked at the entire complex of the SPX and couldn't be more pleased where we are. But I'll turn it over to Ed for SPX.","Edward L. Provost","So Howard, thank you for the question. So SPXpm, you will recall, is a product we introduced as a monthly exploration sometime back. And with the great success we have in the SPX Weeklys, which themselves are p.m. settled, we kind of looked that this is an overall SPXpm complex with great success or attributable to the weekly contract than the XSPpm monthly contracts. But ironically, this month of October, we had record levels of open interest in trading volume in the SPX monthly. So we continue to be very pleased with the PM-settled SPX contracts, both the monthly expirations and the Weekly. So we're very, very happy with our progress and to continue to promote those products.","Edward T. Tilly","And then back, as we look a little bit further down the path, of course, we couldn't be more excited to have been able to share at our Europe RMC, the launch -- pending launch, assuming we have regulatory approval of our short-term volatility contracts. So that's pretty exciting when you look at, from a trader's perspective, being able to really isolate short-term moves and vol and assumptions, and being able to trade just a different part of the volatility curve some time we are hopeful of first quarter. So excited of what we see in new products, but I can't pass the opportunity to remind you that we still think the growth in VIX and the expansion adoption of trading VIX and volatility as a tradable class. I'm just so excited about what we see in the pipeline, be able to touch new users, both domestically and internationally.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","To expand on global reach, maybe can you tell us where you stand today in terms of touching the non-U.S. customers, I don't know if you can do it, but maybe as a percentage of volume? And as you think about a further penetration, you extended the hours, you highlighted kind of global interest in VIX and SPX, but what is the opportunity in a suite of products that's maybe more geared towards local tastes? Like you've got some today, do you need more? Like you've got SPX in oil, you've got SPX in gold, as you meant physical products. Does the suite need to be expanded to really capture the potential of the global opportunity?","Edward L. Provost","Thanks, Ken. Ed Provost. So we've often referred to VIX in more in line of what our analysts and the community who are focused on VIX have referred to, to say global proxy for market volatility, and we had a very, very active quarter visiting with our current and potential customers globally. In fact, we were at 50 office visits with pension funds, hedge funds, private and public endowments and the like in areas ranging from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; to Toronto; Atlanta; Chicago; New York; San Francisco; Lisbon, of course, with our RMC; Geneva; London; Monte Carlo, where there's a big hedge fund conference. The global demand for volatility products and the understanding of how those products can be used is really unrelenting. We note that in Australia, the -- one of our 9 exchanges that have licensed the VIX methodology began trading futures on VIX. So we're very excited about the global interest in trading volatility and the demand to understand how they can improve returns and manage risk using VIX products. Your earlier question as to what percentage of our business comes from outside the United States is an educated guess in our part. We estimate in the area of 20% to 25%, really don't know that with great certainty because we don't know the access of the clearing records at that level of detail. But certainly, among all of our products, the VIX product has the greatest interest from overseas. We're pleased with some progress we've made with our London Hub. We have 4 extranet providers who have already connected to that. And as Ed pointed out earlier, although the after-hours -- extended trading hours, we believe, will be more domestic users, we very much look forward to the interest in our 2 a.m. session, which starts next week.","Edward T. Tilly","Yes. I think I'd want to follow up. Ed mentioned the Australia market and trading the ASX 200 VIX contract. What that does for us globally, Ken, is really raise the awareness of trading volatility as an asset class, separating that risk component called volatility and be able to trade it. It is the same methodology we trade for S&P 500 VIX, the Russell VIX and as Ed pointed out, 9 total exchanges with a license. So as the Australian market becomes more and more aware and focused on the ability to trade volatility, they can't help but look at the global benchmark of volatility that we have here at CBOE and the S&P 500. So again, like Russell, we'll introduce the opportunity to trade pairs volatility trading. You can trade Australia volatility against U.S. So that only helps raise the awareness of volatility when we do have an endorsement on our methodology by foreign markets. And then you said branching out a little bit more, and remind you that last quarter, we announced working with the CME on bringing the 10-year interest rate volatility contract to market. We're still working on that. That's in the pipeline, and I should have mentioned this at the last question on what's in the pipeline. So very, very exciting. That runs the spectrum of users even to a new group to CBOE.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'm just trying to think about the potential for the short-term VIX product, and I believe you mentioned in your comments that the product brings some of the benefits of the SPX Weeklys to the VIX. So I was hoping if you could just kind of expand on that? And then also, if I look at the SPX, about 1\/4 of the volume now coming from the Weeklys, would you expect that same type of breakdown with the VIX over time with the short-term versus the regular VIX?","Edward T. Tilly","So let's -- because it's -- not everyone is familiar and uses these volatility terms like we do, we kind of take a lot for granted. So first, why don't we just, real quickly, what is VXST? It is a measure of 9-day implied volatility S&P 500. You're dead on on that. So the products -- and what is a little different I think is really key. So when we list the short-term volatility contract, we'll have expirations every Wednesday that's settled into the SPX Weekly 9 days following. So for example, next Wednesday is the 6th, VXST would use SPX options expiring February -- November 15. On November 13, there'll there be an expiration, and we'll use the Friday, November 22 Weeklys. So that's the tie in with the Weekly contract. What VXST is not is the same as the Weekly contract on VIX, which is a 30-day number. So really, it's a brand-new index that's responsive to moving some changes in short-term volatility. So the user base we're able to attract, those current users who are looking out 30 days and want to pinpoint volatility risk in their portfolio shorter term and we're going to use those Weekly contracts. So similar to the expansion that we've seen in bringing new users to the S&P 500 complex in the Weekly contract, similarly, we think we'll find users who just want short-term volatility exposure. So that's kind of the way it works. Now can we predict 25% penetration? I don't know that we would do that at this point, but it is that trajectory, that adaptation and bringing in new users that we're really all about. Some small cannibalization, we think that's fine, but really, at the end of the day, it'll be a growth story and our ability to attract new short-term traders to a volatility complex.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just a question on volume expenses and the volume outlook. So it looks like on the expenses ticked up a bit when we look at it as a percentage of related ADV. I think you mentioned something on S&P rates. Just wanted to get an update on that in the outlook because it seems like it had been trending down a bit over the past couple of quarters, just some of the changes. And just on the volume outlook, you mentioned a lot on the user growth, the pipeline on products opportunities with VIX. I guess just curious, when you look at the mix of the business now versus, say, 5, 6 years ago when VIX was more normal, what do you think is the uptick or the increase in volumes when we get back to a more normalized volatility environment?","Alan J. Dean","This is Alan. Specifically, on your royalty fee question. You're correct. We had a rate increase going into effect related to Standard & Poor's in March of this year, and we talked about that before. Standard & Poor's is not the only license agreement that we have. We have a number of them, including other exclusive agreements, semi-exclusive and nonexclusive agreements. And so the mix of products that we trade could impact the relationship between royalty fees and index volume. And -- but I think the metric that we talked about in the past, which is the relationship between index line and royalty fees, is about the best that I can come up with right now to help you look at those for the future. I don't have anything that -- anything better right now, and so mix is the driver in variances from that metric. So let me give you a little -- an answer to the second part of the question, what do we anticipate fixed return to normal historic levels and what would that user base look like? I think it's important as you referenced in the past, and then we overlay that with the VIX user base and how that's changed, and it's changed interestingly in a relatively low volatility market. We've been able to attract, obviously, a much broader user base even at low levels of volatility. VIX futures really started off as a hedge for VIX options traders. VIX options traders tended to be professionals. You can look at the evolution of the contract with the introduction of ETNs and how that's become much more retail. So the user base of a tradable volatility contract has changed albeit in a very low less than historical -- historic level of volatility. What I think is exciting is we of late picked up the more high-frequency trader or the day trader, and that is in also a low level of market volatility. But what we see in months and earlier part of the month of October, primarily, is those day traders and those high-frequency traders really turn up their interest in volatility, as volatility has a higher vol. So what do I mean by that? Current historical level of VIX volatility is about 116. That's low. That's low. VIX volatility is historically higher. So we think we'll increase the interest from high-frequency traders and day traders if we return to a more historic level of volatility. So I think there's more growth to come from that group.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question is more of a macro question. If you look at the options market more broadly, and I'm talking about the multi-listed market, there's been some volatility. But if we look at kind of volumes over the last couple of years, they just really haven't grown at all. And curious to get your guys' perspective on why you think that is and what maybe it's going to take to actually see some growth in this market again?","Edward L. Provost","Chris, Ed Provost. So clearly, the single equity names market has -- is the most mature of all of the option products. I think it's reflective of general volume levels in the equities and futures markets. In fact, the options markets relative to those other markets did not see the drop-off. We still think, through our educational efforts, both those employed by CBOE and by the options industry in general, will broaden the user base for options. But to a large extent, the future volume levels in the single-name equities is going to be tied to general volume levels in the equities markets themselves. We feel confident that the small investor is trickling back into the market as index levels have risen and volatility has continued to be low. So we continue to be optimistic about the long-term growth of the basic option product.","Alan J. Dean","Let me add. This is Alan, Chris. Fortunately, we become less and less dependent, it seems, each quarter on the revenue that we derive from those single-name option transaction fees. So I agree with everything Ed said, but I want to make sure you keep that focus as well.","Edward T. Tilly","And I think what is -- Ed Tilly now. What is CBOE's role then in trying to promote in -- at the growth -- historical growth that Ed mentioned in the product is for CBOE, we still very much believe in the being front and center and leader in options education. We spend a great deal of time web-based and in-classroom, and so we are committed to carrying the majority of that effort for the industry and are optimistic at what we see in both online education and in-class education.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Leon with S&P Capital IQ.","Kenneth M. Leon - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","A question again related to trading volumes and futures, very high in the second quarter, it's off. And do you see a rebound or even passing the second quarter where with 180,000 contract is more driven just by short-term or HFT traders or potentially different groups, such as portfolio managers or even from Europe? It just seems you had great secular growth, and now it seems we're just looking at cyclical factors more than the uptick of a small base, but a great franchise and volatility.","Edward T. Tilly","Let me, Ken, Ed Tilly. Actually, we're -- October for us was second busiest month. So while the quarter might have been better than you're referring to, we are very optimistic, as Alan pointed out, the way we've started this fourth quarter with October volume in both VIX futures and options. So we couldn't be more pleased with the uptick. You mentioned the high-frequency traders, and my response in earlier question was, when volatility increases, we see that new user group really engaging and driving that volume, both futures and options. So yes, the things that we have in Q allow us to attract more and new existing users and new users to the complex, and it's just going to be through a heightened awareness of what this contract affords hedgers and day traders. But that's really the kind of way you see it. So coming off of October, I'm actually very, very encouraged by the volume.","Alan J. Dean","Yes, let me just add, I have the numbers in front of me, Ken. The third quarter in futures, the volume was down. We averaged 180,000 contracts per day in the second quarter this year, 148,000 in the third quarter. But October now, which we finished yesterday, obviously, we averaged 182,000 contracts per day in our futures and the VIX futures for October. So there's a lot of factors that'll drive volume, but we think we're still on that hockey stick curve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akhil Bhatia with Rosenblatt Securities.","Akhil Bhatia","Just a follow-on to that last question, can you just talk about the open interest trends in VIX and why we haven't really been seeing open interest grow much?","Edward T. Tilly","Sure. It's Ed Tilly. Open interest, we've had a couple of conversations on this, and certainly it came up last quarter and we've certainly looked at open interest. But VIX is a bit different. It's really a tactical tool, not really a buy-and-hold investment. So traders tend to get in and out of positions in response to changing volatility levels. We actually have an index, the tail risk hedge index, that we try to prescribe certain levels of volatility exposure based on the level of volatility. So you would see it at historical low volatility that we find ourselves today that we prescribe trading, let's say, X amount of volatility and having that in your portfolio. And as volatility rises, we suggest leveling off. And when volatility is really picking up, we have suggest that you lighten the exposure to volatility. So that's pretty normal for us to see volatility open interest move around. Also I'd point out that expiration cycles tend to lower the open interest in volatility. But if we look through the month of October, for example, which was very, very busy, and we began the month of October about 350,000 contracts in open interest. As we said, record month, but we'll close the month at about 367,000 contracts in open interest. So relatively flat. And if we look to the expiration date, that was a low. So nothing unusual really when we look at open interest, and we just recognized that the contract acts a little different than a buy-and-hold contract would.","Akhil Bhatia","And do you have any statistics on, I guess, customer breakout? How much of it is HFT proprietary trading versus other customers?","Edward T. Tilly","Well, the HFT, we know, tend not to build open interest. They are in the day trader category. So open-close same day, not building open interest. Customers and hedgers tend to be those that are building the open interest in the low levels of historic volatility and the ones that we would see, and actually expect to be selling as volatility increases much the way we saw that trip from front month volatility in October moving from 14.5% up to 19.5% or 20%. Not unusual the hedge worked. Couldn't be a better illustration of the power of volatility and exposure to volatility in a market, where overall uncertainty this happened to be around government inaction having a volatility exposure in your portfolio actually pay off. So not surprising that we saw that fluctuation inter-month. As I said, right around expiration low point, but building back up toward the end of the month of where we began October 1.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Quick follow-up. Actually, coming back to the first question that Rich asked on the expense side. Just maybe, Alan, you can be a little bit more specific in terms of the fourth quarter here because the guidance is fairly wide, and obviously, implies pretty big step-up. So you mentioned the legal fees, and if I look back just a couple of quarters, I think the highest ever were, I think, $11 million in outside services. So you're at $8 million right now. So you went back to the highest level ever, that's $3 million there which gets to $190 million, I think, for the full year. Are there any -- is there anything else you would point to, I mean, on the comp side perhaps? I mean, you're having a great year. Is there anything else that you haven't accrued for? I mean, you change your shareholder comp outlook. So anything else where line items that you would point to where that delta to the low and high end could be coming from?","Alan J. Dean","I understand -- I think I understand what you're trying to do. You're -- with that range of $189 million to $194 million, I think it is -- that leaves a lot of room for where expenses could be in the fourth quarter. If I hit the middle of that range, Alex, that would be where I'd want to be and where I think you'd want me to be, given that the range I gave you for the year back in February, and I don't have any particular information that guides me either way from the middle of that range right now. Does that help at all?","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, so -- but I mean, is there any like year-end [indiscernible] on the comp? Is that a big variability, or is that kind of like a good run rate that we're having right now, given how you're doing this, I guess, is the point?","Alan J. Dean","Say that one more time, Alex.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I mean, is one of the -- is there a variable on the compensation side that could...","Alan J. Dean","No, no, the comp shouldn't vary. That's where we think we do a pretty good job of that throughout the year, so I don't see any fluctuations coming out of that or -- the things that are really hard for me to predict and as many times a surprise for me from quarter-to-quarter or for month-to-month is things like legal fees, things that I can't -- although, I, of course, talked to our legal department and what they're using outside law firms. But if the rates that were -- that outside law firms can charge, that can add up pretty quick. So there's a number of things that I cannot predict with the level of certainty that I would like. And if I wind up for the year in the middle of the expense range, that would be good as far as I'm concerned.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","All of it was answered. I'm all set.","Operator","Our next question comes from Niamh Alexander with KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","If I could try again, Alan, with the capital, because you've built it up, the repurchases are kind of a little smaller than we thought, because you have made the point during the summer that you were back actively at share repurchases. But I guess, what I thought was kind of interesting is that, you seemed a little bit more open to a very -- an annual variable dividends similar to many swaps on competitor exchanges that are cash generative. Did I -- I understood the board's disposition in the past has been like regular dividend or repurchases, the special was really around expected tax changes rather than kind of something. So am I right in interpreting that the board is a little bit more open to thinking about an annual variable dividend going forward, because it is very different than a special or something that you kind of -- you have to kind of -- every year, you're going to come up and come up with something in terms of paying back to the shareholders?","Alan J. Dean","Sure, I don't think the board has really changed its view on capital allocations at all, how we get cash back to our shareholders. The reason why maybe I talked about a little bit more is because cash is building up on our balance sheet. So if the board is committing -- committed to returning excess cash to shareholders, then you have to do something. And so either increase the rate that we're doing share repurchases or a special or variable, that's the reason why you -- it may sound like I'm saying that they're more open to it. They still prefer regular dividends, seeing those grow with our businesses, stock repurchases, making sure we have enough money to invest in our business as needed, that's their preferred path, but nothing is off the table. And again, the overarching foundation of this is returning excess cash to shareholders. That hasn't changed.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess just to follow up a little bit. You've lowered your CapEx guidance. Why didn't you buy back more in the third quarter then?","Alan J. Dean","Well, we started late in the third quarter. It was -- I don't have the...","Deborah Koopman","Early September.","Alan J. Dean","That was early September. Debbie was helping me. So we were out of the market for a long time. It wasn't a July 1 start. So I think what we did, we were, of course, we're opportunistic on how we buy back our stock, but I think we're pretty aggressive as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller of BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Clarify one thing. Do you guys have a sense for when the board might decide on some of those capital issues? Like if we're -- if they're thinking about potentially accelerating the buyback doing a special order, the variable, do you have a time frame for when we'd know which path we're going to be going down?","Alan J. Dean","Yes, it's tied to our quarterly earnings review and release cycle is -- so last week, our board met. Right after the board met at that meeting, they approved the dividend for the quarter. Press release came out. Our finance and strategy committee meets the day before of the board meeting. They talked about it. So the kind of the cycle that would be tied to the dividend announcement in the future is what I'd expect to happen in the future. That's what has happened in the past. Things could change, but that's the way I see it right now.","Operator","I'm not showing any further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Debbie Koopman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Koopman, please begin.","Deborah Koopman","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our CEO, will provide an update on our strategic initiative for 2013; then Alan Dean, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will review our second quarter 2013 financial results. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A will be our President and Chief Operating Officer, Ed Provost.","In addition, I'd like to point out that this presentation will include the use of several slides. We will be showing the slides and providing commentary on each. A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","As a preliminary note, you should be aware that this presentation contains forward-looking statements, which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold, and why we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after this conference call.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Tilly.","Edward T. Tilly","Thank you, Debbie, and good morning. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter at CBOE Holdings. New records for operating revenue and earnings per share were driven by increased trading volume overall and continued growth in our higher-margin proprietary products.","We continue to invest in growth initiatives while returning value to stockholders, as evidenced by our board's recently announced decision to increase the company's quarterly cash dividend by 20%.","Alan will take you through the financial results in more detail after I run through the highlights for the quarter.","First, we'll look at options volume and market share for the quarter. Total options average daily volume at CBOE Holdings grew 1% from the second quarter last year and 13% over the first quarter 2013. The year-over-year volume growth was driven by increases of 23% in index options and 13% in ETNs and ETFs, offset by a 20% decline in equity options.","As we reported last quarter, CBOE responded to intensified fee competition with the implementation of an enhanced VIP schedule in February and a complex order VIP enhancement in March. Subsequently, CBOE's market share in June for multi-listed options increased by 19.7%, excluding dividend trades, from 15.3% for January. The upward trend continued in July when CBOE's multi-listed market share increased to 21.1%.","C2's market share in multi-listed classes increased slightly to 2.1% in June, up from 1.6% in January, driven by growth in ETF options trading and adjustments to C2's maker-taker pricing schedule. C2's market share in ETF options rose to 3.8% in June, up from 2.6% in January, driven by increased trading in the most active pending classes, particularly in SPY options. While ETF trading continues to lead the volume gains on C2, we also expect the new spread-based pricing model implemented in February to attract additional equity business to C2. We are in the midst of ongoing educational efforts to help customers implement and adapt to the new model, which is unlike any other in the options marketplace.","In addition, we also plan to provide access to additional real-time fee incentive information on C2 in September. We expect this added functionality will enable users to more readily maximize the benefits of C2 spread-based pricing model. We continue to closely monitor the very fluid multi-list arena at each of our options exchanges.","Now for an update on trading in CBOE's S&P 500 Index options complex, where we have seen notable upticks throughout 2013. Trading in SPX this past quarter spiked to a new daily record high, and average daily volume rose 21% over trading in the second quarter of last year. The volume ascent continued in July, bringing the growth in SPX ADV to 21% year-to-date. Volume gains in SPX trading continue to be driven primarily by robust trading activity in our SPX Weeklys product, which increased by 126% in the second quarter and is up by 147% year-to-date through July.","VIX futures and options continued to climb to new records throughout the second quarter, including new single day volume records for both products set on April 15. VIX futures average daily volume reached a new quarterly record and increased 92% over the second quarter 1 year ago. Year-to-date through July, VIX futures ADV stands 99% ahead of last year's pace. VIX options ADV during the second quarter rose 28% year-over-year. Year-to-date, ADV in VIX options through the end of July is up 36% over the same period in 2012.","Despite angling low market volatility, we continue to see broadening interest in VIX futures and options trading. On our last call, we reported on new users, among them hedge funds and proprietary firms. To that list, we now add calendar spread traders who generally prefer to participate in markets with steep term structures, such as those typically associated with VIX futures. These traders are increasingly embracing VIX futures as an alternative to the flat-term structure currently seen in the fixed income market.","On a much broader level, we continue to see mainstream adoption of VIX trading. While we're generally agnostic in the volatility as an asset class debate, a recent article published by BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, bears mention. In VIX Euro portfolio, BlackRock recommends a short volatility strategy as an equity substitute, calling it \"a particularly compelling strategy that would have improved portfolio performance even during the financial crisis.\" The firm specifically highlights VIX futures as an equity substitute because they are \"exchange-traded, liquid, transparently priced, operationally simple and provide clean volatility exposure.\" Each wave of new users brings additional liquidity and activity to our growing volatility marketplace and speaks to the inherent versatility of VIX futures and options.","We're thrilled to see the growing diversification of a customer base that now includes [indiscernible] professionals and long-term investors alike. We look forward to reporting on new participants, on new users for VIX futures and options as we continue to extend our marketing and educational reach.","We mentioned in our last call that we would be revising the schedule to implement extended trading hours for VIX futures. As announced earlier this week, we plan to begin the first phase of the rollout in late September with the second phase to begin in the weeks thereafter. In order to meet demand from U.S. customers for post settlement trading period, the first phase of our extended trading initiative will add 45-minute trading session after the current close of VIX futures at 3:15 p.m. The second phase will allow European-based customers to trade VIX futures during their local trading hours by beginning trading 5 hours earlier than its current opening time. Trading will then begin at 2:00 a.m. Central Time, which aligns with the 8 a.m. open of the London markets.","We also look forward to boosting global awareness and trading in VIX futures and options with our second annual European Risk Management Conference, which will be held near Lisbon this September 30 through October 2. Conference sessions will feature our SPX and VIX product lines, as well as CBOE strategy benchmarks, such as the BuyWrite Index BXM.","In other second quarter product developments, we began in May to disseminate values for a new volatility benchmark based on futures options data on CME group's 10-year U.S. Treasury note contract. Interest rate derivatives represent the largest asset class in the over-the-counter market. We are pleased to offer the first index of its kind to gauge volatility in this very dynamic arena.","I'll wrap up here by saying that we remain very bullish on our company's prospects for continued growth. We are pleased that trading on our proprietary products continues to flourish, and we are cautiously optimistic about the recent upticks so far this year in options trading overall. This is an exciting time for our company. As we begin the second half of the year, we remain focused on product development, extending our global customer reach and providing the highest standards in market regulation and compliance. We are committed to maintaining prudent fiscal management and investing in our strategic growth initiatives to continue to deliver value to our stockholders.","With that, I thank you for your attention, and I will now turn it over to Alan Dean.","Alan J. Dean","Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As Ed just highlighted, the second quarter produced our best quarterly results ever. This morning, I will review the key drivers of these financial results and update you on our outlook for the remainder of 2013.","As you saw in the press release we issued this morning, operating revenue for the quarter was a record high of $150.8 million, up 14% compared with 2012 second quarter.","Adjusted operating net income was $77.2 million, representing an adjusted operating margin of 51.2%, a 140 basis point improvement over the same quarter last year and our second best quarterly margin. Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders was $47 million, up 24% compared with the second quarter of 2012, resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.54, an all-time high.","Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the second quarter of 2013 include certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the Appendix of our slide deck.","Turning to the details of the quarter as shown on this chart, the growth in operating revenue is driven by increases in transaction fees, regulatory fees and exchange services and other fees, offset somewhat by lower access fees. Transaction fees increased $11.2 million or 12% from the second quarter of last year due to a 5% increase in trading volume and a 6% increase in the average revenue per contract for RPC versus last year's second quarter. The rise in trading volume was primarily driven by the continued robust growth in our proprietary products, with total trading volume and index options up 25% and futures contracts up 96%. Exchange traded products also contributed to the lift in volume with a 15% increase, while equities declined 19%.","Our blended RPC, including options and futures, increased to $0.334, primarily due to a shift in product mix towards our highest margin index options and futures contracts.","The RPC in our options business was relatively flat at $0.289 compared with $0.288 in last year's second quarter, but declined 13% compared with the first quarter. On our last earnings call, we told you that we expected the rolling 3-month RPC for the second quarter to decline as a result of fee changes we implemented in February and March.","RPC for the second quarter reflects the full impact of these pricing changes, which resulted in market share gains along with higher VIP credits.","I know some of you have questioned whether the benefits of our fee changes on multiply-listed options and the resulting market share gains outweighs the costs. Doing the analysis, it is critical to keep in mind that our leading market share position provides support to several revenue items that would come under tremendous pressure if our market share dropped to the level we believe it was destined if we did not match a competitor's pricing.","In January of this year, we saw our market share of multiply-listed options drop to 15.3%, adjusted for dividend trades after a competitor made an aggressive pricing change. That represented a 750 basis point decline to market share compared to January of 2012. And based on customer feedback, we knew that it would continue to decline if we did nothing. Taking all these factors into account, we believe it is in our best interest to continue to be among the leaders of market share. Our market share in multiply-listed options for the month of July was 21.1%, up 580 basis points compared with January. Multiply-listed options continued to represent a declining percentage of our trading volume and transaction fee revenue due in part to the tremendous growth we are witnessing in our proprietary products.","The contribution from CFE, our futures exchange, continues to grow and has become much more meaningful to our financial performance. In the second quarter, CFE's revenue per contract was $1.54, a slight decrease compared with last year's second quarter due to the impact of discounts provided on certain trades.","As depicted on this slide, in the second quarter of this year, index options accounted for 31.1% of total contracts traded, up from 26.1% in last year's second quarter. Futures contracts accounted for 3.6% of total volume, nearly double its contribution of 1.9% in last year's second quarter.","The shift in the mix of trading volume towards our highest margin products fueled much of the growth in transaction fees for the second quarter of 2013. Index options and futures contracts accounted for 80% of our transaction fees for the quarter, up from 66% in the second quarter of 2012.","Proprietary products are where we see the greatest growth potential. The $6.4 million increase of regulatory fees resulted from higher volume and increases in our options regulatory fees. Since the revenue derived from these fees is only available to cover expenses we incur to carry out our obligations as a regulator, we make adjustments as needed to maintain that balance. With industry-wide customer trading volume running ahead of our expectations, we plan to reduce the options regulatory fee on September 1. This change is expected to reduce revenue from regulatory fees by approximately $500,000 to $600,000 per month, assuming trading volume in the second half of the year is consistent with the volume through June.","Exchange services and other fees increased by $1.4 million, compared with last year's first quarter, primarily reflecting a positive response to a new network access option we added in December of 2012. The decrease in access fees primarily resulted from the decline in trading permits and the introduction of new access fee programs that allowed specific trading permit holders to reduce their access fees based on meeting certain trading volume criteria.","Moving down the income statement to expenses. This next slide details total adjusted operating expense of $73.6 million for the quarter, up $7.1 million or 11% versus last year's second quarter. This increase primarily reflects higher employee costs and royalty fees, offset somewhat by lower travel and promotional expense.","Adjusted operating expense for the second quarter of 2013 excludes accelerated stock-based compensation of $800,000 and $1 million of additional expense for the final resolution of an SEC investigation. The acceleration of stock-based compensation represents the remaining full value of stock awards granted to employees in our regulatory services division who will no longer receive stock-based compensation.","Core operating expense of $49.6 million increased $4.6 million or 10%, compared with the second quarter of 2012, primarily due to higher employee costs. Employee costs were up due to increases in stock-based compensation, incentive compensation and salaries compared with 2012's second quarter. The increase in stock-based compensation reflects grants issued in the first quarter of this year, as well as grants issued in the second quarter, related to the May 23 management transition. The increase in incentive compensation is aligned with our growth in pretax income. Salaries are up primarily due to staff additions, mainly in our regulatory services division.","Excluding stock-based compensation expense, the increase in core operating expense was $2.2 million or 5%. Overall, through June, core operating expense annualized is tracking at the high end of our guidance range, which is in line with where we expect to be for the year.","Taking a look at the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $207.8 million, down slightly compared to the $210.5 million at the end of March, primarily due to estimated tax payments made during the quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated approximately $117 million in cash from operations, paid over $27 million in dividends, used over $13 million for capital expenditures and about $6 million to purchase restricted stock from employees.","There were no share repurchases made under our share authorization in the second quarter of this year. We have $103.3 million available under our share repurchase authorization. As I've stated previously, we use buybacks opportunistically. However, timing will depend on a number of considerations, including share price, the environment, financial performance and other factors.","3 days ago, we announced that our board increased our quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.18 per share, effective with our third quarter dividend payment. This action reflects the confidence our board and management have in the long-term growth of our business and our ability to continue to generate strong cash flow.","Growing the dividend remains an important component of returning value to our stockholders, and is aligned with our disciplined approach to capital allocation.","As noted in our press release, we are reaffirming our full year guidance that we first provided on February 8, as shown on this slide.","In closing, we continue to position the company for long-term growth by remaining focused on executing our growth strategies and delivering strong margins and strong returns. We feel good about the momentum we have in our proprietary products and believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities and to continue returning substantial value to stockholders.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Debbie. Thank you very much.","Deborah Koopman","Thanks. At this point, we would be happy to take questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","My question is when are you going to change your name from the CBOE to the Chicago Board Volatility Exchange? Well, I guess, the question, if we're not going to go with the CBVE -- but anyway, my question would be -- the multi-listed options, Alan, you sort of addressed the company's viewpoint on that you think it's valuable, and it's just -- it's not as clear -- like in equities, you can see the equity exchanges, they maintain market share because you could see the listings following them or connected to the trading. But here, could you elaborate more on the value of maintaining the multi-listed option franchise or market share as you have? Just a little bit more specifics on where you see the other impacts, to other parts of your business?","Alan J. Dean","I'd be glad to, Rich. But before I get to that, what I said in my prepared remarks, we believe, which is that, if -- we believe -- if we didn't match our competitor on that VIP pricing schedule, we saw market share eroding further. And we were already -- forget what I said, 15% or 16% in January, and that was heading down. That was just not acceptable. Options is in the name of our exchange, and so it's very important to us to remain the leader in all categories. Now the revenue items that are important to us are market data fees, you know that. That's driven by market share. And although the money is significant, it can't offset the loss in RPC. But that is an important factor. There's also exchange services and other fees that's how participants get to CBOE and the other services that they receive from us. So if we didn't have the market share to justify those fees, I would expect price pressure or even a decline in the utilization of those services. But most important is the access fees -- the number this year -- is going to be $60 million to $65 million, something like that. A big of chunk of that is SPX and VIX. But still a big significant part of that annual number is from the multi-list category. And as soon as we saw market share starting to erode, we saw pressure on those fees. And no other exchange has the kind of access fees that we have. We are over market in that category. There's no doubt about it. So that's the logic behind it, and that's why we did what we did. Now we always look for ways to increase RPC, even on a multi-list category, and we'll continue to do that as the year wears on. Maybe there's opportunities. The fee schedule is extremely complex. And all the exchanges look for advantages, and we'll look for ours in the short term and long term. I hope that does it for you, Rich.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Yes, no. That's helpful.","Operator","The next question is from Howard Chen of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Alan, I wanted to follow up on your comments about the share buyback. You all have done a lot of capital return over the years, but just given the growing cash position, the dividend that you just materially increased, the liquidity of stock, I was hoping you can elaborate on appetite to buy the stock here at current levels.","Alan J. Dean","I'd be glad to, Howard. I did address it in my prepared remarks, and the point I wanted to get across is that it continues to be the intention of our board to, first, reinvest in our business to ensure our future growth, to pay regular dividends and to see that regular dividend grow as our business grows, and then to use excess cash for stock repurchases. And underlying those 3 things is -- and don't hold on to cash and earn an extremely low rate of return on that cash because that doesn't benefit our shareholders. So the board reviews this policy each quarter. And they did so again earlier this week, reaffirmed our strategy, our stock repurchase, funding the unused amount. And so what I can say right now is that we absolutely remain committed to our current capital allocation policy, and that includes our stock repurchase program. That's it.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The VIX franchise continues to do great, volumes are soaring, but we're seeing a slowdown in open interest growth recently, and I was wondering what your thoughts were here? Like basically, volumes are doing so well, I wonder what the dynamics were to lead to the slowdown in the OI growth?","Edward T. Tilly","Ken, it's a great question. I think we have seen historically different levels of open interest. We have different users coming in using the product differently. We've attracted, as we've said over the last couple of quarters, different users. The day user, if you will, the higher-frequency trader has a different approach and a different strategy. We certainly don't make any longer-term predictions on a short change or short-term change in open interest, just as we wouldn't make a long-term prediction on a blip in volatility causing some new open interest. So while we are very mindful of it and continue to watch it, I think we, like the Street, are just -- see this trajectory continuing with no sign of slowing at this point.","Alan J. Dean","This is Alan, Ken. We often get the question when will VIX volume flatten out. And for us, an indicator would be a plateau in volume, and that hasn't happened. The growth rate is still there. Year-to-date volume is significantly over where it was 1 year ago. We think we have a lot of potential to grow VIX, not only in the U.S., but in Europe. And so we think there's more runway in front of us in both the options and the futures for VIX.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe just a follow-up on the VIX. It seems like each quarter, the growth rate continues to be there, and its upside and its surprise in terms of where our expectations are. And you guys have highlighted some of the different users over time. So I guess, when we start thinking about over the next 1, 2, 3 years, when you think about the growth that you can generate from tapping a larger user base, maybe it's Europe, maybe it's more the traditional asset managers versus some of the newer product opportunities that you see, whether it's on treasuries or other asset classes. Just wanted to try to get a sense, where you see the most potential, whether it's shorter term or longer term, because obviously, it's one of these things we're trying to figure out what the growth rate is going to be is a challenge, but obviously, it's been fairly healthy for quite a while.","Edward T. Tilly","I think it's great. Let me start and I'll turn over to Ed Provost, who is really -- his team, concentrating on telling the story outside of the -- the domestic market. But just to give you some terms of what we see and the growth, I think to your point and the upside, I just point out that as of yesterday, the year-to-date volume in VIX futures surpassed all of 2012. So that is without a huge globalization effort and we have just kicked off the hub. We have not extended the trading hours that some time will begin in September, as I said in my prepared comments. So we really think that there's terrific upside still in bringing new domestic users to the product. And then as Ed I think will spend some time on, also VIX is the global benchmark for volatility. That said, we will aggressively market and launch interest rate vol among other volatility products, but let me ask Ed to give you a little bit more background in what we see rolling out VIX outside of the domestic market.","Edward L. Provost","Thanks, Ed. Michael, so as Ed had indicated, we are full -- in the full attack mode with respect to promoting the VIX futures and options product, both domestically, which of course is where the initial interest came, but with a heavy focus on the international market as well. In fact, we have a group heading to South America in 2 weeks, and that will be our first venture to that area of the world. And really, there's very few spots that we have not at least made some preliminary stops in. We continuously hear from professionals who use the product that they are utilizing it, again as a proxy for global equity market volatility, given the fact that there is no liquid volatility product overseas that comes close to matching what we have here at CBOE in both the options and the futures. So in the equity-related VIX, we see there -- we see a tremendous upside potential, both domestically and internationally. It is the primary focus of our international in this year Lisbon-based RMC conference. As Ed mentioned, and as we have announced, we are trying to make a move into the interest rate-related volatility space. We think there are great opportunities there, the OTC market for products related to that is tremendous. So we see great opportunity away from the equity space, but we're looking to capitalize as much as we can here in the short run on the equity-related VIX. So we are very optimistic, and again, notwithstanding some small drop in open interest, we see every reason to believe that the growth in this product will continue.","Edward T. Tilly","Thanks, Ed. I have one more item, Mike, that I'd like to touch on. With our recent relaunch of our Variance contract, it gives Ed's team in business development the opportunity to circle back on those new -- the original VIX users, the more recent VIX users, and offer them realized volatility. So it gets us back in front of our anchored tenants, if you will, allow us to tell a different story and really complete a volatility story by offering realized vol on the S&P 500. So it's really all coming together on timing for us.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Harris of Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So my question is on the growth in SPX Weeklys. Obviously, VIX growth is great, but SPX at least from our perspective just continues to surprise to the upside. Can you guys kind of expand on that a little bit about really what's driving the growth of that Weekly product set? Is it an increase in velocity in weekly trading? Is it new user expansion? Or is something else going on? And then as you guys kind of look at the opportunity set for that product, how under-penetrated do you think it is at this point?","Edward L. Provost","Chris, Ed Provost here again. So yes, we're very excited about what we have seen in the SPX Weeklys. Often, we are asked how come we haven't seen so much growth in the SPXpm product. The fact is that the SPX Weeklys are a PM-settled option, and that is where the focus -- the primary focus of interest has been. We see interest by both traditional SPX users, but also retail users, and we believe although -- we don't get granularity down to the customer level, but we believe that there is significant transition of users from the Spider option to the SPX Weekly contract. You may recall that when we brought up the Weekly contract, we put it on our hybrid trading system, giving retail clients a more point-and-click experience, which is designed to accommodate the more retail type users as opposed to the institutional users who benefit tremendously by our open outcry mechanism, which we use in our traditional SPX product. So tremendous interest by both retail and, to a slightly lesser extent, institutional. Most of the institutional business remains in the main SPX product, but we see the SPX Weeklys continuing to grow. And quite frankly, the Weeklys product has been a phenomena, not only within the SPX product but across all of our option classes. And there's tremendous interest in playing that last week of expiration. So again, very, very happy about what we have seen and believe that a significant component of that is coming out of the Spider option.","Operator","The next question is from Niamh Alexander of KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","If I could move on to kind of more the future growth opportunity in kind of one of the smaller products now. But it's with regards to Dodd-Frank and the FLEX options and kind of clearing, are you starting to see more conversations pick up or any activity there or maybe total return swaps or what's your role there? What's changing really because we know how you're set up, but are you seeing any activity?","Edward T. Tilly","So the first thing we see really is the exchange look-alike contract picking up interest. It's difficult to measure quite frankly what we don't know. So the increase in SPX volume would not be a stretch to think the most exchange look-alike OTC moving to list it. That makes perfect sense. But when you start talking about a swap market, our first attempt in moving what has been traded OTC swap is the Variance contract. So very, very recent launch. Some -- I think from our perspective, interesting trades being printed. But from our perspective, that's the first time that we've gone in and actively marketed to what is traditionally been an OTC swap trade, standardizing that for our CFE and seeing some futures prints based on that new methodology. So that's really going to be our focus. It is in the realized volatility space. And of course, as I started -- mindful of attracting exchange look-alike business to our listed markets, whether they're traditionally negotiated SPX or, as Ed points out, a point-and-click weekly, a point-and-click SPXpm or, of course, we have ultimately the ability to customize trades by using our all-electronic FLEX mechanism. So we're out there, but our first real push is in realized volatility and our variance relaunch.","Operator","The next question is from Gaston Ceron of Morningstar Equity.","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I just want to shift gears just very quickly, and I missed some of the opening remarks, so I don't know if this was covered, but can you talk a little bit about the market data line? And kind of how you see that evolving in the future?","Edward T. Tilly","Sure, Gaston. The main component of market data fees is the revenue that we receive from OPRA, the Options Price Reporting Authority. That's driven by transactional market share, and that's the main driver. But there's other components in there. We're always looking for information that we own, that we can sell ourselves, whether it has to do with VIX and our futures exchange or other data that we can create and sell. So -- and we've been seeing a lot of growth in the other category. OPRA does a great job in maintaining fees, remaining competitive and selling that product, that information around the world, and we'll always continue to rely on that. But I think the other component has had, I know the other components have had a better growth rate in the past 2 years than the market data revenue from OPRA. So I hope that helps, Gaston.","Operator","Next is Ken Leon of S&P Capital IQ.","Kenneth M. Leon - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","I like Richard's proposal for a name, but I'll give another one, the Chicago Board of Index Exchange. I wanted to go back -- either refresh my memory to kind of look at the interplay of -- with the changes in the incentive program criteria and trading volume incentive costs, they're down 50% for the first 6 months of the year, so as I think of equities or even ETF. Help me out.","Edward T. Tilly","So we did -- we had a change that we put in place on January 1. It was a small change in our VIP credit. And simultaneously, a competitor was aggressive in their VIP pricing with the credits that they pay for customers in multi-list products. So we responded on February 1 by matching them on the multi-list side on VIP credits. Then on March 1, in the complex trade area, we adjusted our pricing to be more competitive there. And those credits are the -- it's the driver of our decline in revenue per contract. And within -- you could take a look at the fee schedule on our website. But basically, what happened is these credits were changed in a way so that when a market participant reached a certain threshold, they would not only receive the credit for customer contracts going forward above that level, that threshold level, but all the way to contract 1. And that was an aggressive change, and so that was the main driver. And Debbie Koopman is pointing out to me, Ken, that you wanted -- maybe I'm hitting the wrong one. You wanted to know about trading volume incentives rather than fees?","Kenneth M. Leon - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Yes. The cost item is trading volume incentives. And I just wanted to see if that's having any bearing on equities and whether it was just onetime episode or something about trend.","Edward T. Tilly","Okay, so trading. I'm sorry. My answer was really good just for the record. So trading volume incentives. That's the fees that we pay primarily to other exchanges and for routing when an option order and a multi-list option comes to CBOE. And we have to route it away because either we aren't the best market or we don't have the depth to satisfy the order. So we have to route it away, and we have to pay fees, not only route -- broker-dealer fees, but exchange fees to do that. And that item over time, that line item, has been going down as we have been billing more of that expense back to market participants over time; we felt that we could and still maintain our market share. So the trading volumes incentive used to be a lot larger a couple of years ago; it's down this year. We'll work to bring it down, but right now, I'm not anticipating any significant change going forward.","Operator","Next is Sameer Murukutla quick of Macquarie.","Sameer Murukutla - Macquarie Research","Just a quick note -- a quick follow-up on the VIX futures regarding the extension of the trading hours. Can you quantify how much demand you're expecting to see with the 45-minute extension in the first phase and the early 2:00 a.m. start during the second phase? I guess what percentage of customers have been asking for the additional trading times?","Edward T. Tilly","So the first phase, the runoff in the afternoon, there's been demand and it's primarily domestic demand. There are a lot of ETN users, there's a lot -- there's some imbalance at the end of the day. That's going to satisfy that first tranche. But that demand has been around for quite some time. When we look at the early -- extending to 2:00 a.m., I think what we're using to project is, as you may or may not know, we currently open 1.5 hours before the U.S. markets. So the extension going beyond to 2:00 a.m. is really to attract more of those users, and to give you a reference, that pre-open session currently runs between 5% and 7% of our average daily volume. It's been 5% to 7% of the entire runup in the terrific trajectory we've had, so we've maintained that interest. So it's that group that we're going after. We think also watching the success of the Globex pre-open sessions, it's that European user looking for exposure in the U.S. markets -- not just linear exposure, but really the global ability to hedge volatility. And it's that user we're going after. So that's the 2:00 a.m. answer.","Operator","Next, we have a follow-up from Niamh Alexander of KBW.","Niamh Alexander - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Sorry if I've missed this earlier. But on your tax rate, Alan, it came in a little lower this quarter and then you kind of stuck to your guidance for the rest of the year. So should we assume it's going to be -- it's going to have to be above the 40% or so levels in the second half? And what were the discrete items that kind of lowered it this quarter?","Alan J. Dean","Yes, good question, Niamh. Yes, so we -- I said in my prepared remarks that we expect the tax rate to be at the lower end of our guidance for the year. So that would imply a higher tax rate later on. We had some special credits and deductions in the first half of the year that allowed us to realize a lower effective tax rate on the federal side. It wasn't state-driven. R&D credit is an example of what we saw earlier this year. So yes, we -- taxes are inherently difficult to predict with certainty, but that's the way we see it, lower end of our guidance. Those tax credits, the deductions that we realized in the first half of the year were discrete. So...","Operator","Next is a follow-up from Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just a quick question. When you do launch the interest rate volatility products, where will they clear? Will it be OCC or someplace else?","Edward T. Tilly","They'll clear OCC, Rich. We'll trade them here, the futures on CFE. And if we're able to launch options, they'll be on CBOE, we hope, and they'll clear at OCC. And there's still -- we're always working with CFTC, SEC on the various futures versus securities designation for some of these options, but clearing OCC.","Operator","We do have a follow-up from Ken Hill of Barclays.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","[indiscernible] on that last question there, so with the 10-year product, I was kind of wondering if you see much overlap for that with your current customer base? And maybe how you might go about some of the education efforts around it as you launch those products?","Edward T. Tilly","The education is key, as you know. We'll be actually trying to attract some new users, and if we get some volatility returning into that interest rate market, I think we'll be able to hit the street in a whole new way. Now that said, there are volatility traders who will be looking across asset class, as there are today. And we have emerging market volatility. We have S&P 500 volatility. We have metals volatility. So we are trying to build a base of pure volatility traders, but the first users will certainly be in the interest rate complex.","Operator","I am showing no more questions in the queue and would like to turn the conference back to Ms. Debbie Koopman.","Deborah Koopman","Thank you.

Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to report that CBOE Holdings posted solid earnings in the second quarter, despite the low volume, low volatility trading environment that persisted through the industry for most of the quarter.","I\u2019m also pleased to note, that as volatility began to spike and trading activity picked up towards the quarter\u2019s end and into July, CBOE was well positioned to benefit most notably in our premium index products.","Let\u2019s take a look at a few of the volume bright spots. Second quarter average daily volume and S&P 500 index, SPX options trading, while down sequentially, rose 5% from 2014 second quarter and is up 6% year-to-date through July 29.","As expected, we saw a significant average daily volume increase in Russell 2000 Index, RUT options which began trading exclusively at CBOE in April. We\u2019ve seen volume increase each month since CBOE became the home of RUT options and in July RUT posted its strongest month of the year. We are confident we will further grow our RUT marketplace going forward.","As the exclusive home of RUT options, CBOE not only provides the product with a concentrated pool of liquidity, we\u2019re also able to leverage our position as the go to place for all things related to index options and to connect with new and existing RUT customers worldwide.","RUT options are now prominently featured across a range of CBOE educational channels, including the Options Institute, CBOE\u2019s Risk Management Conferences, RMC, and the Options Hub, our highly popular social media platform.","CBOE also saw stronger VIX trading. VIX options average daily volume rose 22% from the previous quarter. The trend within the quarter was also positive, with month-over-month increases that continued into July, which is on track for another monthly sequential increase of 15%.","VIX futures average daily volume rose 11% over the second quarter 2014 and is up 12% in July compared to June. Average daily volume in VIX options and futures for July is on track to be at its highest monthly levels since last October.","Recent volatility spikes notwithstanding, we remain in a low-vol regime, with the VIX Index still hovering well below historical levels. Still, we remain guardedly optimistic about VIX trading in the second half of the year, given the return of large traders to the market, a maturing U.S. bull market, and impending U.S. interest rate hikes.","Regardless of volume trends and the ebb and flow of VIX, our strategy is straightforward. We will continue to execute our core growth initiatives to increase index and volatility trading at CBOE, domestically and abroad, through our unique ability to create, collaborate, and connect with the marketplace.","Overseas investors continue to embrace SPX and VIX options for efficient exposure to the U.S. equity market and global volatility, and we continue to make it more convenient for them to access those products.","Last year, we implemented near 24-hour trading in VIX futures. VIX futures volume during non-U.S. trading hours held steady at a little over 8% in the second quarter. As the Greek debt crisis escalated in the second week of July, however, the overnight session accounted for as much as 13% of VIX volume, which averaged nearly 300,000 contracts per day for the week.","In March 2015, we implemented an additional six-hour trading session in VIX and SPX options beginning at 2:00 a.m. Chicago time to align with the open of trading in London and the close in Asia. As expected, volume in extended trading hours in both SPX and VIX options has been a gradual, steady build with the exception of July, when volume in VIX options, like VIX futures, rose dramatically in the face of heightened global volatility.","Product innovation is a cornerstone of our growth strategy. We were thrilled last week to launch Weekly VIX futures and look forward to rolling out the options on October 8. VIX Weeklys are a natural extension and complement to the standard VIX futures and options, offering investors more opportunities to trade VIX.","VIX Weeklys also respond to customers who tell us they\u2019re looking for volatility exposures that more precisely track our benchmark VIX Index. The closer VIX futures and options are to expiration, the closer they track the VIX Index. By filling in the gaps between monthly expirations, Weeklys offer investors short-term protection, as well as the ability to fine-tune the timing of their trades.","We received significant customer demand to list VIX Weeklys futures and early feedbacks from both the buy-and sell-side has been positive. We are encouraged that we\u2019ve seen some volume from day one. We expect Weeklys futures volume to continue to gradually build as we roll out additional expirations and launch VIX Weeklys options.","In other product development news, on August 3, we will be unveiling 10 new CBOE option strategy benchmarks that highlight the long-term utility of options as risk management and yield enhancing investment tools. Two of the benchmarks will use popular SPX Weekly options to create new versions of our flagship S&P 500 CBOE Index BXM and PutWrite, PUT Indexes. The other indexes highlight completely new systematic hedging and risk-managed option selling strategies featuring SPX and VIX options.","Our new options-based strategies are aimed at providing fund managers, investment advisors, institutional investors and others with tangible measures of how options, particularly CBOE\u2019s proprietary options can be used creatively to improve risk-adjusted returns within an investment portfolio.","Education and product development go hand in hand at CBOE, and CBOE\u2019s Options Institute continues to grow and pave the way for greater understanding of our evolving products and marketplace. We were particularly excited therefore to announce plans for the first extension of the Options Institute in collaboration with the Singapore Exchange, SGX, which is expected to launch in the fourth quarter of this year.","CBOE\u2019s world-renowned Options Institute conducts nearly 400 educational events per year, including classroom training at our state-of-the-art facility, webcasts and off-site seminars. A wide range of offerings and course levels allow us to connect with customers across a range of touchpoints as their educational and trading needs evolve and grow.","The CBOE Options Institute at SGX will leverage CBOE\u2019s options expertise and the Options Institute brand name with SGX\u2019s position as the gateway to the region\u2019s financial markets as we look to respond to the tremendous interest we see for our products in Asia.","The CBOE SGX collaboration enables us to quickly and efficiently ramp up to meet the growing demand for options education in the region. Instructors at SGX will be trained by veteran instructors from the Options Institute at CBOE. The Institute\u2019s trademarked content highlights CBOE products and will be translated into Mandarin by SGX.","The Options Institute at SGX marks the second CBOE educational initiative planned for Asia in 2015. As previously announced, we\u2019re expecting -- we\u2019re expanding CBOE\u2019s Risk Management Conference, RMC, beyond the U.S. and Europe with the first RMC in Asia later this year.","RMC, which attracts sophisticated and influential market participants who tend to be early adopters of new CBOE products and services, will make its Asia debut in Hong Kong, November 30 to December 1.","I\u2019ll wrap up here by commending the entire CBOE team for maintaining a disciplined and consistent approach to executing our strategic growth initiatives throughout the second quarter and beyond, regardless of macro trading conditions. A companywide commitment to our strategy for long-term growth positioned CBOE to benefit optimally when market conditions changed, as they did most notably in June and July.","We are pleased to begin the third quarter with that positive momentum and we\u2019re very enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead to further increase index and volatility trading at CBOE.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan.","Alan Dean","Thanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with an overview of our results for the quarter. CBOE turned in a solid performance for the second quarter, achieving top line and bottom line growth both year-over-year and sequentially.","We were particularly pleased to see stronger trading volume throughout the quarter and into July in our VIX Index options, despite the continuation of lackluster trading in multiply listed options industry-wide.","Operating revenue came in at $148.7 million, 3% above last year's second quarter. Operating income was $73.4 million, representing an operating margin of 49.3%, up 90 basis points compared with 48.4% in the second quarter of 2014.","Net income allocated to common stockholders was $44.6 million, up 5% versus the second quarter of 2014, resulted -- resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.54, an increase of 8% compared with $0.50 per share for the same period last year.","We had no non-GAAP adjustments for the second quarter of 2015 or 2014, so the financial results discussed for the quarter are on a GAAP basis.","Now, I\u2019ll review our results in more detail, starting with operating revenue. As shown on this chart, the increase in operating revenue primarily reflects increases in transaction fees and other revenue, offset somewhat by decreases in access fees and regulatory fees.","Transaction fees increased $3.7 million, or 4%, compared with the second quarter of 2014 resulting from a 14% increase in the average revenue per contract or RPC, partially offset by a 9% decrease in trading volume versus last year's second quarter. While total trading volume in our options products was down 10%, the volume in our highest margin futures contracts increased 10% over last year\u2019s second quarter.","Furthermore, looking at options trading volume by product category, our higher margin index options outperformed the lowest-margin, multiply-listed options. Trading volume in equity options decreased by 15%, options on exchange-traded products fell by 12% and index options declined by 2% year-over-year, but increased 7% compared with the first quarter.","Offsetting the volume decline, our blended RPC, including options and futures, increased to $0.368 from $0.322 in last year's second quarter. The increase in RPC primarily reflects the net impact of a higher RPC generated across each product category, as well as a shift in the mix of trading volume towards our higher-margin, proprietary products.","The RPC in our options business increased to $0.308 compared with $0.275 in the second quarter of 2014, reflecting RPC increases of 18% for equity options, 5% for options on exchange-traded products and 4% for index options, primarily resulting from fee adjustments made this year and lower volume discounts and incentives.","Revenue per contract at CFE, our futures exchange, increased 7% to nearly $1.76 from $1.64 in last year's second quarter, as a result of fee changes implemented in January and a change in the mix of market participants.","With respect to the shift in the volume mix, our highest margin index options and futures contracts accounted for 37.2% of total trading volume in the second quarter, up from 33.9% in the same period last year.","As a result of the shift in the volume mix and higher RPC, transaction fees generated from our proprietary products represented a higher percentage of our total transaction fees year-over-year and sequentially.","In the second quarter, index options and futures contracts accounted for 82.4% of our transaction fees, up from 80.9% in the second quarter of 2014 and 81.3% in the first quarter of this year, largely driven by the higher contribution from our futures business.","Looking at some of the other factors influencing operating revenue, other revenue increased by $3.8 million, primarily due to higher regulatory fines assessed to trading permit holders for disciplinary actions. This revenue will be used to offset regulatory expenses. In addition, access fees declined by $1.4 million, reflecting a decrease in trading permits.","Regulatory fees decreased $1.1 million, which is primarily attributed to lower rates for our options regulatory fee compared to the second quarter of 2014 and the elimination of regulatory fees related to CBSX, our stock exchange which ceased trading in 2014.","Turning to expenses, this next slide details total operating expenses of $75.3 million for the quarter, an increase of $1.1 million, or 2%, compared with last year's second quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter reflect higher costs for professional fees and outside services, royalty fees, and depreciation and amortization, offset somewhat by lower costs for compensation and benefits.","Core operating expenses were $46.7 million, a decrease of $1.8 million or 4%, compared with the second quarter of 2014. This decline primarily reflects a decrease of $6.2 million in compensation and benefits, partially offset by an increase of $4.7 million in professional fees and outside services.","The decline in compensation and benefits largely reflects lower expenses related to salaries, stock-based compensation, and the provision for incentive compensation. The increase in professional fees and outside services, as well as the decrease in salaries, is primarily attributed to our outsourcing of certain regulatory services to FINRA, which occurred in December of 2014.","As we told you on our last earnings call, during the second quarter we took steps to cut or delay certain expenses and capital projects in response to sluggish trading volumes. At the same time, we noted that we\u2019d look to unwind certain cost reductions following a sustained improvement in volumes. Given the improvement we have seen in our VIX index options and futures volume, along with the continued strong volume in SPX options, we plan to gradually reverse some of the cost cuts in the coming months.","We have -- we always viewed the cost cutting measures as short -- as a short-term solution to a short-term problem and we\u2019re pleased that volume has returned to a level that we\u2019re comfortable dialing up certain expenses and projects in a disciplined manner.","Taking this into account, we still expect our core expenses for the year to be in the range of $190 million to $194 million; however, I expect to be at the high end of this range for the full-year.","Looking at volume based-expenses, royalty fees increased by $2.1 million, or 14%, primarily due to a shift in the mix of licensed products traded, which resulted in a higher average royalty rate per licensed contract for the quarter.","Previously, we told you that we expected the royalty rate per licensed contract to be $0.15 starting in the second quarter. The rate per contract came in higher, at $0.163, reflecting the shift in mix I referenced earlier, which we saw in the first quarter as well. Looking forward, I\u2019d expect the rate per licensed contract to stay at this level, barring any significant shift in the mix of products traded.","Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $90 million, compared to $138 million at the end of March and $148 million at the end of December. The decrease in cash compared to March primarily reflects tax payments made during the quarter.","Our business continues to generate a significant amount of cash. Through June, we generated net cash flows from operating activities of nearly $106 million versus $121 million in the same period last year.","Capital expenditures through the first half of the year were just under $18 million. I look for capital spending to pick up somewhat in the back half of the year, so we\u2019re reaffirming our guidance for capital expenditures of $37 million to $40 million for the full-year, which includes the development of our new trading platform, CBOE Vector.","Through the first half of this year, we\u2019ve used more than $35 million to pay dividends and nearly $82 million to repurchase our stock. At June 30, 2015, we had approximately $111 million of availability remaining under our existing share repurchase authorizations, which includes an additional $100 million authorized by our Board back in May. Our Board has authorized $500 million to use for share buybacks since the inception of our program in 2011.","Further underscoring our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, we were pleased to announce that the Board increased our quarterly dividend rate by 10% to $0.23 per share from $0.21 per share, effective with the third quarter dividend payment. This increase is our fifth consecutive since we instituted a dividend payment in September of 2010. Since that time, our compounded average growth rate for our quarterly dividend has been 18%.","So let me conclude by saying that we\u2019re very optimistic about the growth opportunities we see going forward. As we begin the second half of the year, we\u2019ve good momentum in our business and remain in a strong financial position. We will continue to make the necessary investments to position CBOE for long-term growth while prudently managing our use of cash in the near-term.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Debbie.","Deborah Koopman","Thanks, Alan. At this point, we\u2019d be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue, if time permits we'll take a second question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Q - Rich Repetto","Good morning, Ed. Good morning, Alan.","Alan Dean","Hi, Rich.","Edward Tilly","Good morning, Rich.","Rich Repetto","So you\u2019ve mentioned in the prepared remarks the rebound in VIX options and futures and especially in July. And you\u2019ve mentioned also the return of -- I thought you said something like big volume users, but with my one question I wanted to ask, can you give us any more color or explanation or insight on who these people are or what -- is it simply just a higher level of VIX volatility in general, is there something else that\u2019s attracting them and how sustainable is it, if we see volatility move up and down towards the year-end?","Edward Tilly","Sure, Rich. Great question and a couple of answers there. We have returned to a more normal shape of the volatility curve. What that means is it upward sloping. So front month about 13, sloping up to about 18, which is the historic level of volatility, so we\u2019ve that term structure play in place, much of what we\u2019ve enjoyed in the growth of VIX options has returned. That\u2019s the biggest VIX option story. Along with that, we talked in the first quarter, hey, what happened to the big trader? The big traders use the most efficient tool for tail risk hedging is pure VIX play, VIX options with the greatest leverage. That was very expensive, if you remember, with the high vol of vol and high option prices in VIX in the first quarter. VIX vol of vol has returned to its closure, to its historic level. So we\u2019ve got a tail risk hedge back in play. We\u2019ve got a term structure strategy back in play and so it\u2019s a sustainable sure. Remember, VIX is using real prices to hedge a portfolio the S&P 500. Our traders tell us by looking over the term structure that is looking month in, month out over the calendar, that they expect while front month is low, roughly 13 out six months it returns to historic level. So that is a structure that our users are used to from a term structure play. And then our tail risk hedgers can find great coverage in that tail risk hedge as vol of vol has returned to its more normal levers -- leverage. As for futures, the futures growth has another -- a different driver. So the range in futures which in the first quarter was relatively flat, if you remember, we\u2019ve had a range from about 12 and then through the risk of Greek default up to about 18. So that range and trade from a futures traders perspective provided great opportunity, so we saw the day trader or the more active futures traders taking advantage of that move from 12 to 18 back to 16, up to 18 and now back to 13. So there has been a lot of activity from the more active futures trader as well as the market makers who are hedging a greater daily volume of options trade. So we benefit again from the options volume increasing in our futures is that\u2019s the go to -- first go to hedge for our options market makers, we\u2019re managing their portfolio pure VIX options. So lot of moving parts. Is it sustainable? Yes. Can we tell you its going to be exactly like that for the next couple of months? No, but this is a more normal vol environment upwards sloping over time and we expect and it would be -- not be surprised if those strategies that are in play, in July and June continue going forward. Long answer to a simple question, Rich. Sorry about that.","Rich Repetto","No, no. That\u2019s good, because it\u2019s very important when you\u2019re looking at the CBOE. But I did want to congratulate you on the Blackhawks NHL Stanley Cup Championship, but I did hear the NHL is investigating, them using soft pucks.","Edward Tilly","Yes, we deflated the pucks, Rich.","Rich Repetto","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just on the VIX Weekly, can you just remind us maybe why the short-term VIX product didn\u2019t seem to succeed as maybe we had hoped and why the VIX Weekly wont suffer a similar fate?","Edward Tilly","This is a really simple story from our users perspective. We knew that there was demand and there remains -- is demand each day for a shorter term contract for volatility. When we rolled out the volatility in VXXT that is an implied volatility over a nine-day period. That is different than what we\u2019ve thought and what our users are used to in applied volatility contract for 30-day. The new Weekly, which is already traded more futures in its first five days than the VXXT did in two months, so is the utility and the easy adoption of the early short-term users in futures contracts to satisfy their needs for the short-term. The other difference as the -- we added more expiries as the -- as we come closer to expiration, VIX futures track more closely Spot VIX. So that is more utility for those users who are trying to track closer to the cash VIX level, we\u2019ve given them 52 opportunities now throughout the year, that tracking becomes much tighter. VXXT didn\u2019t track that number at all. Obviously, it was a nine-day implied volatility number. So there is great buzz around the early days of VIX Weekly futures trading and they\u2019re now announcing the October 8, we think we can get the buzz of the options traders around a short-term contract that answers their needs as well.","Ken Worthington","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, all.","Edward Tilly","Good morning.","Deborah Koopman","Good morning.","Christian Bolu","So thanks for the thoughts -- earlier thoughts on kind of VIXs volumes and why that\u2019s rebounded. But just maybe a longer term question, given all that you\u2019ve seen over the last seven months, how does it inform your thoughts around relative maturity of the VIX product?","Edward Tilly","The last couple of months didn\u2019t change our opinion on the maturity at all. What it taught us was the different utility and how different users choose their hedges. And what we learned I think was the most exciting that we learned in the first quarter in a depressed VIX option volume was the utility back into our SPX complex. So if you remember first quarter across the industry was not our best quarter -- was not the industry\u2019s best quarter. But what stood out was the utility of going back into SPX, and that volume was one of the few contracts that actually showed an increase in the first quarter, we were up roughly 1%. So we\u2019re learning much about the VIX complex, its utility and how it behaves in different market environments. I think what is interesting and we made our announcement today on new benchmarks. With that mind there\u2019s been terrific buzz around capturing vol risk premiums and one of our new contracts or benchmarks that we announced STGV which is a premium capture strategy with controlled downside risk. First quarter that would have been really interesting. And so our research guys went out and found a benchmark that allows and is designed to capture the risk premium fond over the VIX structure. So we\u2019re learning, we\u2019re teaching our users how to use our contracts in different environment. So maturity hasn\u2019t changed, and they are scared to talk about how the business development efforts, how are educational process and collaboration with SGX can continue telling our story globally and domestically.","Alan Dean","Thanks, Ed. Yes, as Ed mentioned and this was referred to in Ed\u2019s preliminary remarks. We continue our vast educational efforts with respect to our proprietary products with heavy focus and both VIXs futures and VIX options. We will be engaged in Asia in two forms in this year both our new RMC in Hong Kong at the end of November and again the collaboration we have with SGX where there is a significant interest by investors in knowing and understanding how to use index options and volatility product. So we look forward to that. We will be in Geneva, Switzerland next month and we have seen every bit of strong interest by participants in learning about our products in particular. Don\u2019t see again, just reflect what Ed said, any advancement in the life cycle of this product. We still see tremendous growth in front of it, and some of the lower volume that we saw earlier in the year really was market conditions driven and not a question of the growing maturity of the product.","Edward Tilly","Yes, I think I like to follow-up on part of the, in the answer I gave earlier is, we know and as far as maturity, we have much to do in short-term exposure and demands around volatility trading. VXX the most successful ETN, trades roughly 40% of its volume in non-standard expiry meaning short-term or Weeklys. We\u2019ve just unveiled our first contract on the future side. I think there\u2019s a great opportunity for us to educate and that to the need for short-term vol exposure when we launch October 8 Weekly contract. New users, new teaching opportunity for us enables to broaden the user base. And again continuing to expand on our extended trading hours were really early stages of VIX options in extended trading hours. So there\u2019s plenty of opportunity there as well.","Christian Bolu","Great. Thank you for all that color.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Edward Tilly","Good morning, Alex.","Alex Blostein","Quick question for you guys on expenses. So not a huge change obviously in the guidance staying within the range, but just kind of curious to hear which project specifically are you planning to kind of bring back on line now that the revenue environment got a little bit better and then maybe also talk a little bit about the ability to roll those back to just kind of how stick those expenses could be if the VIX levels remain kind of like in the 12% to 13% -- the 12% to 13% level zone? Thanks.","Alan Dean","Yes, good question Alex. The line items that we impacted in our expense reductions when we reduced guidance and it included compensation of benefits. So we did things like incentive compensation that\u2019s obvious, hiring freeze, over time that\u2019s in comp and benefits and travel [ph] promotion we look at advertising, various business development projects, travel, also professional fees and outside services primarily contract services. All things that as I said in my prepared remarks, things that we could temporarily delay or reduce and then reinstate later as when volume comes back. So now that we\u2019re seeing volume come back, it will be primarily compensation and benefits that will represent the increase the moving through that range in our guidance. And I think we\u2019re pretty good at dialing back expenses when we need to in response to volume but we did it this year, we did it last year. So those options remain open to us if something bad happen on the revenue side where we had to respond, we would.","Alex Blostein","Got you. Thanks.","Alan Dean","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys, just a question on the CRPC. Just given that it was part of the strength of the quarter, and I understand the mix, the products. But if I look at the multi-listed products, it seems like even there the RPC has been coming in better than expected, no market share, maybe there\u2019s some offset there. But I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on the pricing versus market share dynamic in the competitive space. Because it just seems like the RPC is definitely higher over the, maybe last 8 to 12 quarters, market share is down. But I just wanted to see how you guys think that plays out in terms of profitability and how you guys are positioned.","Alan Dean","Yes, Michael. We implemented a number of fee changes so far this year; the first set came in January 1. We did another -- few more changes on June 1 and they were all aimed at -- it had two objectives, showing up our multi-list market share and maximizing our revenue and it worked really well. We saw increasing as you said our increasing revenue per contract across the board when you compare year-over-year and sequentially in equity options we saw a nice increase there. And at the same time we most recently saw increasing multi list revenue really maximizing going to a level that we\u2019re very pleased with and it\u2019s driven by those gains and revenue per contract. The outlook, will it hold, will at RPC hold? In the short-term I\u2019d say probably, yes. The question is for how long? I don\u2019t expect competitors to react, they always have. And my long-term view really hasn\u2019t changed. I expect a steady to slow decline of revenue per contract in the multi-list side, I expect it to level off, the decline in level off at some point. On the product side, I would expect steady pricing for options with some upside opportunity for futures. But we would always rather see increasing revenue come from expanding user base, therefore volume and not price. So we\u2019re very tentative, deliberate what we do on our product pricing in terms of -- and how we approach our customers. So to sum up, changes that we made, we\u2019re successful optimizing or maximizing our revenue on our multi-list side. We\u2019re happy with our market share and on the product side, happy with the gains that we\u2019ve seen there as well.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I\u2019m going to use my question on capital. So just looking at the balance sheet as Alan mentioned, the cash fell to just below $9 million in June. And I appreciate the color on the tax payments made during the quarter, but you also returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders I think above all is generated from operations. And then, if we look at back, in the past I think you\u2019ve said $40 million to $60 million was a good level of operating cash. So I guess my question is, is that $40 million to $60 million still good level to think about and then also what is your appetite to go below the current cash level of $90 million or should we think that you\u2019re wanting to see that level build back up from here? Thanks.","Alan Dean","Good question. No, my view hasn\u2019t changed. In the past you\u2019re right, I have said $40 million to $60 million and that most recently expanded, it maybe some $40 million to $70 million, just give myself a little wiggle room on that. The wondering thing about exchanges in CBOE in particular is we generate lots of cash month in, month out and -- so that\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t concern me to drop down to a level even $50 million or $60 million. So, we have no intentions of building our cash balances back up. Our policy, the board\u2019s policy is the same now as it was last year and the year before which is we don\u2019t want to hang on to shareholder money. First, we\u2019re going to reinvest in our business to ensure our future growth. We want to regular increases with our dividends that match the growth in our business. You saw us do that again yesterday. And then we want to return any excess cash to shareholders, preferably through stock repurchases but we\u2019re not ruling anything out. We could be special dividends we\u2019ve done that in the past. It could be a variable dividend, we\u2019ve never done that. But nothing is off the table, that\u2019s my point. And the consistency is, don\u2019t hang on to shareholder cash.","Kyle Voigt","Thanks, Alan.","Alan Dean","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Hi. Good morning, folks.","Edward Tilly","Good morning.","Deborah Koopman","Good morning.","Brian Bedell","Alan, a question for you on the other revenue run rate; the extra revenue captured for the financial disciplinary actions. First, is there any offsetting expense against that in the quarter and then what would you think of that as a normal run rate for the other revenue line. And then Ed, I just want to ask about the growth potential for the Russell and the MSCI contracts and your view on that.","Alan Dean","Okay, I\u2019ll tackle the other revenue question. Starting with the backend, no I don\u2019t -- the increase of in other revenue for the quarter is an aberration, it was fine, it was significant fine. And so the run rate you have to factor out that that increase quarter-over-quarter to come to our annual run rate. Now where are the expenses for that? They\u2019re in the $190 million to $194 million that I\u2019m guiding you to on core expenses, they\u2019re in there. Now are they all there this quarter? No, some of them happened in the first quarter, second quarter. Some will happen third quarter, fourth quarter. It\u2019s in the $190 million to $194 million. Sometimes the revenue as it was this quarter related to our regulatory responsibilities is a bit choppy, we saw that this quarter, and while the expenses are much more predictable. And so the -- when we said, when I said in my prepared remarks and I think was might have been even in the press release that this revenue can only be used to offset regulatory expenses. That\u2019s true but it may -- it may not happen -- it didn\u2019t happen this quarter, some of it happened last quarter and some of it will happen next quarter. So, I\u2019m sorry for the confusion if that wasn\u2019t clear on what I said.","Brian Bedell","That\u2019s okay. So, was it, say around $1 million in expenses offsetting this quarter or\u2026","Alan Dean","So I\u2019ll be even more granular. We have a regulatory process, surveillance market, regulation and financial compliance, all the things that we are charged to do as an SRO we do, and the expense related to that -- its rather predictable and it happens at a regular level, month in, month out. We offset those expenses with regulatory revenue, we see regulatory fees. We have that line item there, and combined with fines. So, the fines we can't use to underwrite some other part of our business, that the SEC doesn\u2019t want us to do that, so we don\u2019t. So, I can't say of the $3.8 million increase quarter-over-quarter while a $1 million of expense happened in the quarter, that\u2019s just not the case its -- the regulatory function is a continuous process.","Brian Bedell","Okay. That\u2019s fair.","Edward Tilly","And Brian, the second part of the question I\u2019ll start with, we have just two terrific partners with the Russell suite with FTSE now and with MSCI, and its two different stories. Obviously with the well established contract with the Russell, the story there in the opportunity is really our pledge to our partners that while making this exclusive April 1, the idea for CBOE and for LSE was not say, hey CBOE go see if you can capture that business that\u2019s at another exchange and we\u2019ll call it a day. It\u2019s quite the opportunity. We have let and told the industry that we are the go to place for all things index trading. Russell is no different. With the concentrated liquidity pool, experts in trading and pricing cash settled index product, we\u2019ve ended the debate I think with July at the most busy month of the year for Russell trading in whether or not multi-list has any impact on overall trading volumes. The concentration of liquidity and the specialist of liquidity pool being able to price index options is far more important than a multi-list argument. And so, our job now is a concentrated effort on new users for Russell, and that looking forward to launching the FTSE 100 options and other FTSE products later this year. So there is a terrific opportunity for us with a concentrated business development effort now and promoting the Russell at every one of CBOEs outward customer facing opportunities including RMC. MSCI a different story obviously. Very successful ETF contract. We\u2019ve taken some steps to bolster what we\u2019re offering on the cash settle product. We\u2019ve added the front three months to better meet the institutional customer demands, but we\u2019ve got more work to do on the MSCI than clearly we do on Russell. What both contracts share however is the same argument that we\u2019ve made for years in existing spider or ETF users when they look and we tell them the benefits of trading the cash settled, large notional European style exercise contract. So we\u2019ll be doing the same with MSCI, with the successful for example EEM, ETF and we\u2019ll be doing the same with IWM users in Russell, the same story we\u2019ve told with spider users and moving them to SPX. So there\u2019s a great opportunity and that\u2019s the business development effort with the FTSE, Russell and MSCI.","Brian Bedell","Okay. That\u2019s great color. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris","Thanks. Hi, guys.","Edward Tilly","Good morning.","Christopher Harris","So a follow-up question on the VIX. We know that volumes over the short-term here have been moving around with volatility in the shape of the curve and viability of certain trade. So we\u2019ve kind of addressed a lot of that. I really just wanted to get your guys thoughts on the growth of new users you\u2019re seeing entering VIX or trading VIX, and whether you can comment on if that\u2019s accelerating, if that\u2019s sort of stagnant? Do you have any data you could share on that would be really great?","Edward Tilly","I might take the first look, new users are difficult. What we tend to see is how the contract is being users, and I think my VIX futures reference is pretty aligned with what we\u2019ve said in the past that we attract users, new, existing, different utility when mark and the future side, when we see a range in that futures price. So again that moved to 12 to 18, not only attracts existing users and not only do those higher frequency traders trade more, other futures traders who are looking in the high frequency range, looking for a higher volatility futures contract that VIX story is very compelling. I was able to join our business development team in London just a couple of months ago. And when we mentioned VIX futures and we bring up VIX futures charts and we look at volume, that\u2019s a really exciting story for those higher frequency future shops and we know that there\u2019s a great opportunity going forward. As for the business development effort and the utility of VIX and VIX options I think I\u2019ll let Ed, make a couple of comments on what we\u2019re hearing from the option side.","Edward Provost","Yes. Thanks for the question Chris, and going back to Ed\u2019s comments, we have some degree of difficulty going all the way down to the customer and in identifying specific clients. But we spent a lot of time talking to customers both those that are currently using the products and those who are prospective users. And in particular international efforts have shown an increasing interest in the product. We put this product out there as the proxy for global market volatility and indeed it is followed internationally whether or not people trade it. It is increasingly recognized as the barometer for global market volatility and we see an increased interest in end user base internationally. Indeed that is part of our efforts with respect to the SGX initiative and that\u2019s why we\u2019ll be featuring this highly at our Hong Kong RMC. So again, very much an international story, not to say that we\u2019ve fully grasped all of our potential users domestically because we continue to promote the product to institutional users, both the active type such as hedge funds and some of the lesser active types like pensions and endowments and things like that. So we see plenty of upside in the potential for this product among all user types.","Christopher Harris","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And as there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to turn the call back over to management to make closing comments.","Deborah Koopman","Thank you. That completes our call this morning. We appreciate everyone's participation today and your interest in CBOE.

[Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.","I'd now would like to turn over the conference to Debbie Koopman. Ms. Koopman, please go ahead.","Deborah Koopman","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss the quarter and our strategic initiatives for 2017. Then Alan Dean, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will detail our second quarter financial results and provide updated guidance on certain financial metrics for 2017, and Brian Schell, our Deputy CFO, will provide an update on the capital management front. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A will be our President and COO, Chris Concannon; and our Chief Strategy Officer, John Deters.","In addition, I'd like to point out that this presentation will include the use of several slides. We'll be showing the slide and providing commentary on each. A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","During our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements, which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold and while we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a full discussion of the factors that may affect our forward-looking statements. We will undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after this conference call.","During the course of the call this morning, we will be referencing non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. We will also refer to non-GAAP adjusted combined results, which are also reconciled in our earnings materials. As you know, we completed our acquisition of Bats Global Markets on February 28, 2017. The combined results present information regarding the combined operations, as if the Bats acquisition had closed at the beginning of 2016, in order to provide a supplemental discussion of our results.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Tilly.","Ed Tilly","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin today, I would like to acknowledge the passing of our friend and colleague, Magnus B\u00f6cker. Several of us at CBOE had the pleasure to come to know Magnus while laying the groundwork for an educational partnership with SGX. We are personally saddened and, on behalf of CBOE, I wish to extend our condolences to his family, to our friends at SGX, and others throughout the industry who mourn his loss.","Moving on now to our quarterly results; I am pleased to report on a strong quarter 2017 at CBOE Holdings, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.87, a net revenue of $267 million, led by continued growth in our proprietary index products.","Our overall options volume during the second quarter was up 15% over the previous year, and our proprietary products continue to outperform the industry. We established an all-time record quarter in VIX trading, which increased 19% over the second quarter last year.","Our index options volume increased 9%, reflecting the third highest quarter for VIX options trading and continued growth in SPX options volume. We continue to see strong trading in our proprietary products in July, led by VIX options, which had their busiest month this year. We have grown accustomed to increased VIX trading amidst spikes and volatility. We were obviously seeing that low volatility environments create trading opportunities as well.","While VIX-linked ETPs remain key to the VIX ecosystem, we believe the most recent increases in volume can be attributed to a growing group of users trading VIX futures directly, rather than using VIX ETPs. We are also seeing VIX options trade in greater size and users continuing to find utility trading VIX futures and options, regardless of the VIX index level.","In other business lines, global FX volume was up 8% in the second quarter, and our market share stood at 12.9% at the end of June, compared to 11.5% a year ago. We saw second quarter market share in both U.S. and European equities decrease against the prior year's second quarter, due to this year's continued low volatility. Our Bats ETF marketplace however, continues to thrive and grow.","Our growing market share in ETF listings demonstrates our ability to offer meaningful benefits for issuing firms and deep liquidity to market participants. We are now home to over 221 ETFs, 89 of which were added this year. Of those, 30 are BlackRock iShares funds, which transferred from a competing marketplace earlier this week.","Year-to-date, we have won 39% of all new ETF listings, our highest-ever percentage, including some of the largest ETF launches this year. Five of this year's top 10 new ETFs in terms of assets under management are listed on Bats. We also listed -- we also listed our first exchange-traded notes this past quarter. With the addition of new funds from some of the industry's most influential firms, including Franklin Templeton, Janus, UBS and Principal, and new opportunities to leverage our global presence and CBOE brand, we expect our listings business to gain even more momentum.","We took an exciting step toward further expanding our growing product line this week by entering into an agreement with Gemini Trust Company that provides CBOE with a multiyear exclusive global license to use Gemini's market data, including Gemini bitcoin auction values, to create bitcoin derivatives products. We are working closely with the CFTC and, subject to regulatory review, we intend to offer trading and cash-settled bitcoin futures on CFE in the fourth quarter of 2017 or early 2018.","CBOE will also retain exclusive rights to use Gemini market data for the creation of new indexes, as well as the rights to distribute Gemini market data over CBOE's market data feed.","As you know, Gemini previously selected Bats Global Markets to list their proposed bitcoin exchange traded fund. We cannot be more pleased to build on that partnership by leveraging CBOE's experience in product innovation and cutting-edge asset classes to develop and trade bitcoin futures. The collaboration with Gemini is an example of the strong potential for innovation we see in marrying ETP issuer relationships, ideas and capabilities with CBOE's deep product development expertise. We look forward to responding to the growing interest in crypto currencies through potential bitcoin futures traded on the regulated derivatives exchange, with the many expected benefits this brings, including transparency, price discovery, liquidity and centralized clearing.","Moving on now to our integration with Bats. As mentioned in our last call, the combination of the two companies provides the opportunity to cross-sell additional products and services to an expanded customer base. We continue to focus on our core index business and target the OTC space with quality listed products, while extending our global reach to promote an expanded product line.","I'm pleased to announce we will be opening a satellite Hong Kong APAC office in the third quarter while continuing to leverage our presence in London and Singapore. Our coordinated efforts across multiple locations in the U.S. and abroad enable our equities, derivatives and FX sales teams to interact more frequently and efficiency, with a greater expanded base of buy-side and sell-side clients. Our extended reach enables us to build closer, more collaborative relationships with local brokerage firms and indexers and accelerates our ability to cross-promote our products to a much broader audience.","We are preparing for our sixth Annual CBOE Risk Management Conference Europe which, runs from September 11 through 13. This will be our first RMC Europe held near London and the first to feature team members who now represent new lines of CBOE business, including FX products and European equities. RMC typically attracts sophisticated traders who are early adopters of our new products. We very much look forward to sharing our expanded offering with many of our most influential customers.","As you know, the migration of our trading technology onto Bats' proven platform underpins the scale and efficiency we expect to gain from the CBOE-Bats combination. We remain laser-focused on working with customers to help ensure a seamless technical and operational integration.","Last quarter, we held the second in a series of customer conference calls on the migration of CBOE's exchanges onto the Bats technology platform. On that call, we announced that we expect to complete the C2 options exchange on May 14, 2018, which follows the previously announced migration of CBOE's futures exchange to the Bats platform planned for February 25, 2018. We expect to announce the date for CBOE's migration in the coming quarters as we continue to work on requirements for the hybrid floor and electronic system.","We are also implementing a new index technology platform that will serve as the foundation for our growing index business and enables us to better calculate and disseminate data for new and existing indices. Completion of the new index platform is expected in the first half of 2018, and we will announce a full rollout schedule in upcoming technology integration customer calls.","Turning to our European equities business and the progress we've made toward addressing the challenges and opportunities inherent in MiFID II. Bats Europe is nearing completion of its technical and operational readiness, having successfully implemented a strategic plan that allows ample time for customers to test our systems and prepare for MiFID II. Last month, we successfully completed our third and most significant software release of the year, which included all of the real-time exchange functionality needed for MiFID II compliance. Our final software release is scheduled for October.","Importantly, we also see MiFID II as an opportunity to provide value-added products and services to help customers navigate the changing regulatory environment. These include our Large In Scale, periodic auctions and expanded buy-side trade reporting services. The new volume caps coming under MiFID II will limit trading in dark venues, causing investors to seek new places to trade with minimal market impact. Our Large In Scale and periodic auctions offerings are designed to enable investors to find liquidity and trace large quantities of stock without the associated market impact.","We continue to see rapid uptake in trading on our Large In Scale service, a block trading platform launched last December with BIDs, a block trading leader in the U.S. More than 86% buy-side customers are now connected, and we continue to see increased trading on the new platform. The trading experience on the periodic auctions offerings, lit book operating auctions throughout the day, allows market participants to trade in increased size without significant reactive market movements. We believe we will see strong traction in our periodic auctions offering as we near MiFID II commencement.","Last quarter, we expanded our Europe trade reporting, BXTR, the largest equity trade reporting facility in Europe to enable buy-side firms to meet their trade reporting obligations under MiFID II by allowing their brokers to submit trade reports using their existing connectivity to Bats Europe.","Turning now to our U.S. equities and our Bats market close proposal. We continue to receive questions on this initiative, so I'll take a moment here for an update. Bats market close is a near end-of-day match process for non-Bats listed securities that we created in response to customer demand. It would provide a means to secure primary market closing print prices without disrupting the primary market closing auctions that take place at the end of the U.S. equities trading day.","On July 6, the SEC extended the Bats market close review period another 45 days, making August 20 its next action date. At that time, the SEC may either approve or institute a proceeding disapproval, which would give them another 180 days to act. We remain strongly committed to the customer benefits of this initiative, which are highlighted in our response letter to the SEC earlier this week, and we will continue to advocate for its approval.","In closing, I would like to thank the CBOE team for a great second quarter, our first full quarter as a combined company with Bats. It is a credit to the talent and professionalism of the entire team that we continue to systematically hit our internal integration milestones while delivering strong results in our core business lines and positioning the company for future success through the consistent execution of our strategic growth initiatives. I am excited about the opportunity that lies ahead for this team to leverage our expanded product line and extended global reach to continue to grow CBOE and reward our shareholders for years to come.","With that, I thank you for your time. I will now turn it over to Alan.","Alan Dean","Thank you, Ed, and good morning. Before I begin, let me point out that our GAAP and our reported second quarter 2017 results include Bats for the entire quarter this year but not for the comparable 2016 period. Therefore, the year-over-year variances on the GAAP basis were largely due to the addition of Bats on March 1. To provide an additional review of our business, my remarks will focus on our non-GAAP adjusted combined results, which present financial results to reflect the Bats transaction as if it had occurred on January 1, 2016.","On that basis, for the combined company, we saw strong results for the second quarter, primarily driven by the continued strength of our proprietary index products and growth in non-transaction revenue against the backdrop of subdued market volatility and essentially flat U.S. equities and options trading activity quarter-over-quarter. Summarizing our adjusted combined results, net revenue was $266.9 million, up 5% above last year's second quarter. Operating expenses were $101.3 million, down 5%, and the operating margin increased 410 basis points versus last year's second quarter to 62%. Diluted earnings per share of $0.87 was up 16% over the prior year period.","Looking at our results further, starting with net revenue. Our revenue growth was primarily fueled by increases in transaction fees, market data fees and exchange services and other fees. Turning to the revenue contribution by business segment, you can see that we achieved higher revenue across each business segment, with futures contributing the largest increase. We also benefited from the diversity of our revenue streams, with growth in non-transaction revenue and U.S. equities offsetting the shortfall in net transaction fees in that business. I'll get into this in more detail when I review each business segment.","In our options segment, adjusted combined net revenue of $126.7 million was up $2.1 million or 2% compared with the second quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenue from net transaction fees, exchange services and other fees and market data fees, offset somewhat by an increase in royalty fees and a decrease in access fees. Net transaction fees for options were up $3.7 million in the second quarter, with higher revenue from index options, offset somewhat by a decline in multiply-listed options. Transaction fees from our higher RPC index options were $80.7 million, up $4.8 million or 6%. This increase reflects a 9% increase in average daily volume over last year's second quarter, led by average daily volume increases of 9% in SPX options and 15% in VIX options, offset somewhat by a 1% decrease in index RPC, primarily due to a mix shift.","The increase in options market data fees was primarily due to gains in our share of U.S. options transactions this quarter as compared to last year's second quarter. Total market share for CBOE Holdings was 42.2% for the second quarter of 2017, up from 38.7% in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting market share gains across each of our options exchanges on a both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter comparison.","Moving to futures. Our fastest-growing and highest RPC business segment posted record trading volume and average daily volume in the second quarter. CFE traded an average of 307,000 contracts per day for the quarter, fueling net revenue of $36.2 million, a 20% increase compared with the same quarter one year ago. This increase resulted from higher net transaction fees, driven by 19% year-over-year increase in futures average daily volume and a 5% increase in RPC.","Futures RPC for the quarter was $1.76, compared with a $1.68 in last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of fee changes implemented in January of this year. Looking at CBOE's organic growth from options and futures, excluding the Bats revenue contribution, you can see that we had strong organic growth of 5%, driven the strength of our proprietary products, particularly VIX futures and index options. On a combined basis, proprietary products accounted for 65.4% of net transaction fees in the second quarter of 2017, compared to 62.2% in the second quarter of 2016.","Turning to U.S. equities. Net revenue was up 3%, primarily driven by increases in non-transaction revenue, offset somewhat by lower net transaction fees. Our results reflect a 5% decline in market volumes and a 1.2 percentage point decrease in market share, offset somewhat by a 5% increase in net capture.","We witnessed a continuation of low volatility during the second quarter, wherein generally, overall equities volumes declined as a higher percentage of shares are traded off-exchange. However, strong non-transaction revenue more than offset the shortfall in net transaction fees, with solid growth in exchange services and other fees and market data fees.","Conversely, market volumes for European equities were up 4% in the second quarter. In U.S. dollars European equities reported net revenue of $18.5 million, an increase of 3% versus last year's second quarter despite the weaker pound. In local currency, net revenue actually grew 16% to GBP 14.5 million in the second quarter of 2017 from GBP 12.5 million in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting growth in both net transaction fees and non-transaction revenue.","The increase in net transaction fees resulted from the increase in overall market average daily notional value and a 7% increase in net revenue capture. For the second quarter of 2017, Bats retained its position as the largest European stock exchange, with 21.3% market share.","Net revenues for Global FX rose 21% to $10.9 million in the second quarter of 2017. This increase was due to access fees implemented in the third quarter of 2016. In addition, market share increased from 11.5% in last year's second quarter to 12.9%, tying an all-time high also reached in the first quarter of this year.","During the second quarter of 2017, nearly $28 billion of average daily notional value traded on the Hotspot FX platform, up 8% from nearly $26 billion in last year's second quarter.","Turning to expenses, this next slide details total adjusted combined operating expenses of $101.3 million for the quarter, down $5.7 million or 5% compared with last year's second quarter. Looking at the expenses in detail, the favorable variances are mainly in professional fees and outside services and depreciation and amortization. The decrease in professional fees and outside services reflects the realization of synergies, which resulted in lower expenses for legal services, consulting fees, audit fees and other corporate overhead. The decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily resulted from the acceleration of certain systems depreciation and amortization in 2016.","For the second quarter, we realized $7.1 million in pretax -- $7.1 million pretax in expense synergies, primarily seen in compensation of benefits and professional fees and outside services. We continue to make solid progress executing on our integration plans. And as we noted on our last call, the realization of synergies is ahead of plan, and we expect to end 2017 with $20 million in GAAP run rate synergies and to achieve the $50 million run rate in year 3. We look forward to updating you as we make further progress in the integration process.","Turning to guidance. Looking at our expense guidance for the full year 2017, we now expect to be at the low end of our guidance range of $415 million to $423 million. Adjusted combined operating expenses in the third and fourth quarters are expected to increase somewhat compared to the second quarter, reflecting merit increases and higher cost for professional fees and outside services, driven in part by expected fees for the consolidated audit trail, CAT, to be incurred in the third and fourth quarters.","Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the second quarter was 36.2%, within our guidance range of 35% to 37% we provided on our last call. Looking ahead, as a result of the corporate income tax law changes enacted in Illinois in early July, we now expect our effective tax rate on adjusted combined earnings for the full year to be in a range of 35.5% to 37.5%, resulting in an effective tax rate in the third and fourth quarters closer to the high end of our range. This guidance excludes a onetime charge we expect to take in the third quarter to remeasure our deferred tax positions as well as other non-GAAP adjustments. The effective tax rate on GAAP earnings is expected to be in the range of 37% to 39% for the year.","In addition, we are reaffirming our guidance for depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures for the year, which projects increased CapEx spending in the back half of the year.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Brian to provide an update on our capital management.","Brian Schell","Thanks, Alan. We continue to take a balanced approach to our capital management that we believe results in long-term shareholder value. As such, our capital allocation priorities have not changed. We plan to invest in the growth of our business, return capital through dividends and utilize excess cash to pay down our five year term loan as quickly as possible. Consistent with that philosophy, last week our board declared a dividend for the third quarter and raised the third quarter dividend by 8% to $0.27 per share from $0.25 per share. Our quarterly results once again generated strong cash flows, which enabled us to reduce our debt by an additional $75 million and still end the quarter with adjusted cash and investments of $149 million.","During the quarter, we also completed an offering of $300 million of two year 1.95% senior notes. All of the net proceeds were used to pay down a portion of the five year term loan. This transaction resulted in a compression of our interest rate spread and, by converting a portion of our debt from floating rate to fixed rate, reduced our interest rate exposure to possible future interest rate hikes.","Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio based on trailing 12 months adjusted combined EBITDA at quarter end was 2.1x, which is down from 2.4x at the end of the first quarter. And while we don't have a specific leverage ratio target we are currently managing to, we will look to reduce our debt to enhance our balance sheet flexibility. While we did not make any share repurchases in the second quarter, we may allocate capital to make opportunistic share repurchases in the future, depending on the circumstances.","To summarize, during the second quarter, we built on the strong momentum we experienced in the first quarter and continued to demonstrate the strength of our proprietary index products, generating strong organic growth; diversifying and stabilizing our revenue streams with increased mix of non-transaction revenues; disciplined expense management; leveraging the scale of our business model, producing higher profitability margins; an integration plan on track with a strong cost synergy realization; and finally, ongoing focus on capital allocation by reducing debt and increasing our quarterly dividend.","Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making and are excited about the strength of our core business. We are committed to maintaining our focus on expense discipline and driving enhanced returns for our shareholders.","With that, we thank you for your time this morning. We'll turn it back to Debbie for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Deborah Koopman","Thank you, Brian. At this point, we'd be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Please feel free to get back in the queue, and if time permits, we will take a second question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Rich Repetto","Yeah, good morning. First, I'd thank you for the mention of Magnus, he was a true exchange guy. So anyway, my question would be to get to Alan on expenses. So a couple of things on the expenses. If you look at the low end, if you see what you did in the first half, it implies we can see back into what it implies to the second half. The 2Q run rate is already well below that. And I know you talked about some expenses incrementally coming on. But the question would be, with the synergies, why wouldn't the synergies offset these incremental expenses? And am I interpreting the synergies, like the $7.1 million in 2Q, if -- theoretically, if nothing changed, wouldn't you realize another $7.1 million in 3Q and $7.1 million in 4Q, or is that not the way you calculate it?","Alan Dean","Yes Rich. That is the way we would calculate it, and if nothing changed, there would be another $7 million in Q3 and Q4. We did modify our expense guidance for 2017, guiding to the lower end of the range. And that does imply increased expenses for the third and fourth quarter, and that's the way we currently see it.","I hope that we come in below that. But right now, what we think is achievable is that the lower end of that range, Rich. You can't count your chickens until they're hatched, and so we have work to do, and I think another part of your question was you implied that there might be further synergies happening later in the year, and yes, that's true, but the bulk of the synergies happened early on. Ed Tilly and Chris Concannon worked hard to give us a strong start out-of-the-box on the realization of synergies, and so when February 28 came around, we closed the transaction. Lot of things were ready to be implemented, and we did it. And the low hanging fruit, things like audit fees and board fees and insurance, those were realized relatively quickly as well.","So to summarize, Rich, we do see the possibility that expenses will rise in the third and fourth quarter, and that's why we maintain that guidance range of $415 million to $423 million, but we're guiding towards the bottom end of that range.","Rich Repetto","Okay. You stuck to your conservative knitting, Alan. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. Maybe just a question on -- it seems like you guys have a lot going on across each of the different businesses, some of the new initiatives with bitcoin. Just wanted to try to gauge, like, over the next year or two, where are you seeing the best growth opportunities for the combined entity? I think, we all focus on the synergies and progress there, but more on the revenue side, where are you seeing the potential?","Ed Tilly","Michael, great question. It's one that we focus on, probably the first question our board asks us at every quarterly meeting. They too see the opportunities to execute on the revenue synergies that we laid out, gosh, almost a year ago. But really the opportunity we continue to focus on here, is growing the index complex, really leading with this incredible uptake in volatility trading, even in a low environment. So VIX futures and options, and then the growing appeal and the flexibility that our retail customers are seeing in a Monday, Wednesday, Friday SPX complex.","So the opportunities are to take those core index products and use the broadened and expanded business development lines, that is really leveraging the U.S. team here and really looking to Mark Hemsley, who runs the European operation, getting his team up to speed on education.","I think I mentioned last quarter, that we were sending our own options institute instructors over to Mark's team in order to really get them up to speed, inform -- a much, much more informed lead generation, so that we can grow this product not just domestically, but globally.","So that remains the focus. This will continue to be an index story, I think, proved out in both high and historically -- incredibly historically low volatility. So that's the core. But you did bring up a good mention of our interesting release yesterday. I want to turn it over to Chris and maybe John Deters. Just a little bit of overview, while we're sticking to the core, we're still looking to the future to build new opportunities that we'll be able to tell you stories in the coming quarters. So John and Chris, if you could maybe kind of give an overview of the relationship with Gemini, and then, Chris, maybe how we see the opportunity to roll out products after the initial relationship begins.","John Deters","Thanks Ed. Thanks, Michael. So this is John Deters. Just some quick perspective on the relationship with Gemini. It really represents coming together of two partners who are well positioned to serve the needs of the cryptocurrency market. And I think Ed just touched on it in the prepared remarks, but the partnership really came to life as a result of the CBOE-Bats combination. CBOE, on our end, we were exploring opportunities in the cryptocurrency space but looking for the right entry point. And the Gemini team really had built a good, solid infrastructure that we could leverage for derivatives products. So we're excited about the opportunity. I'd say that, while the cryptocurrency market is nascent, we really, together with our partner, have an opportunity to play a central role in the market. And Chris, if you want to say a word, too, about the cadence of new products and the opportunities set there, broadly?","Chris Concannon","Sure. Thanks, John. Real quick, we are excited about the relationship with Gemini. This is a relationship that goes back to a listing relationship with the Gemini ETF product that is currently before the SEC. And obviously, we're seeing more bitcoin and cryptocurrency products that want to come to the market. The largest issue with bitcoin and cryptocurrency is storage and effectiveness of storage and really, when you think about it, this futures product, which is still pending regulatory approval, has an opportunity to touch a broader set of investors and clients because it does solve the storage issue. Ultimately, it's a regulated futures market that is underpinned by a commodity that's been recognized by regulators around the planet.","So we're excited about the relationship. We're excited about the opportunity to move further into the ETP space of cryptocurrency. We think this future does create opportunities in that space as well. And one thing I'll note, just following up on Ed's comments about revenue opportunity, and you've seen it in the numbers, our non-transaction revenue growth looks to continue. It's an area that we're very focused on in all of our asset classes, whether it's equities in Europe or FX across the globe. So we're excited about the opportunities around non-transaction revenue, given the footprint that this combined company has today.","Michael Carrier","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Yeah, hey good morning. Ed, I want to come back to the comments you make about the index business being still the area of most focus. Clearly, when you look at the VIX volumes in particular in the second quarter and so far this quarter, it's one of the few areas in exchange trading that you should be excited about given the volume trends. So I hear you in terms of people are finding ways to trade in low and high volatility environment. But I think there's also this view out there that some people have that everybody's betting on volatility to be low forever. And at some point, it's going to come to haunt us, and it's going to look ugly in the future. So when I think back to the beginning of 2015, the curve was inverted. Volumes were down. I mean, what's the risk that we go back to a pretty soft environment here and this is just a short-term sake as volatility is still low?","Ed Tilly","I think if we look at all of the opportunities and how people are employing this, I think you're right. I think in the last six to nine months, we've seen our users change the way that they view and are able to harvest premium, and our products are almost directly benefiting that change in opinion. And again, if I remind you what volatility our VIX contract is actually measuring, it's the market's perception of risk. And the spot VIX is a 30-day measure of that perception of risk. So the contract itself is just a direct reflection of where people view their risk over the next 30 days. And, of course, the term structure is look at their perception risk over time.","And to your point, that has been flat in the past. That has been in contango and, on occasion, goes in to backwardation. Now the opportunities as soft [land], I'm not quite sure where you're going with that. Our existing customers are, in fact, finding the utility in a low volatility environment, employing different strategies. The fact that everyone piling into a short model strategy was probably more the norm in the first quarter. We see people now getting out of spreads that allow them to leverage those positions and taking outright positions, whether it's all-in short, as the trend has been. But we see now the interest in long ETP exposure in a more binary effect like -- I've given up on this short model, can't get lower. I'm flipping my -- use the analogy of my old floor days, I'm flipping my trading card over, and I'm taking an outright-long position on volatility.","There are too many things uncertain in the world. You can pick up the paper, debt ceiling looming, North Korean missile tests in the future. And what that impact and my perception of risk over time is reflected, I think, in the activity we see going from all-in short, to now taking outright long positions. So not atypical to what we've seen in the past. There are changing perceptions of risk, and that's been reflected in our marketplace.","Chris Concannon","And Alex, it's Chris. I'll just add, it's not all about volatility. We're seeing a great growth in our SPX complex, as Ed mentioned. Part of that is driven by what we're seeing as broad adoption of option-based strategies in managed funds, in robo-advisors, in ETPs and among insurance and pension funds. So that broad adoption of strong option based strategies that are not related to volatility but are related to other basic strategies. As you can see, the SPX volumes are growing year-over-year and grew quarter-over-quarter. So I think we're in early innings in the broad adoption of option-based strategies.","Ed Tilly","Let me just punch the point, Alex, and what we've observed, and it was a big one for us, we saw a million contract VIX options trade, which is really taking a position, using the leverage of an options contract, taking in premium, I should add, that really takes a position mark that I don't think we're going to stay in this low volatility environment. And on a way back to a normalized volatility, all the way up to a 35 level, this is an incredible payout for someone who's completely taken a different position on vol and expected risk in the future. So we're seeing much bigger positions from existing and much more activity from new customers. So I'll leave you with those thoughts.","Alex Kramm","Great color. Thank you very much.","Ed Tilly","Thanks Alex.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. Maybe a question for Chris. On CBOE's closing option proposal, can you talk about the support you're getting from different groups of investors and traders? And maybe give us some anecdotes that you find interesting, both from the supporting side and from -- maybe from some detractors. And given this is a pretty radical proposal, is the support you're getting sort of enough to improve the odds if this actually makes it through the SEC? Thanks.","Ed Tilly","Hold on. Debbie, can you get ready for the mute button? If Chris starts giving anecdotes, we've got to be careful.","Chris Concannon","Ken, I appreciate that question. Look, we have great support from the industry, SIFMA wrote a great letter. We're seeing additional support. I know some of the distractors were able to get form letters in from some issuers. But really, it comes down to what is the -- what is our legal right to have an offering that is largely already offered by the other exchanges. So we found it ironic that both New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ were so unsupportive of our proposal, when they both offer competitive closing proctors on each other's closing listed stocks. So our biggest point is one of fairness. If they can compete, why can't we compete with them?","And that's an important point for the SEC to consider. I'm not going to speculate on what the outcome is, because it is before the SEC and pending regulatory approval, but we feel pretty optimistic about the opportunity that we have with the SEC and our arguments that we just filed just the other day. So I feel good, don't have any anecdotal things I can share with you right now but happy to talk in the future.","Ken Worthington","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citigroup.","Ben Herbert","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I would like to get your perspective on MiFID II and progress there, but also specific to the systematic internalizer provision and what you think that might mean for exchange volumes.","Chris Concannon","Great question. First, we were able to put in place a fully MiFID II-compliant work on our platform in Europe, with a huge lift by the team in Europe, successfully implemented just a few weeks ago. There will probably be one more cleanup release before the end of the year, but that most recent release allows our clients to begin to be MiFID II-compliant way before the deadline in January of 2018.","So it was an important release for us, and it was an important lift. And -- so we feel like we are way in advance of MiFID II, have our systems ready and up and running. With regard to the impact of MiFID II, it's still hard to predict. MiFID II is certainly not favorable for internalizers and dark pools. It's -- certainly the principle of MiFID II is to support the lit market and push more volume into the lit market. I think there's -- there are -- there is an opportunity for us to play a role with systematic internalizers that are permitted under MiFID II. We continue to explore different ways and means for us to support systematic internalizers.","Today, we support them regularly. We allow systematic internalizers to quote into the public quote through our system. We also provide a trade reporting and clearing mechanism for systematic internalizers. So we think with the robust offering that we have today and the network of clients that we have connected to our platform in Europe that we have an opportunity under MiFID II, not only as a traditional exchange market but also as a supporting role to all market participants, post the effective day in January.","Ben Herbert","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi. Good morning. I just want to get an update on leverage and capital deployment. You continue to delever nicely just above 2X on a gross debt-to-EBITDA basis, and you've made really solid progress on the synergies already after such a short period of time. Just given the fact that a couple of exchange assets are for sale right now, I'm just wondering, as we head in to the end of the year here, what are your thoughts on M&A at this point? And where would you potentially be comfortable flexing the leverage to if the right deal came to the table?","Ed Tilly","Brian, why don't you give a little background on the philosophy? And I can get into maybe the broader view on M&A and just how we've accomplished this over the last couple quarters.","Brian Schell","Sure. Kyle, the -- as all capital management and capital allocation decisions, we review this pretty regularly with our board. Looking at our current situation, our cash flows, our expectations and our historical capital allocation choices. And again, with the ultimate goal of -- as most leadership teams should be, of delivering -- how do we deliver that best long-term shareholder value? And as we've previously stated, as we looked at the leverage and, specifically, our goal and our focus has been to delever, producing obviously lower interest cost.","And more importantly is that balance sheet flexibility that put us -- this combination to come together and be as accretive as it has been to-date. Had there been a highly leveraged CBOE pre-acquisition, it may not have looked the same way. The execution may have gone in the same way, so that discipline and that focus enabled this to come together. So we are looking towards getting back to that without saying, we need to pay x leverage ratio to get back to. So again, it's the flexibility and the capacity that will get us there, and if there's an outcome of things positive that come along the way, whether it's lower cost ratings upgrade, that's not our goal. Again, the goal is to get to the best position.","Alan Dean","Yes. This is Alan, Kyle. I'll add that the philosophy of our board, the objective of our board hasn't changed, don't hang on to shareholder cash. And we're going to find ways to get those monies back to shareholders, and we've demonstrated that in the past, and we will in the future as well.","Ed Tilly","So with that as the background, the way we view M&A and you've referenced some properties that perhaps could be out there. Wouldn't expect us or this board to have any targets that are very, very large scale acquisitions. But we're typical to the activity that we were employing pre-Bats. We're looking to grow this core business, period. And if that means we can build tools that make that easier for our customers to either find and interact with our proprietary complex, if there are tools that Bryan Harkins needs on the equity side or Mark Hemsley sees an opportunity in Europe, we will chase them down. We'll look either to build or buy.","And if it makes more sense for us to go out and make smaller bolt-on acquisitions that further this strategy, we'll do it. But right now, we are deep in integration and migration of this platform to deliver what we set out to deliver to our shareholders last September. So again, think smaller bolt-on. If we think it's quicker to market for us and more effective, we'll build otherwise, but nothing planned large scale at the moment.","Kyle Voigt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Great, thanks. On your success in ETF listings, I believe one of the benefits of that is the potential to drive a larger share of trading in those ETFs. And so just wondering if you guys are actually seeing that. And then as you continue to grow the ETF listings business, any opportunity for developing some corporate listings?","Chris Concannon","Sure, it's Chris Concannon. I'll take that. First, thanks for recognizing the exceptional growth we've had in ETF listings. Obviously, you saw the announcement of iShares moving 30 of their existing products to Bats, which is really just -- they are the leading ETF issuer in the States. And this is further validation of the product offering that we have for ETF listings. And it really is reflective of the power of this combination with CBOE, because the full offering that we were able to provide iShares, from educational products and distribution of content, that's something that only came about through the combination with CBOE. So we're excited about that decision and how it validates our offering. We're also excited about, we have now 221 ETFs listed on our market. We are largely focused on those continued listing of ETFs, that will remain our focus for the foreseeable future.","To answer your question, on the trading side, with each listing and as they grow in AUM, and we did have some record AUM listings, new listings just this year, we are seeing increased trading volume of those ETFs that are primarily listed on Bats. So not only do you get increased market share from 9:30 to 4 when you are the primary market, but you also get the volume in the closing cross in the primary market. So we're seeing both evidence of growing share and larger closing crosses, as these products that we list continue to grow AUM.","Chris Harris","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Great. Hey, good morning everybody. So question just around longer-term outlook for investing and expense for you guys. Clearly, there's a number of growth opportunities you're pursuing on kind of legacy CBOE or legacy Bats, and obviously on a combined basis. How, I guess, should we think about the investing back in the business in this environment? And so sort of think about the kind of the gross expenses over the next couple of years, understanding there are synergies that are going to come out that?","Alan Dean","So, this is Alan, Alex. We are fortunate to be in an industry and a business that doesn't require huge CapEx commitments. It's largely IT, and we -- and the cost of IT equipment over the years has been coming down. So we will reinvest in our business as we need to, to ensure our future growth in the segments. And I -- we will do that. And as far as expenses goes, our goal line expenses is to see increases that mirror or parallel inflationary rates. So 3% to 5% is kind of where we want to be. Of course, that will be net of any future synergies that we still expect that we'll realize some expense reductions in the future. But that's our goal. And I will add that absolutely the biggest investment that CBOE ever made was just in February, the acquisition of Bats, and that turned out pretty good. So really staying the course, conservative on expenses, conservative on CapEx. The CapEx needs are minimal and to ensure future growth. So not much new there, Alex.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Hi, good morning. Chris, can you dig a little bit deeper on the MiFID II opportunity for market data as you see that, and sort of maybe just more broadly, to what extent do you think you can push market data for the combined firm as a percentage of overall revenue, it can be higher longer-term? And then just an update on the timing for the complex order rollout in the second half on options, U.S. options?","Chris Concannon","Sure, first on MiFID II. We do think there's an opportunity for continued growth in market data revenue in Europe. Some of that is driven by MiFID II. But largely, what we have in place today can help us grow market data revenue as well as non-transaction revenue. All the revenue that comes in associated with people connecting to our exchanges and connecting and reading our data. So we're excited about the opportunity. We do run, as Ed mentioned, the largest trade reporting service in all of Europe. That's very valuable information. And with MiFID II and SI quoting requirements, we expect to provide -- continue to provide a facility for systematic internalizers to quote through our platform out to the public. So we think there are opportunities for further market data revenue growth in Europe.","Broadly speaking, non-transaction revenue is a great opportunity for this combined entity. We have so many platforms in so many markets across the planet. We're excited that each one of those has its own unique non-transaction revenue growth opportunity. And we will use a very carefully -- a very targeted growth areas. If we're a growing market like FX, we'll be very careful about non-transaction revenue. If we have a very large footprint in -- whether it's in equities or options, we're excited about the opportunity, both from data as well as access. So hopefully, that answers your question.","Ed Tilly","And then the -- Chris, the October EDGX Complex Order Book.","Chris Concannon","Sorry. Yes, so October 23, we announced this summer that we were rolling out the EDGX Complex Order Book. And as we call it, that's a down payment for the rollout of both our C2 options platform as well as C1. Because both of those markets are going to have a Complex Order Book. It will not be perfectly identical, but the code and the base of the complex order interaction will be very similar across those three markets. So it's a big step. While it doesn't read integration, because it's a new product, it's a big step in the integration process, one that we've -- we're seeing progress quite nicely given that we've announced the re-platforming of CFE in February and then followed by the re-platforming of C2 later in the year.","Brian Bedell","Any early view on pricing there, or to be determined?","Chris Concannon","It's really too early to tell. It is EDGX, so it's one of our smaller markets. So we want to gauge the demand. We want folks to use it, so we'll encourage that behavior, but we have other Complex Order Books that we want to be mindful of, as we enter the market with our new Complex Order Book.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Hey. So a question on your bitcoin futures platform that you're hoping to launch later this year. How do you go about attracting market makers to that product when, presumably, there aren't a ton of correlated assets?","Chris Concannon","Sure, it's Chris. I'll take that. Obviously, we've spent a lot of time talking to our market maker community. And this is a market maker community that crosses across not only equities and options, but foreign exchange. And bitcoin, in their view, is just another instrument in the foreign exchange market. Our market makers are, in fact, active in bitcoin, on the various bitcoin exchanges. So we've talked extensively with our participants on the opportunity in bitcoin and across cryptocurrency, not just bitcoin. So we -- I don't think we need to spend too much time attracting market makers. They're already connected to our platform, and they're already actively trading in the cryptocurrency market.","John Deters","Patrick, I'll add one more point. It's an opportunity for us to just say briefly, a very important aspect of our design is that the Gemini bitcoin auction, which our products would settle to, is an actual traded price of transaction in bitcoin. So market makers have that assurance that there's convergence to a price of tradable bitcoin.","Chris Concannon","And I'll just point out that this is pending regulatory approval. So the date of launches is not determined yet. We are waiting on our regulators to be comfortable with our offering. But we were excited to announce the partnership with Gemini.","Patrick O'Shaughnessy","All right. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Yeah, hey thank you. Just a very quick one for Alan or Brian. You talked a lot about the moving pieces on debt. So can you just give us the expectation for interest expense for the remainder of the year, 3Q, 4Q and into next year, as you're, obviously, doing a lot of things here?","Brian Schell","Yes, so I wouldn't -- I mean, as you model that out, I would just continue to look for -- as we've talked about kind of what are we -- and this goes back to the original kind of capital allocation question and our focus on delevering. So we would continue to, as far as reviewing these decisions with our board, continuing to model that out. We've talked about our prioritization with making sure the business has adequate capital as far as the -- everything we need to fund the business. But we will continue -- expectations are that we continue to focus on delevering. And we see that pace, whether that picks up or changes, again, depends on the opportunities in front of us. And so all along that mix. So we would continue to expect to see a declining interest rate. As far as the aggregate amount roll forward as we continue to delever.","Alan Dean","And Alex, we should benefit from this $300 million note deal that we did at the end of June. There's a nice interest rate pickup there, nice savings that will flow to our shareholders. So that, combined with the deleveraging effort, you need to look at our 2Q interest expense and then factor in those couple of things, and then you'll get to the rest of the year.","Alex Kramm","No, fair enough. I guess I'll do the math myself. It's just you guide on so many different things, and this one you don't guide on, so I figured I'd ask.","Ed Tilly","Why did Alex get two questions, Debbie?","Alex Kramm","I will leave it at that. Thank you.","Deborah Koopman","Two more follow-ups.","Operator","And we have a follow-up also from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Sorry guys. Another Alex follow-up. So just a quick question around pricing. So with the VIX futures, obviously, you had an increase there in the first quarter, RPC holding up still quite nicely, even though volumes are up here. How should we think about pricing power at CFE over time? And I guess, more importantly, how does the evolving mix of clients that you guys alluded to earlier in the call add to the kind of RPC sustainability and potential improvement over time here?","Ed Tilly","Well, let me be specific [ph] that we heard you right, Alex. It was pricing on CFE?","Alex Blostein","Correct.","Alan Dean","Yes. So I'm going to touch on SPX and CFE VIX futures and VIX options. We do have the greatest amount of pricing power in VIX futures. The notional size of that kind of [indiscernible] is large. It's -- there aren't economic equivalents that really match up well to that product, and so the combination notional value and the proprietary nature of the product gives us maximum flexibility on pricing. Now with that being said, we try to be really deliberate and thoughtful in what we do on pricing for that product. We don't want to turn off any new or turn off any existing customers.","We'd rather have a new customer come and start trading VIX futures and then stay there and trade and trade and trade. I'd like to see revenue grow that way rather than have an existing customer leave or a new customer not come at us because of price, so we're really careful about what we do there. On SPX, there's more economic equivalence out there than on VIX futures. You have spiders, you have the futures at the Merc. You have options on the futures at the Merc. You have over-the-counter. So it's a little bit more complex.","But the same strategy holds. So even though we have less pricing power there. Still, our emphasis is on driving revenue through increased customers. VIX options, that contract is one-tenth the size of VIX futures. And so of all of our proprietary products, that's the one we see the most pushback from customers from. And that's probably the product that we have the least amount of pricing power. And in fact, we've given customer accommodations that actually slightly lower our RPC in that product over time. And I would expect that the RPC in that product would -- the chances of that going up are the least of all of our proprietary products.","Ed Tilly","And then the second part of that question really in mix. So if you saw the increase in the first quarter this year in RPC and VIX futures over the previous that was the price adjustments we made in January. And then the difference between Q1 and Q2 in RPC, really is due to the active day trader discount. So you're right, as we see the day trader pick up their volume, we'll see a slight decrease in RPC, but we'll see that bounce quarter-to-quarter just depending on the mix. So right to your point, you're right. You did see that and quarter-over-quarter, it just is the blend between pure customer or day trader -- people taking advantage of the day trader discount.","Alex Blostein","Great. All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And as there are no more questions, I would like to return the call to management for any closing comments.","Deborah Koopman","Thank you. Thank you for your interest in CBOE. I will be available. If anybody has any follow-up questions, feel free to contact me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"4257":["Cboe Global Markets, Inc.

[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I'd now would like to turn over the call over to Debbie Koopman. Ms. Koopman, please go ahead.","Debbie Koopman","Good morning and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Then, Brian Schell, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter 2017 financial results and guidance for certain financial metrics for 2018. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A will be our President and COO, Chris Concannon and our Chief Strategy Officer, John Deters.","In addition, I'd like to point out that this presentation will include the use of several slides. We will be showing the slides and providing commentary on each. A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations portion of our web site.","During our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements, which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold, and while we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a full discussion of the factors that may affect any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after this conference call.","During the course of the call this morning, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. We will also refer to non-GAAP adjusted combined results, which are also reconciled in our earnings materials. As you know, we completed our acquisition of Bats Global Markets on February 28, 2017. The combined results present information regarding the combined operations, as if the Bats acquisition had closed at the beginning of 2016, in order to provide a supplemental discussion of our results and review of our business.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Tilly.","Ed Tilly","Thank you, Debbie, and good morning. I know many of you joined us for our call on Wednesday, thank you, and thank you again for joining us today.","I am pleased to report on a strong fourth quarter 2017 at Cboe Global Markets. As we approach the one year anniversary of our acquisition of Bats Global Markets, I am gratified to report, that we accomplished what we set out to do within the first year. Chiefly, to integrate two great teams, while continuing to serve our customers with superior products and services, and to grow our respective business lines.","A strong fourth quarter capped off a year of tremendous growth, including an increase in total options average daily volume of 11% on a combined company basis, outpacing the 4% gain made by the industry overall. New record trading volume in VIX options and futures, with each increasing 23% over the previous year. An all time high in SPX Weekly's trading, which drove another record year in SPX trading. An 82% increase in ETP listings, bringing our total number to 250 at year's end, with a market share of 12%.","Record trading in our Large in Scale platform, now one of the largest block trading facilities in Europe. Record Cboe FX market share and average daily notional volume, fueled by increased use of our London Matching Engine.","Our ability to deliver superior results across key business lines in 2017, while making great strides in our integration with Bats, positions us to more fully leverage our increased global reach and expanded product line.","Our mission to power potential, to stay ahead of an evolving marketplace is fueled by our commitment to relentless product innovation, leading edge technology and seamless trading solutions. I will take a minute here to look at our recent progress in those three key areas.","Our commitment to drive growth through product innovation, was evidenced by our December 10th launch of Cboe Bitcoin Futures, XBT. The world's first exchange listed regulated bitcoin futures product. We are encouraged by the early trading in XBT futures, which continues to steadily build in an efficient, transparent and orderly marketplace.","At the time of our first XBT settlement auction on January 17, over 124,000 contracts had traded, representing a notional value of over $1.5 billion. Moreover, the successful settlement process worked exactly as designed. The migration of the Cboe exchanges on to Bats proprietary technology is central to our commitment to providing customers with superior trading technology. We expect the migration to maximize our value proposition and to power our company's ongoing growth. Working closely with our customers is key. We held our fourth conference call with customers in December, and their feedback remains positive.","The migration of the Cboe Futures Exchange to Bats technology remains on track for February 25, 2018. We are simultaneously preparing for the migration of C2 options exchange planned for May 14, 2018.","I am pleased to add that we successfully launched our new index platform on January 22nd. The new platform serves as the foundation for our growing index business, and enables us to better calculate and disseminate data for new and existing indices.","We are committed to enhancing the customer's trading experience, through regulatory advocacy, new technologies, and education. We continue to work on behalf of our customers, by vigorously advocating for the SEC's approval of the Cboe Market Close auction, a closing match process for non-Cboe securities. We created CMC as a competitive alternative, and were encouraged by the approval of our proposal by the SEC staff on January 17th. The subsequent appeals by competitors will delay the benefits we believe CMC can deliver to investors in U.S. equity markets, but we continue to work proactively with the SEC on a favorable resolution.","We made inroads recently on behalf of our customers, by seeking and receiving permission from Japan and Hong Kong regulators, to add Cboe Global Markets U.S. Equities to the respective lists of approved exchanges. These designations are expected to increase global access to our growing ETF listing business.","We viewed our preparations for MiFID II as an opportunity to help customers navigate the changing regulatory environment in Europe, with value added products and services. We have already seen an uptick in volume in our new product offerings, that while still a small piece of our overall European business is encouraging, given these are very early days.","It is a credit to our entire team, that were able to deliver superior results throughout the year, while also successfully combining two strong companies into even one greater company. As a result, we are well positioned to continue to execute on our growth initiatives, including growing our proprietary products, expanding our global reach across asset classes, migrating our exchanges to Bats technology, and achieving our acquisition synergy targets.","With that, I will now turn it over to Brian.","Brian Schell","Thanks Ed and good morning to everyone. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone, that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to fourth quarter 2017, as compared to the prior year period and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted combined results, including Bats.","On that basis, our fourth quarter results follow the same general theme you have heard from us throughout 2017, with solid financial results, primarily driven by the continued strength of our proprietary indexed products, against the backdrop of low market volatility, growth in non-transaction revenue, expense discipline coupled with the overachievement of expense synergies, and all of that leading to margin expansion and earnings growth.","Summarizing our combined results for fourth quarter 2017 versus 2016, we continue to grow net revenue, posting a 7% increase in combined net revenue, with increases across each business segment. Our options and futures segment contributed the largest revenue gains, which drove organic growth of 8% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. We had operating expenses relatively flat for the quarter, which combined with our revenue growth, resulted in a 260 basis point improvement in our adjusted operating margin, a 90 basis point lift in our adjusted EBITDA margin.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.87, up 12% and lastly, given the tax reform legislation path in December, we revalued our deferred tax liability, and recorded a onetime tax benefit of approximately $192 million or $1.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, which is included in our non-GAAP adjustments. More to come later on the impact of tax reforms.","The press release we issued this morning in our slide deck, provide the key operating metrics on volume and revenue capture for each of our segments, as well as an overview of our key revenue variances.","At this point, I'd like to highlight some of the key drivers influencing our performance in each segment. In our Options segment, the 3% increase in net revenue was driven by higher net transaction fees, offset somewhat by lower regulatory fees, and an increase in royalty payments. The increase in royalties was due to higher volume in our licensed index products, as well as a mix shift between index products traded. Decline in regulatory fees primarily reflects lower regulatory costs. However this month, we lowered our options regulatory fee and expect 2018's regulatory revenue to be about 12% to 13% below 2017's full year net regulatory revenue of $32 million. However, given that revenues from regulatory fees must be used for regulatory costs, this should have no impact on our bottom line in 2018.","As Ed noted, we remain focused on growing our proprietary products, as we did in 2017, with the delivery of record volume in both SPX and VIX options. In 2018, we plan to continue to focus our efforts on growing our proprietary index products, with ongoing education, business development and various incentive programs, such as those aimed at large, over-the-counter trades and retail volumes. While the incentive programs, may put some pressure on RPC, we expect the overall impact to be net positive.","Turning to futures; we had another record year with growth in both contract volume and RPC. With the latter reflecting a modification to our day trade feed program, which had a favorable impact on RPC for the fourth quarter, and the entire year. For 2018, we continue to be optimistic about a successful technology migration later this month, which we believe will have a positive impact on trading, as we provide CFE market participants with enhanced trading tools and a better trading experience.","Turning to U.S. equities, net revenue was up slightly, driven by growth in non-transaction revenue, partially offset by lower net transaction fees. The continued low volatility levels in 4Q 2017 produced lower overall equity volumes and a higher percentage of volume traded off exchange. As this slide shows, our SIP market data revenue was flat year-over-year for the quarter and full year, Proprietary Market data accounting for nearly all of the market data revenue gain. Our Proprietary Market data revenue saw a growth of 39% in the quarter and 24% for the year, with approximately a fourth of each coming from new customers or additional sales to existing customers, and the remainder from pricing changes. While we expect continued growth in proprietary market data in 2018, we also expect to see additional downward pressure on SIP revenue, due to industry consolidation and potential of continued off exchange trading.","Net revenue for European equities increased 17% on a U.S. dollar basis, reflecting growth in net transaction fees and non-transaction revenue, as well as benefitting from the strength of the pound sterling versus the dollar. On a local currency basis, net revenue increased 10%.","As Ed noted, our focus for European equities has been to be ready, day one, with a full suite of products and services that addresses the new requirements of MiFID II. We look forward to building on the early success we are experiencing under this new regulatory regime.","Net revenue for global FX showed steady progress this year, and the fourth quarter marked a high point for the year in both market share and average daily notional volume traded on the Cboe FX platform. Much of the growth was driven by the increased volumes on our London Matching Engine and better overall fill rates. We plan to focus our efforts on continuing to grow the core spot FX offering, while also diversifying our revenues with new products, and expanding our market data offering.","Turning to expenses; total adjusted operating expenses of $105 million for the quarter were relatively flat compared with the prior year, and in line with our guidance. Looking at the key expense variances, the increase in compensation and benefits reflects higher incentive based compensation, aligned with our financial and operational performance. The decline in professional fees and outside services, primarily reflects the realization of synergies.","For the fourth quarter and full year 2017, we realized $7.5 million and $24.6 million in pre-tax expense synergies respectively, primarily from compensation and benefits and professional fees and outside services. We ended 2017 with approximately $33 million in GAAP run rate synergies.","For 2018, we are forecasting incremental run-rate expense synergies of $17 million or a total of $50 million. Most of the expense synergy relative to 2017 is expected to come from IT related expenses. And while the projected 2018 run rate is equivalent to the run rate we originally expected for 2019, reflecting an earlier realization of expense savings than planned, it is still too early to revise our long term synergy forecast. Keep in mind, the projected run rate expense synergies for our technology migration are heavily weighted toward our largest and most complex exchange, C1.","As stated on previous calls, we plan to provide further guidance on a target date for the C1 technology migration, after we complete the CFE technology migration. And once we complete the technology migration of C2 in May, we expect to be in a better position to make any revisions to our long term expense synergy run rate forecast.","Looking at our expense guidance for the full year 2018, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $420 million to $428 million, reflecting our expectations for expenses to be up 1% to 3% versus 2017. Note, that this guidance includes approximately $8 million or 2% of 2017 adjusted operating expenses for incremental expenses primarily associated with the recent Silexx acquisition, the increased strength of the pound sterling, and [indiscernible] related expenses, that we have an offsetting benefit in our net revenues.","Turning to depreciation and amortization expense; which is included in our total expense guidance, is expected to be $53 million to $58 million, which excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, of about $157 million, and will be excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Lastly, capital spending in 2018 is expected to range from $50 million to $55 million, which includes our investment to migrate the Cboe Futures and Options exchanges on to proprietary Bats technology, as well as the ongoing investment in technology and software to support Cboe's current trading platform.","Now let's spend some time on income taxes; like most U.S. companies, our current and future results are impacted by the recently enacted U.S. corporate tax reform. Consequently, our fourth quarter results included a one-time benefit of $192 million, through a remeasurement of our deferred tax positions. However, our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter was approximately 37%, again within the guidance range we provided on our last call.","Looking further at the impact of tax reform on 2018, and given the predominance of our U.S. earnings contribution, we expect to see a significant reduction in our overall corporate tax rate, driven primarily by the reduction in Cboe statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. However the new tax law both repeals a number of deductions relevant to Cboe, most notably, the domestic production activities deduction, also referred to as Section 199, and the deductibility of certain other expenses and introducing incremental taxes on foreign earnings.","We expect the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings to be in a range of 26.5% to 28.5%. This tax rate guidance reflects the net impact of the corporate tax reform and a full year of the Illinois State tax increase, enacted in July of 2017, resulting in an expected total net reduction in our effective tax rate in the range of 8 to 10 percentage points.","Turning to capital allocation; we remain focused on allocating capital in the most efficient manner to create long term shareholder value. While reduction in the corporate tax rate is expected to increase our earnings and provide additional cash, our capital allocation priorities have not changed. We plan to continue to invest in the growth of our business, return capital through dividends, with a goal of steady annual increases, pay down our debt and evaluate share repurchases. Our quarterly results once again generated strong cash flows, which enabled us to reduce our debt by additional $75 million, and pay out dividends of nearly $31 million, while still ending the year with adjusted cash and investments of $120 million and a leverage ratio of 1.8 times.","To summarize, during the fourth quarter, we built on a strong momentum we experienced throughout 2017, and continued to demonstrate our focus on and strength of our proprietary index products, resulting in strong organic growth. Diversifying and stabilizing our revenue streams, with a growing base of non-transaction revenue, disciplined expense management, leveraging the scale of our business model, producing higher profitability margins, and integration plan on track, with improved expense synergy realization, and ongoing focus on capital allocation by reducing debt, while continuing to return capital to shareholders through quarterly dividends.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Ed.","Ed Tilly","Thank you, Brian. Before opening up for Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to provide follow-up on the two areas of most interest to you on our call at Wednesday. The percentage of VIX futures tied to ETP trading, both long and short, and who is trading VIX futures. This first slide shows average AUM on a quarterly basis, for the top, long and short VIX linked ETPs, which represent roughly 90% of VIX ETP assets, as relatively flat between Q4 2015 and January of 2018. During the same period, overall VIX futures ADV increased by 82%. So while ETP assets continue to be important, the growth in VIX futures trading is no longer reliant on ETP activity.","This next slide demonstrates how our efforts to educate and grow our user base, have increased the number of unique user accounts, associated with trading in CFE, from 4,495 in Q4 2015 to 5,706 in Q4 2017, representing an increase of 27%.","Unique accounts encompassed a broad range of market participants, including asset managers, dealers, market makers, proprietary traders and brokerage execution professionals. During this period, growth from overseas users, interested in accessing our global trading hour session, has been particularly strong with these user accounts, up 57%.","As we mentioned Wednesday, the activity we see from issuers of XIV and SPXC is less than 5% of all VIX futures trading, representing average daily volume of about 12,000 contracts. It's important to note, that non-institutional holders of these ETPs in the last reported period, represented approximately just 21% of total holdings, with the remainder consisting of sophisticated institutional users, who employ inverse VIX ETPs, as part of a diverse mix of trading and investing strategies.","I thank you again for your time, both today and Wednesday. We continue to make volatility trading a primary educational focus. The growth in VIX futures and options trading is a result of the utility of these products under virtually any market condition. We see every change in market conditions as an opportunity to redouble our educational efforts.","With that, I will turn it over to Debbie, for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Debbie Koopman","Thanks Ed. At this point, we would be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue, and if time permits, we will take a second question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Richard Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Richard Repetto","Yeah. Good morning Ed, Brian and Chris. I guess my question -- and I will try to stay broad, because I only got one question. Thank you for the call on Wednesday and the follow-up Ed, with the slides here this morning on the ETPs. I guess the broad question is, the stock has been down, significantly in February, and if you look at the overall growth of the Cboe complex, what do you think people are missing? You think they are overwaiting -- certainly, there has been concern from the inverse ETF debacle, but what do you think investors are -- what one thing would you highlight or a few things you would highlight, that you think are either more important, or maybe this inverse ETF thing is not of concern to you?","Ed Tilly","Well Rich, that is a terrific question. VIX has been incredibly difficult to understand and therefore to model. The growth rate, the adoption rate, the evolving utility and application make it so. And as a result - and so too is Cboe. So we enjoy, as you know, incredible growth and profit tremendously when the world markets go sideways, and we enjoy in the industry, envious position in growth, when the world markets are calm.","So those that continue to view our proprietary products like stocks, the attempt to fit them into equity buckets, will at times and have in the past, kind of missed the growth potential, and as a result, missed the Cboe story.","So we had one key -- from my perspective, missing piece on the story that we have been telling you throughout the years from our IPO and leading into 2016, and that was, how do you supplement this unique product mix with world class technology platforms. So we remedy that, with the vast acquisition that we are coming up on our one year anniversary.","So if you look at the combination now of the most widely followed volatility benchmark in the world, dollar denominated U.S. benchmarks, there is just an opportunity to express any view of the U.S. market, European and U.S. equities, and a growing FX platform. The combination, coupled now with Bats technology, is an absolutely incredible story.","But this market, as it has in the past; we have seen corrections in the past, we have talked about it. Quarterly calls have reflected on them. The incredible record setting volumes that we have had over the past week or two. We have seen those in the past. These are teaching opportunities. We get to go back to the street. We have people near conversion. You all know the leadtime for a conversion into trading is long. These are those events in the market, that make this story that we have been telling in call markets resonate. That turns into volume over the years. It may not be tomorrow, but that is the story we are able to tell, is unique to Cboe.","So sorry for the little rant there, Rich. But I certainly appreciate the question, because, we do scratch our heads here when we look at the utility and what we have built here and how we have set the marketplace and continue to educate the marketplace to take advantage of these moves. Chris, something to add?","Chris Concannon","Yeah Ed. Rich, I will just add that, as a fairly new player to the VIX complex and the SPX complex, what I have seen over the last year, is an educational effort around how to protect your portfolio from an event like Monday, and that is the primary tool that is being used, whether it's an SPX package or it's a VIX package, that the large institutional players are using. This is then -- is one of the most successful selling items for us and for our complex, because of the protection, if you were along VIX or if you were using SPX to protect your portfolio, these events are wonderful events for us and our selling efforts to add our products into people's portfolios.","So I look at -- look, I am concerned about the damage caused in two funds, but when I look at the institutional holdings of those funds, these are professionals that know what they are doing, and certainly benefitted from being short in 2017, in those funds. But when you look at what we have been selling and how we have been selling it, portfolio protection is at an all time high right now, in terms of need and exposure. So that's the story that I think is missed in this.","The other story is, on markets, the U.S. equity markets, the U.S. options markets and the U.S. futures markets, performed exactly as designed, and under tremendous stress, not only on Monday, but again yesterday, and unfortunately, the media doesn't print stories that we all worked exceptionally well. They only print stories when something breaks.","John Deters","Rich, this is John. Further to Chris' point about really institutional players being largely in these strategies. The short VIX strategy is not going away, we have told you that. We showed you how our exposure, our direct exposure is limited. But I think it's important to point out, that already in the days since the rapid increase in VIX, we have seen AUM in the open SPXC short ETF increase from under $100 million in assets to almost $700 million -- $670 million as of yesterday.","So people are rotating back into that strategy. We saw this at the end of 2015 and 2016, where the short VIX strategy increased from its low by 400% within the following year, and we are seeing it again now. What happened, is a couple issuers made a self-interested decision to redeem their notes. But what did not happen, is that people did not flee the short VIX strategy.","Richard Repetto","Great. Thanks guys for the color and the feedback.","Ed Tilly","You could tell we love the business Rich. Sorry for all that bashing right out of the gate.","Richard Repetto","I get it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sameer Murukutla","Hey, good morning guys. This Sameer Murukutla on for Mike Carrier. Just a few questions wrapped in one on capital management for Brian. Given the new lower tax rate, I guess, you know the somewhat decent leverage; can you give us more details on how you are going to valuate share repurchases going forward? And I guess Brian, has your view on leverage changed since Alan has retired, and can you give us an update on what your minimum cash needs are?","Ed Tilly","Who's Alan?","Brian Schell","Alan, if you are listening, that was Ed. So let's talk about share repurchases, I think just to make sure I got this. The share repurchase opportunity leverage and then the minimum cash balance. So if we address the share repurchase -- so, as we previously indicated, we have approximately $100 million of capacity left under our current authorization. And capital allocation is a topic we regularly discuss with our board, and the $400 million of debt reduction in 2017, really put us in a great position to continue to evaluate all of our capital allocation alternatives in 2018, including share repurchases, which is, I think more directly, your question there. And as such, with strong cash flows from 2017, our current year-to-date volumes and the incremental cash expected from the lower tax rate. Again, your capacity to deploy capital towards debt reduction, which continues to be a focus and share repurchases or incremental dividends.","So like I said, it's all there on the table. As I mentioned, 2017 just put us in a great environment to evaluate it, open up all the options, and looking as a roll-in to kind of the next question about the leverage, we never -- we don't have at targeted leverage ratio, and -- but our objective was always to achieve that long term balance sheet flexibility. And so that's what -- we have always been working towards for that capital allocation of what you saw was due during 2017.","And for as far as the minimum cash number, there is kind of a minimum cash, that I would say, from an operating standpoint, on the balance sheet, we tried to target, call it roughly about $80 million to $100 million at the end of the quarter, or kind of throughout the period, as we had looked for various working capital needs or any type that might happen for kind of inflows and outflows. So that's kind of a range that we kind of ballpark, as far as any incremental needs we might have during the quarter.","Sameer Murukutla","Perfect. Thanks for answering all those questions.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You and CME both have tax rates in the 36% to 37% range in 2017. Your guidance is 26.5% to 28.5%, CME's falls to 24%. Can you speculate maybe on the more modest tax benefit here? What I am trying to figure out is just maybe, how conservative you are being in your assumptions? And I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks, incremental taxes on foreign earnings, can you maybe flush this out to me, because that's -- your foreign business is still pretty small from an earnings perspective. Thanks.","Brian Schell","Sure. So a couple of things; and so I don't have the detailed reconciliation from a -- we had talked about earlier. John and I talk regularly, but that's not something that we have compared tax rates on all of those items. So I can only speak more specifically to the Cboe tax rate, and as you look at kind of the corporate tax reduction of that 14% and I appreciate the 8% to 10% being more modest, I will take it every quarter, that's pretty awesome, as far as the impact on cash flows. But as I break it down at a high level, the 8% to 10% reduction, we would say that -- if we talk about the 2% to 3% bucketed towards the state impact, from both Illinois, as well as the losses from the federal benefit, you lose that, because your state rate actually goes up a little bit of how much you can actually deduct, and then section 199. And whether that was a bigger or smaller benefit to us versus anyone else, obviously, I don't know. So that's one area of potential speculation is, is how that lays out, because as you know, this is a very complex area, and it's very unique to jurisdictions and where they are reporting the income.","The other -- I would put it in other bucket of a bunch of miscellaneous items, which again, will be very-very unique to each institution and each company, whether it be $162 million and whether those expenses were relative to a larger or smaller expense base or earnings base, could have a different impact. The foreign tax that I mentioned is, it could be both a mix shift, because of the different rates now. You have the new tax that was introduced, on kind of the high -- basically kind of high yield on the assets. And so that does have an impact, and I would say, that kind of makes up the remaining change of the overall tax rate impact, that gets us down to that 8 to 10 percentage points reduction.","Ken Worthington","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Hey good morning everyone. I kind of wanted to just come back to the first two questions that were asked, and kind of combine them for Ed, meaning -- you know, I guess, you guys couldn't be more optimistic that this is a non-event. But obviously, as Rich pointed out, the stock has come off, so it's off 20% or so from the high. So I hear Brian's comments on capital allocation, but like, when it comes to senior management, how opportunistic do you think you should be right now, in terms of buying back the stock, and maybe push some delevering out a little bit, considering your confidence level here?","Ed Tilly","I think it's a good question, and maybe a little bit more specific to what Brian said. Our goal and what we shared with you last year, was delevering. That was the number one goal of the board and it was on the advice of the senior management team. What Brian is saying, is we believe the balance sheet is at a very nice place for us. And as far as flexibility, we are free, we think to look at the world differently than we would have been a year ago at the closing of this deal. We are in the middle of an integration and the platform migration. So that's kind of the timing of how we see deals going forward. This is the one we continue to be focused on.","You are asking, and the question is exactly what the board is going to ask senior management next week is, is this the right time to get back into -- and opportunistically repurchase our shares. We are telling you, that our recommendation to the board is, we like the flexibility of the balance sheet, and we should be entertaining all methods and modes to return cash back to our shareholders, whether it's the continuation of deleveraging and adding share repurchases, and considering a change in the regular dividend. So everything on the table, but your timing, and painfully pointing out Alex, I appreciate that, what the stock has done over the past three days, is we will make this even more of a focus next week, I can assure you.","Alex Kramm","All right. Thank you for your personal comment.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to slide 26, and I appreciate all the difficulty gathering this information, obviously on a short period of time, so thank you for that. When you guys talk about unique users, what's the makeup of that growth in customer types that you highlight on the page, the 27% growth. And I guess, any sense you guys can give us, what percentage of this new user growth has been by participants deploying a short volatility strategy. Other than the market makers, I guess, because that would [indiscernible]?","John Deters","Yeah Alex, this is John. So I think he perspective we can give -- I'd start with saying that the user growth has been -- apart from the outsized growth we have seen in participants in our global trading hours, otherwise I think the user base has been pretty well distributed across those categories, the market participants that Ed described in his comments. So it's very broad based. I think and this is somewhat of a guess, but I think that the percentage of those new users employing short strategies, would be just about consistent with what the short strategy employment has been in the past. And you can see this in the ebb and flow, it's just one indicator. But you see this in the ebb and flow of assets and the two strategies, long and short.","The application of the two strategies changes with market environment, and so, most of these new users are institutional representatives, and they will appreciate that fact.","Let me give you just a little more color on the changing composition of our market participants, particularly in the VIX futures complex. So from that same period, Q4 2015 to Q4 2017, we have seen -- if you look at the kind of ADV by origin, we split the origin into three broad buckets, customer, firm and market maker, and I am happy to explain, some of the color on what each of those mean. Firm being classic sell side, customer being sort of classic non-member buy side, and market maker being more member buy side, so think real market makers in the market, proprietary trading firms and that type.","We have seen a growth of about 67% in customers, so classic buy side, really growing strongly. And then, we see growth that's similar, about 60%, a little bit less in market makers. And then firms have been fairly stable, if there is the representation from firms is just a smaller cohort of market participants.","So what this all means, is that new customers, new real end users, buy side users, are coming into the VIX market. That generates activity from the market maker community, in the ratio of about three to one, so every new contract that comes in from a customer, spins out three new contracts from market makers approximately, and that's the kind of benefit of having more participants doing more business in the VIX futures market.","Ed Tilly","Let me just add Alex, because it's kind of lost when look at markets like this. But all of this growth is before the migration to Bats tech. So the excitement around that globally and domestically about the enhancements and the upgrade in the performance that's expected, and the order types and order handling, we can't be more excited to introduce all of these users to new tech, and then being able to go out and appeal to those that have been waiting for our technology migration. So we think the timing, moving into the February 25th date, really couldn't be better. So with all of the eyes around the world on our VIX futures contract, and looking forward to a migration, we think the timing is great.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks for [indiscernible]. Good morning folks. Maybe just to come back, I mean I guess it's sort of a number one question. And totally appreciate everything you have been saying about the shortfall, especially on Wednesday's call. But maybe if you -- for say, slide 27, any sense of what those numbers would be pro forma for the entire VIX ETP usage, and then if you were to expand that to, what you think the portion is to short vol strategy, even if we think that that's going to continue, we just -- if you go out, people just want to try to get a sense of sort of your exposure there. And then if I can just sneak one more in, Chris, if you can talk about hotspot, FX and then the volumes there increasing pretty dramatically this year, and maybe if you could talk about what's driving that for you guys?","Chris Concannon","Sure. It's Chris, I will start with hotspot, and then we can talk about the VIX complex. The hotspot has been growing, it has been a very exciting 2017. The FX business is up 13% in revenue, in a market, that was by most measures, down the overall FX spot market, by some measures is flat to down. So we are growing in our market share, as well as in our overall notional volumes.","Really, what we spent the last year working on, and it was really under Bryan Harkins efforts was, looking inside our liquidity pool and really mastering -- matching the right liquidity with the right takers, and the FX market is a lot more complicated than a straight equity market. So we have deployed a great deal of data analysis, execution quality measures, pushing them out to our clients, and the clients are really reacting to them. Only the market makers having better experience, but really the takers are finding the right liquidity in the right pair.","So it's -- I would say it's the service level that we delivered, combined with upgrades in our technology. The FX technology has been upgraded from London to the New York platform, so it's running at much higher speeds with much higher turnover.","I would add that the London Matching Engine has been really a driver of growth. We have always planned that the London Matching Engine would be an opportunity for growth and now we are seeing it firsthand. That was the fastest growing match for us, as it should, as we took on the competition in London. Again Reuters is only matching in the London area, so we are really attacking that London FX spot business.","Ed Tilly","On Cboe FX, Chris.","Chris Concannon","On Cboe FX.","John Deters","This is John, I will speak to the first question on slide 27 and drilling down a little bit more. So the first part of the question was, if you could sort of expand from the short ETPs to the direct volume from short and long ETPs. The total direct volume from short and long would be more like 7%. So it's not double the percentage, the 4.4% that we showed you for the short. And in terms of the -- outside of short ETPs, the overall VIX futures volume from short strategies -- for those employing short strategies. Can't give you a precise number there. What we can say is that, there are literally a dozen or more volatility trading strategies that our market participants employ, all the way from calendar spreads and rope [ph] strategies to ARB strategies to long and short of a variety of stripes; short term short, long term short, long term long, short term long.","So this is a strategy of many, and outside the ETPs, those who employ the short VIX strategy are true, true professionals. So this gets back to the point we made earlier that, the short VIX strategy is not going away. In particular, for those market participants. We have seen it already in the last couple of days since the volatility spike, and we have an event like we had earlier this week, in terms of the short VIX strategy performance. When the volatility level, when the level of VIX doubles, increases by 100%, once you increase by 100%, and you reset to historic norms, you don't increase by 100% again. So it's really an exceptional event, when the level of VIX increases doubles in a matter of just a handful of days. That's occurred, and now we are at a point where -- and professionals know this, we are at a point where the short VIX strategy tends to work quite well.","Brian Bedell","Okay. That's great color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citi.","Ben Herbert","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to shift gears maybe into the OpEx guide, and how you see really kind of run rate organic growth there, versus what you might be spending on, integrating the platforms this year?","Brian Schell","So if you think about the -- I guess the synergy and how that's built into the overall, kind of that 1% to 3% target. I noted in my remarks about the -- or call it the, the incremental expenses, that we will see, that -- while there are associated revenue line items attached to those items I mentioned, it's not necessarily a true increase to -- or excuse me, a true -- there is an offset, excuse me, on the revenue side. We typically have targeted, as we have historically, that -- I will call it a core growth rate in expenses. We are trying to limit that, call it a 3% to 5% range, and if you look at the impact of the synergies, that are actually realized, not just the run-rate, but they actually realize, because the realized numbers obviously are going to be -- some percentage of actually the run rate element, as you saw, for example, in 2017. I mean, that number, closer to call it, 75%-ish of what the run rate was and what we realized.","When you factor that in, we think we are going to still be in that range of that -- call it that 3% to 5% kind of core expense run rate for the business as we roll forward. So we still tried to manage it within that parameters to say, how well are we doing, when we are trying to keep that expense line item in check.","Ben Herbert","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Great, thanks. So I think the point you guys made the other night, about long vol strategies coming back as vol normalizes, definitely makes a lot of sense. Just wondering if there is any way you can maybe quantify that for us? How much volume do you guys has been out of the market, over the last few years, due to the extreme low levels of vol?","John Deters","So Chris, this is John. It's a good question. I think -- because long and short strategies tend to flip back and forth a little bit over time, I think the overall volume exposure that we wanted to, sort of the 7% combined long and short, is probably a fairly consistent number. And almost more consistent in volume terms, than it is in percentage terms. So as we grow our VIX future volume, because of penetration of new customers, overseas penetration etcetera, I am not sure, that percentage will maintain. But the volumes certainly will maintain.","And I would point to -- I think, the best evidence we have, the long vol strategy returning, is the assets associated with long volatility ETPs, because that's a very transparent, and it's a daily metric.","We hit a record in assets, a couple of days ago, and it's interesting to note, the last time we hit the record, was at the beginning of 2016, during this time, when the short vol strategy was hit hard, that we mentioned before. So it's predictable, when the short vol strategy hits hard, people migrate to the long vol, and we hit records there.","So today, we are a little bit off that high that we had a couple of days ago in terms of assets in the long vol strategy, but we are kind of in the ballpark of $3.1 billion for the long strategy today. So clearly, those are -- it's a mathematical equation. There are dollars in the strategy, and the dollars in the strategies result in volume to CFE.","Ed Tilly","Chris I'd add, we referenced on the call the other day, the strategy that we have not seen wholly in the year and a half, starts in VIX options, and it's actually just the vertical trade, trading the level of VIX. And I probably didn't give a very good example the other day. But if you can imagine VIX at its historic level of 18 and the trade between 17 and 22. That's a really interesting vertical trade from an options traders perspective, it's much more so, when you are at low VIX and the options really let you trade the option change between 10 and 11 or 10 and 12. That gap becomes trading options. Those options, that gamma is [ph] hedged in VIX futures.","So we haven't seen that, because we haven't had any sustained level of volatility here. So it's a trade that we have seen in years past. I would expect, that given this environment, we will see that picking up again as well.","John Deters","And Chris, I'd just add the notion of -- professional traders love to trade velocity. They love to trade products that have volatility. Now we have -- if you look at 2017, with muted volatility, the vol-vol was also muted. In this environment, you have the velocity of the VIX has turned up another notch, and that becomes an attractive trade, in and of itself, regardless of short long, it's the -- the vol-vol is now a very attractive trade among professional users.","Chris Harris","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Allen with Rosenblatt.","Chris Allen","Good morning everyone. I just wanted to ask about non-transactional revenues? You pointed regulatory fees being down next year, some SIP pressure in cash equities? I am wondering where there is growth opportunities potentially offset within market data, access fees and exchange service and other fees?","Brian Schell","So as we kind of look over that landscape, and then obviously not going to get into a specific projection of the revenues. But we will take a couple of those items there. On market data -- and again, I think it's appropriate, and that's why we split it out, is that, yes we think there will be pressure, obviously in the equities with industry consolidation, and potentially what happens to -- at least for our share, as far as what happens to exchange trading on the equity side, as far as that kind of flowing out. That the proprietary growth, while I can't project if certainly, that's going to have the same success rate, we do see continued momentum there. We do see continued growth on the proprietary side, and as far as the access fees, that's another opportunity where we see, that that's something that -- and it continued to have some positive opportunity, as we rationalize across the exchanges, and the services that we offer.","So we do think, while it's going to come under pressure, because of just the pure size of the SIP, and that's not going to grow or -- as far as -- what it has in the past. That will have a little bit of a drag on, I will call it the non-transaction revenue category, even pulling out the regulatory fees, which I would kind of separate that out, as you look at the core, kind of non-transaction fees, as far as those -- kind of part of that offering.","So we do see some pockets of growth heading into 2018.","Chris Concannon","Chris, this is Chris. I would just add, that when I look at the proprietary data feeds, that's really where our largest opportunity is. We are continuing to see demand from overseas in our products with a great deal of success coming out of Asia, also out of Europe. There is demand for U.S. equity, real time data, at a cost that is much lower than the competition. So we are seeing that demand come in. That demand is very focused on U.S. ETFs, as the ETF market in the U.S. continues to explode and thrive, and the products continue to do the things that they are designed to do. We are seeing international demand in inbound, not only for those products as you look at the AUM growth. But as a result of that growth, they are also demanding real-time data.","So very excited about the growth opportunity in our proprietary data products in 2018.","Chris Allen","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good morning. Just another question on the market environment for VIX trading. Ed, I know you said earlier that VIX trading remains attractive, really in any market condition, and you gave some good examples of that in the current environment. But I also think in early 2015, you cited the flat term structure of VIX futures as a key reason why the volumes were lagging in 2015 into 2016, a bit, despite an uptick in volatility at the time. I know we have this inverted term structure, but if we move into an environment with a flat term structure, would that concern you, and if not, I guess what's changed?","Ed Tilly","Flat historically, we rarely remain flat, and as you point out, with inverted now, the trade back into inverted, you will see a great deal of volume moving into that trade. It's just not sustainable. Inverted term structure, is about 30% of the time, and it's not very long lasting.","As is flat. So again, if you just -- if you reduce down, there has been a lot written about VIX and volatility. VIX is a pure measure of the markets, expected risk and the price of insuring a portfolio of the S&P 500, can't say that enough. And rarely, I do have a flat expectation over time, it's just not natural. When we look out over time, we are usually more uncertain over time, which is why there is that normal upward sloping curve involved.","So I do think if we remain flat, some of the strategies obviously change, but they are never long lasting, from a historical perspective, and we go back into that normal shape.","So I would expect, while flat, a bit muted on some of the strategies. But the trade out of that flat, is what we see coming into the marketplace, and our participants are making trades accordingly. So I would expect a return to an upward sloping curve.","Unidentified Company Representative","And Kyle, just to support Ed, you really have to think about the different overall economic environment we are in now, versus time period late 2015, early 2016, where you have got just real significant moves in rates and uncertainty about where rates will unfold. You have got credit coming into question for the first time in many-many years, and you have got these choppiness in the equity market itself, in terms of realized volatility. All adds up to an entirely different situation from where we were in 2015 and 2016, where a flat yield curve actually reflected the sentiment.","Kyle Voigt","Thank you.","Ed Tilly","Kyle, let me give you one more just to look at. We have used it in the past, and I think it's a good one to be mindful of now, and it's the effect on realized vol on your expectations on implied volatility. So this inverted shape right now is because realized is so high, and we have always said that that is an anchor, when realized volatility is low, and it's very buoyant to volatility and perceptions, when realized vol is high. So it's that relationship that's out of whack, and that relationship that tends to be the trade. So keep an eye on realized, and that will give you some guidance as to how that curve is going to change over time.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to come back to Chris Allen's question, for a little bit about the market data and other non-transaction fees. I think the answer was primarily around equities, but how about the futures business? You may have talked about this before, but as you do that migration in the month or so, that business will throw off a lot more market data, like proprietary data and like, depth of books, stuff like that, that didn't even exist in this whole structure. So considering the growing participation in the market that you have been pointing out, I mean, shouldn't there be a lot of more market data that you can sell? And I don't know, if there is a fee schedule yet, but can you help us at all, in terms of the opportunity there?","Ed Tilly","Yeah. Great question. Thanks for helping me answer the question better. So absolutely, we are very excited about the futures migration. Heads down here. February 5th is the migration. We are not only putting in a new platform, but we are creating the opportunity for new data products. We have a depth of book feed that will be coming off of our futures platform. We have a top of book feed, and we have a great deal of demand, and if you look at the chart that we showed you on the growth of the users of our CFE platform, that's also reflective of the growth of our data use. So every one of those users needs to have eyeballs on real-time data, both top of book, and now with the potential for a depth of book product, that is typically priced at a higher end price.","So very excited about the opportunity with the new platform. Obviously, very excited about where the data will go. Just our bitcoin futures launch put demand on our market data in our futures product. So we think with additional futures product launches over the course of 2018, the demand for that data will continue to grow.","Alex Kramm","But too early to talk about size, obviously, I guess?","Ed Tilly","Yeah. Very early to talk about size right now. But my level of excitement is high.","Alex Kramm","And then lastly, since we are in follow-up, like, the multiply listed options business doesn't come up a lot anymore, because it has become a smaller piece. But those volumes have really surprised us here too. So maybe -- any commentary in general like, what's going on in the equity options market? I know obviously there has been more volatility, but it seems like there has been more than people would have expected. So any comments would be helpful.","Ed Tilly","No. Look, in the more recent activity that we have seen, we have seen an explosion in volume in the multi-list options business. That's after several years of very muted, sometimes declined volumes. So we are excited about that recent activity. But I will tell you, in 2017, even with the platforms being worked on and a lot of focus on replatforming our futures product, we were able to deliver growth in our multi-list options.","So one of the most exciting platforms that we delivered in 2017, was the complex order book on Ajax, and we have just seen record after record in our complex order book platform since the launch. And what's great about that, is that the complex order book was delivered as a production platform for our C2 platform. So that complex order book will show itself in a slightly different form in C2, but it's very exciting to see the growth of that and the opportunity that we have, when we deliver C2 with a complex order book that looks very similar.","Alex Kramm","Alright. Thank you again.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, we would like to return the call to management for any closing comments.","Debbie Koopman","Okay. Thank you very much for your interest today, and look forward to speaking to you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I now would like to turn over the conference to Debbie Koopman. VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ma\u2019am.","Debbie Koopman","Good morning and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss the quarter and provide an update on our strategic initiatives. Then, Alan Dean, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will provide an overview of our third-quarter 2017 financial results and Brian Schell, our Deputy CFO, will review the quarterly results in more detail, including an update on certain guidance metrics.","Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A will be our President and COO, Chris Concannon and our Chief Strategy Officer, John Deters.","In addition, I'd like to point out that this presentation will include the use of several slides. We will be showing the slides and providing commentary on each. A downloadable copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations portion of our website.","During our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements, which represent our current judgment on what the future may hold, and while we believe these judgments are reasonable, these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties.","Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a full discussion of the factors that may affect any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after this conference call.","During the course of the call this morning, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. We will also refer to non-GAAP adjusted combined results, which are also reconciled in our earnings materials. As you know, we completed our acquisition of Bats Global Markets on February 28, 2017. The combined results present information regarding the combined operations as if the Bats acquisition had closed at the beginning of 2016, in order to provide a supplemental discussion of our results.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Tilly.","Ed Tilly","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report on a strong third-quarter 2017 at Cboe Global Markets, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.89 on net revenue of $270 million, led by continued growth in our proprietary index products, with record average daily volume in VIX options and futures despite record low volatility.","Overall options average daily volume increased 11% in the third quarter compared to the previous year, and our proprietary products continued to outperform the industry. Index options volume increased 26%, driven by a record quarter in VIX options trading and continued strong trading in SPX options, which increased 56% and 12%, respectively. VIX futures trading set an all-time high for a second consecutive quarter, with ADV up 36% compared to the third quarter last year.","We saw third-quarter market share in both U.S. and European equities decrease against the prior year\u2019s third quarter, due to ongoing low volatility. Global FX volume was up 13% and our market share was 12.9% for the third quarter, compared to 12.4% a year ago. We are preparing to launch trading of non-deliverable FX forward transactions, NDFs in November.","NDFs will trade on Cboe SEF. The Cboe ETF Marketplace continued to grow in the third quarter, with 23 new ETF launches and a record 30 transfers on a single day from iShares, bringing our total ETP listings to 234 at the end of September. Year-to-date through September, we executed 22% of trades and captured 38% of all new listings and 62% of transfers. Our market share of all U.S. ETP listings now stands at 11%.","Before recapping the quarter\u2019s key initiatives, I will touch on our new Company name, mission and commitments, which we unveiled on October 17. Our new name blends what many already informally called us, Cboe, with the extended global reach afforded us by the acquisition of Bats.","Our mission, powering potential to stay ahead of an evolving marketplace, is fueled by our commitment to relentless product innovation, leading-edge technology, and seamless trading solutions. Let\u2019s take a look at the past quarter through the lens of these three commitments.","Our commitment to driving growth through product innovation has never been greater, nor has our ability to bring new innovations to market. Our diversified product line allows us to shape every aspect of the product development cycle and our new asset classes represent new building blocks for innovation.","Additionally, we continue to tap the potential of long-standing proprietary products, such as our flagship S&P 500 options franchise. In September, we announced plans to launch options on 10 S&P Select Sector Indices designed to provide market exposure to widely followed U.S. equity sectors represented in the S&P 500. The new options will allow European investors who cannot currently hold options on ETFs due to certain European regulations to target U.S. equity exposure. We will leverage our extended reach in Europe to market Sector options, which we expect to launch by year-end.","Our second commitment is to differentiating our Company with leading-edge, state-of-the-art technology. We expect the migration of Cboe exchanges onto Bats proprietary technology to maximize our value proposition for customers and shareholders alike and to form the foundation for our Company\u2019s ongoing growth. Working closely with our customers is key to a seamless migration.","In September we held our third conference call to update customers on the progress of our technology migration and their feedback remains positive. The migration of the Cboe Futures Exchange to the Bats platform is progressing well and remains on track for our planned February 25, 2018 launch.","The implementation of our new index platform is also on track for the first quarter of 2018. The new platform will serve as the foundation for our growing index business and enables us to better calculate and disseminate data for new and existing indices. We are simultaneously preparing for the migration of C2 Options Exchange to Bats technology, which is planned for May 14, 2018.","Preparations are also underway for the migration of the Cboe Options Exchange to the Bats platform. The first step will be migrating SPX options to the Hybrid system, which we are targeting for the second quarter of 2018. On October 23, we successfully launched the EDGX Options Exchange Complex Order Book, designed to be the most efficient and adaptable complex order book in operation.","We expect the new functionality to provide immediate benefits to EDGX customers and to form the foundation for all complex orders handled by Cboe Global Markets, once all of the exchanges migrate to Bats technology.","In other technology news, last week we announced our acquisition of Silexx, a developer and operator of a multi-asset order and execution management system that caters to institutional customers throughout the U.S. The Silexx platform supports equities, options and futures trading and provides access to roughly 40 global markets, including in Europe and Asia.","We are pleased to provide customers with an additional, streamlined channel to industry-leading data, analytics and trade execution tools. Our third commitment is to providing seamless trading solutions through a blend of data, analytics and navigational trading tools coupled with a distinctive emphasis on customer education and collaboration. We view MiFID II, for example, as an opportunity to help customers navigate the changing regulatory environment with value-added products and services.","Our foremost goal was to provide our customers with operational readiness ahead of MiFID II with ample time to test their systems. I\u2019m pleased to say we successfully completed our fourth and final software release, and that all exchange functionality needed for MiFID II compliance is now in place.","Our Large in Scale block trading platform and our Periodic Auctions offering, a lit book operating auctions throughout the day, were developed in anticipation of the new volume caps under MiFID II, which are expected to limit trading in dark pools. Both were designed to enable investors to find liquidity and trade large quantities of stock with low market impact.","Our ability to provide market participants with cutting-edge trading solutions is supported by our ongoing commitment to customer collaboration and education. This commitment is highlighted by Cboe Risk Management Conferences, which are now held annually in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Most recently, we enjoyed record attendance at our sixth annual RMC Europe in September, held just outside London. RMC attendees, who are often early adopters of our new products and services, had the opportunity at RMC Europe to interact with team members who represent new product lines at Cboe, including FX products and European equities.","In closing, I would like thank our team for a great third quarter, our first quarter reporting as Cboe Global Markets. It is a credit to the entire team that we are now operating as one bigger, bolder company, just eight months after the close of our deal. Our integration work is not over, but there is an excitement throughout the company in seeing our ongoing efforts come together. Every team member has been integral to the creation of Cboe Global Markets, a truly transformational step in the great history of our company. The collective effort of our team has positioned us to power the potential of our customers and shareholders in the quarters and years to come.","With that, I thank you for your time. But before turning this over to Alan for the last time, I would like to thank him for his outstanding contribution to our company. As you know, Alan will be retiring after 38 years of service to Cboe. He has helped successfully guide Cboe through major challenges, including the aftermath of the Market Crash of 1987, our transition from floor to electronic trading, and our journey from a membership organization to a shareholder-based company. He was instrumental in the accomplishment of major milestones, including our successful IPO in the midst of a very challenging financial environment, our transformative deal with Bats and our ascent to an S&P 500 company.","More important, in between those major events, Alan lent his guidance, wise counsel and steadfast support to Cboe on a daily basis for the past 38 years. I thank him for his dedication, service and friendship. Over to you, Alan.","Alan Dean","Well, thanks Ed, I appreciate those kind words and good morning everyone. Before I begin I\u2019d like to thank all of you on the call, analysts, portfolio managers, and shareholders for your support over the years. As CFO of Cboe, one of the reasons I\u2019ve enjoyed my job so much is that I have had the opportunity to interact with so many consummate professionals. It has been a pleasure to work with all of you. Lastly, as I ride off into the sunset, I know that Cboe is in good hands with Ed, Chris and of course with Brian Schell at the financial helm.","Now onto the quarter. Before I begin, let me point out that our third quarter 2017 results includes Bats for the entire quarter this year but not the comparable 2016 period. Therefore, the year-over-year variances on a GAAP basis were largely due to the addition of Bats on March 1. To provide an additional review of our business, our third quarter financial review will focus on our non-GAAP adjusted combined results, which present financial results to reflect the Bats transaction as if it had occurred on January 1, 2016.","On that basis, we posted another strong quarter, primarily driven by the continued strength of our proprietary index products along with continued growth in non-transaction revenue, against the backdrop of record low market volatility and a decline in U.S. equities trading and relatively flat options trading activity industry-wide in the third quarter 2017, compared with the same period in 2016.","I will give a quick snapshot of the quarter and then turn it over to Brian to dive deeper into the quarterly results. Our adjusted combined net revenue was nearly $270 million, up 10% above last year's third quarter. Adjusted operating expenses of $101.9 million were down 2% and the adjusted operating margin increased 440 basis points to 62.2%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.89 rose 24% over 2016's third quarter.","Now I'll turn it over to Brian.","Brian Schell","Thank you, Alan. And let me say that I am honored to succeed you and thank you for our partnership over these past 12 months. I look forward to continuing to work with the investor\/analyst community as well as with the Cboe team as we further our efforts to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders and strive to capitalize upon the significant opportunities that lie ahead of us, as demonstrated by our results reported today.","Now let\u2019s review the quarter in more detail. Starting with net revenue, the key growth driver during the quarter was net transaction fees and to a lesser extent in other revenue, market data revenue and exchange services and other fees. These increases were offset somewhat by higher royalty fees and lower regulatory fees. The decrease in regulatory fees primarily reflects lower regulatory costs we are incurring, resulting in a reduction in the fees we record to cover some of these costs. We've seen this line item steadily decline this year and believe the third quarter regulatory fees represent a good run rate to use for building expectations going forward.","Looking at the revenue contribution by business segment, we achieved higher revenue across each business segment, except U.S. Equities, with options and futures contributing the largest revenue increases. In our options segment, net revenue of $130.7 million was up $11.5 million, or 10%, compared with last year's adjusted combined net revenue for the third quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenue from net transaction fees, offset somewhat by an increase in royalty fees.","Net transaction fees for options were up $13.8 million or 15% in the third quarter, with higher revenue from index options as well as multiply-listed options. Net transaction fees from our higher-RPC index options of $87 million were up $12.9 million or 17%. This reflects a 26% increase in ADV, led by 12% in SPX options and 56% in VIX options, offset somewhat by a 5% decrease in index options RPC, primarily due to a mix shift and higher volume discounts.","Total market share for Cboe's U.S. options exchanges was 41.7% for the quarter, up 2.3 percentage points compared to our combined market share in the third quarter of 2016. The higher market share contributed to growth in market data revenue, with increases in revenue from both industry and proprietary market data.","Moving to Futures, our fastest growing and highest RPC business segment posted record ADV for the second consecutive quarter. Net revenue of $38.9 million was 37% above last year's comparable quarter. This increase was driven by a 36% increase in futures ADV and a 3% increase in RPC. The RPC increase primarily reflects the impact of fee changes implemented in January of this year.","Looking at Cboe\u2019s organic growth, which excludes the legacy Bats revenue contribution, we saw strong organic growth of 15% for the quarter, primarily due to our proprietary products, particularly VIX futures and VIX options. On a combined basis, proprietary products accounted for 69% of net transaction fees this year compared to 64% last year.","Turning to U.S. Equities, net revenue was down slightly, primarily driven by lower net transaction fees, which were nearly offset by growth in non-transaction revenue. The results reflect an 8% decline in market volumes and a 1.6 percentage point decrease in market share, with net capture unchanged. We witnessed another quarter of low volatility, which typically results in lower overall equities volumes and a higher percentage of that volume traded off-exchange.","As noted previously, continued growth in non-transaction revenue nearly offset the shortfall in net transaction fees, with solid growth in exchange services and other fees and proprietary market data fees. We continue to see positive customer response to our proprietary market data offerings, which had revenue growth of 41% in the quarter, with approximately 20% of the growth coming from new customers or additional sales to existing customers and the remainder from pricing changes. We are encouraged by the market response to our market data offerings and look forward to further expanding our customer base.","Market volumes for European equities were up 3% in the quarter. Net revenue for European equities increased 16% on both a dollar and local currency basis versus last year's third quarter, reflecting growth in net transaction fees and non-transaction revenue. The increase in net transaction fees primarily resulted from an 8% increase in net capture, offset somewhat by a 1.9 percentage point decline in market share.","Net revenue for Global FX rose 9% to $11.3 million. This increase was driven by higher transaction fees, reflecting a 13% increase in average daily notional value traded on the Cboe FX platform, offset somewhat by a 3% decline in the net capture. And our market share increased 50 basis points to 12.9%.","Turning to expenses, this next slide details total adjusted operating expenses of $101.9 million for the quarter, down $1.5 million or 2% compared to last year's adjusted combined expenses for the third quarter. Looking at the detail, the favorable variances are driven by reductions in compensation and benefits, professional fees and outside services, and depreciation and amortization. The declines primarily reflect the realization of synergies, which resulted in a reduction in staffing and lower expenses for legal services, consulting fees, audit fees and other corporate-wide overhead.","In the third quarter, we realized $7.6 million of expense synergies, primarily seen in comp and benefits and professional fees and outside services. Our realization of synergies is running ahead of plan and as a result we now expect to end the year with approximately $30 million in GAAP run-rate synergies for 2017. However, at this time we believe we have just pulled forward some of the savings. As a result, we are not changing our forecast of synergies to be realized in the long-term. We look forward to providing you with further updates as our integration progresses.","Looking at our expense guidance for the full year 2017, we now expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $413 million to $415 million, reflecting a reduction from our original range of $415 million to $423 million.","Moving to income taxes, our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the third quarter was 36.2%, within the guidance range of 35.5% to 37.5% we provided on our last call. This excludes a one-time charge of $7.4 million recognized in the third quarter to re-measure our deferred tax positions, as well as other non-GAAP adjustments. We now expect the effective tax rate on GAAP earnings for the year to be in the range of 37.5% to 38.5% compared with prior guidance of 37% to 39%. The effective tax rate on adjusted combined earnings is expected to be in the range of 36% to 37% for the full year and a range of 37% to 38% for the fourth quarter. The tax rate guidance incorporates the impact of the corporate income tax law changes enacted in Illinois in early July.","Looking out to 2018, and assuming no significant changes to the federal income tax code, we expect the effective tax rate to increase compared with 2017, reflecting the full year impact of the Illinois tax rate changes. In addition, we now expect capital expenditures for the year to be in a range of $49 million to $53 million versus our previous guidance of $55 million to $60 million, reflecting better visibility on our project costs and timing as we enter the fourth quarter. We also reaffirmed our guidance for depreciation and amortization.","Turning to capital allocation, we continue to focus on allocating capital in the most efficient manner to create long-term shareholder value. As such, we prioritize capital by investing in the growth of our business, returning capital through dividends and utilizing excess cash to pay down our debt as quickly as possible.","Our quarterly results once again generated strong cash flows, which enabled us to reduce our debt by an additional $100 million and payout dividends of $30.6 million, while still ending the third quarter with adjusted cash and investments of $127 million.","Our debt to EBITDA ratio based on trailing 12 months adjusted combined EBITDA at quarter-end was 1.9 times, down 0.2 turns from the second quarter and roughly a 0.5 turn since the end of the first quarter. And, while we don\u2019t have a specific leverage ratio target we are currently managing to, we will look to continue to de-lever to enhance our balance sheet flexibility. While we did not make any share repurchases in the third quarter, we remain open to allocating capital to make opportunistic share repurchases, depending on the circumstances.","To summarize, during the third quarter we built on the strong momentum we have experienced throughout the year, and continued to demonstrate our focus on and the strength of our proprietary index products, generating strong organic growth; diversifying and stabilizing our revenue streams with a growing base of non-transaction revenue; disciplined expense management; leveraging the scale of our business model, producing higher profitability margins; an integration plan on track, with improved cost synergy realization; and ongoing focus on capital allocation by reducing debt while continuing to return capital to shareholders though quarterly dividends.","In closing, we are uniquely positioned with solid market fundamentals and exciting innovative products and services in our pipeline, which we believe will power our potential to serve the needs of our customers and build shareholder value.","With that, we thank you for your time this morning. I will turn it back over to Debbie for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Debbie Koopman","Thanks, Brian. At this point, we would be happy to take questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue, and if time permits, we will take a second question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Rich Repetto","Yes, good morning, guys. First I just want to congratulate Alan, the maestro of expenses. I think it's only fitting that he announces his retirement when you beats us on expenses, you will lower the 4Q guidance, increase the synergies, but you still keep the target synergies the same for the outlook.","Ed Tilly","Rich, I kicked him out of the room. He\u2019s not in here.","Rich Repetto","I\u2019ve never enjoyed being manipulated more. It\u2019s been consistent. Any way, my question, I was going to ask Chris about market data, but I'm going to stick to the expenses with Alan here. So how do we get our expenses when \u2013 I think there's still another $5 million of synergies if you take the run rate for 3Q and I think you come up with about $25 million if you stayed at that synergy level. And at the same level, and you\u2019d come out still at the low end of guidance and you expect to take $5 million out. So just one last time could you explain why the expense guidance is what it is for 4Q?","Alan Dean","Rich, we have a new maestro of expenses, Brian. So I\u2019ll let Brian handle that question.","Brian Schell","Hi, Rich. So, I mean, a couple of things are going on. We know we have some seasonal expenses that are going to increase in the fourth quarter that reflects \u2013 that\u2019s reflected in that full guidance for the year. So we\u2019ve seen the run rate, we\u2019ve seen more the changes obviously, loaded earlier than what we expect in the fourth quarter, as far as any rate of change. So we still feel very comfortable with that range, we think it's perfectly conservative around the range that we've guided to. So, like I said, the real driver there where you might see that a little bit different than where you're headed, as far as where you made a model of that is we do expect an uptick in fourth quarter this year than maybe what you have modeled.","Rich Repetto","Got it. Thank you. You\u2019ve been trained well, Brian. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays.","Jeremy Campbell","Hey, thanks. I just wanted to touch a little bit more on the capital deployment side. I mean, you guys are now down below two turns of EBITDA. And I know you guys mentioned you don't really have a target that you're guiding to here. But can you just think about, okay, aside from reinvesting organically in the business and the dividend that you're currently paying out, how you\u2019re thinking about prioritizing those \u2013 that kind of excess capital and free cash flow going forward?","Brian Schell","Yes. So this is a conversation we have quarterly with our board. We review our projecting cash flows, we look at where we're going to end up on the various ratios, we look at any potential dividends, the share repurchase opportunity, so all those items that we \u2013 that are available to us and the tools that we can use to help continue to deploy capital effectively. We still continue to look at achieving that longer-term goal, where I\u2019d say, maybe even a shorter-term goal of continuing to restore increased balance sheet flexibility.","And as we look through the predictability of where we are, what does that generate, there are definite benefits to continue to allocate the capital the way we've done in the past and again, there shouldn't be any surprise if we continue to focus on delevering again, enhancing the balance sheet flexibility, reducing our interest expense and at some point, potentially getting an upgrade on some of the rating agencies if that continues to turn positive from their perspective, again, no guarantees there. So that's how we've continued to think about it. It\u2019s pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter.","Jeremy Campbell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, guys. Maybe one question, just on the regulatory side. So we got the treasury support on the capital markets, there were some focus on market data. But on the flipside, there were some easing potentially on capital ratios for like the dealers and recently you\u2019ve seen some of the market makers impact back way from options. So I guess when you look at all the points in there, just any change in terms of your opportunity on market data or in terms of the users of the market, going forward, if some of these recommendations are put in place?","Chris Concannon","So this is Chris Concannon, I\u2019ll take that one. First of all, there's been several treasury reports, all \u2013 we view as favorable many of which have been some of the opinions that we\u2019ve voiced over the years when it comes to regulation and market structures. So we view the treasury reports as quite favorable when you look at them across the board. One in particular is about, as you mentioned capital and bank capital that impacts our market makers and how they clear their trade. So we see that trend is being largely favorable for market makers in our market and in the SPX in particular. But that trend will continue, obviously, it's only a treasury report, action has come from the various regulatory agencies.","On market data, we think we're well-positioned. Our organic growth suggests that we're well-positioned because we are coming at the market with a much lower alternative. And so we're viewed by clients as having a lower cost of market data and that's one of the reasons why we're reflecting growth in our market data revenue and in our market data opportunity, that opportunity is not just here in the U.S, but it's also a global opportunity as investors around the planet both in Asia and Europe are looking at U.S. market data and trying to find solutions that are less costly. So we feel like in light of the treasury report, we're well-positioned to talk about market data costs.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hey, good morning, guys.","Ed Tilly","Good morning.","Alex Blostein","So wanted to follow-up on the kind of the revenue discussion, you guys highlighted earlier from migration of Cboe products into Bats' technology platform over the next couple of quarters here. So I guess, sounds like Q1, we're going to see CFE and VIX Index products and then SPX later on in the second quarter. Now that the company has been combined for a couple of quarters, you\u2019re spending more time with our customers, any idea in terms of what kind of revenue opportunities that could create incrementally, and it\u2019s obviously a pretty robust backdrop that you've seen so far this year?","Ed Tilly","Yes, let me just \u2013 actually, before I turn it over to Brian and Chris to add some color, want to be really clear, the SPX is actually moving to hybrid, not a true migration onto new technology. But you are right, that CFE and the C2 are migrating early 2018 to Bats technology. So just a point of clarification, so your expectation is in line with what we're going to roll out.","As far as the opportunities, and I will ask the table to join me, really what we've always targeted and from a users perspective, the greatest benefit moving to Bats technology will be really on the future side. So just \u2013 if you recall, over the past quarters and actually years now, we\u2019ve recognized some of the shortcomings of the current technology primarily when we look at that from a futures trader\u2019s perspective, we have a wonderful platform that was really built by experts in matching quotes that is an options exchange perspective and the needs of massive amounts of quotes in processing those.","What Chris Isaacson and his team has been able to completely redo is that was with the expertise of someone that's used to processing massive amounts of orders and quotes. So the benefit to the futures exchange will be the greatest we think, and that is leapfrogging a global standard or expectation on what you should be able to interact with on our VIX futures for sure. So biggest benefit, we think our futures looking forward to the C2 migration and then, the quarter after SPX moving onto hybrid. So happy to add more color, and I think Chris has got some. And then, if there was a follow-up to that, happy to get into it.","Chris Concannon","Yes. And I'll only add that the, I view the integration as already started technically. We launched the EDGX complex order book on October 23. And that's an investment in the future of our complex series that will be rolled out in C2 as well as the C1. So as you think about it, we started the migration in October. We also have an index product migration that we announced, CFE is in February followed by C2 in May, and then, obviously, the SPX moving to hybrid is all part of the migration to a new platform. So we're underway. We've already seen success in the migration, the launch of the complex order book on EDGX and so it's off to a very good start.","Alex Blostein","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","Okay. Thank you taking the question. This is totally a follow-up to Alex's question. I believe you're in beta testing in some of the new technologies. So I believe that there's already clients sort of using the new CFE technology. It could be totally wrong, but I believe that was the case. What are you seeing from \u2013 if I'm right, what are you seeing from those customers thus far? And I guess, what I'm particularly interested and maybe others are as well is, are we seeing the pace of trading impacted by those clients who are I guess, in early versions of the new technology or are there any other takeaways? Thanks.","Brian Schell","Thanks, Ken. Really, it's very early days in our clients touching the new platform. We're really testing the APIs and making sure messages and interactions between our platforms and their platforms are correct. There's nothing you can learn in those days because we don't have all clients on in trading. Obviously, where our QA department is pounding way on the system and testing it to the standards that we require, but it's just too early to look at the client behavior on a test platform to predict any outcomes. But our original prediction as Ed alluded to is having new a platform for CFE is positive not only for our clients, but the outcome in the market, typically with the new platform you have more positive results from those clients that are enjoying higher throughput.","Ken Worthington","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good morning. So just a follow-up on the synergies, less than one year into the integration you're going to hit $30 million of synergies versus the three-year target of $50 million. When I go back to the original acquisition slide deck from last year, I think well over 60% of the synergies you outlined were IT-related. I think only $18 million were non-IT-related. And just from your prepared remarks, it sounds like most of the synergies you've realized so far have been in comp and corporate overhead.","So am I right in thinking that most of the IT-related synergies still remain and typically take a little bit longer to realize? And how do I reconcile that big part of the IT synergies yet to come with, I guess, you maintaining the long-term synergy targets?","Brian Schell","So I think that's pretty consistent. So couple of things that\u2019s happened as far as when we pull some of that forward is some of the expectation we had built out \u2013 we\u2019ll talk about the non-IT synergies. We've actually hit close to that target where we thought we would hit. Longer range for the non-IT is just that we were actually able to realize them much sooner in 2017 whereas we thought they were going to be more extended into 2018. So we've almost exactly nailed that number and have pulled that forward.","Consistent with everything we've done with I think to your question in a way, you've kind of answered it already, is that we've continued to kind of lay out how do we talk about the synergies that we\u2019ve realized, and that\u2019s going well, we're seeing the stronger numbers and yet not changing that further out guidance is. The big bulk of those numbers are going to continued to be associated with that final technology migration than when happens with that third platform. Because a lot of parallel process continue to be maintained and so those people are still here although systems are being run in parallel. So it's not just the comp cost, you have the connection cost, you have all the power and everything going along with it. So those costs are continuing to maintain and so that will not fall off until that certain platforms continues to come off.","The other thing is \u2013 the other reason why we have that is that when we actually have the migration occur for example, when CFE actually happens and when C2 actually happens, that will continue to reinforce or alter that, we'll call it a three-year, five-year number back to the original slide that we put out. And so kind of the follow-up question, I may ask or provide insight to is, when do we think we\u2019ll have insight to, when that number may change or not. I think we need to get further along into the platform migration with CFE, with C2 and then, we've finalized the requirements and everything that's going to be built into what C1 is going to actually take and that's when you would look for an update from us.","Kyle Voigt","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks very much. Good morning. Maybe just to catch on to that team and maybe a different angle. As we think about pricing, as you migrate the CFE and C2 platform over, I don\u2019t know if you can share with us any type of targets for, first of all, like improvement in market share, within the options business, from adding the complex order book and kind of over what timeframe I get. But I guess, the broader question I\u2019d want to focus on is, how do you think about pricing as a strategy? Is that going to be married with the conversion, I guess, what I'm asking is, is there the potential to reduce pricing as a competitive weapon to gain market share in 2018 across the options platform?","Chris Concannon","So it\u2019s Chris. I\u2019ll take that. I think the first focus is, when we think about the migration of the platform, it's really perfecting the micro market structure of the platform that we're delivering. Today, there's functionality that we would like to give our clients on their current platforms and we're waiting for the migration to install that functionality. We do think that functionality is a net benefit for clients, a functionality that clients have asked for around the Complex Order Book, around auctions, around order types.","So we're trying to satisfy our client demand with the migration itself to make sure we have everything wrapped into that migration. That is a net positive for client trading on the platform. So we think about our opportunity to grow market share on the Options platform in the multi-list segment of our business. The platform migration does help us provide tools and functionality that is in demand by our clients and improves our current functionality.","So that's the way we think about it. Obviously, I won't comment on pricing in 2018 and how we view pricing in 2018. It's too early to say.","Brian Bedell","Okay.","Ed Tilly","Let me just follow-up, Chris to your point, the technology change won\u2019t be driving pricing, answers to competitive pressures, we've always been responsive to that. So the technology migration will not be the driver behind pricing. It will be the competitive environment and looking product by product, order type by order type and functionality by functionality and what we can, so we will be looking at that holistically across all the asset classes, but not technology driven.","Brian Bedell","Great, that is very clear thank you.","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from Vincent Hung with Autonomous.","Vincent Hung","Hi, can you talk about the success that you've had in growing the SPX options contract this year, specifically around what the week lease has done to enhance this, and the more \u2013 further innovation you are planning there.","Ed Tilly","Yes. I think we can talk just in general the index complex, and if you look at this quarter, it resembles very much the report that we gave last quarter. And that's proprietary complexes outpaced the entire industry and growth and you\u2019ve pointed out one of the greatest highlights and that is in the SPX Weekly contract.","I think what it really \u2013 if we look at the end user's perspective and what we learned quite honestly, every day talking to our customers and in particular at various RMC conferences around the globe, is the confidence that investors have in the short-term. Their perception of risk in the very short-term, their very comfortable making strategy and hedging and taking positions in the short-term, that's reflected in our SPX Weekly's growth.","The user group who is trading in the SPX Weekly's, very active retail, very active hedge fund, but the theme is the comfort in the short-term. The third Friday in the many months that the open outcry SPX contract, if we look at that volume, that's still high institutional base. But boy, people are just aren't that confident, if you look out over time. That is reflected in the insight that we give you. If you just look at our website, you look at the VIX term structure that is the price of the futures over time that is still much higher VIX level out in the back months than the front months that shows up in trading in the short-term primarily in the SPX Weekly contract.","Vincent Hung","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Thanks. Can you guys provide a little bit more color on the new index platform you planned to launch in the first quarter of next year? I guess, specifically, what is it and what are your expectations?","John Deters","Sure Chris, this is John Deters. The new index platform really starts life as a stand-alone piece of technology. Today, it has been coupled, pretty closely with our matching edge in technology, which is not a construct that allows for quick and fast upgrades enhancements to the system. So Stage 1, we remove it from its coupling, with the matching edge in technology. And then, Stage 2 and onwards, is we will really be an effort to just constantly include our platform and make it better, mold it to our specifications, which if you think about what we do well in the index business, it's more complex indexes, really cutting-edge stuff, typically involving derivatives positions, weather they are futures or options. So we're chasing really the highest and most complex proprietary type indexed products this index technology will be build to suit that objective.","Ed Tilly","I think John, your key is taking that technology out of the matching hedge and that's the first step, that's going to happen in the first quarter and then, we'll grow the business from there.","John Deters","That is right.","Chris Harris","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citi.","Ben Herbert","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just like to follow up on the market share discussion and anything specifically you might be seeing into 2018 in Europe related to MiFID?","Brian Schell","Well I think Chris and I can take that, it is share and sign through MiFID and the launch, I was just in our office in London and all of the buzz both from our board members perspective and made a number of office visits. It's really still a lot of uncertainty and really, where is volume going to show up. And I think what Mark Hemsley and the team have done is offered a solution and in the prepared remarks, I mentioned Large In Scale and periodic options are really trying to accommodate a low market impact, and accommodating larger trades that would otherwise have been dark.","As for share region by region, Chris, I think you can add some color. We enjoyed the number two spot and our various, across Europe. There is room between number two and number one, but I think right now from a customers perspective, it's MiFID to readiness, it is with the team in London is preparing for? But Chris, as far as share, do you want to add some color.","Chris Concannon","Sure, I mean really our strategy in 2017 was MiFID readiness for the clients. We wanted to be ready early, provide products and solutions that help them comply with MiFID II. And put it in their hands before MiFID II\u2019s start date in January. The team in London has accomplished all of that, we've delivered everything \u2013 all the commitments to our clients on MiFID II readiness.","We have a final release just recently and a larger release over the summer. As Ed mentioned, Large In Scale, periodic auctions and now certain benefits for quoting for systematic internalisers. Those are all things that MiFID II requires for clients to interact on our platform. So, I feel good about the focus that the team has had on providing product to clients, way before MiFID goes live. And we don't think about market share in those terms post MiFID, we're thinking about products and solutions to deal with some of the challenges that our clients are facing with MiFID II.","Ben Herbert","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Dan Fannon","Thanks good morning. Wanted to just follow-up on just M&A in general","Ed Tilly","Dan you are cut out.","Dan Fannon","Sorry, can you hear me.","Debbie Koopman","Now we can.","Ed Tilly","Yeah, now we can, try again.","Dan Fannon","Yeah, if you could just kind of talk about the strategy in general, you obviously announced a small acquisition a few weeks ago, discuss that a little bit. And then, maybe think and then, maybe think a little bit more about maybe the backlog, how you should we think about M&A going forward, as priority for you guys?","Ed Tilly","Before I can turn it over to John Deters to get into the weeds on Silexx but really the M&A strategy hasn\u2019t changed from the road show that Alan led us through in 2010. This is really keeping a very flexible balance sheet, growing the proprietary complex is at the heart of what we look at.","Now with our broader asset class, we'll be looking across the asset classes on how we grow both share in our presence in different regions. So if there is an opportunity, we'll first look to Chris Isaacson for a build solution. If we think time-to-market is a higher priority, we will look at smaller bolt-on transactions that legacy Cboe has done in the past.","So really, you should expect us to proceed as we've done and as we've recently announced the Silexx deal. Don't expect us in large-scale M&A in the short-term. We will always keep our eye out over time on how to grow this business, but it's really business as usual here as far as M&A.","Think bolt-on, we will be growing our various asset classes, but focused no the proprietary index complex, John will get into Silexx right now and large-scale M&A, we're in a big integration and system migration, and that's got the attention across the entire organization, across all of our offices. And that's the Number 1 priority. But John want to add little color on Silexx?","John Deters","Yeah, thanks Ed. This is John Deters. So I think Ed framed it right. Silexx is almost a perfect example of how you might think about bolt-on \u2013 kind of run rate bolt-on, M&A deals we might do going forward. Really a prime example of how we can create either by building internally or by acquiring new tools and new platforms for our users to engage with our products and services.","So we acquired Silexx as a channel to reach end users directly with our products and services. And really this is a \u2013 call it the last mile to the end user that we will be owning for the first time. And it's important to recognize about Silexx, really is a broker-neutral platform, so we're reaching that end user in partnership with our key broker participants in our marketplaces.","The platform is fully ready to go with global exchange connectivity over 40 markets globally and multi-asset class capabilities. So it's a very high utility platform for the end user and while it's not material from a financial point of view because it is a very young technology, we think just because of its use we'll be able to sort of mold it, it will evolve with our business and we'll be able to really shape the platforms so that its kind of an ideal channel for our products globally.","Dan Fannon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays.","Jeremy Campbell","Hey, thanks for the follow-up. Just want to touch on new product development. I know, last quarter, you announced that Cboe and Gemini were partnering to develop futures on bitcoin. I know it's still in the potential product phase in still developmental, but the asset class itself seems kind of nascent here with lot of white space, but recently a large competitor of yours announced that they're pursuing a bitcoin futures product as well. So can you just maybe give us an update on where you are in the approvals timeline? And how you think about the competitive dynamic there? Is it really like a first-to-market type of thing, pricing, or does the Cboe product may be have some advantage versus other ones?","Ed Tilly","Our products always have the advantage. No, I think what you recognize is the way we look at crypto in general, you're right, pretty small if you look at all of the digital currencies across the globe. This is not a very big market yet. But we have recognized this sort of captures the attention of a lot of our end users, and giving them exposure in our lit market that's regulated by a U.S. regulator with key to our development of our product that we are comfortable listening on the CFE, our futures exchange.","So I think not surprising as CME recognizes the same benefits of offering a transparent market. Now we\u2019ve taken a different approach into the development, ours is really designed with a hedger in mind, a true trader and we used the model that we have for VIX Futures and Options. So the difference is the ability for our trader, who's trading on CFE, our futures exchange, the ability to replicate a position on Gemini. In that, at these settlement price on Gemini is accursed by the result of actual trades and we will settle our futures to the actual trade resulting on Gemini after their auction. Our competitor is taking the approach of an index, which is a value over time across four different indices.","So from a hedger's perspective, very, very difficult for that price to converge as a moment in time at various trades across number of exchanges, so we really like opening up that playbook to the successful VIX launch from a hedger's perspective, really making this easy for our traders to hedge and we think what we know that is the difference. And I want to be really clear while our first contract with Gemini is bitcoin. We're really agnostic to the ultimate crypto currency that may survive so whether that's ether or bitcoin, it will be interesting. But we are not in that fight. We know right now there are customers looking for exposure in bitcoin. So Chris, you want to add something?","Chris Concannon","Sure. I'm encouraged by the recent announcement. It certainly does validate, what I\u2019ll say it validates a crypto currency, in the future of crypto currency. It's not suggesting what crypto currency is going to be the winner and the loser. But overall, the crypto currency space is the space that I think we believe in and certainly our competitor across town believes in as well. And I'm just encouraged by that validation.","I think it's also important to point out that with regulated futures of our certain asset class like a bitcoin, you do have an opportunity to introduce ETF. And over time, we do envision ETFs coming to market once the regulated futures market is dealt and liquid so we do think the opportunity, we're encouraged by everyone's focus on this space. It is a small space as you mentioned. We're talking about bitcoin trading close to $2 billion a day. That's a relatively midsize stock listed on one of our equity markets. So encouraged overall by the space and encouraged how people are thinking about the crypto currency space and the future of that space.","Alan Dean","I think your other question was where are we on the approval process. It's very difficult for us to gauge where the regulator, when the regular will make a decision. We think again with our partners, Gemini that we've been able to answer all of the questions coming from CFTC, but we wouldn't speculate on a date. We are operational-ready and we will keep you up-to-date on the approval process as we learn as that unfolds.","Jeremy Campbell","Great, thanks a lot.","Alan Dean","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Michael Carrier of Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. This is for just Alan and Brian. So just on the taxes, you mentioned the Illinois tax. I think you indicated for next year, higher. Just any sizing of that and then, on the flip side, I know it's early. But if we do get some tax reform maybe just that potential as like an offset, if you guys, there's some positive there. And then just on the bitcoin conversation, when you guys look at the different products that you have whether it's on futures and options, are there \u2013 I'm just trying to understand sort of the opportunity versus the risk when maybe the underlying is not yet regulated, meaning understanding that you might have the regulation by the CFTC or the SEC on the actual contract. But just trying to understand that new lines versus the underlying asset?","Ed Tilly","Why don\u2019t we let Brian and Alan have their answer and then Chris and I can get back to bitcoin.","Alan Dean","So on the Illinois question specifically, we know that the reg was passed it was effective kind of halfway through the year. And we saw kind of the incremental impact it had on 2017. We're still going to work through \u2013 I'm not going to give you guidance right now on the 2018 impact quite yet. There's still some interchange, we want to see what happens with how the state code reflects kind of within the overall income statement.","So but we will flag that for you as we kind of issue our own broader guidance for 2018. Likely on the next time we get together. As far as the \u2013 what's been proposed as far as kind of the federal changes, clearly, a big benefit to someone in Cboe's position where we pay at the top end of the bracket, it's primarily U.S. earnings. So we're paying that full 35%. There's positive and negatives in there, but largely it's going to be much more positive to us both on an effective tax rate basis and a cash basis for what we'll ultimately pay in taxes.","I think it's probably still early to kind of speculate right now because of the ebbs and flows and what\u2019s likely to change from what's been proposed to what may or may not end up happening. So we view it largely positive, a reduction to corporate rate would be a big benefit if it stands in its current form. Both on an effective tax rate basis as well as from a cash basis and stay tuned but again, we\u2019d be \u2013 obviously, a very strong component of that going through the way it looks right now from an impact to our bottom line.","Brian Schell","So let's get to the bitcoin, I think it really, your question is why would we choose Gemini as opposed to any of the other crypto exchanges around the globe and it really \u2013 we found a partner, who is looking for the same transparency regulation and oversight as a listed exchange would. So Chris, you want to describe the structure of Gemini and what's really attractive and then, I can add the color from our futures exchange and CFE regulation and our ability to look through the transactions on Gemini. And then ultimately the transactions on our futures exchange.","Chris Concannon","Sure. Really first, one of the things that attracted us to our partnership with Gemini was the embracement of regulation. They chose to be regulated by the New York State Banking authority that was not required, but they chose it and welcomed it. So you have a regulated entity in terms of how it is a custodian of bitcoin, how it manages its market and I think about it from a regulated standpoint, when you look at the overall bitcoin market, the CFTC has determined it as a commodity so they did come to a conclusion that is a commodity.","Have you look out the world of commodities, there are many commodities that their underlying markets are unregulated. And now what a derivative of exchange does as it brings the regulated market to the professionals and provides an opportunity for hedging and taking positions around their views of that commodity market. And that's really what we're doing here, what's unique is we found a partner in Gemini that embraced that regulation.

Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report on a solid third quarter 2016 at CBOE Holdings with adjusted earnings per share of $0.58 on revenue of $156 million against a backdrop of choppy volatility and very challenging year-over-year quarterly comparisons.","In the third quarter last year, CBOE had record high financial results as well as record highs in SVX and VIX options in futures trading. While Brexit driven spikes in volatility, it drove increased trading in the second quarter of this year. Against those comparisons, overall trading at CBOE for the third quarter declined year-over-year and from the previous quarter. However, year-to-date trading on our index suite is up 5% led by an increase of 14% in VIX future's trading and continues to outpace monthly listed volume traded industry-wide which is down 4%.","Throughout the quarter, we made notable progress in advancing our growth strategy beginning with our planned acquisition of vast global markets which we announced on September 26. We are pleased by the very positive response to the acquisition we received from industry participants. We would appreciate the anticipated benefits of combining U.S. and European equities, ETF trading, global FX platform with CBOE's wide array of index options and services and multi-asset volatility products. The acquisition has the potential to significantly expand and diversify our product line, broaden our reach with that market leading European presence and increase our non-transactional revenue stream while enabling us to streamline the combined company's technology and enhance our strong growth and margin profile.","We continue to work through the stuffs necessary to complete the transaction in the first half of 2017 and on a parallel track to position the company for optimal success, immediately following the closing. And integration team comprised of CBOE and employees is snapping out plans and efficiently maximizing synergies and revenue opportunities for the combined company. I'm pleased to report that as we work our way through this process, we continue to believe that we are combining two very complementary and like-minded companies. There is mutual respect for the best-in-class innovation that each company brings to the marketplace and we are thrilled by the opportunities that we expect will result from uniting to supremely dynamic and innovative cultures.","It is important to note that the multitude of opportunities afforded us by the VAS [ph] deal, squarely fit into our strategy to develop unique products, expand our customer base and leverage alliances that complement our core business. We see the VAS acquisition as an accelerant of our forward momentum that significantly expands the opportunities on our strategic path. We're even more enthusiastic about CBOE's mission to provide innovative products that facilitate and enhance trading in the global marketplace, given the additional strengths we believe we can bring forward once the transaction is completed.","Product development remains and will remain key to our value proposition. I'll take a few moments here to highlight recent progress made in that regard. On October 26th, we launched the CBOE S&P 500 Smile index, a premium capture strategy Index constructed to perform in both full and bear markets. The CBOE Smile Index is based on the steaminess of the curve of implied volatilities of the S&P 500 SPX options, which generally looks like a Smile. As with all of our strategy benchmarks, the Smile Index is meant to be used by asset managers as a road map to drive the use of proprietary products -- in this case, SPX options.","In September, we expanded our global-based index offerings with the launch of options on the FTSE Emerging Index, which tracks the performance of large and mid-cap companies from advanced and secondary emerging markets. In August, CBOE's asset management affiliate, CBOE VAS Financial launched the CBOE VAS S&P 500 Buffer Protect strategy fund -- the first mutual fund designed to provide investors with index-based buffer protection. The new index-based fund provides a risk manage investment that seeks to protect against some downside losses in the S&P 500 Index, while still participating in potential upside.","On October 18th, CBOE VAS launched the CBOE VAS Defined Distribution strategy fund, which seeks to generate consistent monthly distributions while preserving capital over the long term. The fund's strategy is implemented by using proprietary SPX options and is designed to appeal to investors seeking income in low interest rate environment.","We view target-based investing as a major trend that will further democratize the use of many of our products as it can offer the benefits of the options stream, while substantially reducing its complexity. Furthermore, our proprietary product offering and expertise in developing options-based strategy performance benchmarks combined with our CBOE Vast partnership uniquely position's CBOE to find and lead target-based outcome investing's in the options space. We continue to expand our global customer base through joint trading and educational services with our index provider partners.","Since becoming the sole U.S. provider of options on the MSCI emerging markets index and the MSCI EAFE Index, we have concentrated our business development and educational efforts on growing customer awareness in these products, which add a significant international dimension to our index options franchise. I'm pleased to note that we've begun to see growing traction in MSCI trading.","This quarter, we plan to build amass success by broadening distribution of data in this widely-followed indexes through CBOE's market data express service, provide real-time values of the underlying indexes to broker dealers and their customers. Our efforts will supplement those of MSCI's distribution service which are focused on institutional trade indexes. Our MSCI, SPX, FSTE [ph] products were predominantly featured in last month's 5th Annual CBOE RMC Conference in Europe. While many of Europe's foremost volatility and derivatives traders, strategists and researchers, we are now preparing for our second annual RMC ASA, which begins November 30th in Hong Kong.","Touching briefly on the successful launch of KER Global on September 26, you'll recall this CBOE partner with the London Stock Exchange Group and major dealer banks in the development of KER Global, which we believe provides customers with an interest rate trading alternative that offers increased trading efficiencies and reduced transaction costs. We are pleased that there has been trading on KER Global from day one and we look forward to potentially developing new products for the platform, introducing it to our U.S. customer base and participating in its expected growth.","In closing, I will reiterate that our mission is to provide innovative products and facilitate and enhance trading in the global marketplace. We remain faithful to that vision this quarter by broadening access to our marketplace, developing new products and providing customers with market data to enhance their trading experience. Lastly, we took a major step forward in advancing our global mission with our planned acquisition of VAS global markets. We believe the VAS transaction combined with CBOE's leadership and index trading and global reputation is the go-to place for trading market volatility, will galvanize our company's efforts to develop new training products, opportunities and efficiencies for our customers and to reward stock holders for years to come.","With that, I will turn it over to Alan Dean","Alan Dean","Thanks, Ed, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to provide an overview of our third quarter financial results. Although overall results were below last year's record-setting quarter, it was a solid quarter. Our operating revenue came in at $156.2 million versus $187 million on last year's third quarter. Adjusted operating income was $74.8 million compared with $101.1 million last year. Adjusted operating margin was 47.9% against 54.1% in the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $0.58 per share versus $0.76 per share for the same period last year.","Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the third quarter of 2016 includes certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our financial results and that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck.","Looking in our results further starting with our operating revenue, the main driver of the year-over-year variance was more muted trading volume across our suite of products. Transaction fees were down $32.9 million or 23% compared with the third quarter of 2015, driven by a 12% decrease in both the average revenue per contract or RPC and total trading volume. Looking at volume by product category, our higher RPC proprietary products index fashions in futures were down 21% and 7% respectively, compared with last year's third quarter. For the multiple listed products, options on exchange rate of products decreased 11% while equity options were relatively unchanged.","However, as Ed pointed out, year-to-date trading volume and index options are up 5% while VIX futures are at 14%. Our blended RPC including options in futures was $0.0378 versus $0.0431 in last year's third quarter and $0.0405 in the second quarter. The decrease in RPC primarily reflects a shift in the mix of trading volume with our largest RPC products, index options and metrics accounting for 40.7% of cash [ph] traded in this year's third quarter compared with 44.6% in last year's third quarter and 42.9% the previous quarter.","Furthermore, the RPC from multiply listed options, equity options and exchange rate of products decreased 49% versus last year's third quarter and 25% compared with the prior quarter, primarily due to the mix of account type and higher volume discounts and incentives. Revenue for contract at CFE, our futures exchange increased 4% to nearly $1.71 from $1.65 in last year's third quarter, reflecting lower rebates linked to volume and account type.","Despite the shift in trading volume, the revenue contribution from our proprietary products increased accounting for 90% of total transaction fees in the quarter, up from 84% in the third quarter of 2015 and 87.9% in the second quarter of 2016. Looking at some of the other factors influencing operating revenue, market data revenue increased by $1.1 million, regulatory fees were up $900,000 and exchange services and other fees increased by $600,000 while other revenue was down $400,000. The increase of market data revenue was primarily driven by CBOE's higher share of Opera market data, as well as continued growth in market data revenue to derived from proprietary index values, the increase in exchange services and other fees was largely due to revenue contributed from CBOE Livevol technology services, a 2015 acquisition we anniversary it in early August.","Turning to expenses; this next slide details adjusted operating expenses of $81.4 million for the third quarter, a decrease of 4.5 million or 5% compared with $85.9 million in last year's third quarter. The decrease largely reflects lower cost with composition of benefit, depreciation and amortization and loyalty fees, the decline in amortization and depreciation expenses mainly due to the final right-off of certain regulatory software.","Core operating expenses were $51.6 million, an increase of $500,000 of 1% compared with the third quarter of 2015; this change primarily reflects increases of $1.2 million in travel and promotional expenses and $400,000 of facilities costs, primarily offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in compensation and benefits, the decline of compensation of benefits was largely due to lower incentive based compensation expenses, which are aligned with our financial performance, the increase in travel promotional expenses primarily reflects higher costs for advertising, special events versus last year's third quarter.","Working out our guidance for core expenses, we now expect to be slightly below the guidance range of $211 million to $215 million for the year, in addition, we expect to be slightly below our guidance range of $46 million to $48 million for depreciation and amortization.","Looking at volume based expenses, royalty fees decreased by $2.4 million or 11% compared with the same period last year primarily due to lower trading volume and licensed index products which were down 19% versus last year's third quarter volume. In addition, the royalty rate license contract traded increased to $0.601 this quarter up from $0.146 in last year's third quarter of $0.155 in the previous quarter, due to a shift in the mix of licensed index products traded. ","Turning to the balance sheet; we finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $73 million compared to $52 million at the end of the second quarter and $102 million at the end of 2015. Through the first nine months of the year which generated net cash flows from operating activities of $174 million down from $194 million in the same period last year, primarily due to a decline in that income. ","As we continue our efforts to effectively allocate our resources to drive shareholder value, year-to-date for September 30, we issued -- we used $36 million for capital expenditures, $58 million to pay dividends of $65 million to repurchase our stock, at September 30, we had approximately $97 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorizations which is unchanged from June 30. We suspended our share with purchase program of connection with our pending transaction with Bats, going forward we may make opportunistic share repurchases, although we attend to direct our capital resources towards paying down the $1.65 billion of debt, we plan to take down as a part of the Bats transaction.","Looking at capital expenditures through the end of the year, we expect to be slightly below our guidance range of 47 to $49 million for the year. The majority of our capital spending continues to be system related, particularly with the ongoing development of the CBOE factor trading platform. Previously we notified our market participants that we expected factor to be up and running for CFE [ph] our futures exchange and March of 2017, in line with our planned acquisition of Bats we have suspended the launch a factor for CFE, while we are continuing the development of CBOE factor until the Bats transaction closes, under the combined company we plan to incorporate the functionality offered by both platforms and migrate into the proprietary Bats technology, ultimately allowing customers to trade through a single platform.","Going forward we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and we plan to keep debt levels in line with our investment grade profile to maintain the flexibility for capital expenditures dividend payments opportunistic share repurchases and other strategic initiatives. In closing, we will continue to take a balanced improved approach or capital allocation strategy which includes evaluating all alternatives to create long-term value for our shareholders. With that, we thank you for your time and attention this morning.","And I will turn this Debbie for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Debbie Koopman","Thank you. At this point, we would be happy to take questions we ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back into the queue and if time permit we will take a second question, operator. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you will now begin question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And this morning's first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. ","Rich Repetto ","Yes, good morning Ed and good morning Alan. Yes, I guess the question, well first can I humbly ask two questions and you just pick the one you want.","Debbie Koopman","No Rich, you have to choose.","Ed Tilly","We'll get both of them.","Rich Repetto ","No, just one question. It's been a little bit over a month since that Bats acquisition was announced. And we talked about on the on the call then what the potential multiple compression and you have seen the stock come go down by about 11.5% from that the September 26, I believe. So I guess the question is. What has is the feedback been I guess from the investment community and how -- is this in your range of slight multiple compression for the transaction. ","Alan Dean ","Rich, this is Alan. Largely the response from our shareholders the investment community has been extremely positive, towards the Bats transaction, they'll likely -- fulfillment of our strategic objectives, the potential synergies that what we can become the revenue opportunities that the lie before us, so with few exceptions very positive. On the stock price, we were concerned about PE compression and our stock prices dropped from the announcement, but the entire sector with the exception of Bats, it is dropped in that period of time since September 28 or 26 whatever that that date was. Our PE -- our forward PE is holding, it did drop slightly over that period of time but so did every other exchanges. So, I wish business was a little bit stronger in October but I don't see the drop in our share price being really dependent and or the result of our announcement of the Bats transaction. ","Rich Repetto ","Okay, fair enough, thanks I will get back in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Allen from Buckingham.","Christopher Allen","Good morning everyone. I just want to ask on Bats as well, so you working through just a different choirs get the deal closed, I am wondering like what are the requirements, any potential the closed bit sooner than first of 2017, now just given the quick turnaround time we saw with the NASDAQ CBOE transaction.","Ed Tilly","Great question. There is obviously with the frost it's being ready from an integration perspective as well, so the teams are working diligently on being prepared, should we be able to close earlier so while we maintain that we are ready for the second half of 2017 and our planning is really -- sorry, first half of 2017 our planning is perhaps much more aggressive than that. Now that said, it is very difficult to predict the various examinations and primarily an antitrust. And the rule filings are required for both Bats in CBOE's perspective so why we think things will go smoothly, and eventually we will get through whatever the requirements are in an antitrust inspection, we will be ready to hit the ground running with an integration team that is preparing for an early earlier close. So again can't get more specific other than to tell you we will be ready. ","Christopher Allen","Thanks.","John Deters","Maybe one more point as for the on procedural mechanics, this is John by the way, the procedure on mechanics just remind people on what we discussed on the initial announcement call, we have shareholder goals from both companies, we anticipate those occurring. Likely in early in 2017 prior to that, obviously joint proxy statement of registration -- the registration statement to be filed, and we're currently making the full host of a regulatory approvals applications for those approvals in U.S. and Europe, and on the 19, of October so just recently both CBOE an Bats, further notification report forms under HSR [ph] to the FTC and the department of justice, so things are moving along as anticipated. ","Christopher Allen","Thanks, helpful.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from [indiscernible] with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys, good morning, so appreciated the growth that you guys highlighted across various products in the volumes said, but I guess taking a step back, total revenues year-to-date up in 1% and operating income is down a couple percent, so when you take a step back and you spend a little bit more time, just given, give us a sense, what kind of organic growth opportunities you guys can see on the top line with the Bats combination? ","Ed Tilly","So, sure, so what we've really been focused on is part of the deal is really what these companies can do together, and the transaction is really bringing the complementary strengths of both of the companies, if we look at those product lines and the opportunity, is really maintaining the core, what is CBOE what have we done in the past and that is to bring to the marketplace, all of the products services benchmarks that we have done in the past, we will not lose side of that. Bats as the of second largest U.S. operator in U.S. equities, operating a platform in Europe, that combination allows us from a business developer perspective, to reach a cross to cross sell to develop new products and services that we wouldn't be able to do together. I love to give you a great example of businesses that we have been involved with in the past, and specifically, we've been very much partners with ETP providers, and I think the greatest example of that for us, is partnering with Barclays and the VXX the most successful for us, when we look at volatility ETP's that been brought to the market. ","In partnering and helping design at being an integral part in bringing it at concept like ETP to market, or ETN to market, we haven't participated in the volume related to that ETN or ETP training, with Bats listing platform, conceptually we can take the idea of a new ETN or ETP, right from the force of that idea, developed with our partner list that ETN or ETP on our new listing exchange, participate that in the volume resulting from the trading of the ETP, the construction and the index services around that ETN or ETP, and that is a back end, participate on the market data as a result, so this ecosystem for CBOE and product development now beginning with the concept moving to listing all the way to market data, changes because of this combination. Both of our companies really couldn't do this alone, but that's an example of some of the opportunities that we look forward to working with our new partner. ","Alan Dean","Alex, this is the Alan, I want to add little bit more collar on the year-over-year comparison that you started out was in -- you have to keep in mind that 2015 included the blow out third quarter, which included August of 2015, it was continuing drops in oil prices, questions about the economy in China we set many volume records in the third quarter of last year, and so that's a tough comparison and to be equal to the net this year compared to last year, when last year has that quarter long , I'd like to be a head, but we have on hand the blow-out quarter this year, yet I hope it's in the fourth quarter, you never know when it's going to happen, but it always does so, I think it's a little unfair just take the three quarter comparison last of this year, and then to draw any conclusions from it.","We believe our core products SPX and VIX are continuing to grow and customers and users and we're doing of education to facilitate their growth. So I want to throw that out there and make sure that you understand the third quarter 2015 is something that has to be considered. ","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, I will jump back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Hi, good morning folks. Just maybe along the lines of Bats, maybe Ed, if you can talk a little bit more now that you're past the announcement on the multi list strategy, obviously Bats is wanting the auction mechanism later this quarter and then, I think the game plan is to launch a complex order of business in the middle of next year, maybe if you could just comment on if that still in the predicted timeline, and how the CBOE team is involved in that launch. ","Ed Tilly","So to be really clear as our attorneys are staring me down right now; we're not involved in in the Bats decision on how to time the rollouts of their planed auction mechanism and or spread book. But now part of the deal which we're very much mindful of, is the opportunity to operate these different medallions with different strategies, so we definitely part of the diligence appreciate the time on that Bats has already been public on. So our planning in the integration is certainly mindful of that. So this goal as and what we have said on September 26, is to take CBOEs very successful traditional market model and through them the acquisition be able to offer alongside of that Bats has been very successful maker-taker time price priorities algorithm, and having our two other medallions at the end of the acquisition, be able to offer services and pricing schemes that are different -- that are very smart are each of our most successful exchanges.","So we are mindful of that rollout schedule, at the end of the day whose goal is obviously to migrate all of these auctions, excuse the word of auctions, all of these platforms onto one proven technology that is the Bats platform and looking very much forward to explaining those differences and different schemes algorithms in pricing to our combined customer base. ","Brian Bedell","Very good great, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you and the next question from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt ","Hi good morning, thanks for taking my question. Just a broad question I guess on U.S. options industry wide volume, is multi list side is down 3.5% year-over-year so far in 2016 after declined and last year 3% even less elevated volatility last year, and I appreciate the index options volumes are faring a bit better and I think a growth of something like 3% this year. But the growth rates risen are still significantly below historical norms, so I am just wondering if you can give an update thoughts as to what's going on in the options industry to cause this and what it might take for the industry to return to more normal historical growth rates. ","Ed Provost","Hey Kyle, this is Ed Provost. I'll take a shot at that, it's tough to try to discern the macro trends of the marketplace in general, but I think as was noted in this week's Barrens [ph], Steve's article about the increase in passive investing, there is a general shift away from single stock trading toward more index like trading, and passive investing. I think it's the combination of the lower volatility and those trends, those general trends in the marketplace it may explain why the overall option volume and multiply was that classes is more muted [ph] that point is muted in ATF options and certainly as we've seen in our index products, we have seen great growth. So I'm going to -- I'm going to say that the general trend toward passive investing and that generally muted volatility overall is probably the best explanations but truthfully I don't know that any of us can know with 100% certainty. I can assure you that the OCC isn't very actively engaged in their educational activities around the multiply traded options, while we focus very heavily on our proprietary products. ","Kyle Voigt ","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from Alice [ph] with UBS.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning. Just very quick for Alan, I guess. On the expense, this clearly you lowered the guidance maybe can talk a little bit more about -- just thinking is this kind of like the industry volume environments is little bit tougher, so you started by cutting expense a little bit in the third quarter. Is it the Bats is saying; hey we're cutting some of these projects or -- and the just connected to that you still have a pretty decent ramp I think in the fourth quarter, when you look at the low end of your guidance, it was below that. So just to remind us what's coming in the fourth quarter here that bring that up.","Alan Dean","So our approach towards expanses is the same in the third quarter, fourth quarter as was a year ago we are very careful about how we spend money. The $211 million the $215 million spent, the guidance that would that we gave you earlier this year and that we maintain this year's expenses that we fully expected to spend. It -- a part of the reduction from that guidance is incentive compensation, which is there is a core expenses but it is somewhat variable because it's tied to our net income. So that's down a bit compared to what I thought it would be. It's hard for me to point any one item or a group of items that would be going up in the fourth quarter compared to earlier this year. Other than it's consistent with our business plan, what we're thinking on expenses and so to come in slightly below the guidance that we gave you earlier this year, I feel pretty good about. And there isn't a whole lot more clarity that I can give you beyond that. ","Ed Tilly","I want to make a comment, this is Ed, Alice good morning. I want to make a comment that the planning and that looking forward that to Bats and the combination. That does not sideline the core business that we've begun here, so our projects and in that we had outlined as far as education and next services a new product creation, that remains on track. We know what we're good at here that's going to be part of this business going forward with that. So all of the products that we have targeted for this year, our online and that we know that's going to core of this is going forward. ","Unidentified Analyst","All right, very good. I will jump back in the queue, thanks. ","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from Mike Carrier from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. ","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning guys. This is actually Steve [ph] on Mike Carrier, thanks for taking my question. I just want to focus on the balance sheet a bit and the capital management I know in the near term we share repurchases, will be put on hold until leverage comes down. However, Alan, giving updates of what you think your future minimum cash needs will be post to deal. ","Alan Dean ","And then that's not far different from what we told you before, in the past I've said a $40 million to $70 million, I would move that up to maybe $50 million to $100 million, but so not a significant change. And certainly not impactful on how we approach capital allocation or it wouldn't be impact upon our ability to pay down debt or grow dividends as our business grows, or reinvest in our business, or take advantage of strategic initiative sell. The -- our cash requirements really are changing that watch. ","Unidentified Analyst","Perfect thanks, Alan.","Operator","Thank you and our next question from Christian [ph] from Credit Suisse.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning guys. On target based invest in, feels like a very interesting opportunity for you. Maybe can you speak to what the bottom line contribution is today. From the index is that you what you have already launched. And then if you are trying to sell these indexes to asset managers, maybe speak to some of the push back what challenges you are hearing from them. ","John Deters ","Chris, this is John Deters, I will take this one. So we you really gave a wide range of indexes, many are proprietary CBOE so basically CBOE inventions like the VIX, like the [indiscernible] index. Those indexes we license and we've got robust activity around licensing those indexes. And for other indexes we provide custom index services to third parties, who come with ideas and need a sophisticated calculations services provider. We find that are independence in the index world certainly does position us well to be an index services provided to asset managers. And at the same time we really understand the strategies applying because we we've utilized index products in our markets, in the form of future's auctions.","And now with our own asset management affiliate with CMOE Bats we're utilizing many of those strategies, index based strategies and package part of our loan. So we think touching on all parts of the of the index and package part -- ecosystem given -- ecosystem gives us kind of unique insight into the uses, the needs of asset managers.","Ed Tilly","With that am not sure exactly what you had in mind Chris, when you say push back from asset managers.","Unidentified Analyst","What kind of any challenges that the asset managers are talking about, that's prevented them from using these products more?","Ed Tilly","Yes, well I mean one of the first challenges is really in -- as index strategies become more complex, for example index strategies that incorporate options overlay components, in various derivative overlays. There are a very small handful of index calculation services providers globally who can pull widely, reliably service that they need, so we're actually because selling into accommodative market if you will, because we provide those services for a good many years, and we're very confident our team ability to perform those services.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Great, thanks for the color, very helpful. ","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning, just a question of compensation I believe the incentive tied to pretax income level, so wandering if you changed your accrue in the third quarter? If there is any reversals or whether that would be a catch up at the end of the year if you come below that target? ","Ed Tilly","Great question, route that right -- to describe that tied to pre-tax income goals that we set at the beginning of the year. The reversals of instead I'd say we didn't know accrue as much as we would have liked to because on the year-to-date basis pretax income is lower than our goal so. I don't see a catch up in the fourth quarter and last pretax income is wonderful I hope it is, I hope I miss our core -- of incentive compensation being a lot higher than I expect right now. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And the last question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. ","Chris Harris ","Thanks. Hey guys, sorry I got in late, so apologies if this was asked, so the expense growth for this year and on a core basis around 70% or so maybe, I know we're not giving official guidance on 2017 yet. But if you think about the trajectory were there some things that were included expense base this year that maybe not be flowing into next year, I think that there might be one, so kind of any thoughts is that how we should maybe be thinking about that the trajectory expense growth going into next year.","Ed Tilly","Great question. No, Vector [ph] factor was not a factor in our expense growth this year versus last year everything we've done on Vector [ph] director so far, with the exception of someone up front planning is all been capitalized in this resting on our balance sheet. So no, that what happened this year what accounts for the 7% growth which is higher than the inflationary rate that we are which is our goal of growth year-over-year. What's happened this year is couple of things we had Growth in the regulatory expenses tied to outsourcing of what we do over to fend run that was contractual that but that was offset by our ability to increase revenue so that but that was part of it the other part was Livevol we purchase Livevol august of last year, so we have a full year of expenses of Livevol this year versus only with four months last year. That's another reason for the -- outside expense growth.","And then the last one, it's [indiscernible] which are completely offset the expense, so no impact. VAS [ph] is adding two expenses to us this year. We started consolidating the results into our financial statements earlier this year, I think it was February. And so that's having a minor impact in our expense growth this year. So next year our goal and expense growth year-over-year is that inflationary rate that 3% to 5% -- actually I feel lot better at 3% than I do at 5% but that's our goal. That hasn't changed in the 6.5 years that we've been a public company, that's always been our goal because if you don't control expenses, then operating leverage that exchanges and certainly we do as well, you lose out on some of that it you lose control of expenses. So we were mindful of that and -- so now should be no surprises next year, if there are -- then they have revenue attached to them or some other mitigating factor.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Patrick [ph] with Raymond James.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, guys. And question about what you're seeing out there from retail right now because we've had a couple of interesting, consolidating deals in the retail broker space and their trades really want to cross-sell it, options capability to trade customers, you trade once the leverage option house to join more options traded from its customers, so that seems like it will be a positive but then maybe the headwind -- it seems like maybe we're seeing future as an alternative to options, little bit more in the retail space and CME is talking about a big retail initiative. So what are you seeing out there from retail right now?","Ed Tilly","Yes, those mergers and consolidations we've seen as having options in derivatives as significant driving force. We know that the brokerage firm see these products as we provide here as significant contributors to their bottom line, looking to optimize both technology and clients under a single trading platform. So we look at that as all very positive for our business and we see and support the promotion of our products through those firms. So we're very, very pleased with that. As to the future's initiatives and options, the future exchanges; we are aware of that. We monitor that, we engage with our clients about the use of that. We do not see any degradation of our volume or movement of our volume from our products on the security side to the CFTC side. We actually think it can be complementary to our business, whether it's cross-hedging and opportunities like that. So all of what we're seeing in the brokerage business in terms of the consolidation we think speaks very positively to our products and we think the growth of our products has something to do with those transitions taking place.","Ed Provost","I want to add, this is Ed. I'd like to add a little bit to that. So the way we view any educational -- change in education or focus in education, it's moving into broad-based trading and hedging. We're in favor, any opportunity to grow this pie as opposed to just moving [indiscernible] flow around and market share around, we are very much the educators, we align ourselves and partner with the retail firms, so we can bring new users to the marketplace, that's what we will be participating and helping our retail partners with.","Unidentified Analyst","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from Alice [ph] with UBS.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. Just one quick one -- I think -- but when you think about things that are happening outside of your control, I think there is a couple of items that are possible notable for the options industry, one is the OCC's raising fees I think in December so maybe that did see some friction. And then I think at the beginning of next year, although maybe that's getting pushed out as the tax change at 871M, I guess. So just wondering if there is any commentary on both those items, how they impact the industry and is there something we should be worried about or is there any opportunities around that? Thanks.","Ed Tilly","So each of the one -- just to remind everyone, else it's really the -- in position of the U.S. tax and dividend equivalents for foreign investors, so you can't get us into the weeks that are out, straight question. We think it's extremely complicated. We think it will be very, very difficult to monitor from a retail perspective and really what this is, is the combination of option, strategies that result in 80 delta combinations or standalone option strategies and the effective withholding from a foreign investor as a stock equivalent to avoid paying taxes on dividends. The monitoring and implementation of this is extremely costly. CBOE has partnered with OCC and we've been very vocal and written a number of letters on this.","So we are concerned but at the end of the day, this from CVV's perspective -- you know our mix, you know our breakdown and where our revenues come from. We don't think this will as material to CBOEs, it might be from some of our other competitors who are much more reliant on single name options in their dividend flow. So we're doing the majority of the lift with our partners at OCC, we're partnered with the retailers who have all made comments in this. So complying is going to be difficult, we've asked for extensions on this so that we can all get ready to monitor and track through combinations in single option strategy maintaining and watching this AV delta threshold.","So as provided I was just going to say as to your -- the portion of your question Alex on the -- any accretion fees, whether it be an OCC fee and exchange fee. It's never a positive to the customer experience, all that being said, the industry affords a very low cost of doing business. The brokerage firms who are highly focused in this area of the business are very, very competitive in the conditions that end-user customers ultimately pay. We don't think that those fees will have any material impact on customer business going forward but certainly we would rather not see fee increases because cost of doing business is always going to have some impact on the amount of business being done.","Unidentified Analyst","Very good. Thank you again.","Operator","Thank you. Next is another follow-up, this is from Chris Allen with Buckingham.","Christopher Allen","I wanted to ask about the -- your synergies you guys laid off for the bad steel, you obviously have the integration planning going on board. I'm just wondering if there is -- you have any kind of updated thoughts. So we kind of look at the trade technology moving over from that and over half of your headcount in trading support development and then a sizeable amount of consulting fees would the technology in services; it seems like there could be upside to the synergies?","Alan Dean","Chris, this is Alan. At this point I don't have any updates for you on synergies. We are in the middle of integration, the planning process right now and so it's really premature for me to update that for you. I -- we'll reiterate that I'm highly confident that the synergy numbers that we came out with when we announced the transaction with bets are -- were highly achievable. I still believe that hasn't changed. And they are focused on IT as you mentioned. As I get more clarity, if there is something material, I'll certainly update you and other analysts as we go through this but right now nothing new other than to reiterate -- I feel good about those numbers.","Christopher Allen","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And as there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to return the call to management for any closing comments.","Debbie Koopman","Thank you. That completes our call this morning. We appreciate everyone's participation today and your interest in CBOE. We look forward to speaking you at future calls and I will be available today for any follow-up questions.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after this conference call.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Bill Brodsky.","William Brodsky","Thank you, Debbie, and good afternoon. Thanks for joining us. I\u2019m pleased to report that fiscal year 2012 began with another strong quarter at CBOE Holdings. We delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings per share growth on an adjusted basis, as well as significant gains in market share. Moreover, we achieved solid financial results, despite lower industry-wide trading volumes by prudently managing expenses, while investing in future growth.","Our company\u2019s mission is to create value for stockholders by generating industry-leading profit margins and growth rates who will diversify portfolio of risk management products and services. It is our mission to operate as a sub-regulatory organization with the highest integrity and confidence and to create an effective compliance in regulatory structure that functions as a trusted financial institution that provides all market participants and investors for the market price is reliable, efficient, and fair.","We issued annual 10-K filing disclosed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as investigating CBOE\u2019s compliance with its obligation to the sub regulatory organizations. And the CBOE is simultaneously conducting its own review of its compliance.","We are unable to comment on the SEC\u2019s investigation except to say that we continue to cooperate. We have conducted a rigorous self-examination of practice throughout our exchanges and we\u2019re sharing the results of that review with the SEC.","In the past two years CBOE has navigated significant shift in our business and our ownership model. Our self-examination is an exhaustive inventory of all of our processes and practices to ensure that the highest ethical standards are embedded in every aspect of our current operation.","This past quarter we instituted company-wide educational seminars, the detail have the requirements of the SEC and our own rules applied to CBOE as well as, as an SRO. We have also begun to realign and add senior staff to key areas beginning with the recent announcement of our new Chief Compliance Officer. Additional new hires and appointments will be made in the weeks and months ahead.","Our entire organization is fully engaged in this process, and we are confident of our teams collective ability to deliver the highest standards for regulatory and compliance excellence.","Moving on now to update on our three key strategic initiatives for 2012, product developments, particularly focusing on our high margin proprietary products, optimizing revenue and market share and commoditized products and broadening our customer base. I\u2019ll report on each initiatives and then focus the balance of my remarks on a major new technological initiatives currently underway, which will have significant long-term benefits throughout our company.","Turning first to product developments. As you know, nurturing the early growth of SPXpm, our newly launched electronic S&P 500 option products is a primary focus to CBOE in 2012. With experiences is our guide, we aim to establish traction and steady growth by working closely with early adopters. At the same time we expanded a comprehensive market and educational program and send it to increase awareness and understanding of SPXpm to a broader audience of likely potential users.","I\u2019m pleased to report that trading in SPXpm continues to gain traction, despite turning the depressed industry-wide trading, since the products they viewed on October 2011. We are very encouraged both by customer feedback and trading activity. Monthly trading volume in the first quarter saw a steady sequential gains and average daily volume increased 16% over the prior quarter. It is gratifying to note that the open interest in SPXpm continues to build copying the 100,000 contract mark for the first time in March and April. I should also mention that open interest of 100, 000 contracts in SPXpm is the no show equivalent to open interest in 1 million spider contracts.","In addition to grow SPXpm we were also expanding our VIX product line in 2012. Fixed options and futures continue to show tremendous growth even in low volume, low volatility trading environments. First quarter VIX options average daily volume rose 36% over the previous quarter and 4% over the first quarter of 2011 while trading in VIX futures continue to ride wave of dramatic record breaking growth. Really 2 million VIX future contracts changed in March 2012 the product\u2019s busiest month ever.","Volume for the first quarter of 2012 reached a record of 4.1 million contracts topping the previous quarter by 74% and the first quarter of 2011 by 57%. To put those figures in perspective, it should be noted that VIX featured a 10 times the size of VIX Options. VIX Futures growth is fueled in part by growing number of exchange trading products tied to the VIX Index. These products are brought to market by major firms, which CBOE views as partners in growing the volatility phase.","There are currently more than 45 ETPs for the assets under management of $5.1 billion, an increase of 82% from December 2011 followed up $2.8 billion. We continue to expand our volatility marketplace by increasing awareness of CBOE as the world\u2019s go-to source for volatility education and to expanding our roster of tools to help investors understand, calculate, and trade volatility.","In March, we began publishing values of CBOE, VIX, VIX Index, which is VVIX, which as and implies tracks of volatility in the VIX Index. VVIX was developed for volatility traders seeking ways to formulate strategies based on the relationship between market volatility as measured by the VIX Index and the volatility of the index itself.","This stage puts a significance of the VIX Index as the market indicator and we are pleased to offer benchmark tracking with worlds most watched volatility index. In all, CBOE Holdings now offers more than two dozen volatility benchmarks and strategies, which is real-time option prices to variety of investors with a snapshot of expected volatility in various asset classes, also the benchmarks a meaningful value ads that keep customers coming back to CBOE to our website, through our options as a suite, and to our trading facilities.","We often see customers demand for tradable products tied to volatility benchmarks that proved to be a particular benefit in measuring and creating trading strategies such as the case with CBOEs ETF Volatility Indexes. In 2011, CBOE rolled out six benchmarks designed to monitor volatility in highly active sector specific ETS. This year based on customer demand, we introduced security features and options on three of them, the CBOE Emerging Markets ETF Volatility Index., the CBOE Brazil ETF Volatility Index and most recently CBOE Crude Oil ETF Volatility Index.","We look forward to further expanding our decks product line in the months ahead. We are pleased to announce last week that CFE completed agreements with DRW Trading Group that allows us to create variant features that were more of a coding conventions and economic performance of OTC stock index variance swaps. By combining the conventions of OTC variance swaps with the benefit of exchange traded features reaching out for meaningful benefits to OTC index as well as customers who are not traditionally participating in the large OTC variance swap markets.","We plan to initially introduce a new feature contract based on the variance of the S&P 500 later this year subject to regulatory approval. Currently, variance swaps in the S&P 500 index are estimated to trade $10 million vega notional per day in each \u2013 in the OTC market. Vega is the dollar exposure to changes in volatility. At the reference clients each VIX Futures contract is equal to $1,000 of vega.","Now, to report on the second of our three major strategic initiatives for 2012, the optimization of revenue and market share in commoditized products, we achieved considerable market share gains in the first quarter as a result of the January implementation of our new Volume Incentive Program VIP at CBOE. So volume gains are afforded by VIP were supplemented by incremental order flows, where is our marketplace we see still are fully electronic make or taker model.","We\u2019ve seen a very positive customer response to VIP, which pays credits to permit \u2013 to \u2013 excuse me to permit holders for executing certain types and levels of business at CBOE. Alan will discuss the results in greater detail, but I am pleased to report that CBOE\u2019s market share in multi list options excluding dividend trade increased by 3.9 percentage points to 22% in March compared to 19.1% in December of 2011.","Moving on now to our third strategic initiative to expand our customer base through targeted business development programs. The OTC opportunity is significant for CBOE Holdings, given that we offer many proprietary products that are well suited for this market. We see current OTC market participants increasingly turn to exchange trading alternatives both in response to a post crisis focus on systemic risk management to anticipate a change in OTC trading likely to result from the implementation of Dodd-Frank.","FLEX trading and CBOE\u2019s proprietary products for instance grew 21% in 2011 and increased 24% in the first quarter of 2012. This increase was driven in part by dealer bank facilitating customer orders, as well as insurance companies and created this structure products that have begun using flex options and loads of OTC trading. With this terrific growth in mind and with the potential from greater growth in the horizon, we developed customized trading technology called CFLEX 2.0 to better serve the market.","CFLEX 2.0 will enable our customers to conveniently access flex options with the same CBOE interface that they use for regular options trading, built entirely in-house. The new CFLEX technology will feature CBOEs automated improvement mechanism, which we call AIM, which we expect will be enthusiastically embraced by FLEX and OTC users. We began a gradual roll of CFLEX 2.0 last week and we expected to be fully functional by the end of the quarter.","CFLEX 2.0 is a major systems enhancement. We expect to delve in and at itself attract additional trading for the CBOE marketplace, but it\u2019s also the centre piece of the major technology initiative that I referred at the beginning of this call.","I\u2019m very pleased to announce that CFLEX 2.0 marks the beginning of the rollout of our company\u2019s new trade engine technology called CBOE Command, which will accommodate in the anticipated fourth quarter move of our CBOE and CFE service from Chicago to Secaucus, New Jersey, where C2 and CBOE stock change data centers are already located. CBOE Command and then you will be hearing frequently in the months ahead and I would like to take a moment to buy some context and what it means for company and our customers.","It is important to know that system development is deeply embedded in our value proposition, while every exchange aims to provide fast and more efficient trading technology. CBOE systems are also uniquely developed the power innovation. Our systems are designed in-house and engineered for maximum flexibility and scalability, enabling us to cost effectively launch new products and when appropriate new exchanges to trade those products. Our bench trading technology is in fact the unsung hero that has enabled us to successfully launch and trade our premium products such as S&P 500 Options and VIX Options in Futures.","When we set up to introduce our volatility products for instance, we determined that the optimal path to market with the level of futures products, while partnering with the futures exchange might have been the obvious next step we were able instead to leverage our systems expertise and scalable technology to efficiently, cost effectively, and independently rollout the CBOE futures exchange. We later followed with VIX options and the rest of its history.","Our SEC options complex illustrates a similar union of products and systems innovation. Each of our SPX products is supported by customized trading technology, tell us a specific trading need. SPX, the index option of choice for large institutional orders is supported by the tremendous liquidity on CBOE trading floor. SPXpm, which trades electronically on C2 guide us to the point and quick customer and SPXpm weekly blend both open outside and electronic trading.","To our 2012 rollout, CBOE commend will add significant system upgrades, resulting in an even more robust trading platform. Our expanded platform will provide customers with the most comprehensive array of options and volatility products in the world but it will also place at their command, newly customized ways to access and trade those products.","The fourth quarter of our \u2013 fourth quarter move of our service to the east coast will provide customers with more features and even faster access to CBOE options and futures data than ever before. It is a pleasure to announce that the next-generation of trade engine technology of CBOE Holdings. And with that I will now turn it over to Alan Dean to give you the financial report.","Alan Dean","Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bill mentioned, we delivered solid first quarter results despite lower trading volume, industry wise. Our ability to delve our bottom line consistently even in challenging market conditions highlight the underlying strength of our products offerings and are focused on managing costs while investing in long-term growth.","Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders were $33 million up 2% from one year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per share has reached 3% from one year ago to $0.37. While operating revenues of $121.4 million declined 2% from one year ago, adjusted operating expenses were down 3% and adjusted operating margins increased by 80 basis points to 47.5%.","Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the first quarter of 2012 and 2011 include certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide back.","To gain a better understanding of the key drivers during the quarter, let me begin with the operating revenues. As shown on this slide, operating revenues decreased by $2.6 million or 2% in the first quarter from one year ago. The decrease reflects declines in transaction fees and access fees offset significantly by strong growth in exchange services and other fees and market data fees.","Bill (inaudible) January 3, fee changes which included the introduction of a new volume of incentive program and revamping our liquidity provider sliding fee scale to exclude our proprietary products. These changes were designed to drive incremental volume to our exchanges, leverage the strength of our proprietary products and maintain competitive pricing across all of our service areas.","We realized significant gains in market share as a result of the changes and subsequently made additional adjustments to fine tune and optimize our revenues and expenses given our increasingly competitive position. As always, we will continue to monitor our fees to ensure that we are competitive and make prudent adjustments accordingly.","Turning to the next slide, you will see that the $5.1 million or 6% decrease in transaction fees was primarily driven by a 4% decline in trading volume combined with a 2% decrease in the average revenue per contract, or RPC. RPC decreased to $0.28 compared with $0.285 in the first quarter of 2011.","On our last call, we said that we expected the fee changes to decrease the RPC in equity options, increase the RPC for index options, and index futures and result in little or no change in the RPC for ETF options. For the most part that is what occurred during the first quarter. The lower RPC and equity and ETF options was due to the credit paid (inaudible) program and higher volume discount for liquidity providers for short sliding fee scale which we set at the beginning of each year.","Volume discounts for liquidity providers a multiple list of products were up as liquidity providers traded more as a result of the increased market share brought to CBOE through VIP. Conversely we saw the RPC for index options and futures products increased as a result of other fee adjustments made at the beginning of the year significantly offsetting the RPC defined and multiply listed option.","Looking at the mix of contracts traded index options accounted for 24% of total contracts traded in the first quarter of this year in comparison with 28% in the previous quarter and 23.1% in last year\u2019s first quarter. Futures contracts our highest margin product accounted for 1.4% of our total volumes versus just less than 1% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and last year\u2019s first quarter. Trading and equity options increased to 47.5% of the total, compared with 39.4% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 31.3% in last year\u2019s first quarter. Excess fees in the first quarter were down year-over-year and sequentially primarily as a result of our 2012 results.","The number of trading permits held steady during the quarter. We also saw an increase in the number of pulmonologists taking advantage of our exciting skilled pricing. As a reminder and return for their discount, we get a full year commitment to those trading permits. Exchange services and other fees increased by $2.7 million, up 57% over one year ago, again reflecting pre-modifications.","If you annualize the first quarter revenue of $7.4 million, it does exceed our full year guidance of $24 million to $26 million. However I\u2019m maintaining the guidance because there is often a lag in customer response to these types of changes.","Market data fees were $1.3 million or 25% primary as a result of higher op revenue allocated to CBOE and increased revenue from CBOE\u2019s market data services. CBOE\u2019s market share gains resulted in a higher share total of total options transactions cleared which is the basis for allocating op income.","Moving to expenses, this next slide show our adjusted operating expenses of $63.8, which were down 3% compared with last year\u2019s first quarter and relatively flat compared with the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating expenses exclude accelerated stock-based compensation.","As we expected first quarter, core operating expenses were up 3% to $41.6 million from $40.6 million in the first quarter of 2011 due to increases in outside services, travel and promotional expense and data processing.","Outside services were up due to the higher expenditures for contract programmers. The increase in travel and promotional expenses occurred due to our ongoing advertising campaign to build awareness for VIX product and SPXpm. The higher data processing expenses primarily resulted from costs associated with moving our systems to the east coast and with related enhancements.","Volume-based expenses, which include royalty fees and trading volume incentives declined $3.1 million versus last year\u2019s first quarter due to a decline in trading volume incentives. This increase was primarily due to the changes in criteria for contracts that quality for the quantity-based fee waivers. Our success on bringing more customer (inaudible) CBOE would allow us to make things expense reduction. Royalty fees were basically even with last year\u2019s first quarter.","Overall, we have very successfully controlled expenses and that translates into improved margin and income. As you can see from this slide, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $57.6 million resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 47.5%, up 80 basis points compared with 46.7% in last year\u2019s first quarter, representing our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. We reported an effective tax rate of 41.3% versus 42.2% in last year\u2019s first quarter. The tax rate decreased reflects the benefit of the new Illinois a portion of factor.","Turning to the balance sheet as shown on this slide, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $148.6 million, compared to $134.9 million at the end of 2011. Our balance sheet remains debt free and we continue to generate significant cash.","We generated nearly $63 million in cash flow from operations for the quarter and continue to return cash to stockholders through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. At the ended of the quarter, we had $28 million remaining on our $100 million share authorization. We remain committed to returning excess capital to stockholders. And in less than two years, we have returned more than $565 million to stockholders through share repurchase, tender offers and dividend payments.","Our board will continues to consider all available alternatives as we look for the multi efficient way to enhance long returns to stockholders. Finally capital expenditures for the quarter were $7.9 million when annualized this is in line with our guidance of $30 million to $35 million for the year. As noted in our press release, we are maintaining our 2012 guidance that we provided to you on February 8, and is shown here.","I would also note that our guidance does include expenses related to the initiatives that Bill outlined today. Looking ahead, we remain extremely optimistic about our long-term growth prospects and belief we are well positioned to generate even stronger financial results as investors regain confidence in the equity markets and trading volume picks up.","With that I will hand the call over to Debbie so we can take your questions. Thank you very much.","Deborah Koopman","At this time we will be happy to take questions. We will ask that you limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone, feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits we will take a second question.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Richard Repetto with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead with your question.","Richard Repetto \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Yeah, hi, Bill and Alan, and Ed and Tilly. I guess the question is you did make some aggressive moves with the volume incentive program and you\u2019re seeing some market share shifts, but you are seeing some RPC declines as well. And I was wondering have we done the analysis or how would you evaluate the overall changes, was it beneficial we\u2019re going through the numbers now, but how did you look at it as versus if you would have maintained just the same market share the same RPC last quarter.","Alan Dean","Yeah, hi, Rich. This is, Alan, yeah, there are so many moving parts that you have to look at doing that analysis such as product mix, pricing changes made during the quarter, changes unusual behavior as well as market conditions. You just can\u2019t look at transaction fees as you alluded to, you have to look at the entire picture including market data fees, which are significantly up this quarter, trading volume incentive expenses, which as you saw are down, because of the changes we made during the quarter, and those changes were made possible by the increased market share coming from VIP. Demand from trading permit holders continues to stay strong and I believe that VIP was somewhat responsible for that.","Exchange services and other fees another line item that was up significantly this quarter, turned out to be really good, better than the guidance that we provided. And again I believe that VIP was helpful in allowing us to maintain the demand in that revenue line item.","And finally, the additional market share certainly added to our liquidity enhancing the quality of our markets, which helps a lot of things. So overall I feel that CBOE financially benefited from VIP and increase in the market share that resulted.","Richard Repetto \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions.","Alexander Kramm \u2013 UBS","Hey good evening. Maybe just saying what Rich said here on the \u2013 I guess VIP experiments I think you\u2019ve said on the prepared remarks, you made some changes following the original program. So can you just talk us a little bit how should be thinking about RPCs and overall revenue in line of those changes? Thank you.","Alan Dean","This is Alan; we did make some changes, even recently, effective today that we made another change in the VIP program. I think you should look at our revenue per contract similar to the way I tried to frame it, after our fourth quarter earnings call, which is that \u2013 more market share would probably result in a declining RPC for equity options and maybe ETF options, which is a good thing because you see so many other line items are positively affected by that.","And if you saw market share hold steady then I think it would be reasonable to assume that RPC also would hold steady and the (inaudible) classes specifically equity options and ETF options.","Alexander Kramm \u2013 UBS","All right, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Jillian Miller \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thanks guys. Before getting towards the end of your buyback authorization, just wondering, the intent is going forward is a further authorization something you\u2019ve already been in dialog with the board about \u2013 and I guess there is more generally, how you\u2019re thinking about capital returns strategy going forward because they are building out some cash in the balance sheet maybe if you can give us a sense for whether you\u2019d be more likely to raise the dividend or increase fee buyback pays with excess capital? Thanks.","Alan Dean","Yes, Alan Dean again. Let me first remind you that since our IPO barely two years ago and this was in my prepared remarks. We have returned over $565 million to our shareholders to stack repurchases, buybacks, dividends. And our policy hasn\u2019t changed the policy of the board. First we look to reinvest in our business and after that we\u2019ll look to return all excess capital to our shareholders to enhance the long-term return in the value of their holdings in CBOE.","Now as far as our current stock repurchase program all I can say at this point is that we intend to continue, complete the problem and just as we were before, we intend to be opportunistic on how we do that.","Jillian Miller \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Carrier \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks guys. Maybe just a question on expenses, it looks like, the run rate as far has been on the low end or even better, in low end of the guidance for the full year. So, I guess first is there somebody\u2019s new initiatives that you discussed, at the beginning to some of these kick in and so we would expect the expense run rate to start the ramp up, or is it maybe just more likely to be at the lower end of that guidance range?","Alan Dean","Alan Dean again, if you take our core expenses for the quarter and multiple then by them by four certainly, we are under our \u2013 the annual guidance that we gave you. However, if you take the same core operating expenses for the quarter and compare them to the core expenses for the first quarter of last year, they are actually up 3%, which is a lot closer in line with the guidance that we gave to you three months ago, which is an increase of 4% to 7% over the last year.","And also, I do expect some expenses to ramp up as we go through the year. So consequently, we\u2019re maintaining in our expense guidance of $173 million to $178 million for 2012 and that does represent a 47% increase over 2011, which all by itself was kind of depressed because we did \u2013 we were tight with our expense recall, expense control last year.","Michael Carrier \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nim Alexander with KBW. Please go ahead with your question.","Niamh Alexander \u2013 KBW","Hi, thanks for taking my question. On the technology initiatives and is there ways to quantity maybe the spend, or is it most of the spends behind you kind of in the CapEx. And then what is the revenue opportunity from this are maybe new co-location fees, that you could start charging is there \u2013 is it maybe higher volume from improved latency. Could you expand a little bit more on that?","Alan Dean","Alan Dean again. The cost of CBOE command, mostly the move out to the East Coast and the functionality changes like CFLEX 2.0, they are all included within the guidance that we gave you both CapEx and our core operating expenses. We are breaking them of any further than that at this point in time.","The co-location revenue that is in that line item exchange services and other fees and co-location is one of the items that one of the fee increases that we put in at the beginning of this year and has included in that line item and partially accounts for the increase in that revenue. So beyond what we\u2019ve already done, I don\u2019t think I could count on anymore incremental revenue from co-location because of CBOE command, the changes that we\u2019re making to the functionality or to move out to the East Coast.","William Brodsky","(inaudible) what Alan saying, this Bill Brodsky, this initiative gives us additional flexibility, it does reduce the latency and it gives us tremendous advantages in terms of anything that relate to over-the-counter initiative. So it really is following through on initiatives that we had established, but the CFLEX 2.0 is something that we believe is quite significant.","Niamh Alexander \u2013 KBW","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Chen of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse","Alan, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on the exchange fees, on that you could see some delayed impact from clients. Does that mean clients what actually have to come in pull additional lines and have you seen any of that post adjusting the fee schedules on the recent months?","Alan Dean","We have seen some pullback early on, if sometimes the reaction is not immediate and it is in pulling lines, it could be something as simple as reducing their logins that you have with the CBOE command or trade engine. So, it\u2019s a fairly easy thing to do, but you don\u2019t want to do it in an environment where volume or market share is growing and volume is there. And so, I really do believe that VIP and the increase in the market share helped mitigate the lost of the bleeding (inaudible).","Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks. I mean just a quick clarification, and Alan on your commentary about, is it more based on conservatism or do you see like a pipeline of people who are collapsing log-ins and doing things like that?","Alan Dean","At this point in time, no, I don\u2019t see a line of people looking to get out or dramatically change what they are doing, but even one or two large users making a large move could dramatically impact this line items. And so it wouldn\u2019t be prudent for me to count on that revenue for the remainder of the year given that we are still so early in the year.","Howard Chen \u2013 Credit Suisse","It makes sense. Thanks a lot, Al.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy \u2013 Raymond James","Hey, good afternoon.","William Brodsky","Hey, Pat, how are you?","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy \u2013 Raymond James","Good, good. So the \u2013 your volatility franchise is obviously very important to you. How careful do you guys have to be or how much do you monitor the indexes that are tied to the VIX, obviously, there is a well published kind of disconnect this past quarter between, I think of the three VIX and the underlying VIX and how much do you worry about the harming the brand of your volatility franchise?","William Brodsky","This Will Brodsky. I think what\u2019s before I can hear is that, the index that you\u2019ve talked about really related to the use of leverage on the ETF. And I think what \u2013 the most important area is customer education, and the unique feature of leverage products, but from what we can see it appears the issuer who had the problem has addressed it, and it was a unique situation and didn\u2019t have any connection to any of the other 45 ETPs that are currently tied to our VIX.","Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy \u2013 Raymond James","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Daniel Fannon \u2013 Jefferies","Hi, good afternoon. I guess if you could just discuss kind of the competitive framework generally in the options market today and kind of how you see the potentially intensifying as the year progresses and then with that as you\u2019ve been kind of tweaking prices all we have still to date is that something we should expect you know continue based on the changes in volume?","William Brodsky","This is Will Brodsky. I will take the first crack at this. We operate in my view in the most competitive segments of exchange markets in the United States. And as a result, it is very dynamic and it is a day by day competition, so we monitor this daily and we will continue to do it. And it is the way we are operating and happily I think we\u2019ve done pretty as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Justin Schack with Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Justin Schack \u2013 Rosenblatt Securities","Hi, I\u2019ll start the question on may be different angle on the best question that Patrick asked. Can you guys breakdown how much of the VIX options for the futures volume comes from or it\u2019s related to you PTPs based on that. How I know you partially answered this when Patrick asked, but how are going about, I think it was the public size the regulator, regulators are looking at what happens with (inaudible) some speculation about the potential changes to you the structure of that market and respected relations and redemptions and what\u2019s that could have over long-term on that volume that we getting those ETPs.","William Brodsky","One of things, this is Bill again and one of things I said earlier is that there continues to growth in not only in the products, but the assets under management in these exchange traded products. And there is no doubt that as more assets are deployed in to different products, there is a clear correlation between the amount of products, the assets under management and the volume that we are seeing particularly in the VIX futures. It is just a natural thing, they\u2019re going to balance off every day and we look that as very constructive. But I just go back to what I\u2019ve said earlier and that is that there are unique features to leverage products that need not to be related to VIX there are other leveraged exchange traded products out there I think what is very important is that people need to understand about the suitability issue and they\u2019re not designed for buy and hold investors, these are unique tactical instruments.","Justin Schack \u2013 Rosenblatt Securities","Okay, thanks Bill.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Worthington of JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Kenneth Worthington \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi good evening. Just (inaudible) to VIP program a little bit more finally. You\u2019ve obviously made some changes and there is a reasonably big reaction in terms of market share, you\u2019re on the winning side, others are on the losing side. Why don\u2019t you think we\u2019ve seen bigger pricing changes, priced some of your competitors to try to neutralize the benefit that you\u2019ve seen thus far, or is it you have been making so many moves that can\u2019t quite catch up and if you look out six months I know Bill you said you are in the one of the most competitive markets, but to what extent our concerns about the stadium scenario where everybody stands up and no one can see a apply pricing here?","Alan Dean","This is Alan Dean, I think that we are in a unique position in the options industry, different from anyone else because of our proprietary products. And the SPX and VIX specifically. And having those two products allows us flexibility, I think it gives us a competitive advantage that others don\u2019t have. So there could be a reason why others have not responded as aggressively, Ed Tilly do you have anything?","Edward Tilly","Yeah, I think as we stated when we announced the VIP program early on the beginning in the year that we concentrated on a very largest consolidators of liquidity. And I think the immediate response that we are seeing most active is Philadelphia trying to go after the smaller consolidator. And with that obviously, the impact on share will be different, but it\u2019s a different targeted market. It actually circles back to a couple of questions earlier, when we continue to see pricing tweaks, we will see, we will continue to change its pricing.","Of course, it\u2019s what we do and we look at the competitive landscape and the changes even in VIP month in, month out as from our entire team that\u2019s what these guys do. So I think we will see changes going forward, we\u2019ve seen Philadelphia change, CBOE will continue to change. We will look to see to and continue to change, this is part of the business and we will continue to do that moving forward.","Kenneth Worthington \u2013 JP Morgan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Allen of Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.","Christopher Allen \u2013 Evercore","Good afternoon, guys.","William Brodsky","Good afternoon, Chris.","Alan Dean","Hi.","Christopher Allen \u2013 Evercore","I might have missed this, but can you just give us a little more color just to what\u2019s driving incremental increase and expenses moving forward. And you\u2019ve already made some hires to address some of the SEC related issues, it looks like are there more \u2013 you said there is going to be more to come, or have you all been spending on some of the seminars and kind of what else we drive \u2013 expect to drive moving forward?","Alan Dean","Well, the \u2013 let me go back to the analysis that I cannot \u2013 that I laid out and when I answered the question before. If you compare the first quarter core operating expenses of 2012, compared to the first quarter of 2011, we are up 3%. And I expect that our expenses will grow during the year even if we don\u2019t complete our move out to the East Coast. Even if we don\u2019t continue to enhance CBOE Command, and when you add all those things into the natural growth rate of expenses, that\u2019s why I believe that to expect an increase in expenses of 4% in 2012 at a minimum of over 2011 is a reasonable thing to expect.","Christopher Allen \u2013 Evercore","Good. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Justin Cressall with Morningstar Equity. Please go ahead with your question.","Gaston Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Equity","Hi, good afternoon, it\u2019s Gaston Ceron with Morningstar Equity Research. Thanks for taking my question. Just a real quick, Bill I wanted to go back to something you\u2019ve said, got to believe the sort of \u2013 I actually I am not sort of the call, and I might have heard all of that you said. But I think you\u2019re addressing some of these recent regulatory issues that are out there, and I thought you said something about possibly higher kind of expenses going forward on the regulatory front, I\u2019m curious if you have at this early stage sort of any sort of estimate of what the current run rate impact of that might be or what we should we expect sort of a modeling \u2013 for a modeling purpose for by the way cost going forward?","William Brodsky","Yeah, actually I didn\u2019t address any expenses in that regard, but Alan just did, but I will ask him to just kind of reiterate what he just said. Alan?","Gaston Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Equity","I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m also missed that, I apologize.","Alan Dean","That\u2019s okay Gaston. What I said is that, the expenses related to CFLEX related to moving out to the East Coast any other functional enhancements that we make to our trade engine CBOE Command related to regulatory enhancements, that\u2019s all included in our guidance and not incremental and that\u2019s why we see the year right now. And we are being specific about what each of those items costs.","Gaston Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Equity","All right. And anything that might come from any conversation we have regulators that\u2019s not something or especially commenting on right now or?","William Brodsky","Well, certainly we are not commenting on conversations with regulators, but I\u2019m quite frankly, I look at the whole regulatory matters an opportunity to just to take a fresh look at things. As I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve gone through dramatic changes in our whole operations in the last three to five years. And this is an opportunity to take a fresh look in the environment we are in and just do things that we think are right to do. But as Alan said, we think we can do this within the contract that the expense guidance in given.","Gaston Ceron \u2013 Morningstar Equity","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Heinz with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your questions.","Matthew Heinz \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, Good afternoon.","William Brodsky","Hi, Heinz.","Matthew Heinz \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","So we\u2019re continuing to see kind of a broad market shift towards ETF products, I guess TY and IWM relative to from your higher margin index products. Just incremental share gains, but I\u2019m wondering and how you are thinking about that trend and whether you view those products as a competitive threat or nearly just kind of complimentary to your index product suite?","William Brodsky","Yeah. Well, I\u2019m not sure I either understand or agree with your permits. The market will choose products based on what\u2019s going on when markets are not as volatile, they go to indexes when it\u2019s more volatile, they may go to individual stocks. But that certainly now \u2013 what we\u2019re seeing now, I mean you look at our VIX product lines and there is dramatic growth there, which have nothing to do with what\u2019s going on in IWM or other things.","And the other thing that we\u2019re seeing is the increased growth in our XPS line which is really attributable to whole variety of things the weeklies the fact that as VIX grows there is more volume in SPX. And this is a whole host of things that are different and as more business is done by institutions we\u2019re going to see more business in SPX. So I think these are kind of very unique products that are not necessarily related to what I\u2019ll call broader customer interest in traditional ETFs or individual equity options.","Matthew Heinz \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, let\u2019s stripping out the VIX and just how looking apples-to-apples that SPX versus FTY I mean do you think that in terms of contract count you think that\u2019s attributable to less institutional activity?","Alan Dean","Just remember that the SPX is 10 times the size of the spider and I looked at the open interest from April to \u2013 from March to April. And the decline overall in SPY and open interest with dramatically greater than the decline in SPX, I think it was 4% decline in open interest in SPX versus 16% decline in SPY. So these are numbers that we watched very carefully and I just think that you got to look at them and try to make your own analysis.","Matthew Heinz \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Ditmire with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.","Edward Ditmire \u2013 Macquarie","Most my questions has been answered, but just I had a quick housekeeping and can you tell us how much of the long LTIP award component is embedded in the comp expense in the quarter?","Alan Dean","Yeah, I think it\u2019s in the press release. And don\u2019t get it pull that out.","Deborah Koopman","2.7.","Alan Dean","Debby has got correct answer (inaudible).","Deborah Koopman","2.7 million.","Edward Ditmire \u2013 Macquarie","Okay.","Alan Dean","The $3.7 million.","Edward Ditmire \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead with your questions.","Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, good evening.","William Brodsky","Hey, Roger.","Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi. Yes on SPX scale I know you\u2019ve talked about this in the past in the last quarter about just being a sort of a long term build. I think last quarter you said you hired sales person to which for the New York area they try promote the usage of it, can you just talk to maybe what feedback has been and what where it hasn\u2019t \u2013 haven\u2019t made the penetration here I yet or where you\u2019re thinking up further tailoring in the selling efforts to drive penetration on it.","Edward Provost","Hi, Roger Ed Provo.","Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi.","Edward Provost","So we have brought on the physicians that we described in the last earnings call everybody\u2019s on board both in the New York office and in Chicago our program is not materially changed from what we have been doing since we launched the product, primary focus being active, retail, and the hedge fund community one of the people we brought in is very much in the hedge fund side of the business has tremendously strong contacts in that community and we have dialogue everyday with both current and prospective users of the product.","We remain very optimistic that this product will begin to pickup volume, the users, and the people who are looking at it with the product makes sense, it works, it\u2019s distinguishable from our SPX products and they like the market model. So we\u2019re very committed to staying on the same path that we\u2019ve been on.","William Brodsky","And let me add a little bit further, Roger, just to clarify, Ed hired that additional person not specifically for SPXpm, we are selling the complex and pushing our institutions into SPX whether it\u2019s the traditional four base the weekly contracts that has enjoyed terrific growth with the PM. So we are, as far as to say we can go as far say we are agnostic as to what our institutional users pick up from that sales effort and we are just trying to drive everything back into their propitiatory complex.","Alan Dean","Just to add one more point to add in Ed\u2019s comments and I think Bill touched on it, in his opening comments. One of the things we\u2019ve been very encouraged is the steady growth in open interest and at expiration in both March and April it did exceed a hundred thousand contracts again those are adjusted equal to a million spider contracts and we are optimistic if trend is going to continue along with average daily volume. So again we couldn\u2019t be more optimistic, but it is a long term process and much away we thought it would play out.","Roger Freeman \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jillian Miller with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Jillian Miller \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thanks. So even the volatility haven\u2019t been particularly high end February or March, the VIX complex is doing really well and I know that on the futures side, a lot of that\u2019s kind of driven by the mixed incentive products. And on the option side is that also the case or there is something else that\u2019s been driving that?","William Brodsky","I think it has to do with the \u2013 there is still the volatility space being very much at its infancy. And so volatile, low volatility environment we have lots of people who are analyzing the product coming to our seminars, learning about how volatility works and becoming new users of the products.","So that while if we saw some spec of volatility, with no doubt see an increase in volume, where we are looking at as growing the user base and in these low volatility environment these people have a lot of opportunity to focus on products like VIX that they might not be able to focus on., if there was a much more active market. I would note also that we saw a great evidence of this at our \u2013 I think with our 26th Annual Risk Management Conference in Florida, which we held in March, we had 300 buy-side institutional portfolio managers, many of them were very much concentrated in the educational seminars focused on the VIX products. So again, in this particular product, we just have a tremendous growth in the rate of new users of the product.","Jillian Miller \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay, and that\u2019s helpful. And then just quickly has there been any update on the OCC, I guess SEC approval for the clearing on the OTC, S&P options, have they gotten \u2013 I think what\u2019s kind of the \u2013 your thought on timeline there?","Edward Tilly","This is Ed Tilly. We have not seen approval, we do expect approval \u2013 the only indication we can get is when OCC shares these things with us, so I would push that out certainly, not expecting that immediately, but maybe at the end of the quarter or early next quarter.","Again, really the information will be maybe much more public by OCC, but we are learning is that there is interest and that\u2019s really exciting and encouraging to us, especially when we can look at a multipronged approach at moving OTC business to centrally cleared, to centrally \u2013 to being centrally cleared. And this complement CBOE\u2019s effort in our CFLEX 2.0, so that we can go out, Ed Provost team can go out and offer more than one alternative to OTC trading.","So it really works quite well with our timing and launching CFLEX 2.0 in the OCC\u2019s approval, pending approval to come directly to clearing. So it\u2019s just a great opportunity for us to sell the opportunity.","Jillian Miller \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Our first next question comes from Matthew Heinz of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question.","Matthew Heinz \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, just a quick follow-up on the access fees, it looks like that the annualized 1Q rate is tracking slightly below the midpoint of your previous guidance? Just wondering if there are any changes there or is everything remaining the same what would the drivers be to it is kind of getting cut off?","William Brodsky","Yeah, it just tracking just a fair below the low side of our guidance. And we haven\u2019t seen any declines in demand and we feel like that the guidance that we gave you is still important still relevant and appropriate. So we are maintaining that for the rest of the year.","Matthew Heinz \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, thank you.","Operator","I\u2019m not showing any other questions in the queue.

Our strong performance in 2018 demonstrated our ability to effectively leverage our increased global reach and expanded product line.","After a brief overview on market volatility, I will touch on high-level results for each of our business lines and highlight how we plan to build on those results in 2019. After hitting an all-time high in September, the stock market fell sharply during the fourth quarter, fueled in part by investor fears of rising interest rates, escalating trade tensions and the risk of a global recession.","In December, stocks briefly entered bear market territory before rallying to close out 2018. For the year, the S&P 500 index suffered its largest annual decline since the 2008 financial crisis falling by more than 6%. Large daily moves and rapidly changing perceptions of risk marked the fourth quarter, which was the most volatile since 2011 and was the backdrop for record trading activity in our proprietary products.","Realized volatility for the period was 24, while the VIX Index, which reflects the implied volatility of SPX options, averaged 21, an unusual inverted condition that made SPX options an especially attractive and cost-effective hedging and trading tool. Despite an 8% increase in the S&P 500 and a 35% decline in VIX Index since year-end, market observers generally agree that the higher volatility will become the new normal for stocks.","They point to the same risk factors that fueled the market correction in 2018, and warned that the robust equity returns investors enjoyed over the past 10 years are unlikely to continue.","As such, we expect that demand for equity hedges using SPX options and VIX options in futures will increase in 2019. As we frequently noted, our suite of proprietary index products provide unique and complementary tools to help investors manage risk in most any market environment. And many customers use VIX options in futures and SPX options in tandem depending on market conditions.","Given increased volatility, year-over-year trading in VIX futures rose 18% in the fourth quarter fueling the 14th consecutive record volume year in VIX futures. Fourth quarter VIX options volume, while down from the previous year increased over the previous quarter. And SPX options reached a record volume high for the sixth consecutive year and set a new record in global trading hours.","Whether branching out into new markets such as the Middle East, Scandinavia and Asia or further penetrating existing markets. The demand for education around our proprietary products has never been greater. In response, we've revamped our sales and marketing teams to better respond to key market segments and geographies with an emphasis on education.","Specific user groups we've target include commodity trading advisers, where we've seen growing use of VIX futures, but not widespread adoption. Similarly, we continue to identify asset managers and hedge funds with diversified portfolios of investments yet no allocation to volatility. We are working closely with these communities to demonstrate the powerful impact that a small allocation to volatility can have on a broad portfolio.","We saw increased demand in VIX options from the buy side in 2018 and intend to build on that trend with a focused sales campaign in 2019. Efforts are also underway to partner with sell-side banks to provide further incentives to increase VIX trading. We also plan to run a directed sales campaign focused on new and existing institutions and hedge fund community, which actively participates in the VIX complex, but where we see considerable room for growth.","In 2019, we remain committed to what has been a very successful playbook in growing the use of SPX options globally, educating new users both retail and institutional on the utility of SPX in virtually any market climate. We will continue to actively educate and market to our retail client segment including through partnerships with key retail firms and to our institutional base where we still see considerable opportunity among large pensions and global asset managers. And while, we continue to see increased trading during global trading hours we believe there's significant untapped potential for growth in non-U.S. regions and are increasing our overseas educational efforts accordingly.","Turning now to our overall Options business. Options average daily volume increased 23% for the quarter and 14% for the year at Cboe Global Markets the number one U.S. options marketplace. Multi-list options increased 22% in the fourth quarter and 14% for the year, while index options trading rose 24% in the fourth quarter making 2018, the sixth consecutive record year in that category.","In addition to growing our options market through the aforementioned VIX and SPX options initiatives in 2019, we look to increase trading XSP, our Mini-SPX options which trade on Cboe by also adding them to our EDGX Exchange subject to regulatory review.","We also plan to continue to grow our index marketplace through product innovation.","We are pleased to expand our suite of products type to S&P Dow Jones Indices with the rollout of Options on 11 Select Sector Indices. We launched Options on a material Select Sector Index yesterday, and plan to launch Options on the 10 remaining indices next week. We expect the new Options to have particular utility for investors seeking an alternative to Options on exchange-traded funds, including European customers seeking an alternative due to certain European regulations.","Turning now to the positive results in our equities marketplace. Growth in U.S. equities was fueled by a 33% increase in industry ADV for the quarter, and 12% over the previous year. Our ETP business also grew in the fourth quarter, bringing our total number of ETP listings to 290 at year's end, an increase of 16% over 2017's total. Our ETP offering now includes VXXB, the largest volatility [REIT] [ph] ETP, which replaces VXX.","We are excited about the potential for ongoing data sales growth in 2019, as we continue to distribute our products, including our flagship Cboe One Feed around the globe. Cboe's growth strategy as it relates to market data revenue remains focused on expanding users and providing products that meet client needs while leveraging our position as an industry low-cost provider.","And while we believe that the SEC exceeded its authority in issuing its recent market data order, and we filed a motion to reconsider the order, I should reiterate that the order has no impact on our existing market data feeds and that our fee schedules remain unchanged.","We are confident in the value proposition offered by our suite of market data offerings, which are tailored to meet the needs of our customers. And we remain fully committed to offering these products.","With regard to new competitors in the U.S. equity space, it should be noted that we've always been priced at a relative discount to our competitors for data and capacity feeds and that today's equities landscape is much different than it was in 2007 when Bats entered the marketplace and trading fees subsequently compressed materially.","Rules relating to the order routing and Bats execution also changed and associated costs are down considerably. We don't see much room for lower prices on any front. Further, we believe our operational efficiencies, cross asset product mix, and four exchange medallions enable us to bring unique value to our customers and leave us well-positioned in this hybrid competitive market.","We also believe the unique benefits of our equities business model and our ability to be nimble will leave us well-positioned with regard to the U.S. equities transaction feed pilot. Evolving our business model to meet industry and customer needs is in our DNA.","We remain fiercely opposed to the pilot and will fight against it at every possible turn, but we are confident we will continue to compete aggressively should the pilot be inactive.","Turning now to European equities. Trading increased 19% for the quarter and 11% over 2017. Cboe LIS, our European block trading platform powered by BIDS technology logged another record quarter.","Our strong results were a result of the rapid adoption of the services we put in place to meet the market needs under MiFID II. We are now positioning our business to continue to grow in a post-Brexit environment and are in the final stages of preparing to launch our new EU venue in Amsterdam subject to regulatory review.","Global FX average daily notional value was up 8% in the fourth quarter and 27% for the year leading to another record year in 2018. We plan to build on that success by improving our customers' experience through advanced data and analytics combined with industry-leading liquidity.","In closing I would like to thank our team for a great fourth quarter and for making 2018 a year for the record books. It is a credit to the entire team that we're able to deliver strong results across a greatly expanded product line.","We plan to build on those results in 2019 not only with the initiatives outlined here, but with the planned completion of the migration of Cboe exchanges to Bats technology October 7th when all of Cboe's options futures and equities markets will trade on a single world-class platform.","Moreover, we will continue to redefine markets through our commitment to relentless product innovation, leading-edge technology, and seamless trading solution in ways that benefit our customers and shareholders alike.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian.","Brian Schell","Thanks, Ed, and good morning everyone. And let me add my thank you for joining us this morning. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that unless specifically noted, my comments relate to 4Q 2018 as compared to 4Q 2017 and are based on our non-GAAP adjusted results.","As Ed mentioned, Cboe had a record quarter. Our net revenue was up 26% with net transaction fees up 37%, non-transaction revenue up 8%, adjusted operating expenses increased 6%, adjusted operating margin of 66.6%, up 610 basis points. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 77% to $1.54.","Our record results were driven by revenue growth across each of our business segments. This growth combined with our focus on disciplined expense management allowed us to achieve the operating leverage reflected in our margin expansion which is inherent in our operating model.","The press release we issued this morning and our slide deck provide the key operating metrics on volume and revenue capture for each of our segments as well as an overview of key revenue variances. I'd like to briefly highlight some of the key drivers influencing our performance in each segments.","In our Options segment, the 34% or nearly $45 million increase in net revenue was primarily driven by increase of $46 million in net transaction fees, reflecting growth in trading volume and revenue per contract in both index options and multi-listed options, with index options up $32 million and multi-listed options up $14 million.","The growth in net transaction fees for index options resulted from an increase in average daily volume of 24% for the quarter reflecting a 38% increase in SPX options, offset somewhat by a 2% decrease in VIX options, and a 10% increase in RPC, resulting from a mix shift with SPX options accounting for a higher percentage of volume as well as pricing changes implemented at the beginning of the year.","The 22% ADV increase in our multi-listed Options business was primarily driven by higher industry volumes. Industry option volume reached a new high in 2018 surpassing the previous record set in 2011.","Our market share was down from last year's fourth quarter as we continue to focus on optimizing our overall net transaction fees in 2018, which is reflected in a 48% increase in RPC for multi-listed Options for the quarter and 17% for the year.","Turning to futures, the 13% increase in net revenue primarily resulted from a 19% increase in ADV, offset somewhat by a 6% decline in RPC. RPC was lower year-over-year, primarily due to a shift in the volume mix with fewer block trades which have a higher revenue capture.","CFE also posted growth in non-transaction fees for the quarter and the year driven by demand for market data and connectivity or capacity fees, which were modified in May of 2018 following CFE's technology migration in February of 2018.","Turning to U.S. equities, net revenue growth -- net revenue grew 18%, primarily driven by increases in net transaction fees and exchange services and other fees. Net transactions fees were driven by higher net capture and industry ADV, offset somewhat by lower market share. SIP market data revenue fell 4% in the quarter and the proprietary market data increased 28%. We expect SIP market data revenue to be relatively unchanged year-over-year in 2019, absent auto recoveries and assuming no significant changes in market share.","Net revenue for European equities increased 29% on a U.S. dollar basis and was up 31% on a local currency basis, reflecting growth in both net transaction and non-transaction revenues. Net transaction fees were the key growth driver, reflecting favorable net capture and higher market share on stronger market volumes. The higher capture resulted from strong periodic option and LIS volumes, which have higher relative net captures.","Net revenue for Global FX increased 14% this quarter, as we grew market share to 15.3%, up nearly 40 basis points year-over-year. The growth reflects favorable market volumes and stronger net capture.","Turning to expenses: Total adjusted operating expenses were nearly $112 million for the quarter, up 6% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The key expense variance was in compensation and benefits, resulting from higher incentive-based compensation, driven by and aligned with our strong financial and operational performance. We exited 2018 with a cumulative run rate expense synergy of $57 million versus our previous estimate of $50 million and we still expect to exit 2019 with $80 million of run rate synergies and $85 million in 2020.","Additionally, we want to provide you with incremental visibility to our expectation of how much expense synergy we expect to actually realize this year and in 2020. Given that the C1 migration is planned to occur in the fourth quarter, we expect to realize approximately 20% of incremental $23 million of targeted run rate synergies during 2019, which is a significantly lower percentage than the previous two years. In 2017 and 2018, higher percentages of synergies were realized, 75% and 64% respectively, as many personnel and vendor decisions were made shortly after closing in 2017. And in 2018, we completed the CFE and C2 platform migrations earlier in the year.","We also estimate that we plan to realize approximately 40% of the remaining $5 million of run rate synergies in 2020. With the synergy discussion as context, we'd now like to review our expense guidance for the full year 2019 and a preliminary range for 2020. For 2019, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in a range of $420 million to $428 million, reflecting our expectation for expenses to be slightly down to nominally flat versus 2018. Our 2019 projected expenses reflect the benefit of synergies, attained through 2018 and the growth of core expenses to support our business.","With respect to 2020, we expect a similar range of $420 million to $428 million, reflecting the significant carryover benefit realized in 2020 for the C1 migration in 2019, which is likely to offset a 4% to 6% core expense growth rate in 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense, which is included in our total adjusted expense guidance, is expected to be $35 million to $40 million. This excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets of about $138 million, which will be excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Lastly, CapEx in 2019 is expected to range from $50 million to $55 million, an increase from $37 million in 2018. A significant driver of the increase in our forecast is an assumption that we will spend additional capital for the possible relocation and leasing of our Chicago corporate office headquarters accounting for about a third of the incremental spend.","We have no definitive plans to share at this point. But if we do decide to relocate we would not expect to incur the increased capital expenditures until the second half of 2019, at which time we would likely be able to provide more clarity. The capital budget also includes, our ongoing investment in technology and software to refresh enhance and add capacity to our systems including potential Brexit-related spending.","Turning to income taxes. Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was about 22% below our annual guidance range of 26.5% to 28.5%, reflecting several positive discrete items relating to state income taxes. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 37%. The decline primarily reflects the favorable impact of corporate tax reform. We expect the annual effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for 2019 to be within a range of 27% to 29% for the year, which is higher than 2018, due to the expectation of realizing fewer favorable discrete items in 2019.","Turning to capital allocation. We remain focused on allocating capital in a most efficient manner to create long-term shareholder value. During the fourth quarter, our strong financial results, cash flow generation, and financial position enabled us to continue to invest in the growth of our business, while also returning nearly $35 million to shareholders through dividends. We ended the year with adjusted cash of nearly $258 million. We were not active in share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2018. Instead, we conserved cash realized towards a potential near-term strategic acquisition.","While we are unable to provide any specifics relating to this potential deal, and there is no assurance it will ultimately occur, I want to point out that, if we are successful in completing this transaction in the near term we do not anticipate incurring significant leverage or issuing any stock with respect to its funding.","Turning to share repurchases. For the full year of 2018, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of Cboe common stock under our share repurchase program for nearly $141 million representing 1% of shares outstanding. We currently have $206 million of availability under our share repurchase program. And as always, we plan to continue to evaluate share repurchases as part of our overall capital allocation. At year-end, our leverage ratio was 1.5 times down slightly from 1.6 times at the end of the third quarter 2018.","In summary, Cboe delivered record results for both the quarter and the year and continue to demonstrate our focus on growing our proprietary index products growth in a diverse set of revenue streams, disciplined expense management, leveraging the scale of our business producing, higher profit margins, and integration plan on track and ongoing focus on capital allocation by continuing to invest in the growth of our business, while returning capital to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.","With that, I'll turn it over to Debbie for instructions on the Q&A portion of the call.","Debbie Koopman","Thanks, Brian. At this point, we'd be happy to take your questions. We ask that you please limit your questions to one per person to allow time to get to everyone. Feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits we\u2019ll take a second question. Keith?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. All right. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And this morning's first question comes from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Rich Repetto","Good morning, Ed. Good morning, Brian. And first congrats on the strong quarter and strong year. But everybody's asking about, I think the question that we get most often right now is on volumes to-date in 2019 and more specifically in the latter half of January and February, Ed. I guess, if you could expound again on what you see happening what conditions -- market conditions you would need to see a return to the higher volumes that we saw in December and November.","Ed Tilly","Thanks, Rich. Thanks for not mentioning either the pat or Brady to start\u2026","Rich Repetto","It was good. That was going to be Mike.","Ed Tilly","I am - I am sure. It was. The question is great and we get that question as does every exchange operator after we're coming off a record-setting quarter followed up by a market environment where our customers are reassessing risk, the strategies that were successful in that record-setting quarter and the changing market environment. So that's not unusual for us. You've seen that ebb and flow. But more specifically, I think what I'd call out is that rally that began in late December and continued through early January did lead to a lot of changes for us and as we look at the marketplace, the level and the flatness of the volatility surface. We've talked about in the past, certain strategies rest when that surface is flat. You know that.","The change in the VVIX that is the cost of using VIX options as a hedge only the cheapest that I can recall that change as we've seen the return over the last weeks into using VIX calls as a hedge. So as perceptions change so does the volume. And we've seen it building on that base in January and early February. That's not surprising.","Look back and you'll see what market environment really serves us well. It's the one we're in now and that January readjustment is just part of the story. What we've seen over the last few days, obviously, now is the return to uncertainty. All of those same risk factors that drove market volumes starting in September through the rest of the year are still out there.","So we find ourselves really well-positioned. The liquidity in our products are ready to take on changing perception. And looking over the last week we already see a shift in rebuilding of the volumes that we were used to perhaps at the beginning of the correction in early fall. So we like the market. We see it coming back. The Street says that they're reassessing. And we can see that show up in our volumes and the shift already. So hope that answers and I can get -- we can go pretty weedy in surface and the other Greeks and happy to get there if there's a follow-up question.","John Deters","And Rich, this is John, not to take it too deep in the weeds, but I know you've asked a lot in the past about the ETP ecosystem behind VIX. And we like what we see there particularly with the transition to VXXB. We think that's been orderly. The fact that AUM is somewhat down recently is just indicative of the fact that those products are really all about taking directional views in the level of VIX.","And the case we're taking directional views right now is somewhat for GLA as they say. So I think really the \u2013 where we see the opportunity here is in the options with the low level of VVIX and a low relative cost.","Ed Tilly","I think it's -- John, to point out and it's following up on Rich's question, the change in AUM, Rich, and those ETP trackers just coming off of the last day in January to a day or two ago went from about $1.7 billion to about $2.1 billion. So you do see a return to those strategies that have worked. But this resetting from our customers' perspective is not that unusual.","Rich Repetto","Got it. That helps a lot, Ed. And thanks for the congrats and the pats.","Ed Tilly","Right, Rich.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hey, guys. Good morning. I want to go to your guidance on expenses and that's -- 2019 makes sense, obviously, with the transition of timing and the synergies. Can you talk about why your core expense base is accelerating by over 2x? So it sounds like net x synergies, I think Brian you talked about 2% in 2019 and 4% to 6% in 2020. And what's your ability, I guess, to ultimately flex that if the revenue environment is a little softer?","Brian Schell","Yes. So a little bit of that is, if you look at kind of historical and we looked at, say, from -- and I'll call this new environment of this combined Cboe as far as being a large organization operating in multiple markets. If you look at kind of that core expense base without of the -- all of the other noise going on. If you look at 2017 -- 2016 and 2017, I think, we saw some of that core expense may grow though that, call that 4% to 6% range.","I know, traditionally, we tried to be more in that 3% to 5%. So I think we saw it creep up just a little bit. I think we're going to have a very strong year as far as 2018 to 2019 essentially having that lower number here, implicit of roughly, call it, 1% to 3% as far as where that guidance goes.","And then, I think we're going to start to return to some of that -- part of that is that, we provided that slightly higher range, again, because it's almost two years out. So we're being a little bit conservative. Some things could happen, but it's not outside the range of where we have been before as a larger entity.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi. Good morning. I'd love to hear your comments about the consortium at MEMEX. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that the business has always been competitive. I think you're priced below peers. What are your thoughts maybe broadly on the brokers and dealers exchange frustration, leading to greater action here? And specifically, to what extent do you think their actions taken here are a direct threat to Cboe?","Ed Tilly","It's a great question. And up front and we've said -- in the competition in a transparent market, that's what we're used to. The Cboe competing in -- its history of multi-list options and Bats in [U.S.] [ph] equities when we can see the competition we do quite well. And what I'm referring to is this is competition in a lit market as opposed to competition in the dark market, where there may or may not be regulatory arb and less clarity to what's happening in dark pool.","So facing a new entrant head on, it's really what we're used to. We are the low-cost provider -- leading in the low-cost provider on many fronts. The market is different from the last time we had a new entrant. And Chris Isaacson has joined our call this morning. And I think his perspective on -- this is what we refer to as Bats 2.0, we don't believe that. The market structure has changed. Fees have changed. So I'm going to let him talk about what's different from his perspective.","But I will comment that is a formidable group that has come together. I know we don't take any competition lightly and you refer to that name and the liquidity providers who are committed to NYMEX. There are some issues I think that we will compete head-on. And there are others as a low-cost provider today that I think is going to be very, very difficult for that new entrant. But I'll ask for Chris' perspective who's been through this from 2007.","Chris Isaacson","Thanks Ed. Appreciate the question Ken. So, I was one of the founding employees of Bats and this has been phrased as Bats 2.0. As Ed mentioned in his prepared remarks and just now that the market is different. Transaction fees at that time that Bats started were say roughly $0.10 per 100 shares of capture on transaction fees. And they've been compressed substantially since then.","Reg NMS was a tailwind for Bats and all the effects of Reg NMS are really borne out now. There's frankly many calls to revisit NMS. And there's -- obviously, there's focus on non-transaction fees. But as Ed mentioned, we are the low-cost provider here. And the growth of our non-transaction fee revenue is really based on customer growth and new products and not on raising fees.","So, we think we're positioned extraordinarily well. I mean if you look at the rationale around this integration between Cboe and Bats, it was about making a lean mean fighting machine as far as an exchange operator that also has incredible proprietary products. And we -- we're fulfilling that promise to that deal and we're ready to compete against what could be a formidable competitor. But we think we're well-positioned.","Ed Tilly","Ken I think we'll learn more also if we ever hear of a management team or see a filing or understand which fees that group is going against. It's been a wonderful headline. They've way outkicked the coverage. That's for you Rich so far. So, we really don't have many details. But when we do, we -- because it's transparent and needs to be filed, we will compete.","Ken Worthington","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.","Kyle Voigt","Hi, good morning. Maybe just a broad one for me. If we go back let's say five years ago, it felt like VIX was a product where we felt there was the most opportunity for further customer geographic penetration, the longest runway for growth. But just looking over the past four years, SPX has actually been your fastest-growing product followed by VIX futures and then followed by VIX options.","So, I guess the question is has your view changed at all with respect to what inning we are in for VIX and SPX? And which product kind of do you see the bigger runway for growth going forward?","Ed Tilly","Yes, I think what's changed and we began mentioning this on the call. I would say its three years now is I left the Risk Management Conference and was really in awe at how our users changed our story from a VIX one to their ability to pivot and use these products depending on their change in the perception of risk.","Meaning they now have fine-tuned which market environment they expect to use our products to hedge. That's the bigger change. And the reason we stack the proprietary products the way we do is because using these products in tandem based on your perception of risk does change in every market environment.","When realized volatility is higher than implied, there's a great focus on SPX implied over realized strategies focused on VIX futures. We've talked about term structure, the effect of term structure. Those talks never happened five years ago. It was -- I'm getting some volatility exposure. I'll use VIX futures or VIX options. I have a basket of the S&P 500. I'm going to use out the money options in the S&P 500 as a hedge.","It is different today. It's evolved. It's much more sophisticated. And it's rewarding for us to see that any market environment, one of these products is the go-to hedge globally. And also in the prepared remarks, the increased demand inbound we have from other geographies is where we're going to focus. But I really wouldn't re-rank them as you're asking me to do but rather stress how users use these in tandem depending on how the risk perception changes.","Kyle Voigt","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays.","Jeremy Campbell","Hey, thank you. So just looking at the RPCs and revenue captured during the quarter, obviously, they were pretty strong and up pretty materially sequentially across the board. But specifically looking at the multi-listed option there, Brian, I think you noted that market share came down a bit. Was this you guys being selective? And then I'm also just kind of wondering if there's something around volatility that is in RPCs here. Just trying to get like a sense of the underlying dynamics and where these capture rates go in 2019.","Brian Schell","So I think it was a combination of several things as far as what you saw in the fourth quarter. As we looked at the volume and you look at market participation, I wouldn't call so much as a selectively trying to move tiers away. I think some of that reflects certain tiers being hit not being tiered. And again you're going to get noise quarter-over-quarter with certain larger firms that may or may not hit tiers depending on maybe whether strategy may have changed. So you're seeing some of that in the fourth quarter, which Cboe benefited on the RPC side. Maybe they lost it on the market share side.","Again you saw a very, very strong net transaction outcome, which, again, was very pleased with. And so you're going to see some of that noise. So what I potentially expect to see that strong of an RPC on a quarter-to-quarter basis going into 2019, probably not. So it's not trying to exclude certain flow, but we're also -- and we make it -- try to be very disciplined about our pricing of not chasing unprofitable flow to make sure just because we want to gather market share because it just doesn't have any meaningful impact to the bottom line.","So we try to be -- maintain some consistency across that schedule. And ultimately we see competitors doing different things that may try to enhance their market share, trying to create some -- make it sticky or not. Again, we see that over time. But like I said, our focus has been being very disciplined on our price schedule, looking at that top line and not so much focusing on the noise around the market share and the RPC at any one quarter.","Ed Tilly","And more of maximizing revenue, when balancing the capture with market share that's always been the playbook. We've got all the tools. We can respond if one of our competitors acts in a rational way. But to Brian's point, we don't chase share for the sake of share. We look at this as a blend in total revenue opportunity. So to Brian's point, I expect that capture to come back down to its -- closer to its average and then outlier as a result of really, really high volumes in that fourth quarter and some key players missing a couple of tiers.","Jeremy Campbell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Hi. Good morning everyone. Wanted to just come back to the expense side here for a minute, but more from the synergy opportunity here. I look at that slide 29 which is -- I think is new and is actually super helpful. But I also look at it and I say Well it looks like Brian and Chris and the rest of the team really got this down to a T in terms of like by week, by month, what's coming out, and what projects are happening and what cost will be realized. So I look at it and I wonder well, what is that stone that they haven't turned over? Will they all of a sudden find something surprising that they haven't seen before? It seems like you got a very, very detailed handle already. Or do you think there could be still something that we haven't discovered yet?","Ed Tilly","I'll let Chris do it.","Chris Isaacson","I'll take that. This is Chris Isaacson. I mean, I think we try to be very, very disciplined when we were looking at expenses. And as we put together this integration plan, as we hit closer to the end of it in October, the clarity does get much more clear for us. So, as we -- Brian and I work together along with the team, we have -- think we have a really good feel for what we're going to realize as far as synergies in 2019 what we're going to experience for run rate going forward. And we're quite excited about finishing this migration. And frankly, not just the cost -- taking the cost out of the organization where needed, but also about the opportunities we're going to have on the new platform that's going to give us more agility as we're doing weekly software releases across all of our platforms.","Brian Schell","I'd just add to that. As we continue to evaluate through there as -- and we've always said that when we had -- to enhance Chris point when we had any incremental visibility to a certain project or a key initiative that was going to drive down or change expenses, we will provide that. And as we obviously progress into the year and that becomes firmer or whatever and we can refine those guidance we will. And like I said and going out to 2020, obviously that's a little less. We felt confident that obviously you saw the schedule that Debbie beat us up on to make sure that we are providing this, because we again had a pretty good sense of confidence on where that was. And whether that's looking at the various expenses and our people getting reimbursed for Chick-fil-A sandwiches or are they going out to the expensive steakhouses. So it's all those little things that we continue to look on be very disciplined about and take a good look at.","Alex Kramm","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much. If you could just come back to the revenue capture rates, especially in European equities and Global FX, looks like they're having a very nice sort of structural sequential increase for several quarters. So I think when you've -- just refocused your comments on coming back to averages are we expecting that to sort of pull back earlier in the year? Or do you see that sustaining? And then on the European side, if you can comment on sort of any impact from Brexit on the way you're operating that from a revenue capture perspective. And then just maybe an outlook on the market data proprietary side\u2026.","Debbie Koopman","I think you're breaking the rules on the questions there Brian.","Brian Bedell","All right. I'll stop there.","Ed Tilly","Brian, let me take one of the four. So Brexit is really the goal that Mark and the team have set out. It's no disruption for our customers and their need to have access in pan-European access. That's the goal. That's what we've set up. And then mindful from a governance perspective and certainty around working and cooperating with the new regulator and that process is underway, but the heart of it was really the continuation of operation what our customers in Europe are used to expecting from us as a successful seizing opportunities that MiFID II gave to the marketplace. Similarly that was based around continuation of business and that is what Brexit is.","So if we could just put that aside, we don't know what the opportunities look like. We really don't know at the end of the day any more clearly than any other operator that's dealing with Brexit, but continuation of the operation is really what we're after right now. And that's what the team is focused on.","So I'll turn it over for the other three questions to Brian and Chris.","Brian Norman","So, on the -- talk about a little bit just the observations when you think about the segments and you look at the overall growth. When you looked at the Global FX and European equities while overall industry volumes did enhance those businesses not as much of their growth came from an overall higher tide. You saw stronger I'll call it kind of almost organic or driven growth by increased market share by both of those businesses both European equities and Global FX for the things that we're doing.","Now, again they had solid fourth quarter last year as well particularly FX. I think you saw its initial significant ramp-up in growth beginning fourth quarter of 2017 and you saw that continuing to enhance into 2018. So you're seeing that disciplined management. You see around the liquidity initiatives and the analytics that they're using to continue to grow that business.","On the European equities side, it's a mix of the higher capture with the periodic options and LIS. And so that was actually the bigger driver and then the market share on top of it. So, the overall industry volume just wasn't as big of a component of that growth. So that's something that from a capture standpoint we would continue to expect to see higher than historical levels as far as capture goes, because of what that team has been able to do and launching those value-added products that their customers are seeking and really find a lot of utilization out of.","Chris Isaacson","Yeah. And I would just add to Brian's point, I think in Europe with periodic options, LIS partnership with BIDS, we think we have a full suite of trading products for our customers there, some at a higher capture but certainly a greater utility for them that have been very well received by both buy-side and sell-side and great work by Mark Hemsley and the team there to not just be ready for MiFID a year ago but to be ready to seize on that opportunity that MiFID presented us many opportunities and we see follow-through for that in 2019.","As Ed said, Brexit is more about business continuity, because we don't know any better necessarily than anyone else. But we do think eventually change will create opportunity for us. And as Brian said on FX, an amazing story in 2018. This is truly about getting closer to your customer, having better data and analytics so that you can have more intelligent conversations with them so they can improve their trading experience on your platform. And we think there's still room to run their as well as we get closer to our customers and provide them more value.","Ed Tilly","And I think the last one was market data. And just to remind you that the SEC's opinion really doesn't have any impact on our strategy and that is to get new users and grow the user base. But we do believe the SEC has ceded its authorities as I said in my prepared remarks.","We filed a motion for reconsideration in October and the SEC is considering the motion. We don't know when they're going to act but they've stayed -- the compliance they set forth in the original order. So in the meantime our fees remain intact. And we're out trying to bring in new users to our feed. So we -- nothing new there other than the fees remain intact. And as things change and involve with the regulator, we'll keep you up to date on our strategy.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much. I\u2019ll get back in the queue for one more.","Ed Tilly","Looking forward to it Brian.","Brian Schell","We're six through 10.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Hey thanks. Good morning. Brian just a question on your capital and tax comments. So, you mentioned in the quarter no buyer has given a potential deal. I guess just given the kind of bigger picture when you're thinking about M&A, you guys more recently like over the past year or so have done some transactions not necessarily M&A, but maybe investments that were more long-term strategic maybe create some future optionality. Is that still kind of where the focus is? Or are there also opportunities out there that can actually bring more near-term like financial benefits? And when could we like potentially see maybe some like conclusion around that and buybacks to resume?","Brian Schell","So, let me talk about the -- just -- specifically address kind of the buyback. So, as we've said in the past buyback is obviously one of our broader capital allocation alternatives that we'll pursue.","At any one point in time we've made a habit of -- a policy of not saying hey we're in or we're out or this is where we are. So, just to continue to reemphasize that we're not going to say, hey we're now in kind of approach. But like I said it's something that we do think is very valuable with the right price.","And again, we weigh that against all the alternatives we have whether that's continuing to invest in organic opportunities or we might see something that's sitting right now outside of Cboe Global Markets portfolio that we think actually makes sense strategically that we want to add and that has a long-term growth impact that we think we can manage as well whether it be a topline growth or something to add to cost reduction synergy approach as well.","As far as some of the other kind of investment opportunities, I'm going to turn it over to John have a few more thoughts about kind of some of the -- how we're thinking a little bit about that.","John Deters","Yes. So -- and I think Michael your observation is generally correct. And I think we can draw a line directly back to the integration of Cboe and Bats. I mean we as a management team are laser-focused on sticking the landing there. And I think you've heard us talk consistently about that for many quarters now.","We see the light at the end of the tunnel. We're coming up on October here just in a few short months. And that gives us opportunity to start looking at things that are in the market.","We're always going to be opportunistic. What do we like we like and this is consistent with what we've talked about before. We love being an exchange operator. I'll say it very categorically. And so platforms that we know or familiar with that bring us potentially closer to the end customer, that help us realize efficiencies, and in some cases, you'll see platforms like that also produce interesting data sets that are complementary. Those are the types of platforms we'll think about.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Hey guys. It was a good year for growth and access in exchange fees. Just wondered if you can talk about the outlook for those revenue categories in 2019 and beyond.","Brian Schell","So, I would say that we continue to take a look at those and optimize across the broad category. We continue to see -- like -- I think that Ed mentioned earlier about from the market data side we continue to look at growing that organically. We're seeing a -- continue to try and build that pipeline just even into new year as far as new clients, new geographies, primarily on the equity side, top of book which we think is the -- kind of the largest upside for us at this point.","And again, it's not just the equity side. It's also \u2013 we think there continue to be opportunities around whether it be the futures data the index data and across all the asset classes. We continue to see opportunity there.","As far as the other call it the access fees exchange services as we continue to look at those and align those and gear those to look at more and more about capacity and access to our markets and all the things that we're doing on the tech side you'll \u2013 you potentially could see some noise as to any one category, how they're classified, again, because the technology is different and how they're using it, and we're aligning it. And sometimes, you see the name changes, but it's not just a simple name change, but it's really reflective of again, how we're building the systems, and like I said, how the clients are consuming the data.","So I will look for continued growth there. It's been lower to single digit numbers versus what we've seen on the transaction side for 2018. But we're still optimistic that there's still opportunity there and we \u2013 and we're continuing to be very disciplined about any changes to our pricing.","Ed Tilly","Yes. I think also maybe, Chris the change that we will file and we submitted at BZX equities and how we're looking at capacity fees rather than connectivity fees I think as to Brian's point, how you may see things that are different. So, maybe just a couple of words.","Brian Schell","Yeah. So on that Chris, really the customers pay for access to our markets and they pay for that in the form of really physical port fees as well as would have been logical port fees, but it has kind of been a misnomer. And really, what they're paying for is capacity. And so think about it as somebody is going to use AWS or some cloud provider they're paying for what they use. And that's effectively what they're doing on our markets as well. So we just put in a rule filing on BZX equities for effectively capacity fees for a logical port. So as our customers need for capacity increases, so will our charges related so will the incremental charges related to their access. But that, we just view that as part of operating the markets. And as they need more capacity, they'll buy more. And if they need less, they'll buy less, but yeah that's the story there.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ken Hill with Rosenblatt.","Ken Hill","Hey, good morning, everyone. I just wanted to circle back to some of the M&A comments you guys have made. One of the deals kind of rumored out there right now is BIDS. And I know, you guys can't comment on that probably specifically, but I was hoping you could provide a little bit of color or speak more generally about how you could get some regulatory comfort with the deal of that nature, where you have an exchange actually owning a broker-dealer given a lot of the regulation that largely precludes that.","Ed Tilly","Well, I think it's heated up right. We can't comment on that, but we will introduce as we pointed out in the prepared remarks this is \u2013 we forget the M&A aspect. BIDS is our partner in Europe, and we've had a very successful relationship. But specifically, to that question, we really don't comment on any rumors specifically as you point out with BIDS. So I really don't have anything further on that today.","Ken Hill","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ben Herbert with Citigroup.","Ben Herbert","Hey, good morning. Just wanted to follow up on capital return, and as we look at continued deleveraging likely over the course of 2019 are you thinking about any sort of substantial increase either the buyback or maybe a potential variable dividend return excess capital maybe looking further out to 2020?","Brian Schell","Like I said, we haven't made any definitive plan to say one way or the other so that here's what we're going to allocate specifically to the various options that we have. I'll just again reiterate kind of my earlier comments is that this is a conversation we have on a very, very frequent quarterly basis at a minimum with our board and various committees about our approach to capital allocation for the coming year and changing to market circumstances or opportunities whether they'd be from a debt capacity side, whether they be at dividend side or share repurchase activity given where the stock may be trading. Or again, I know there's been some -- or an inorganic activity that we want to pursue. So I think it's too early to provide that kind of guidance at this point other than we'll continue to evaluate and try to deliver what we think is -- makes the most sense for returning cash to the shareholder because we -- it's not ours. We don't want to sit on it. And we think it's appropriate to either put it to use or give it back to you.","Ben Herbert","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.","Q \u2013 Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Hey good morning. So volume and open interest in your corporate bond ETF futures has remained pretty scant so far despite an uptick in credit market volatility in an environment where credit and hedging vehicles should theoretically be more in demand. Can you provide an update on your sales and client education efforts for that product and your expectations going forward?","A \u2013 John Deters","Yeah Patrick, this is John. It's a great question. I know you're familiar with the use case behind those products. So I'd start with saying that, overall we're really pleased with the trend that we see in that marketplace. What do we look at for a brand-new product like that? We look at things like the customer dialogue in the first instance, what are our teams hearing out there and how engaged are the end users -- potential end users for this product.","Next, we look at the user connectivity. So our brokers connecting to this product setting up their risk models and then beginning to facilitate customer transactions and you want to see progress there. You're not going to see a big bang. You're going to see slow and steady progress and we're seeing that.","And then third and only third, only last then come the volume numbers. So while they've been -- I think kind of what we would expect for a brand-new product like this, the volume numbers aren't going to come for some time yet. This product did not -- in the case of this product that dynamic is even clear because this is a brand-new asset class for us, a brand-new user base. Even beyond our own level of connectivity with that user base is the question of this user base is familiarity with products like this. So what are they doing today? Well largely the end user base for hedging or gaining exposure to this type of asset class is through swaps.","And the futures product is an entirely new world for them. So part of the education is beyond just here's what the instrument is. It's how do you use futures. Once we have those conversations, the light bulb goes off and people are really intrigued because the benefits in terms of margin, in terms of cost and transparency, in terms of the ability to shift your positions in the market once you put it on, they're just -- they're so evident. But you have to have all these conversations and get people there. So it'll be a trajectory that we'll see play out over time.","Q \u2013 Patrick O'Shaughnessy","Great. Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm","Thank you. I guess, very quick since we're on new products as with the prior question or new initiatives. Can you just give us an update on what's going on, on the MSCI option side? I don't think we've heard a lot about this in recent calls. And you look at what the futures are doing over at ICE and the environment last year I think very successful. So, just wondering, if that's still something we should be paying attention in - on, or what's happening on that side?","John Deters","So, Alex this is John. That's a really good question. Interestingly earlier we had a comment for one of the questioners about the relative growth in our product set just referring to SPX and VIX. And the statement was that SPX is our fastest-growing product in the past year. It's actually a misnomer. It's actually the MSCI product set albeit from a low base. So that will be something that evolves over time.","But we had a 250% increase from January 18 to January 19 in terms of volume traded. And you see a similar trend in terms of the open interest for those -- these two products. So this is a long-term build. This is how new products evolve in our market. You commit to them.","Day one when volume is -- never mind where it is today when volume is when -- where it was when we launched it three years ago these are accretive for us. It's not we make money off of every trade. But the key here is sticking to the products, sticking to the promotional effort and over time seeing customers really adopt the products in their workflows to the point that you get this virtuous cycle of liquidity. So, we're seeing that play out right now as we speak. But again it's from a low base.","Alex Kramm","All right, very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is also a follow-up from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.","Rich Repetto","Yeah. Hi, Ed. I'm going to be transparent. I got two brief questions. You can pick, which one you want to answer. First, just on the non-transaction revenue items. Can you just give us -- do you expect it to be single-digit percentage grower or high single digit? What kind of modeling? Or what should we think about there? Or on the M&A side, have you ever stated what like the guidelines for an M&A transaction for the Cboe would need to be as far as accretion, time frame, et cetera?","Ed Tilly","Let me take the second question, Rich. We love to answer them both. We have given guidelines in the past, not as specific as you're asking at the level of accretion and over what time. But as -- even as John's words today, we can touch a customer either earlier in the trade process or later in the trade process. We love that and that's evidenced -- you've seen us with Livevol and Silexx in the past and even transformative deals.","Obviously this board when we set out on our first major acquisition of Bats that was a game changer, executing on a successful integration. And then ultimately in October on the migration our board is comfortable with large scale M&A.","So we are still interested in the spectrum as far as size. The board has gotten very comfortable with our ability to delever after a deal. So, I just keep an open mind on the size.","As for timing on accretion, we have not given that guideline. We like accretive deals. So, put -- just put that in the back of your head. I won't get any more specific than that. But our goal and the board's goal is to deliver to the shareholders what we promised in our first major M&A. You will see tack-ons and bolt-ons along the way, but very comfortable with larger-scale M&A.","And I will need to turn it over to Brian on non-trans revenue question.","Brian Schell","Yeah. So I would say that the growth rate as you look at all the dynamics of what's going on. And largely due to the SIP being a \u2013 such a large base of overall non-transaction fees, and if you look at it from a drag on growth rate that's probably one of the biggest reasons that we would expect a call it low to mid-single-digit growth rate in non-transaction revenue. And I also say back to Chris earlier comments that, we kind of addressed as we have delivered \u2013 when we've delivered the new technology platforms then you'll potentially see a \u2013 either a changing structure or kind of how we basically provide those services whether it be the port fees, the capacity, things like that. That tends to necessarily get re-priced or adjusted to reflect how the users are using those services, as well as the greater capacity or whatever the benefits that are associated with it. And so we would expect to see a lot of change, during 2019 with C1. And so there's going to more substantial changes more likely be 2019 from a change in that growth rate.","Rich Repetto","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","We also have a follow-up this one from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks for the patience, guys. Rich got my non-recurring question \u2013 recurring revenue question, but I will add one more. I think Ed, you mentioned as part of the organic growth opportunity for the volatility franchise the penetration or the effort to target commodity trading advisers maybe if you can just talk about what you think your penetration is there currently and how large the opportunity is. And is it getting new CTAs to use it for the first time? Or is it more about getting them to embrace the strategies and use it more frequently?","Ed Tilly","It's a little of both. So, if we look over the past three years or so we've seen some CTAs entering the space, that certainly have embedded volatility strategies that they'd like to put in place and really being able to express the position in the U.S. market by using long or short VIX futures strategy that's really the story. We had a very large futures user coming in from Europe expressing a short exposure in the U.S. market by a long \u2013 continuing to roll a long VIX futures position. So that's the target. We understand there's a demand out there, so focusing on that group will be relatively new for us. And that's why I think what our team \u2013 our newly designed biz dev team is out focusing on among the new users.","Brian Bedell","And is it targeting basically trying to get them to not use and displace another strategy on that? Or is it really more of an end-use a new way?","Ed Tilly","No, no. It's not replacing. Again, if you think of the use case for all of these products and if you have one exposure to express a short position in the U.S. market it's really strike specific or level-specific on the S&P 500. And if you're wrong that is linear in its losses. But to maintain a constant exposure to VIX futures is a small \u2013 well in this case zero roll-down risk, but historically a small roll-down risk to still maintain that same long exposure in VIX looking for a soft in the U.S. market. So no it really wouldn't replace. It's just a different way to express long or short positions in the U.S. market. We don't think they would replace but enhance. That's really the beauty of these products.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much.","Ed Tilly","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And as there are no more questions at present, I'd like to return the floor to Debbie Koopman for any closing comments.","Debbie Koopman","Thanks. That completes our call this morning. We appreciate your time and continued interest in Cboe. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."],"4102":["CBOE Holdings (NYSE:CBOE) Q4 2013 Earnings Call February  7, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Deborah Koopman - Vice President of Investor Relations and Analyst","Edward T.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Deborah Koopman. Ma'am, you may begin.","Deborah Koopman","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. On the call today, Ed Tilly, our CEO, will discuss the quarter and our strategic initiatives for 2014; then Alan Dean, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will detail our fourth quarter 2013 financial results and provide guidance on certain financial metrics for 2014. Following their comments, we will open the call to Q&A. Also joining us for Q&A will be our President and COO, Ed Provost.","In addition, I'd like to point out that this presentation will include the use of several slides.

Tilly","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2013 was a banner year for CBOE Holdings, with records set across key financial metrics, including revenue, earnings and operating margin. These solid financial results enabled us to return nearly $110 million in capital to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases over the year.","CBOE Holdings total volume, options and futures was nearly 1.2 billion contracts, making 2013 our second busiest year. Total average daily volume increased 4% from 2012. Options volume rose 3%, outperforming the industry-wide increase of 2%. Index options trading increased by 22%, led by record trading in our SPX complex and in VIX options.","Solid fourth quarter results capped 2013's record financial performance with a year-over-year revenue growth of 9% and diluted earnings per share growth of 16%.","Fourth quarter ADV rose to 4.9 million contracts, a year-over-year increase of 18%. Alan will discuss our quarterly results in detail, so I'll move ahead with a look at our key initiatives, build on [ph] progress made to date and opportunities on the horizon for 2014.","We remain focused on our core mission to create value for stockholders by generating industry-leading profit margins and growth rates through a diversified portfolio of risk management products and services. Ongoing strategic initiatives fall into 3 main categories: Leveraging and developing proprietary products; optimizing revenue in commoditized products; and broadening our customer base, all while maintaining the highest standards in market regulation.","I'm pleased to note at the onset that CBOE and our partner, S&P Dow Jones Indices, achieved an important legal victory in the final quarter of 2013 when New York's Federal Court dismissed a competitor's challenge to S&P's rights to license its indexes, validating previous rulings by the Illinois Appellate Court, the Illinois Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court. Significantly, the deadline to appeal the New York Federal Court ruling passed in January, bringing this baseless challenge to an end. We are thrilled to have reached finality and legal certainty in this matter. It is a victory for innovation at CBOE and for our ability to continue to grow the index options marketplace for years to come.","Now onto product performance and development. Trading and CBOE's S&P 500 Index Options Complex rose 18% in 2013. Much of the growth was driven by a sharp increase in SPX Weeklys volume, which grew by 98% in 2013, following an increase of 70% in 2012 and a tripling of the volume in 2011. The record pace carried over into January 2014 when SPX Weeklys trading increased 53% over January 2013 and 29% over the prior month, setting a new monthly volume high.","I'm pleased to note that Weeklys trading, created by CBOE in 2005, has brought a new base of customers made up of retail investors and semi-pros to our SPX marketplace. Obviously, we believe there's significant potential ahead to further develop this new and growing customer base.","Our standard SPX option remains the index option of choice for institutional investors trading large and complex orders. I'm happy to report that trading in our FLEX SPX option, excluding Weeklys, increased by 5%, making 2013 the busiest year in the product's 30-year history.","Trading is off to a strong start in 2014, with January SPX volume up 10% over last year and 7% over the prior month. More important, we continue to identify significant opportunities to further grow SPX trading in 2014 and beyond.","User groups, where we see considerable untapped potential, include SPY option users who lack awareness of the benefits of SPX relative to SPY options; OTC users, despite implementation delays in Dodd-Frank, we are seeing OTC-type trades come to CBOE; the institutional investors, asset managers, pension funds, insurance companies and financial advisors, some who are only just beginning to trade SPX; and overseas investors who can use SPX to hedge global economic risk or to officially take a position on the U.S. market. We believe that educational and marketing initiatives aimed at these customer segments helped to increase SPX trading in 2013, and we are intensifying those efforts going forward.","Turning now to trading VIX options and futures, which continue to grow at record levels. VIX options averaged 567,000 contracts per day in 2013, a new annual record and an increase of 28% over 2012.","The record-setting pace continued into the new year. January's average daily volume of 792,000 contracts marked a new monthly high for VIX options trading and represented an increase of 16% over January 2013 and 61% over December 2013.","VIX futures averaged nearly 159,000 contracts per day in 2013, an increase of 67% over the previous year. January 2014 average daily volume in VIX futures was 210,000 contracts, a new monthly record and an increase of 52% over January '13 and 38% over December '13.","While volume increases in VIX futures and options are predictably more pronounced during periods of greater volatility, such as those we experienced in January, we were particularly gratified that we also saw double-digit increases in VIX trading throughout 2013, which was marked by prolonged periods of low volatility.","Each wave of new users brings more liquidity and activity to our VIX marketplace. We believe we are still in the early stages of growing VIX domestically and that we have hardly begun to scratch the surface internationally. We intend to grow the volatility space in 2014 domestically and beyond through 3 major initiatives: Enhanced investor education, broadening access to our volatility marketplace and through new volatility products.","Investor education goes hand-in-hand with new products. This is particularly so when it comes to VIX trading, which has created an entirely new marketplace, and as some say, a whole new asset class. There is a tremendous thirst for knowledge about VIX futures and options from investors of every type.","Since its inception, VIX trading has captured the immense imagination of trading pros and sophisticated ballplayers. Last year, BlackRock and others endorsed VIX futures for the broader mainstream purpose of asset allocation, confirming a trend that we have long anticipated, given the inverse relationship with VIX and the broader stock market.","We have laid out an ambition -- ambitious educational plan for 2014 that responds to the growing demand for VIX information and trading resources. This includes expanding our business development staff as needed and beefing up our VIX educational offerings.","We also look forward this year to rolling out a new options and volatility educational app for mobile and tablets users and to unveiling a newly redesigned CBOE.com website, with additional options and volatility resources and enhanced mobile viewing.","While we are busy responding to a growing online and mobile world, surprising numbers of investors from around the world still wish to visit CBOE in person to see options and volatility trading firsthand and to attend the CBOE Options Institute. We meet demand for visiting groups and students. We just completed construction of a new and expanded home for the Options Institute overlooking the CBOE trading floor. We're excited about the opportunities the state-of-the-art space provides for us going forward.","An expanded 2014 curriculum at the Options Institute, both in our classrooms and online, is heavily weighted toward VIX futures and options, as well as SPX trading.","In the fourth quarter of 2013, we extended the trading day for VIX futures by 5 hours and 45 minutes. The extended trading day represents the demand from U.S. customers for additional trading time, while enabling European-based customers to access VIX futures during their local trading hours.","Trading for VIX futures now begins at 2:00 a.m. Central Time, which aligns with the 8:00 a.m. open of the London markets. We're pleased with the volume we see thus far during non-U.S. trading hours. As you would expect, there are significant volume spikes in the hours preceding the open of the U.S. markets on particularly volatile days, such as we saw in late January and early February. 8% of VIX futures trading now takes place outside of regular U.S. trading hours, and we expect the percentage to increase going forward.","This year, we plan to expand our extended trading hours initiative to nearly 24 hours, which will accommodate Asian market hours and a growing worldwide user base. We also look forward to adding VIX and SPX options to our extended trading hours initiative in 2014.","VIX product development continues at CBOE. We are thrilled that next week, on February 13, we will launch futures on our new short-term VIX Index, VXST, with short-term VIX options to follow.","VIX -- our short-term VIX futures and options will leverage the most compelling features of SPX Weeklys and VIX futures and options. Our team is currently ramping up a concerted marketing and educational campaign to support and promote the launch of these major new volatility products.","Like VIX, our Short-Term Volatility Index is based on real-time prices of SPX options. While VIX is calculated using SPX monthly options, short-term VIX uses S&P 500 options that expire in 1 week. We think the more targeted time horizon sets the stage for compelling trading opportunities, and customer feedback confirms that view.","Short-term VIX futures and options will have weekly expirations, enabling traders to fine-tune the timing of their volatility needs. We envision investors using these products to pinpoint and hedge against event-driven market moves, such as corporate earnings and Fed announcements.","Short-term VIX futures and options will have the same expiration day and a similar settlement process as VIX futures and options, enabling traders to create strategies using VXST and VIX to capture changes in the volatility term structure.","The ability to trade short-term volatility has generated considerable buzz since we announced the new products at CBOE's Risk Management Conference in Portugal last September. We look forward to making the concept a reality with the launch of short-term VIX futures next week.","Turning now to market share, where CBOE continues to hold the industry lead. In December 2013, CBOE and C2 accounted for 29.3% of all options trading, excluding dividend trades. CBOE commanded 27.5% of total industry market share, adjusted for dividend trades, just under its 28% total market share at the end of September 2013. In January 2014, CBOE's market share increased another percentage point to 28.5%.","In multi-listed options only, CBOE held 20.3% market share in December, down slightly from 20.9% at the end of September. In both cases, CBOE led the 12 options markets by a margin of several percentage points. C2 market share and multi-listed classes, excluding dividend trades, at the end of December was 2%, up slightly from the 1.9% at the end of September.","We are pleased with overall performance in the equity marketplace, but are never complacent. We closely monitor the daily changes in this very fluid arena and are prepared to quickly modify our CBOE and C2 models in response to competitive pressures.","Going forward, our entire team is excited about the opportunities before us to continue to further define and expand the options in the volatility space in 2014. Our strategy is clear and focused. We will continue to sow the seeds for our company's future growth, with programs aimed at developing new products, optimizing our market share in commoditized products and expanding our user base. And we will continue to capitalize on the favorable operating leverage inherent in our business through disciplined expense management and prudent allocation of capital.","On that note, I will turn it over to Alan Dean to report on our financials.","Alan J. Dean","Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As Ed mentioned earlier, 2013 was another record year for CBOE Holdings. We ended the year with a strong quarter and accomplished a number of important initiatives that positioned the company for continued growth. This morning, I will take you through our fourth quarter results, as well as provide guidance on certain financial metrics for 2014.","As outlined in the press release we issued earlier this morning, operating revenue was $141.8 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% compared with last year's fourth quarter. Operating income was $72.6 million, representing an operating margin of 51.2%, which was 130 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2012.","Net income allocated to common stockholders was $45.6 million, up 17% compared with the adjusted fourth quarter of 2012, which translates to diluted earnings per share of $0.52.","Before I continue, let me point out that our GAAP results reported for the fourth quarter of 2012 includes certain unusual items that impact the comparison of our operating performance. These items are detailed in our non-GAAP information provided in the press release and in the appendix of our slide deck.","Turning to the details of the quarter, as shown on this chart, the growth in operating revenue was predominantly driven by higher transaction fees. However, we did see increases in each revenue category, with the exception of access fees. As we have seen throughout the year, revenue from access fees was down slightly due to fee modifications implemented in the first half of 2013.","For 2014, there were no significant changes made on our fee schedule for trading permits, so revenue in 2014 will primarily be driven by demand for those trading permits.","Transaction fees increased $8.2 million or 9% from last year's fourth quarter, driven by a 22% increase in trading volume, offset somewhat by an 11% decrease in the average revenue per contract, or RPC, compared with last year's fourth quarter.","In the fourth quarter, we saw increases in trading volume across every product category compared against both the prior year period and the prior quarter.","Our blended RPC, including options and futures, was $0.316 compared with $0.355 in the fourth quarter of 2012. This decline was mainly due to an increase in volume-based incentives for certain multiply-listed options traded at CBOE under our Volume Initiative Program or VIP.","In addition, the products -- product mix shifted a bit with lower-margin multiply-listed options accounting for a higher percentage of trading volume during the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2012. As a result, the RPC in our options business declined to $0.275 compared with $0.322 in last year's fourth quarter. The revenue per contract on equity options and exchange traded products declined by 44% and 33%, respectively, while the RPC on index options held steady.","To put this decrease in the context, keep in mind that our market share and multiply-listed options in December 2012 hit a low for the year of 17.3% and dropped further in January of 2013. In response, we modified our VIP program in February 2013, and CBOE ended 2013 with market share of 20.3% in multiply-listed options for the month of December, 300 basis points higher than December of 2012.","On the futures side, CFE's revenue per contract was about $1.57, up 9% from the $1.44 in the fourth quarter of 2012.","As this slide depicts, multiply-listed options accounted for 66.2% of total contracts traded in the fourth quarter of 2013 in comparison with 65.6% in last year's fourth quarter, while the contribution from our highest-margin index options and futures contracts accounted for 33.8% of total volume versus 34.4% in last year's fourth quarter.","Converting the volume into transaction fees, you see that index options and futures contracts accounted for 80.1% of transaction fees, up from 71.3% in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Regulatory fees for the quarter increased $1.1 million compared with 2012's fourth quarter, but declined $1.4 million versus the prior quarter. As we had pointed out in our prior earnings calls, the revenue derived from these fees is only available to cover expenses we incur to carry out our obligations as a regulator. As a result, we make adjustments as needed to keep the revenue obtained from the options regulatory fee and related expenses in balance.","Accordingly, effective September 1, we modified our options regulatory fees for CBOE and C2. In our last earnings call, we stated that we expected regulatory fees to decline by about $1.6 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, assuming similar trading volume quarter-to-quarter.","Industry-wide options volume was a little better in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, resulting in a slightly lower-than-expected decline.","Continuing down the income statement, this next slide details total adjusted operating expense of $69.2 million for the quarter, which was up $4 million or 6% compared with last year's fourth quarter.","Turning to core operating expense. This slide details fourth quarter core expense of $43.9 million. This represents a decrease of $2.4 million or 5% compared with the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to lower expenses for outside services, offset somewhat by increases in employee costs and travel and promotional expenses. The decrease in outside services was mainly due to lower legal expenses, reflecting lower litigation expenses and the benefit of an insurance reimbursement. The increase in employee cost reflects higher salaries resulting from headcount additions, mainly in regulatory services and systems, as well as increases in stock-based compensation and the provision for employee bonuses. The increase in travel and promotion -- promotional expense was driven by higher advertising cost, which was mostly due to timing of expenses. For the full year, advertising expenditures were relatively flat year-over-year.","Looking at core expenses for the full year, we came in at about $186 million, slightly below the low end of our guidance of $189 million, but the difference is primarily a result of lower-than-anticipated legal expenses.","Going into the second half of the year, I was concerned that I might have to increase guidance, given the trajectory of legal expenses, but we caught a break in the third and fourth quarters when legal expenses declined, which resulted in a favorable variance.","Volume-based expenses, which include royalty fees and Trading Volume Incentives were $16.3 million for the quarter, an increase of $3.6 million or 28% versus last year's fourth quarter, primarily reflecting a $3.4 million increase in royalty fees.","This increase is directly related to the volume -- to the growth in trading volume in licensed products, as well as certain royalty fee adjustments.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.1% versus 33.1% in last year's fourth quarter. This variance was due to the recognition of significant discrete items related to prior years in 2012 versus no such prior year adjustments recognized in 2013. The lower tax rate of 36.1% for the fourth quarter of 2013 versus 2012's adjusted tax rate of 39% reflects higher tax benefits recognized for the domestic production activity deduction, also called the Section 199 deduction, resulting from an increase in our qualified production activities income.","This slide gives you the details of the tax adjustments to GAAP results.","Now a few highlights relating to our balance sheet and capital allocation. 2013, we generated more than $224 million in cash from operating activities, which enabled us to return more than $58 million to the stockholders through dividends and more than $51 million through share repurchases. Our capital position remains strong. We ended 2013 with cash and cash equivalents of $221.3 million and a strong balance sheet.","We have and will continue to take a disciplined approach to managing cash, looking first to fund the growth of our business, then to return capital to our stockholders through sustainable quarterly dividends and share repurchases.","Based on our strong cash position, in December, our Board declared a special dividend of $0.50 per share, or $43.8 million, that was paid out in January.","At the same time, the board...","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","And Ms. Koopman, you may begin now.","[Technical Difficulty]","Deborah Koopman","I just want to apologize to everybody. Our service provider for the conference call had some issues. And as you are aware, the call was dropped. We're going to give this another try. And again, I apologize for the issues from our service provider.","Alan J. Dean","Okay. Thank you, Debbie. This is Alan Dean. I'm going to pick up where, I hope, we left off. Let's now move to our 2014 guidance for certain financial metrics.","For 2014, we expect core expenses to be in the range of $191 million to $196 million, which represents an increase of 3% to 5% versus 2013. The increase primarily reflects higher expenses for regulatory services as we build on the effort we started in 2013, with a focus on maintaining the highest standards for regulation and compliance. The increased resources devoted to regulatory services primarily include the full year impact of 2013 staff additions, additional hiring in 2014 and further enhancements to our regulatory systems.","At the beginning of this year, we increased the actions regulatory fee, which is designed to cover this cost. We expect this -- the additional revenue generated from regulatory fees to offset the incremental cost with no impact to our bottom line.","Turning to stock-based compensation. In the first quarter of this year, we will grant additional shares of restricted stock as we did in 2013. As a result, we expect to record about $3 million of accelerated stock-based compensation expense in the first quarter. Accelerated stock-based compensation is not included in core expenses and will be reconciled as a non-GAAP item.","Continuing stock-based compensation, which is included in core expenses, is expected to be $13 million for the year. The decrease versus 2013 is due to the final vesting in June of stock awards granted in 2010 following our IPO.","Since stock-based compensation will fluctuate a bit quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of vesting of certain stock grants, the appendix includes a slide that provides guidance by quarter.","In 2014, capital spending is expected to be between $47 million to $50 million, up versus nearly the $32 million we spent in 2013. This increase primarily reflects additional capital spending to harden our systems, and the continuation of our efforts started in 2013 to enhance our systems and software for regulatory services.","In closing, we are very pleased with our results for 2013, and we head into 2014 well positioned for continued growth. We have the financial strength and breadth to execute on our near-term initiatives and to deliver solid results while also continuing to invest for long-term growth.","I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Thank you for your interest and your patience with this call -- during this call. I will now turn the call back to Debbie so we can hopefully take your questions.","Deborah Koopman","Thanks, Alan. At this point, we'd be happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] And again, we apologize, and thank you for your patience. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Sandler O'Neill.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","The -- my question goes to how well the VIX futures and the VIX complex is running. And I'm just trying to see whether can you distinguish -- we know the higher volatility undoubtedly helps the volumes and they're running at record levels. But is there anything that you can distinguish between, say, volatility-driven and incremental base growth? Because we still can see the open interest, it's still -- it's high, but it's not at the peak levels it was at other times of last year.","Edward T. Tilly","Yes, I think, back to the open interest question, Rich, that we've had the last couple of quarters, I think, as we pointed out, we see there are users now following CBOE's tail risk hedge strategy in that they're accumulating and buying volatility exposure when volatility is at historic lows. And as volatility increases, they are lightening up on that exposure. So we saw, in the last couple of months, people following that pretty closely. And so open interest, not surprisingly, while it is increasing slightly, did not make a very big jump because we had such a spike in volatility over a short period of time. We did notice for the first time, as volatility -- I'm sorry, as open interest decreased, as is typical around expiration, it built up rather quickly as compared to historical past because of the increase involved. And back to the user base, as we've been telling you, the original users are trading bigger and bigger and looking for more volatile exposure and more volatile exposure. The high-frequency traders tend to like the higher-volatility volatility, and I think we saw a great deal of that over the last 2 months, specifically.","Richard H. Repetto - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Great. The numbers certainly look good.","Edward T. Tilly","We're pretty pleased with what's happening.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Alan, just on the expenses. I guess, just 2 questions on that. Just in terms of the reimbursement in the fourth quarter, just whether that's significant that you want to call it out? And then, I think just going forward, I think I understand everything you went through. I just kind of want to get a sense -- because I understand the regulatory offset in terms of revenues and expenses, but when we think about sort of the run rate that we were at in 2013 going into '14, is there any big adjustment? I know it's based on activity levels and stuff, but I just want to get a sense on how much of that is the increase versus sort of core new investment?","Alan J. Dean","Okay, Mike. The returns for reimbursement was $1.5 million. So for us, that's kind of significant. And going forward, looking at our expenses for 2013 and what were -- our guidance for 2014, that's a 3% to 5% increase, that range, that $191 million to $196 million. And there's a couple of things going on here. First of all, we've got a -- the last vesting of our 2010 stock grant occurs in June of this year. So the amortization will end, and so that's reducing expenses. On the other hand, on the regulatory side, I've got a couple of things going on. I've got all the staff additions that occurred in 2013. I now have full year impact to 2014. In addition to that regulation is continuing to add staff, although not at the rate that we saw in 2013. And then we have systems adding staff in our efforts to harden our systems, as well as to modify, enhance, create applications for regulation. And so when you roll that in together, that's how we get to the 3% to 5% increase and guidance over what we're seeing in 2013.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit about the different use cases that you're communicating in trying to educate investors between VIX and the SPX options? Kind of in what circumstances folks would want to use SPX, and in what circumstances folks would want to use VIX, and the extent that you think VIX is incremental versus cannibalizing some of the SPX volume?","Edward T. Tilly","I think what you find is a pure volatility play. So if we look at risk in a portfolio, we can distinguish between a linear risk, long, short, and then Greek risk, which, as we're trying to pinpoint with a VIX contract, specifically volatility. So certainly, there are those that are looking to protect tail risk by using out-of-the-money SPX splits, but with those come Greek risks. So as the market moves down, obviously, those, \"We're out of the money; put some in SPX,\" become, \"In-the-money or out-the-money,\" and with that requires a much more constant hedging. By using a VIX contract, we're isolating that component of volatility -- of risk, called volatility, and you're able to take a position, long or short volatility, without all of the other Greek risk. So those are the 2 different users. I'm sure there has been some cannibalization of the out-of-the-money puts in SPX for example. But what we really think we've done here is by isolating the component of volatility, really attracted new users to a complex and new users with a completely different way to hedge their risks. That's the primary difference. So yes, some cannibalization, but growing a completely new user base who's simply interested in isolating the component volatility.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jillian Miller from BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You've got 8%, I think, you said of your VIX futures coming from the non-U.S. hours. And it's exciting to think you still have the rollout for the VIX options and S&P options in 2014, which are clearly much larger products. But what I'm trying to figure out is whether that 8% of volume is like incremental new volume that wouldn't have been there if you didn't have the extended hours, or whether it's volume that would have been there otherwise in the regular hours but it's just more convenient for your clients coming in at different times. So I'm just wondering how you guys think about it; if you have any way of tracking that or any visibility into whether this is truly incremental volume?","Alan J. Dean","Yes, I'll give you one example, I think, where the timing is really directed toward the user and the users finding the extended time and trading at that time and may not be willing to wait until the open, and I'll have -- Ed will give you some -- what our guys in the street are hearing and who the user base is. Let's take the January 31 as an example, where you're right, we averaged around 8%, but a very, very volatile overnight day like the 31st, where we traded 52,000 contracts in the non-U.S. trading day. That percentage is closer to 15% of a day. So we know that we are answering the demand of overnight risk, where someone isn't willing to wait for the open of the U.S. market. So I think that, that's an example of accommodating the demand that would not be met unless we were open for those extended trading hours. But Ed's got different insight from our business development guys as to who actually is accessing these markets in non-U.S. trading days -- hours.","Edward L. Provost","Jo-Ann -- Julian, I apologize. So yes, we actually just had a group in London within the last 2 weeks, and we were engaged in a conversation with users of our VIX futures, and specifically, they were addressing the extended trading hours. And they specifically noted that they had users using the products from the opening of the London market at 2:00 a.m. Chicago time. So it was evident to us that while it's always difficult to understand how much of that would have come into our marketplace had we not been open earlier, there is certainly a portion of that, that is incremental, and of course, some of that, which is cannibalized. We're fine with that. We believe, as we extend the hours later this year to nearly 24 hours, we will pick up additional incremental business. So we're very optimistic that it is not just cannibalization, but rather expanding the broader user base.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question, definitely a similar theme. You've been expanding the business, new products, new geographies. I'd love to get just a better indication of overall organic growth, trying to separate the volume growth that you're seeing, open interest growth that you're seeing based on new customers versus kind of the beta of the market. So is it possible to estimate the growth in the number of new users of that you're getting? Or are there any proxies for the growth of new users that you're looking at to kind of judge yourself and maybe that you could share with us to evaluate organic growth?","Edward T. Tilly","Kenneth, it's difficult. Because again, we don't have access to the detail at the customer account level. Obviously, all contracts are cleared through the options clearing operations, which is a separate organization from CBOE. But I will tell you that as we travel the globe and we engage clients both in the conferences which we organize, some of which we participate as speakers and then our one-on-one visits, the dialogue does reveal to us who among those clients we're speaking to are historically using our product, who -- which ones have been using, say, for example, SPX and maybe just transitioning to VIX, and others who have not been engaged in any of our proprietary products. So I can tell you, and the best example is our risk management conferences, which we run both here and in Europe. A significant component of those attendees are people that are brand-new to our product. So there's every reason to believe that we are engaging and bringing new clients into the business. That being said, we have clients who have been involved from Day 1 who are looking at different and new strategies, and we see them as increasing their use of the products as well. So it's a mix of both. It's a great question because we struggle to have as much precision around that question as possible, but it's really -- the answer really comes from a lot of different sources and a lot of dialogue.","Alan J. Dean","Yes, Ken, I think it's also -- from our perspective, we think we'll attract even another new user base when we launch the short term contract next week, similarly to new SPX users. So as SPX Weeklys really took off over the last 1.5 years or so, we know that those are new users who've come to the SPX complex looking for shorter-term trading opportunities. We think the same thing and the same opportunity holds for us beginning next week when we launch VXST. So we continue to grow the base by slightly changing the contract specs, and in this case, a shorter duration.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So what's the punchline? Based on your different sources, is it like -- does it feel like it's 10%? Does it feel like it's closer to 20%? Does it feel like it might even be bigger than that? Like do you have just a way to frame it with a number?","Edward T. Tilly","Unfortunately, with this trajectory, as we've said in the past, that until we see a sustained plateau and we can identify where the penetration has been, this growth, as evidenced with the return to more historic levels of volatility, shows the increase in the potential going forward. So I wouldn't dare make a prediction on the penetration yet, when we're coming off of 2 record months just as we return to more historic levels of vol [volatility]. So no, I won't give you that number. But as we've always said in the past, if we see a plateau, it'll be easier for us to identify the next circle of users, if you will. But right now, we're still building this original user group.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Evercore.","Christopher J. Allen - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","You mentioned the increased CapEx spending to harden the systems. I'm just wondering if you can give us some color and details around that, and what prompted the new investments there?","Edward L. Provost","This is Ed Provost. So yes, last year, for the securities industry as a whole, the -- we had both on the stock side of the business and on the option side of the businesses, outages related to national market systems, to -- related to failures within broker-dealer systems that sent orders into the exchanges. And then, of course, the exchanges themselves, including CBOE, had its own issues. Ours was around our 40th anniversary celebration last April. So under the overall umbrella of Reg SCI, which will ultimately lay out regulatory requirements for things like disaster recovery and the timing that you will be allowed to recover that way, we are jumping ahead of that and making investments in our infrastructure. Examples of that being taking some of the hardware, which we utilize for multiple purposes and separating it out, even though it's designed to do multiple functions. But in order to reduce single points of failure, making investments in hardware to separate those functions so as to reduce the likelihood of any outage. Other kinds of things including enhanced testing, upgrading operating software and other things that we can do to ensure that our systems are as close to 100% over the course of 2014 as possible. Our track record really has been fabulous through the years. But last year, for the industry as a whole, and even for us in a couple of isolated instances, we had some outages. So we believe an investment in our technology will go a long way towards moving us toward that 100% mark, if at all that can be achieved. And we're optimistic that it can. One point I'll make is we had a very, very successful industry test just last weekend, in which we, on a Saturday, transitioned from our primary to our back-up data center in a matter of minutes. We had most all of our major liquidity providers connected. So we already feel great confidence in things we have accomplished in the time since we began making these investments. So we're very committed toward achieving this, and it does involve some expense.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Question on competition. So I guess the ISE is going to give up their legal fight now; you guys talked about that already on the call. But just curious to get your thoughts. It looks like these guys are exploring launching their own volatility-related products based on a different index. And just wondering how you guys think about your defenses, given, obviously, you are the early leader there. And how important do you think branding is for a product like this?","Edward T. Tilly","A couple of questions in there, Chris, and I appreciate it. Yes, we believe branding is very, very important. We are the first mover. The open interest is with our VIX contracts, both futures and options. There has been volatility trading for as long as I can remember. I've been on the trading floor 25 years ago, and we traded volatility. We did not have a way to accurately measure and trade volatility on its own. VIX is the only contract that is tradable with an underline that can be replicated with the component parts that derive the volatility contract. That's very special. That's why the Globe has endorsed our methodology and why there are many licenses and other exchanges that use CBOE's methodology. So there will be other contracts coming out, I'm sure. I'm sure that the ISE's contract will not be the last. But we're very, very comfortable with where we find ourselves with the open interest and the growth in VIX. I will point out, if there's any success in that contract, in ISE, it will be because the users of those contracts have to hedge, and the only hedge is VIX futures and VIX options.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just, I guess, a quick one on the non-transaction items on the revenue. I don't think you gave, really, a guidance outside of regulatory fees, but are there any things you can pinpoint? In particular, on the access fees, I think, Allen, you talked about the pricing hasn't changed, so it's really all a matter of the number of, I guess, licenses still. Any view there? I think that's been surprising to a lot of the people that, that continues to be so high and people continue to want to access the market and that hasn't gone away, and you have the power -- pricing power there. And also how is that changing with some of the European access, maybe, 24 hours trading in the future? Can this actually start growing as new users connect to the exchange? And maybe you can give us a little bit of a magnitude here.","Edward T. Tilly","Yes, it's a great question, Alex. We didn't change fees in 2014 for access fees. So I didn't point out any guidance or point you to any change in that line item. I really expect that line item to be close to flat year-over-year. But you're right, certain things can affect access fees, primarily volume. And so if we see volume in the industry or in our proprietary or licensed products that will increase demand, it could come domestically. It could come elsewhere. And so there could be a surprise there in terms of access fees going forward, pointing that up. But where I sit right now, I'm -- maybe it's a conservative view, but I'm looking at flat year-over-year. Going down the P&L, at other revenue items, exchange services and other fees, again, no major changes of fees in there, so that will be a demand-driven thing, and I don't see demand changing beyond where we're at right now. Again, that could change if new participants come to our market and want more log-ins or lines or a different way to come into us that -- so that could be a factor there. Market data fees, as you know, is market share-driven, so I'm thrilled with our market share right now on the multi-list side. But if VIX and SPX takes off next year, and we, at the same time, hold our market share on the multi-list side, that would -- could have the effect of driving additional revenue in the market data fees. Regulatory fees, I did talk about that, so I won't go over that. And then Other, I didn't talk about, I really don't know of anything that is material or extraordinary happening in that line item in 2014. So is that good?","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe just to clarify. In the access fees, just as you're expanding to Europe, there are no fee waivers or anything like that for new people signing up and using the exchange for the first time, right? So any new -- this system should be theoretically drive access fees higher?","Alan J. Dean","That is correct. There are no fee waivers or incremental fees for new people. No changes at all from the way we -- what we charge for an access fees for May 1 of last year through right now, and as far as I can see forward, no changes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Christian Onwugbolu from Credit Suisse.","Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The OCC recently announced that it received regulatory approval to clear OTC equity index options. Just curious on your thoughts on any impacts to CBOE.","Edward T. Tilly","So sure. Let me bring you back a little bit and kind of outline our approach to OTC, and it's really one that we described pretty thoroughly way back on our roadshow, and it's just taken this long for the third leg to finally be approved at OCC. But initially, what we believed was exchanged look-alike contracts, those OTC contracts that trade OTC that are most like what's listed on the exchange, we needed to accommodate those. So we automated an SPXpm contract, which really lines up with the convention of OTC, a pm-settled contract. So with SPX, it's the traditional SPX. SPXpm and our Weeklys, we really satisfied the first users of the most exchanged look-alike contracts and then we automated our FLEX contracts, so that is the contract that allows users to customize the terms of a contract. By automating FLEX, we think we satisfied the second user, one OTC user, one that needs slightly more customization in their needs. And now finally, we told you on our roadshow that we clarified our agreement with Standard & Poor's that allows them to license to OCC the clearing of S&P 500 trades. It's very important to point out that CBOE benefits economically similarly in that the fees that OCC generates, CBOE receives something as if those trades occurred at CBOE. So we're optimistic that OTC users will clear at OCC, and very specific guidelines as to the contracts that will qualify for OCC clearing, and you can find that at the SEC.gov website. There are size and duration restrictions as to the type of contracts that can be cleared at OCC. So all in all, we think it's in the final prong to this approach that we outlined quite some time ago. And I think, importantly, from our perspective, we see the benefit not just in that first print, that first big OTC trade that clears at OCC, but rather, in the velocity of hedging of that trade that we think will occur in the traditional SPX on our floor or the SPXpm contract. So that's really what we think the opportunity is, even though we'll benefit from the economics of that trade that clears at OCC.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, Ed, so I wanted to follow-up on the comment you made about BlackRock and sort of the endorsement and some of the VIX product that they're starting to use. When you guys talked to those -- some of the larger asset managers, can you give us a sense, I guess, which type of product strategies are picking up the product and gaining a little bit of traction with you guys? And also on the flip side, when you talk to end users with respect to adoption of the product, what are some of the bigger hurdles that you guys are facing from their side?","Edward L. Provost","Well, so I'll answer your last question first, Alex. This is Ed Provost. The big end users, the traditional managed money, in particular, the pension space, the biggest hurdle is always whether or not the fund is allowed to trade options, and more broadly, to use derivatives. So that's always a challenge, has been for the 40-year history of the CBOE. We've made great progress, but it is still the case. In fact, we have a pension plan here in the CBOE building today that we're speaking to educating them about the use of option products. Not even as far down the line as VIX, but the basic SPX product, trying to help them understand not only how the product works, how it can increase their returns, but how to convince their board that they should be allowed to use options and other derivative products like options to manage their portfolio. So we still, to this day, have the hurdles at the institutional level, especially in the pension area, in getting them to be able to utilize the product. And then once we get past that, educating them on how to use it and then taking them down to using more advanced products like the VIX. So as to the specific strategies that hedge funds use, they're a bright group of people, and they have developed all kinds of different strategies that we have monitored. The BlackRock paper, which we often have referred to, talked about writing VIX options against long portfolios to generate the premium that would increase the return. So that's a very common strategy. We see multiple-legged spreads coming in, lots of sophisticated uses of the products. So again, it's -- this is a product that is still is in its infancy, we believe, not only in terms of the number of people using it, but the kinds of strategies that are being utilized by even the current users that are using the product. So we're feeling very confident. We speak about all of these at our conferences. And oftentimes, we end up learning a lot from our very sophisticated users about how they are using the product.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Gaston Ceron from Morningstar Equity.","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the CapEx. You guys gave some great detail and color on exactly what's driving that. I just have a quick follow-up on that, which is, I mean, with all the attention given to systems issues within exchange industry, do you expect this to be a 1-year bump in CapEx? Or do you think that we're going to be at these elevated levels for a while for a few years going forward? Or if they come down, that they may not come down back to where they were kind of going into this year?","Alan J. Dean","Gaston, that's a good question. I'm going to say, I think it'll be somewhere in the middle. I don't think it'll be back to where we were in 2013 or 2012. But in a lot of respects, I look at what were the hardware that we're purchasing in 2014 and the systems application changes that we're making in 2014. Some of them are onetime or might just require enhancements going forward. So the way I'm looking at it right now, it's probably somewhere in the middle, maybe a little higher than the middle going forward. But that's how I see it right now.","Edward L. Provost","Gaston, Ed Provost. Just to add that once Reg SCI comes out in final, and presumably, that will happen later this year, it will give us a better understanding of what the SEC requirements will be. As I've mentioned earlier on, we're running ahead of what we expect the SEC will require and doing things that we think are in the best interest of our company. So I would agree with Alan. It's a little hard to predict. My sense is we will have greater investment continued going forward, but probably, we'll have just -- this bump in 2014 will hopefully be a bump, and that's something that will be sustained at that high level in the years coming.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James.","Patrick J. O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So Alan, quick follow-up question for you. I know you love to predict legal expenses. So the lawsuit from the bad eye [ph] is finally over with. Are your professional expenses going to be kind of reset to a newer lower level?","Alan J. Dean","Yes. I do think that legal expenses, which is in outside services, will be lower in 2014. Maybe the run rate that we saw in the third and fourth quarter may continue into 2014, but there's another aspect of outside services you need to be aware of, and that's contract programmers, which is also in that line item. And so any expense related to contract programming, so any development, enhancement of existing applications that gets expensed in that, capitalized, run through that line item, and consistent with our system's hardening theme and regulatory systems creation, I see increases there in 2014.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jillian Miller from BMO Capital Markets.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Given some of the volatility we've been seeing in REITs products, I was just wondering if we can get an update on your Treasury VIX that you were working on with CME, like what's the expected launch date, what are your expectations of the product and users? And then I was also hoping you might be able to give us an idea for what type of revenue share you have with CME on that.","Edward T. Tilly","So first, I mean, in order, the things that we're really looking forward to as far as the calendar goes, next week is going to be a big one for us. We're probably most optimistic on the VXST launch. Then expanding the trading hours to include, as Ed Provost pointed out, a near 24 hours a day toward midyear. And then I think, if you look for the calendar, I think the best case for our venture with the CME would be late fourth quarter into -- and perhaps, 2015. That's actually how I think you should look at it. And then as far as the sharing, Alan's really against sharing specifics on those deals, so I won't go around him on that. But that's how -- when you look at it, it's really a fourth quarter, maybe beginning of next year.","Jillian Miller - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then on your market share, I apologize if you mentioned this in the call and I didn't hear it. But I was just wondering if there is anything going on in January. I mean, we've seen an increase across multi-list products, and I don't think you changed pricing or anything. So I was just wondering kind of why the improvement's there, if you have an idea for that.","Edward L. Provost","I think -- Jillian, Ed Provost. I think it really does, at the beginning of the year, caused firms to relook at the various complicated fee schedules across the exchanges. And I think I can say with confidence that there has been some greater focus by some large firms as the new year has begun on the opportunities to consolidate their order flow and take advantage of some favorable pricing at CBOE. So I think that, in conjunction with the higher volatility, has benefited CBOE's market share, and hopefully, that will be sustained through the year.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Deborah Koopman for any further remarks.","Deborah Koopman","Thank you. And again, I want to thank everybody for their patience, and we appreciate your time and your continued interest in our company. Good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program, and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone."]}}
