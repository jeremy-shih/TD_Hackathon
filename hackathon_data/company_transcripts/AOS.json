O. Smith Corporation First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions).","I'll now introduce your host for today's conference, Pat Ackerman, Vice President Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.","Patricia Ackerman","Thank you, Ashley. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2014 conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","A note this morning to you all, on the conference call, is that the slide deck is viewer control, so you will have to advance the slides as we go along. That's just a little hiccup we have this morning. So just be aware of that that you will need to advance your own slides.","The next slide, before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking states are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","The next slide. In order to provide improved transparency into operating results of our business, we are providing non-GAAP measures, adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted segment operating earnings that exclude certain items, as well as non-operating pension costs consisting of interest costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and curtailments. Prior year results are provided on a comparable basis. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website.","Ajita, I will now turn the call over to you.","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you, Pat. I'm on slide four, which says first quarter highlights.","2014 is off to a great start. We continue to see the benefits in our performance from the housing recovery in the U.S. and our expanding consumer product business in China. Here are a few highlights.","Our organic growth drove sales 8% higher to a first quarter record of $552 million. China sales growth of 25% exceeded our expectations, and growth was across the board with gas tankers, water treatment, and renewable energy products growing faster than the business as a whole.","Our adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share was 13% higher than the $0.48 per share recorded last year primarily driven by higher sales. We continue to allocate a portion of our capital to returning cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we announced the 25% dividend increase and repurchased $21 million of stock.","To allow us to continue to repurchase our shares, our Board increased its authorization by 1.5 million shares in April.","John will now describe our results in more detail.","John Kita","Thank you, Ajita.","Slide five. Sales for the first quarter of $5.52 million were 8% higher than the previous year driven by higher volumes of water heaters in the U.S. and China. Adjusted earnings of $49.7 million improved 11% from 2013. Adjusted earnings in 2014 excluded after tax non-operating pension cost of $3 million. Adjusted earnings in 2013 excluded after tax non-operating pension cost of 3 million, an after-tax gain of 6.8 million related to a settlement with the supplier, and an after-tax restructuring and impairment expenses of $9.5 million.","On slide six, adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share improved 13% compared with $0.48 per share last year. The effective income tax rate of 28.8% associated with first quarter adjusted earnings was approximately 1 percentage point lower than in the first quarter last year providing a $0.01 per share benefit to first quarter 2014 adjusted earnings per share. Reconciliation from GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included at the end of this presentation and covers the previously discussed items.","Slide seven. Sales in our North America segment of $389 million increased 3% over last year driven by higher sales of residential and commercial water heaters in the U.S., which were partially offset by lower Canadian water heater volumes and a weaker currency in Canada. The unfavourable sales impact from Canada amounted to approximately $5.5 million. ","Rest of World segment sales of $173 million increased 25% compared with last year driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products in China, market acceptance of our newer higher value water-heating products in China, and new store additions.","After examining buying patterns by our top seven customers during the quarter compared with the prior year, we believe a change and inventory levels favourably impacted our sales in China by approximately $10 million.","On slide eight, North America adjusted operating earnings of $59 million were slightly below last year and adjusted operating margin of 15.2% declined as well. The favourable impact from higher volumes in the U.S. and savings associated with rationalization of our manufacturing footprint were offset by higher steel prices, lower volumes in Canada, and a weaker Canadian dollar. As a result of higher steel prices, we announced a mid-single digit price increase in North America, which will be effective May 1.","Rest of World operating earnings of $25 million improved almost 40% compared with last year. The favourable impact from higher sales and improved mix of products in China was partially offset by sales-related increases in selling and advertising costs and higher expenses related to opening a second water heater plant in China in late 2013. Operating margin was 14.5%, an improvement over last year, largely due to improved profitability in our China water treatment business.","Our adjusted corporate expenses was $13 million, an increase from the prior year, primarily due to higher stock-based compensation costs, related to shorter amortization periods.","On slide nine. Cash provided by operations of 12 million in the first quarter of 2014 was lower than the 34 million provided last year as a result of higher outlays for working capital in the 2014 period. We're expecting an operating cash flow for the full year 2014 to be between $240 million and $250 million.","Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 15% at the end of March 2014. We have sizable cash balances located offshore, and our net cash position was almost $250 million at the end of the first quarter this year.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 450,000 shares of common stock for a total of $21 million under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan. At the end of the first quarter, we have repurchased approximately 300,000 additional shares. Considering the additional 1.5 million shares authorized in April by our Board, we have approximately $1.9 million shares remaining on our existing repurchased authority today.","Depending on factors such as stock price, working capital requirement, and alternative investment opportunities, we expect to repurchase a significant portion of the authorized shares in 2014. ","Slide ten. This morning, we increased our adjusted earnings guidance to $2.20 to $2.35 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance represents a 10% increase in after-tax earnings compared with our 2013 results.","Non-operating pension costs are expected to be $0.14 per share in 2014, slightly above the $0.13 per share in 2013. Recall that in 2015, our pension plan will sunset for almost all beneficiaries. We expect this to result in a considerable reduction to our pension costs for 2015.","Our GAAP EPS guidance is $2.06 to $2.21 per share. Our adjusted EPS and our GAAP EPS guidance does not include the impact from future acquisitions.","I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the assumptions in our 2014 outlook and reiterate our acquisition strategy.","Ajita Rajendra","Thanks, John.","I'm on slide 11 which has a heading that says, \"2014 Outlook and 140-year anniversary.\"","As John mentioned, the midpoint of our updated 2014 guidance implies growth of 10% in adjusted earnings per share over last year. Our outlook for 2014 includes the following assumptions. First, we continue to see strong growth in China. As many of you know, we operate as the consumer product business in that region and have invested significantly in innovation, safety, reliability, and quality to sustain and enhance our position as the leading premium water heating brand.","The return on our investment in engineering and innovation together with distribution expansion and market share growth are the key drivers of our success in China. The macro-environment tool provides three important tailwinds for our business. First, our premium consumer products, with a highly recognizable brand are in the sweet spot of the government's desire to grow the consumption part of China's economy.","Second, China recently set a goal for the population to be 60% urban by 2020. This push for urbanization equates to 10 million to 15 million people per year moving to the cities, and many of whom may buy apartments and water heaters.","Third, rate inflation has been increasing recently, and this adds the expansion of discretionary income. Combining all of these factors gives us confidence that we will continue to at least grow at two-times China's GDP rate.","Second assumption, we expect the Lochinvar brand to continue to benefit from the transition from lower efficiency non-condensing boilers to higher efficiency condensing boilers to higher efficiency condensing boilers and also from strong market acceptance FTXL boiler. Both of these products are expected to be introduced in the second half of this year. ","Lochinvar branded condensing boilers continue to offer a compelling feedback in the form of energy savings, and we have better reputation for innovation and outstanding product quality. As a result, we expect Lochinvar branded sales to grow at approximately 10% in 2014 well ahead of GDP growth in the U.S. ","Third, we are cautiously optimistic about the developing recovery in U.S. housing. After a very strong industry growth in 2015, helped by improved levels of home completions and significant expansion of the replacement market, we expect residential water heater volumes in the U.S. to be up to approximately 9 million units, including tankless, primarily due to an increase in new home constructions this year. We expect commercial water heater volumes will increase to approximately 162,000 units. Both of these industry estimates are improvements from the levels we originally forecast in our generate guidance and reflect a strongest tax of the industry this year.","Fourth, we announced the mid-single digit price increase for wholesale water heaters in North America effective May 1st. This price increase was anticipated as we saw steel prices climb steadily over the last several quarters.","And our fifth assumption, as discussed in the past, 2014 will be negatively impacted by higher cost associated with the new factory in China in approximately $10 million of incremental ERP implementation expenses. ","In addition, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate for the year will be between 29% and 30% in 2014 higher than the 28.3% we sell in 2013.","I'm on to the next slide now, slide 12, which shows the A.O. Smith growth strategy. Our acquisition strategy has not changed. We remained focused on water heating and water-related technology companies around the world, as well as leveraging our brand, our brand equity and distribution channel in China. Our target list continues to evolve. In the last 12 to 18 months, we've walked away from several targets primarily because of price and new names have been added to our pipeline. Our teams are energetic and very engaged in the process.","We will continue to consider a combination of support for organic growth, acquisitions, share repurchase and dividends for capital deployment. ","Slide 13, our investment criteria. You've seen this slide before, and we showed this as a reminder that we will continue to be financially disciplined acquirer of companies within our stated corporate strategy. ","Now, this concludes our prepared remarks, and we're open for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions).","Our first question comes from William Bremer of Maxim Group. Your line is open.","William Bremer \u2013 Maxim Group","Good morning.","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning.","Patricia Ackerman","Good morning.","John Kita","Good morning.","William Bremer \u2013 Maxim Group","Nicely done. I love the consistency.","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you.","William Bremer \u2013 Maxim Group","All right. Let's first start off with Lochinvar. Could you give us a sense of how it\u2019s contributed to the quarter? And more importantly, what did you see on the aftermarket there?","John Kita","Well, it was an interesting quarter for Lochinvar. They were up about 7%, and we feel they were affected pretty significantly by the weather. The contractors we talked to said that they were basically so busy that they only had time to repair versus replace, which can take two to three days. ","We saw that in our parts business. Our parts business was up almost 20% year-over-year and was actually as strong as the fourth quarter, which is very unusual for them from a parts standpoint, so they were affected by the weather. We're still very comfortable that coming out as Ajita talked about two new products in the last half of the year. We are incurring some engineering and expenses to get those to market, but we're very excited about the products that we're bringing, and we're comfortable at this point that they can still achieve their 10% growth.","William Bremer \u2013 Maxim Group","Okay, John. Thank you. ","And can you give us an update on how you're considering rolling out the residential end to that abroad?","John Kita","You're talking about Lochinvar in China?","William Bremer \u2013 Maxim Group","Yes, I am.","John Kita","So I think there's not much of an update. We'll have the residential boiler there relatively soon. We're still running into some headwinds with respect to the commercial boiler in getting the approvals. We're looking at a couple of different strategies with respect to that right now. We're still comfortable long term that the boiler business will be a good growth opportunity in China, but it's taking longer than expected, but we're looking at a couple of different strategies with respect to commercial.","Ajita Rajendra","Let me jump in here too, Bill. This is Ajita.","We are seeing some signs in China where the government is starting to talk about cutting back on coal consumption and increasing natural gas in the country, and all of those signs are very positive signs from the point of view of these types of very highly energy efficient products.","So again, as John said, it's going a little slower than we'd like, but the long-term prospects are right in line with our expectations.","William Bremer \u2013 Maxim Group","Great. And then just a quick follow-up here. Can you give us an update on India, how that's progressing and what your strategy is throughout '14?","Ajita Rajendra","India is going well. Right now, the economy is kind of at a standstill, and the depreciation of the Rupee has hurt us as we have said in the past, but if you look at what's happening with the business in local currency in India, it's right on track. We are increasing market share slowly, expanding distribution, and the business is growing. We don't see it in dollars, because the depreciation of the Indian Rupee essentially almost offsets the increase in volume that we're seeing.","So we are happy with the business in local currency. We are not quite as happy when you translate it back to U.S. dollars. But again, the longer-term trends are very positive. There is a lot of anticipation that after the election and once they -- the issues with the election die down and there is a definite result that the economy will pick up again.","William Bremer \u2013 Maxim Group","Great. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Somerville of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning guys. This is John for Matt. ","Just first a couple of questions on the price increase, is that May 1st price increase across the board and North America, both residential and commercial, kind of similar mid-single digit range? And then a follow on to that, I mean obviously steel costs have increased over the last few quarters, but I believe Caldwell was still low where it was the last time you raised prices, in I think it was mid-2012. So how confident are you that that's going to stick? Are you the first mover here or are you following kind of industry price increases or just maybe talk to the confidence level that you're going to see stickiness in that price increase?","Ajita Rajendra","We are pretty confident about the price increase. And I am not sure about the steel data. We'll have to check on that, but my perception is that steel prices were in fact lower at that time, although I'm not sure about that. Okay? We\u2019ll have to check on that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Ajita Rajendra","But the indications in the marketplace are pretty good. There was not a lot of pushback, a very little pushback from our distributors, and so we feel pretty good about the price increase.","Unidentified Analyst","And just given the timing, I mean, it's May 1st. So, since it's mid-quarter, we shouldn't see \u2013 there was no pull forward into the first quarter. There shouldn't be any impact, I wouldn't think, on a quarterly basis.","Ajita Rajendra","Not in the first quarter. No, there was almost -- I shouldn't say almost. There was no buying in that we saw in the first quarter. We'll see a little bit of impact in the second quarter, but not much.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah. Okay. And then on the commercial side, commercial volumes -- you said commercial volumes were up in the quarter that was against the pretty tough double-digit comp, and I think there was pre-buy in California last year. You've increased your commercial industry outlook slightly, it looks like. So, are you seeing signs that non-res activity is starting to improve or what gives you -- how do you explain kind of the commercial bump?","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah, we see non-res activities starting to improve and feel pretty good about that, which is why we bumped it up.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","John Kita","It started out relatively slow. I'd say, it shows that January and February were pretty weak, but we saw a very strong March. So, that's what gave us the comfort level to raise it up some.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then lastly, John, you mentioned the 10 million inventory benefit in China. Did something drive that? Is that a pull forward into the first quarter? Is it just your customers willing to kind of have higher inventory levels because of the consumer demand they're seeing? Just a little more color on that please.","John Kita","I mean, part of it is the delta last year in the first quarter our major customer ship out of inventory. So the inventory's levels went down about $5 million. This year in the first quarter, our customers built their inventory levels about $5 million. So that delta is about $5 million. We're not really uncomfortable with the inventory level. It was just kind of a quarter-to-quarter comparison.","Ajita Rajendra","Right. The $5 million up and down month by month per quarter is not unusual, as John said. But we try to -- when we do have inventory data, we try to look at it to make sure that we give you an accurate picture of what's going on.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. That's very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Graham of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning.","John Akita","Good morning.","Patricia Ackerman","","Good morning.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Ajita, I just want to understand your market assumption for the U.S. res tankless. Are you using 4% for tankless as a percent of the market or 5%?","Ajita Rajendra","It's about approximately 4%.","John Kita","About 400,000 units.","Ajita Rajendra","Four hundred thousand units.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Four hundred thousand units. So essentially you're lifting your assumption in North America non-tankless by about a point, right?","John Kita","Yeah, by about 100,000 units. Yeah.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Right, right. Okay. I just want to kind of get that math right. So you're up by a point even though first -- January and February which I think you allude to as being weather affected were up five.","Ajita Rajendra","Well, yeah. So on the residential side, January and February we're up 5%, okay? And we think that March was very similar. So we think the first quarter industry is up about 5%.","What I was alluding to earlier was commercial was down January and February. But up significantly in March.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Well, I guess I would have to believe that the weather affected January and February numbers of residents as well though, right?","Ajita Rajendra","Possibly.","John Kita","Yeah.","Ajita Rajendra","That's possible.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay. ","Ajita Rajendra","Again, we saw a very strong quarter as it was. We think about 5% for the industry.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Understood. But even with that, let's say it didn't affect your 5% in the first quarter and your estimate is about -- you're assuming 4% for the year.","Ajita Rajendra","Right. That's right. That's about right.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay. All right. Next question kind of related to China, and I don't think we've ever asked this question before, could you guys separate out in total what your new distribution points impact on sales were versus the rest of the business if only versus the same store stuff?","Ajita Rajendra","That's very difficult to do. We really have not thought -- we don't look at it separately because when distribution points change, there's always a change going on in terms of less efficient distribution points shutting down and new ones opening up. And so hopefully the mix is always getting a little better. And so because of all that change, we don't really look at to try to separate it out in that manner.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC","(Indiscernible) gets at least. The reason I'm asking is that obviously your two largest customers there are more than half of the sales. So I was hoping that maybe at least we can get one-third, two-thirds.","John Kita","I don't know if I can give you that, Scott. But our two largest customers are about 40% of our business.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Forty percent, I'm sorry.","John Kita","And why it gets really difficult is we're adding primarily distribution in tier two, okay? We're closing -- and the phenomena we talked about the end of, I think it was '12, continues. There's a significant amount of closures of new stores and opening of new stores with the net increase being -- the net being an increase. So it's a real struggle to try to get even same store sales and some of that data.","Clearly, I'll tell you this, quarter-over-quarter, I think new store additions help us year over year. We have had a net just from the fourth quarter, third quarter, we added probably a net of 150 to 200 stores. But again, most of those are in tier two, tier three setting so that they don't have the same per volume throughput after tier one starts happening.","John Kita","Another thing that's impacting us is the growth in online sales, which doesn't really have a correlation to number of those. And our online sales last year were on $16 million, and we hope that we'll double that this year. And when we look at the first quarter, it's suddenly on track to do that.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay. So let me ask the question maybe a little bit differently here. If we look at the sales growth number, X out the inventory impact. Your sales were still kind of 15% plus op, right? I'm sorry, the inventory impact.","John Kita","Right.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Where I'm trying to get at here is that off of my past calculations, I have always assumed 5%-ish type of new distribution add to sales. Would it be fair to say that even if you don't want to get that granular, do you think that your same store sales are still outperforming China GDP?","John Kita","I would say that same store sales are probably not outperforming.","Ajita Rajendra","I don't know that we have.","John Kita","Yeah. But it's a combination. As we've said, we're growing differently. We have a higher average price, okay, year over year. And as of new products, we have a change in mix. We have new distribution. We have answerably product line like water treatment, commercial combi growing much faster than the average. Then we have the inventory build. So I think that's a pretty consistent story in that. We continue to grow a lot of different ways, and that's why we're comfortable saying that on average we're going to grow 15%.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC","I got you. That helps. Thank you.","My other question is about the acquisition environment. And I don't know if this means anything, but your corporate expenses were a little bit higher than what I was expecting. Was there an acceleration in due diligence work in the first quarter on M&A?","John Kita","I think we've talked about corporate in our last conference call and we spent traditionally our first quarter because of LTI grants and the way we have to amortize them much quicker because some of the executives are getting retirement eligible. I think we highlighted that that the first quarter was going to be the highest corporate expense. We're still comfortable. When we said at the end of the year of 49, we think we can probably have corporate come in around 48 or so.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies LLC","","Okay. So, I guess the bottom line to that question would be really squarely for you Ajita. Could you access any type of probability that you\u2019ll get a deal done in 2014?","Ajita Rajendra","That\u2019s almost an impossible question because like I said we are looking \u2013 I\u2019m happy with what we see in terms of the pipeline and potential. Like we have said that when we layout our financial criteria the price that we\u2019re seeing becomes a concern especially given today\u2019s interest rates and competition from P\/Es etc. who are essentially looking at a slightly different math. And we will continue to be a very disciplined acquirer to make sure that when we do make an acquisition that it would be where we see value creation, and it adds value to our shareholders. So, to be able to predict whether we can do or not, I wouldn\u2019t go there at this point.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Aditya Satghare of FBR. Your line is open.","Aditya Satghare \u2013 FBR Capital","So two questions. First on the China market here, how should we think about your growth in China in the context of overall water heater growth in China? How should we think about the utilization level of this factory as we go forward?","Ajita Rajendra","Why don\u2019t I jump in and then John maybe you should add some color to it? In looking at the water heater factory, obviously we just started \u2013 I mean we started our production little after midyear last year and it\u2019s building as the volume builds. So, it\u2019s nowhere near in terms of being fully utilized and we didn\u2019t expect it to be. So from that perspective it\u2019s adding cost as we\u2019ve indicated and that\u2019s in our guidance. I mean it\u2019s in line with what we expected and what we\u2019ve seen. And the teams are working on productivity improvements and all the rest of things to mitigate that as much as possible again all in line with our expectations and guidance from when we opened the factory. So, not much change there. ","What is the first question \u2013 oh, the water heater market in general. If you look month by month things go up and down, okay? But overall, Aditya, if you look at the last six months and our anticipation going forward is that we have gained market share and we continue to gain market share over an extended period of time. Month by month things go up and down. Usually in the first quarter we go down a little bit in market share because we pulled back with spring festival etc., we pulled back a little bit on our promotion and you\u2019ve seen that in the past. But overall the trend has been a slow increase in market share. We expect that over time to flatten out because obviously you can\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not an unlimited thing to go in terms of market share. Overall, we expect that to flatten out.","Aditya Satghare \u2013 FBR Capital","One more question on China then, so you mentioned three products which contributed strongly for China growth, you mentioned the gas products, the renewable products and I missed the third one. But how can we think about your market share in some of these high-end differentiated products and maybe sort of broadly touch on what are some of the key factor, the key differentiating points customers are willing to pay for in terms of your products?","Ajita Rajendra","I think the best way to look at it, Aditya, is that we have a team there really spends a lot of time and money and effort understanding the consumer and consumer trends. And combining that with our product development capability and speed to market, we stay ahead, we have in the past and we continue to stay ahead of the trends in terms of where the market is moving and come out with the products with the features and benefits and become first [ph] to market with key features and benefits at the high end that people are prepared to pay for. ","And so our portfolio and mix of products is always changing. If you go back a few years, our product line was essentially electric tank type water heater and when we saw tankless as being a market we wanted to get into, we made a big push-in to tankless and we\u2019re now the leaders in tankless in China. And similarly we\u2019re growing in renewable energy products. And also when we made, the based on our strategy and getting into adjacencies to leverage our core competencies in China like our brands, like our channels and access to market, we went into water treatment for a number of reasons, again to expand our customer base and bring them high quality products that live up to our brand positioning. And also we wanted to get into a business that has a much faster replacement cycle from the point of view of replacement filter. Now, we haven\u2019t seen the impact of that yet in water treatment, but we expect to see that soon. So, we\u2019re constantly changing our product line, our portfolio products to stay ahead of the market and market trends. That\u2019s a long answer I know, but that\u2019s the approach that we have in China and have been taking for some time now.","Aditya Satghare \u2013 FBR Capital","Last question from my side coming back to the U.S. here. If we try to sort of strip the weather impact aside, is there anything in the U.S. market or any change in customer buying patterns or mix, which would suggest that consumers are replacing at a rate, which is higher than what you have seen over the last couple of years?","Ajita Rajendra","I don\u2019t think so. I think what we\u2019re seeing is that they have been last year and this year in addition to new construction coming back as there has been a pent-up demand for remodelling and the discretionary replacement component of residential water heaters and we see that coming back.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Connors of Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.","Ryan Connors \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott","Great. Thank you. First, I just had a quick kind of housekeeping question on a couple of bigger picture items. Just in terms of the buyback you mentioned that authorization has been up in the press release there. Can you give us some color around what your assumptions are in terms of the buyback and share count within the guidance?","John Kita","","We\u2019re assuming kind of for the year probably low 91 million shares outstanding, so 91 million to 91.5 million somewhere in that range.","Ryan Connors \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott","","And then two other things from my end, just first off on this you mentioned as FTXL boiler rollout for Lochinvar, our understanding is that that\u2019s somewhat of a true step change in terms of applying that type of technology to a broader set of applications. So I\u2019m curious what, how that rollout is proceeding and what the reception has been both internally and among your distribution in terms of that particular product?","Ajita Rajendra","","It\u2019s been very high. Internally certainly, I happened to have dinner with and speak to over a hundred of our Lochinvar distributors and buy\/sell reps really in the last week and the excitement level is very high. That\u2019s when they really saw the product we introduced with in addition to actually they went in and had a training, etc. and the excitement level is very high. So, there is a gap here in terms of fire-tube type boilers and what\u2019s in the market. So, this goes from about 400,000 BTU to 850,000 BTU range and bringing in introducing fire-tube boilers of this quality with these type of controls, etc. into that space is seen as a very positive move in the marketplace. ","Ryan Connors \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott","Okay, and will that product price \u2013","Ajita Rajendra","We\u2019re moving [ph] the product. They\u2019re just starting to ship. So, we haven\u2019t really seen the impact of sell through, third quarter we start to ship the product. So, again this is excitement level we\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s, we haven\u2019t really seen numbers yet though -- impacting our numbers yet.","Ryan Connors \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott","","And is the intent to price that product at a premium I would assume?","Ajita Rajendra","","It will be in line with Lochinvar pricing, which is the premium price product in the marketplace.","Ryan Connors \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott","","Okay. Great. And then just a final question from me. You mentioned \u2013 John, I think you mentioned a nice acceleration in commercial market in March. Does your data give you any insight into what particular niches of the market are picking up there?","John Kita","","No. We wished it did but it does not.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Brady of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Charles Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","With respect to the China and the water treatment business in your release talk -- you cited the margin in Rest of World as being largely attributable to better profitability on that business. Can you just speak a little bit in \u2013 are you seeing a growth trajectory in that water treatment that\u2019s picking up a little bit quicker than you expected or is it just a function of as we go forward in time the volumes get better and the profitability gets better there?","John Kita","","Well. I think we\u2019re seeing volumes pick up nicely especially on the AO Smith branded portion of it, I think, it was up almost 70% quarter over quarter and so we\u2019ve seen nice improvement in profitability mainly because of the volumes coming through, etc. where in most of our outlets [ph] which means a little more SG&A etc., but again the volume certainly helps. And what we saw for the first time has really even after amortization of customer list, etc., which is almost $3 million on an annual basis we saw it was very slightly profitable even after that, so compared to year ago there was a fairly significant loss.","Charles Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Alright. Okay. And then just on Rest of World, you previously commented for the margin for the full year expected just under 13% EBIT margin. Is that still kind of in line with your expectations, has that moved it all?","John Kita","","No. I think as part of raising our range, we got a little more comfortable with that. I think last year was about 13.2% EBIT margin and even with the full year the new plant we think we can achieve those sorts of levels this year.","","Charles Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Correct. Alright.","John Kita","","All in total.","Charles Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Just one more from me. When you talked about the M&A strategy one of the comments you talked about, you walked away from some stuff and some stuff had been added to the acquisition pipeline and I guess, Kita [ph] on that particular comment, I don\u2019t know if that was an offhanded comment, obviously things moving in and out, but I am wondering if that speaks to an expansion of kind of the areas you\u2019re looking at, or what would have driven adding companies to that potential pipeline that maybe weren\u2019t on that list before?","Ajita Rajendra","I think we really have not expanded what we are looking at in terms of water technology companies, and companies and businesses that would leverage competencies in China. So from that perspective, the lens has not really expanded. But we discover new companies or potentials or find areas in which maybe there is value creation that we didn\u2019t see before, while we may see potential with private companies that are not in the market but we started discussion. So it\u2019s a combination of all those things. ","John Kita","And I think companies are coming up for sale that weren\u2019t \u2013 sale that was unavailable. ","Ajita Rajendra","Right, they have become more actionable. So it\u2019s a \u2013 it wasn\u2019t anything, it was perceptive for you to pick up that comment but it wasn\u2019t anything unusual happening. It\u2019s the ongoing evolution as we are very actively looking for potential companies in this space.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Rose of Wedbush.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","I may be a little bit late on this because I was on another call. But I don\u2019t believe you mentioned it. If you could touch upon and I know it\u2019s small, maybe your progress on India\u2019s water treatment business, and then secondly, I had a question on the ERP.","Ajita Rajendra","We talked about India a little earlier. The business in India itself is going \u2013 we\u2019re happy with the business in India. We are expanding our market share slowly. We are expanding our points of distribution and the product is very well accepted in the marketplace. The Indian market is kind of stagnant right now, especially with the elections going on, and there is a lot of anticipation that once the election is done that the market will pick up again. When we translate our results into U.S. dollars, the results are disappointing, because a unit volume growth is essentially offset by the depreciation of the Indian rupee. And so from that perspective, the revenue and the profitability we see is disappointing.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","I am sorry, I actually \u2013 I can\u2019t \u2013 what I was asking is about the initiatives on the water treatment side, I am sorry, maybe I wasn\u2019t clear. ","Ajita Rajendra","Oh, I am sorry, go ahead, John.","John Kita","Well, I mean we talked about on the last call that we\u2019re going to enter the water treatment market, and I think the intent really is to do it on a pilot basis, test the product out in certain regions. So we did not \u2013 we will have a decent amount of advertising et cetera but it will be more on a pilot basis we believe this year with more of a larger rollout next year.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Okay. So we\u2019re still on track.","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah. The water treatment market in India is about 3 times the size of the water heater market in India. And it\u2019s an established market with some strong players and what we want to do is to make sure that we have the products that live up to the brand positioning and can go in and make a really good impression and compete in that space. If we had to say things on track, I would say we are slightly behind. But we anticipate that, that\u2019s an exciting opportunity for us just like in China to be able to leverage the infrastructure that we are building in the market.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","And then on the ERP side, it was a headwind last quarter, this quarter and as we think about next year, have you been able to quantify the benefits better now that it\u2019s underway and does that provide a tailwind, not just the lack of the headwind for you next year? And then on the CapEx side, you\u2019ve commented the impact on the CapEx for \u201914, does that all go away for \u201915 or is there some carry on in \u201915? ","John Kita","Well, we should talk about \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about the fact that expense is about $10 million incremental, i.e. about $15 million for the full year. The biggest portion of that expense ends up being in the last half of the year. We are right now in the testing phase and much of that cost et cetera gets capitalized. So we saw $1 million plus expense hit in the first quarter. We will probably see a couple million in the second quarter but the majority of the impact from an expense standpoint will be the last half of the year. And we are pretty much right on track with what we thought it would be. The first rollout will be in August, then we will start rolling out next year at the remaining sites. So we never anticipated that in \u201915 there was going to be significant efficiency improvement, again because the majority of the rollout happens in 2015. So you will start seeing the benefits we think more in 2016. ","Operator","Thank you. I am not showing any further questions in queue.

With me participating in the call are Kevin Wheeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. [Operator Instructions].","I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on Slide 3.","Kevin Wheeler","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to review several items regarding our third quarter performance. Sales in our North America segment increased 6%, and operating margin performance in North America improved approximately 200 basis points over last year. Our North America water heater and boiler operations continue to perform well. I'm particularly pleased with our commercial water heater performance, where we continue to outperform the market. Productivity within North America water treatment, manufacturing and the effectiveness of our direct-to-consumer channel continued to improve, and Water-Right's performance is right on track with our expectations. ","We announced a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend rate in early October to $0.24 per share, which represents a 5-year CAGR of 24%. In China, while the third quarter came in where we expected, we are disappointed to see further weakness in demand and expect that to continue in Q4.","Moving to Slide 4 please. As weakness in our end markets in China persist, we have implemented further cost reduction actions. Over the course of the last 10 months into Q1 2020, we are targeting a 20% reduction in headcount from December 2018 levels. We continue to review and rationalize brand building and advertising spend, selling expenses, travel costs and other SG&A spend. By the end of the year, on a net basis, we will close over 700 in non-productive stores. We are continuing our aggressive cost reduction programs in both manufacturing processes and product costs, and we'll continue to work with our distribution customers on programs to reduce their inventory. ","Total annualized savings as a result of these actions is estimated to be $38 million to $40 million, of which approximately $28 million will be realized in 2019. ","I will now turn over the call to Chuck, who will review our third quarter results in more detail. Chuck?","Charles Lauber","Thank you, Kevin. Sales for the third quarter of $728 million were 3% lower than the same quarter in 2018. Earnings in the third quarter of $87 million declined 17% from the third quarter in 2018, and third quarter earnings per share declined 13% to $0.53. Sales in our North America segment of $515 million increased 6% compared with the third quarter of 2018. Higher water heating, heating, heater and boiler volumes in the U.S. were supplemented by $16 million in sales in our recently acquired Water-Right business. ","Rest of the world segment sales of $220 million declined 20% compared with the same quarter in 2018. China sales declined 20% in local currency, primarily related to weak consumer demand and previously disclosed channel inventory levels. The weaker Chinese currency unfavorably impacted translated sales by approximately $6 million. India sales grew at 9% in local currency compared with the same period in 2018.","On Slide 6, North America segment earnings of $122 million were 15% higher than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2018, driven by the favorable impact to profits from higher U.S. water heater and boiler volumes as well as lower steel costs, improvement in the profitability of Water-Right sales without Water-Right and incremental profit from Water-Right. As a result, third quarter 2019 segment margin of 23.6% improved from 21.7% achieved in the same period last year. ","Rest of the world earnings of $4 million declined significantly compared with to third quarter 2018. The unfavorable impact to profits from lower China sales and a higher mix of mid-price products, which have lower margins, more than offset the benefit to profits from lower SG&A expenses in that region. As a result of these factors, segment margins declined to 1.9% compared with 14.3% in the same quarter of 2018. ","Our corporate expenses of $10 million were lower in the current quarter compared to the third quarter last year, primarily due to incentive-based compensation. Interest costs were higher in the third quarter than a year ago due to higher debt levels associated with the acquisition of Water-Right in April. For the year, we expect interest expense to be approximately $11 million. ","Cash provided by operations of $280 million during the first 9 months of 2019 was lower than $289 million in the same period of 2018 as a result of lower earnings, which were partially offset by a lower investment in working capital compared to a year ago. ","Our liquidity and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 16% at the end of the third quarter. We have cash balances totaling $514 million located offshore, and our net cash position is $195 million at the end of September. ","During the first 9 months of 2019, we repurchased approximately 4.9 million shares of common stock for a total of $230 million. Approximately 4.1 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of September. On Slide 9, we expect our cash flow from operations in 2019 to be approximately $400 million compared with $450 million in 2018, primarily due to lower earnings. Our 2019 capital spending plans are approximately $80 million, and depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $75 million in 2019. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $46 million in 2019, essentially the same as last year. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% in 2019. We expect to purchase our shares in the amount of approximately $300 million in 2019, and we expect average diluted outstanding shares in 2019 to be approximately 167 million.","On Slide 10, we continue to see headwinds in our markets in China. The fourth quarter is typically the strongest consumer demand quarter of the year. However, with continued weak year-over-year consumer demand and persistently high channel inventory levels, we are forecasting the fourth quarter in China to be similar on the top line and operating profit line to the third quarter of 2019. As a result, we revised our 2019 EPS guidance to a range of between $2.25 and $2.28 per share, a 13% decline at the midpoint compared with last year. ","I will now turn the call to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance and business assumptions for 2019, beginning on Slide 11.","Kevin Wheeler","Okay. Thank you, Chuck. Our outlook for 2019 includes the following assumptions. First, let me start with China. We saw year-over-year consumer demand in the third quarter decline compared with first half of the year and project full year sales to be down approximately 19% in local currency terms. Combined with our expected 4 points of unfavorable currency translation, our 2019 China sales projection is a decline of approximately 23%. Our forecast for the Chinese currency in Q4 substantially levels with where it is today. ","The sales decline of 19% in local currency is roughly equally attributable to weaker consumer demand and the change in China inventory year-over-year based on our projections of year-end channel inventories. Total channel inventory remained relatively unchanged from the second quarter at approximately four months. Historically, channel inventory increases in Q3 as it did in 2018 as the market prepares for the higher fourth quarter sales. This year, the channel did not experience a third quarter inventory increase. While we expect that consumer demand will be higher than other quarters of the year as the fourth quarter is typically a period of high promotion and buying in China, our assumption is the fourth quarter demand will run at a year-over-year decline similar to what we saw in the third quarter. We project that the channel inventory will be reduced nearly 1 month. We expect that we would exit the year with channel inventory levels remaining above normal. Normal is in the 2- to 3-month range. ","In the U.S., we project residential water heater industry volumes will be down 100,000 to 150,000 units in 2019. Commercial industry water heater volumes are expected to be up 4% to 5%, primarily driven by growth in the light-service electric models. ","Based on boiler sales growth of 5% year-to-date, we expect our North America boiler sales to grow approximately 5% for the full year. We project India water heater EBIT will be positive in 2019, and we expect India will achieve breakeven in 2020. ","Please advance to Slide 12. We project revenue will decline by approximately 5% for the year in U.S. dollars and 3.5% in local currency. We see sales growth in North America with our water heater, boiler and water treatment products collectively expected to grow approximately 4% in 2019, including $40 million to $45 million in Water-Right sales. EPS is projected to be $2.25 and $2.28. We expect North America segment margin to be between 23.5% to 23.75% and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 4.25%. ","We are pleased with how our North America segment is performing, particularly on the water heater side on lower industry volumes. We see long-term growth drivers in water treatment solutions and boilers across North America. ","In the near term, the China economy remains weak, and we have taken further action to rightsize the business while continuing to invest in innovation. We have a strong brand, broad product offering in our key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation. Over time, we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value. ","Our replacement markets remain stable, which we believe represents approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes. We have strong cash flow and balance sheet, providing an opportunity to continue to invest in ourselves, acquisitions and return cash to shareholders. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now available for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc.","Jeffrey Hammond","Just on China, I guess, just a lower expectation, your margin top line. Are you seeing that as more aggressive destock or weaker consumer demand? And then just on inventory, should we expect kind of first half '20 to still be under margin pressure as you guys continue to destock? And when do you think that kind of wraps up and gets back to normal?","Charles Lauber","Yes. This is Chuck. So when we look at kind of the change from our last guidance, what we really have seen is the consumer demand, our sellout, down a bit, which declined since -- it was kind of running flat year-over-year. That was our assumption. So we've seen a weaker decline in consumer demand of about 5% to 8%. So what that did is it pushed back a little bit our inventory reduction that we were expecting at the end of Q3. The good news is inventory did not go up. Typically at the end of Q3, inventories would go up in that 12% to 15% range. This year, it remained flat. So even last year, the inventories went up at that low end of that range. So as we go up the back half of the year, we're looking at a bit of a weaker Q4 based upon that weaker consumer demand and the needs that inventories are still going to be needing -- we still expect inventories to come down by about a month, which is going to cost a headwind. So to your question going out at the end of the year, we're looking at going out at the end of the year somewhere around three months. And as Kevin mentioned, typically, it's in that two to three month range that we would have this channel inventory. So we do have a bit of a headwind heading into next year.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay. And I think that you said commercial -- North America commercial sounds better and was good in the quarter. Can you just give us the water treatment core growth and just talk about, I guess, qualitatively at least, what you saw in residential water heaters?","Kevin Wheeler","Well, I'll take the residential water heater side of it. First, in Q3, we expected residential to bounce back a little bit stronger than it did. And although it was positive, not nearly where we expected it to be at the end based on -- through August, the industry was down 194,000. We look at our September. We don't see much more of an improvement once we get that data coming out of -- from our industry. ","So overall, we took the industry down a 50,000 compared to what we did in Q -- on our 2Q -- Q2 call. And simply, we just don't think in Q4, we can make up that delta. And so -- but when you look at it, again, you'll remember there's 120 million households out there, and we estimate somewhere in those households is about 132 million water heaters. And so 100,000, 150,000 units, there can be some variability there from year to year. We're coming off of 2 straight years of over 4% growth. This one looks like it's going to be down in the 1.5% range. So overall, we feel pretty good about our water heater business. We don't see -- we see going forward our replacement market remaining strong. So overall, the residential business, slight down year, but there is some variations from year to year.","Charles Lauber","And on water treatments, on the water treatment side, the North America water treatment, that is, last year, we had a bit of a tough comp because we had some ramp-up going on with one of our major customers. But if you look at the base business, we grew at about 9% for the quarter. So the base business is growing nicely like the back half of the trajectory on growth as well as continuing to look at improvements in operations.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies.","Saree Boroditsky","I appreciate the commentary on North America but wanted to see if you could dig into the results a little bit more. You talked about a 4% price increase back in August. How has this been received by the market? And are you seeing some more price increases from competitors? Or just in general, any changes in the competitive dynamic?","Kevin Wheeler","We're going to be very consistent here since we're the only public company. What I will say is we announced and implemented a 4% increase as stated in August, and that's been implemented.","Saree Boroditsky","Okay. And then based on the 20% total headcount reduction in China, can you just confirm if that would be another 5% reduction in the fourth quarter? And maybe provide some color on where those headcount reductions are occurring, if you feel like the business will be rightsized for the 2020 market conditions at this point.","Charles Lauber","Yes. Saree, this is Chuck. So we've increased that percentage from 15% to 20% from the last quarter. We did that based on the continued weakness in consumer demand. We'll look at whether that would be increased as we go forward. There will be some of that, that goes into Q1. It's going to be over the course of probably the next 2 quarters that we'll see that come out. The areas impacted, it's been largely across the board. We have not -- what we've been very careful to do is maintain our R&D and engineering capabilities and maintain that investment so that we can continue to lead with innovative products. So we have not leaned on those types of headcount reductions, but it's been pretty much across the board.","Kevin Wheeler","Yes. And a little color to that. What's important for us is we're going forward in making the adjustments for the current environment that we're in, that the business overall, whether it be in operations, manufacturing, engineering, we're still in position when the economy turns that we can ramp up quickly. So it's a very strategic way that we're doing it. And we know the economy is going to come back. We just -- we don't know exactly when, and we want to position our cost structure to the environment but also the ability for us to ramp up when the economy comes back and be able to service our customers at the appropriate level. So it's a balance here, and we're looking at it from all sides.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird.","Michael Halloran","So just some thoughts on China here from a competitive dynamic, market share perspective. Last couple of quarters, you've given some good detail about how you think you're tracking versus the market, both at the high end as well as kind of overall. Maybe you can just give us an update there and then specifically talk about how you think you're performing versus the market as well as competitive situation.","Kevin Wheeler","Yes. This is Kevin. Let's just talk Q3, because we look at this quarter by quarter, and it does vary. In Q3, our gas tankless shares, we held our share. And on wall hung electric and water treatment, we were down slightly, about 200 basis points. On the water heater electric side of it, we know exactly where those share declined. We've seen a couple regions. We'll take some action there. And you got to remember, in Q2, we also talked about that we had improved market share in Q2. So we gave a little bit back. But again, there is variation from quarter-to-quarter. We don't see any issues there. We expect to recover our share over time. And we have the products, the distributions to handle that. ","With regards to competition, certainly, every -- China has been a competitive market for the past 20 years. We have people that are -- have entered into our space on the premium side, and we have to compete, and we're competing on a regular basis. Now again, we're in a market that's a little bit down. And so it's -- we have some mid-price point products that have done fairly well, and we have some premium products that continue to provide value to consumers. But there's a balance there. So overall, when you step back, our share is continuing to be in line with our expectations. And you'll tend to see a little bit of up and down quarter-to-quarter.","Charles Lauber","And I think, Mike, on your comments or your question about high end of the market, the water treatment side, when we look at this year-to-date compared to 2018, we've seen it pretty stable. We haven't seen any decline, consistent with what I think we've talked about in the other quarters within the water heating side, both gas and electric. We saw the high end come down a couple of hundred basis points as far as the total market, percentage of market.","Michael Halloran","Okay. That makes sense there. And then the margins in the fourth quarter, I think, Chuck, you said about consistent with the third quarter. I think the math I ran was closer to breakeven. Just to confirm that one way or another. And then more importantly, just maybe talk about some of the puts and takes going into the fourth quarter to get to that margin profile. How much of this is just really volume deleverage versus maybe including severance or some of these other one-off kind of cost items? Any kind of color on the puts and takes and factors there would be helpful as well.","Charles Lauber","Yes. So the Q4 volume, it's largely volume and -- hold on a second here. Yes. It's largely volume, Mike. The puts and takes compared to last year, think of it in terms of 50% channel inventory carve out that's going to hurt our volume, and the other 50% of it being part of just lower consumer demand. The puts and takes on the headcount reduction and those other costs, I mean, we still have some costs going into headcount reduction and severance in Q4, although those benefits are higher than the cost that we've incurred. We've got a little bit of -- the plant's inefficiencies that occurred in the third -- or inefficiencies that occurred at the low end of that rate also. So those two kind of offset each other. But the risks on kind of the Q4 number probably relate more along consumer demand than what happens to channel inventory because we're forecasting channel inventory to come down by about a month. And back to your question on Q4. Yes, we think of it as being pretty much a breakeven quarter for the fourth of the quarter in China -- the fourth quarter in China to be pretty much breakeven.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow.","David MacGregor","I wanted to start off by, while we're on China, parsing out, if we can, sort of the difference between what you might been seeing in your mid-price point product versus your premium price point product. And if we're able to talk about that four months of surplus inventory, are you able to parse out how many months are you in terms of just if we isolate the premium? Because it seems like the mid-price point is probably turning relatively well given where the markets migrated and maybe the concentration that might be in premium. So if it's four months on the aggregate inventory, what would it be on the premium?","Charles Lauber","Yes. I mean I'll say that right now, in Q3 and Q4, what we're seeing as sell into the channel is more heavily weighted towards the mid-price, lower-margin product. The channel does have more of the higher price product that's taking longer to move in this sort of an environment. To parse it out and split it, we don't have that kind of clarity exactly right now. It looks like we see it changing over time because we know that we're selling mostly, and that's why our margins are lower in these two quarters, we're selling a larger percentage of mid-price product with lower margins. As far as the months, so we've got about four months of inventory, and I want to help define that a little bit. So four months, think of it in terms of the guidance we gave, so down 23% from last year. And we're thinking of four months as you take that number and divide it by 12, and that's roughly the number of dollars we kind of have in the inventory. So I wanted to frame it a bit because we're not looking at it as the next three months sellout. We're kind of looking at it as the 12-month average and working to get that down. So as the total year volume goes down, that's where we got a little bit more aggressive. But it's about four months looking to go to about three months by the end of the year.","David MacGregor","Okay. And then, I guess, as a follow-up, just maybe talk about the boiler business. And I guess you've reduced guidance twice so far this year. Can you just talk about performance in the third quarter with maybe a little bit more granularity? And also, I guess, any color you can provide in terms of just the backlog dynamics? Are you seeing backlogs up or down the boiler business? And just what does quoting activity look like in the boiler business?","Kevin Wheeler","Yes. The boiler business, it's kind of a mixed message I'm going to send here. The activity, bidding and quoting has been very active, and it's been that way throughout the year. It actually spilled in from last year, and we're getting a lot of activity there much more than -- it actually is turning into orders right now where we're seeing more and more jobs being delayed or postponed, and we can make some speculation around labor shortage and things of that nature. But when you look at it, the 5% that we're forecasting, we're gaining share in most of our categories that we compete in. But -- and we have this backlog of quoting that just has been released as we expected it. The good news is we do expect it to be released over time, but there is just a kind of a delay between -- much further delay between quoting and actually turning into orders than we've seen in the past. But overall, the commercial business seems to be good, and we're getting our fair share of the jobs that are being turned into orders. And we look for that to carry over into next year.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stephens.","Robert McCarthy","Can you hear me?","Kevin Wheeler","We can, Robert.","Charles Lauber","Yes. We can.","Robert McCarthy","I guess one thing, thinking about China, I mean, one thing we can say -- and I'm not trying to be impolitic, but clearly, there is a bit of a visibility issue here, understandably, with respect to the channel and what's occurring just given the fact that you've taken down your assumptions consistently and then obviously, certainly 2Q versus 3Q. But I think next year is the year of the rat as opposed to the pig, and New Year starts on the 25th. But are you going to be in a position to really guide with any granularity or visibility or conviction when you report fourth quarter for China given just the dynamic nature of what we're seeing right now?","Kevin Wheeler","Well, let me take that. I believe I'm asked more than once, are we at the bottom? And we kind of said, hey, we hope so. And -- but we really don't know. The data is a little bit unclear. And what we're going to look at is we're coming off a difficult Q3. Consumer demand was down as we talked about. We're going to look at Q4, and that's going to give us kind of the vision into 2020. But it's one of these markets that we have to take month by month, quarter by quarter. And hopefully, we get to Q4, maybe there is a Phase 1 of the China agreement that may help going into 2020. But we don't know. What we do know is that we're trying to give you our best view based on the data we have today, and Q4 is going to be a critical quarter as we set up going into 2020. And we're in the middle of our planning process right now, but we just need to see how Q4 plays out.","Robert McCarthy","All right. And then moving on to kind of back to North America. And obviously, I think there is some limits to what you want to talk about given competitive dynamics or whatnot. But just in terms of the granularity, I mean, is there anything you could say about kind of the relative growth rates in the near term for tank versus tankless? And have you seen a pronounced shift there given the fact that particularly some applications for tankless but the all-in cost coming down, there seems to be, at the margin, more of a preference for it. And this, historically, over the last couple of years, there's been a better growth rate in association with it. What can you give us? Because clearly, underneath the hood, we are seeing a little bit of a different growth rate for North America. And I'll just highlight the fact that you did miss consensus numbers for third quarter, and you did take down some of the assumptions for fourth quarter. So any kind of visibility as to -- if there's a potential sea change going on there in the fourth quarter would be helpful in terms of granularity.","Kevin Wheeler","Let me try to take some of that. As far as sea change, no. But we don't see a sea change. If you look at the tankless side of the business, it's growing certainly faster than the tank type. That delta has changed quite substantially. We're down about 1.6% on tank, and tankless is up maybe in the 3.5% range. So there is -- if anything, there's a contraction between the 2. And -- so there's no meaningful change. Again, you look at this quarter-to-quarter, I've been in this industry 30 years, and I -- it's difficult to predict the swings because quite frankly, when you look at it, a couple hundred thousand, 150,000 or 100,000 units, that's a relatively small number when you bake it into the millions that we sell. So what I'll come back to is we believe our North American tank replacement market remains solid. We are still a participant in the gas tankless business and have a low double-digit share that we're continuing to improve. We're going to be filling gaps in that category, the tankless category, in 2020. So no changes. Our distributors seems to feel fairly confident going into the quarter, into next year. So overall, that was a long way to say that it's pretty much status quo what has been from the beginning of the year.","Charles Lauber","And Rob, I want to come back to China real quick here and mention about visibility into the channel inventory in China. We have pretty -- we think we have good visibility into the channel inventory. What we're a little bit struggling with is sellout and consumer demand. That's really the change in our estimate quarter-over-quarter. And just remembering that we don't control the channel inventory. It's our customers inventory. We certainly work with them to try to help them move it through the channel. We have promotion programs and work with them closely. But the delta and variable from the last outlook is really the step down in consumer demand.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow.","David MacGregor","I just wanted to ask about you filed an 8-K back earlier in October just looking at amendments to the articles of incorporation. And I was just wondering if you could just talk about the motivation for incorporating these various defensive measures.","Patricia Ackerman","If I may?","Kevin Wheeler","Sure.","Patricia Ackerman","David, this is Pat. The amendment was basically to bring our charter and bylaws up to our peers and current standard. So it was really just some benchmarking that we had done and looked at what best practices for shareholder proposals and for director nominee. So it really was benchmarking and best practices that drove the amendment.","David MacGregor","Got it. And then just a follow-up question. I asked you last quarter about the -- sort of the split between mid-price point and premium price point in China. And you said you'd get back to us with that. So just wondering if we could follow up with that question again and give us a better sense of proportion in the Chinese business and, I guess, if there's anything you could be doing longer term to improve the contribution margin on the middle price point product other than just scale.","Charles Lauber","Yes. So this is Chuck. So we don't necessarily have granularity into the change of mid-price points. We have introduced many more products -- not many more products, we introduced more products in the RMB 3,000 to RMB 5,000 range, which, like we said before, the contribution margin isn't as high as the contribution margin in the high end of the market. But we are working on cost reduction programs like we always do. We have cost reduction programs to lower product cost as well as improve production -- productivity and process improvement. So we continue to work on that. Right now, it's just heavier mix towards the, what I'll call, the high end of the mid-price products because of the fact that the channel has more higher end products in it today than it does mid-price. But those newer models are really well received in the marketplace right now. And our customers continue to want to introduce those, at the same time, work diligently to, over time, take down the channel inventory and some of the higher-priced models that are in the market.","Operator","And we have a follow-up from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc.","Jeffrey Hammond","Just on the -- there's been the recent news article about Haier entering the North America water heater market and building a plant. Can you just speak -- I mean, clearly, the market's pretty rational, few players, good returns. Just what are you seeing out there? And what are your expectations from that new entrant?","Kevin Wheeler","What I can tell you is what's been publicly announced is that they are going to -- they've indicate an announcement they're going to enter the electric water heater market and that they have investment in South Carolina of about $60 million. We have not seen any product in the market, and we don't know quite frankly much more than what they published. What I would -- now what I would tell you is that regardless, we always have competition. And A.O. Smith has a long-standing relationship with customers. We have the broadest portfolio of products in the market, technology, high service levels. And we have long-term relationships with -- and meeting market share. So at the end, there'll be a -- it looks like another competitor with a partial [one]. And if and when that starts to materialize, they're talking about next year, Q4. We'll deal with it as we have with all of our other competitors. So that's -- there's not much to say other than what you've read. And I think what we bring as value in our market share and our broad products of both residential, commercial, tankless and so forth that we're in good position to continue to move forward and be successful in this -- in our markets.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay. Great. And then just back to the water treatment. Chuck, was the 9% that -- did that exclude that large customer? Or that would've included that tough comp?","Charles Lauber","Yes. That excluded the load-in of ramp-up of the large customer because we had an unusually high ramp-up of a customer. So the 9%, we view as more as kind of the baseline growth of the base business.","Operator","And we have a follow-up from Robert McCarthy.","Robert McCarthy","Yes. No. I mean I guess a question I would have is can you give us any kind of updated embedded expectation for the relationship with Lowe's? And has anything changed there in terms of what is kind of translated into your guidance for this year and thinking about next year?","Kevin Wheeler","No. Really, we can't. I -- we're not going to talk about specific customers going forward, particularly on performance. Overall, our water treatment business, as we said, continues to improve, and that's in all categories, whether it be our dealer network, our direct-to-consumer, retail and wholesale. So overall, the business is improving. We're becoming more productive. Margins are moving up, and the business is moving in the right direction as we continue to penetrate these market segments.","Robert McCarthy","And then just a follow-up on the entrance of GE and Haier. I mean I guess it stands to reason though that it worked through a material price increase several years ago. It worked out. But that was in the context of, I guess, to pass an oligopoly. I mean clearly, do you think going forward, if it gets to a more competitive environment with more players, that does lead to lower return thresholds and definitely could put a cap or put some pressure on the North American margins? How do you think about trading profitability versus growth in North America going forward if the market changes?","Kevin Wheeler","One, I don't think they are mutually exclusive, and we don't trade. But let's just take this from a much more macro picture, okay? And I'm not going to get into specifics regarding this potential competitor. But if you look at the investment that they're -- they've announced making $60 million, I can tell you from our perspective, we're 10x that. It takes a lot of investment, engineering and relationship, sales organizations to be a major player in this market. And we feel we're in great shape. We've invested, as I said, about $600 million in building this business over the last 60 to 70 years. And it's one that we feel good about going forward. And we think we have the pillars to -- whether it be product, manufacturing, engineering and so forth, to compete down the road. And that's what we're going to do. That's what we've done for the last 60, 70 years. And we'll continue to do that in the future.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up from David.","David MacGregor","We haven't talked much on this call about raw materials, and you did indicate in your prepared remarks and in your press release that it had been a positive influence on the North American margins. Can you just talk about, I guess, the extent to which that contribution could grow going forward? I mean steel markets, from a price standpoint, has come down pretty substantially. Not clear to what extent your contract versus spot exposed in the U.S., but in -- your indirect is probably coming through favorably as well. How should we think about the margin contribution from raws as we move through 4Q and into the first half of next year?","Charles Lauber","Well, for Q4, we'll just talk about those steel costs are set in advance. We kind of have the 90- to 120-day lag on when we see those steel costs, whether they go up or down. So you kind of can look back and look at Q4, and it's our best cost position in Q4 on steel for 2019. So -- and keeping in mind though just on the margin side, so we do have some large retail customers that have formula pricing that also moved the other way. So while there's some margin expansion certainly opportunity when steel goes down, there's also that corresponding headwind on pricing that offsets it. So looking through the end of the year, it is our best steel position in Q4.","Operator","And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Patricia for closing remarks.","Patricia Ackerman","Thank you all for joining us on our call today.

Smith Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce you to your host for today's conference, Mrs. Patricia Ackerman. Ma'am, you may begin.","Patricia K. Ackerman","Thank you, Terja. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2014 conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results [indiscernible] different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described on this morning's press release.","In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we are providing non-GAAP measures, including adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted segment operating earnings that exclude certain items, as well as nonoperating pension costs consisting of interest costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and curtailments. Prior year results are provided on a comparable basis. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website.","Ajita, I will turn the call over to you.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Our strong performance in the second quarter was driven by solid growth and profitability across all our major businesses. Here are a few highlights.","Our organic growth drove sales 8% higher to an all-time record of $595 million. China sales were up 17%, with gas tankless and water treatment products growing faster than the business as a whole. Our adjusted earnings of $0.66 per share were 27% higher than the $0.52 per share recorded last year and were primarily driven by higher sales. We continue to allocate a portion of our capital to returning cash to our shareholders. We repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares for $60.8 million this year through June 30. To allow us to continue to repurchase shares, our board increased its authorization by 1.5 million shares in April. We increased our dividend by 20% or more for the third consecutive year in early 2014.","John will now discuss the results in more detail.","John J. Kita","Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the second quarter of $595.4 million were 8% higher than the previous year, driven by higher volumes in water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and water heaters and water treatment products in China. Adjusted earnings of $60.3 million improved 25% from 2013. Adjusted earnings in 2014 excluded after-tax nonoperating pension cost of $3 million. Adjusted earnings in 2013 excluded after-tax nonoperating pension cost of $3 million and after-tax restructuring impairment expenses of $3.1 million.","Adjusted earnings of $0.66 per share improved 27%, compared with $0.52 per share last year; effective income tax rate associated with second quarter adjusted earnings in 2014 up 27.8% compared with 31.5% for the same period last year. The rate this year was approximately 1 percentage point lower than the rate we previously disclosed, providing a $0.01 per share benefit to second quarter 2014 adjusted earnings per share. We expect the effective income tax rate for 2014 adjusted earnings will be between 28% and 29%, with the GAAP effective income tax rate almost 1 percentage point lower. A reconciliation from GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included at the end of this presentation and covers the previously discussed adjustment.","Sales in our North America segment are $410.1 million, increased 5% over last year, driven by higher sales of U.S. water heaters and Lochinvar-branded products. Rest of World segment sales of $193.6 million increased 14% compared with last year. Sales in China increased 17%, driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products and expansion of our distribution outlets in China.","North America adjusted operating earnings of $67.1 million were 7% higher than last year, and adjusted operating margin of 16.4% was up slightly. A favorable impact from higher volumes in the U.S. were partially offset by higher steel price. As a result of higher steel prices and other cost inflation, we announced a mid-single-digit price increase in North America, which was effective May 1. Rest of World operating earnings of $29.3 million improved 30% compared with last year. Higher sales in China, lower selling and advertising cost as a percentage of sales compared with 1 year ago and improved profitability of water treatment products contributed to the improved operating earnings in the second quarter. As a result, operating margin improved significantly over last year to 15.1%. Our adjusted corporate expenses were $11.5 million, a decline from the prior year primarily due to significant M&A due diligence cost incurred in the second quarter last year.","Cash provided by operations of $90 million through June 2014 was lower than the $105 million provided last year as a result of higher outlays for working capital in the 2014 period. We are expecting operating cash flow for the full year 2014 to be between $240 million and $250 million. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 16% at the end of June 2014. We have sizable cash balances totaling nearly $500 million located offshore, and our net cash position was almost $250 million, both as of June 30, 2014.","During the first half of 2014, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock for a total of $60.8 million under our 10b5-1 automatic trading plan. Considering the additional 1.5 million shares authorized in April by our board, we had approximately 1.4 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of June. Depending on factors, such as stock price, working capital requirements and alternative investment opportunities, we expect to repurchase approximately 1 million of the remaining authorized shares in 2014, pending approximately $110 million for the year. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we expect to end the year with approximately $300 million in net cash, similar to the level at the end of last year.","This morning, we announced an increase to our adjusted earnings guidance of $2.34 to $2.40 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance represents a 15% increase in after-tax earnings compared with our 2013 result. Nonoperating pension costs are expected to be $0.14 per share in 2014, slightly above the $0.13 per share in 2013. Recall that our pension plan will sunset in early 2015 for almost all beneficiaries. We expect this to result in a considerable reduction to our pension costs for 2015 and beyond. Our GAAP EPS guidance for 2014 is $2.20 to $2.26 per share.","I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the assumptions on our 2014 and 2015 outlook and reiterate our acquisition strategy.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Thank you, John. As John mentioned, the midpoint of our updated 2014 guidance implies growth of 15% in adjusted earnings per share over the last year. Our outlook for 2014 includes the following assumptions: First, we continue to see strong growth in China. As many of you know, we are a consumer product business in that region and have invested significantly in brand building, innovation, safety and quality to sustain and enhance our position as the leading premium water heater brand. The return on our investment in engineering and innovation is one of our key success factors in China, along with distribution expansion and market share growth. The macro environment also provides 3-pronged tailwinds for our business: First, our premium consumer products with a highly recognizable brand are in the sweet spot of the government's desire to grow the consumption part of China's economy. Second, wage inflation has been increasing recently, and this is the expansion of discretionary income and growth in the middle class. And third, China recently set a goal for the population to be 60% urban by 2020. This equates to 10 million to 15 million people per year moving to the cities and thereby increasing the demand for apartments and water heaters. Combining all of these factors gives us confidence that we will grow at least at 2x China's GDP rate. Please note that we expect higher advertising expenses in China in the third and fourth quarter due to a catch up in ad spending from lower spending in the second quarter and seasonal advertising and promotional spending in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect second half operating margins in Rest of World to be lower than the first half operating margin.","Second major assumption. Significant market acceptance of our water treatment products has supported our growth in China. Chinese consumers are becoming much more aware of the health risks associated with poor water quality, and our trusted A. O. Smith-branded reverse osmosis water treatment products fill this need. With less than 4 years selling these products in China, the A. O. Smith water treatment brand has achieved almost 20% market share in the organized retail channel. We added over 500 retail outlets to our water treatment distribution channel in 2014, resulting in approximately 3,400 outlets now selling our products. Studies we have seen estimate 40% annual growth of water treatment products in China for the next 5 years. We continue to invest in innovation and technology to serve this fast-growing product category and expect our A. O. Smith branded water treatment products to grow more than 50% this year, resulting in almost $100 million in water treatment sales in China and Turkey. Our success in water treatment is a classic example of what brand-, distribution- and innovation-driven new products can achieve in China.","Third major assumption. We expect Lochinvar-branded sales to grow approximately 10% in 2014, well ahead of GDP growth in the U.S. as our Lochinvar brand is expected to continue to benefit from the transition from lower efficiency noncondensing boilers to higher efficiency condensing boilers. Additionally, we have received very positive feedback from the market associated with our recently announced FTXL boiler. The FTXL will launch late in the third quarter, and we believe this new product could shift some sales from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.","Fourth, we are cautiously optimistic about the developing recovery in U.S. housing. After very strong water heater industry growth in 2013, helped by improved levels of home completion and significant expansion of the replacement market, we expect residential water heater volumes in the U.S. to be up to approximately 9 million units, including tankless, due to an increase in new home construction and expansion of the replacement market this year. We expect commercial water heater volumes will increase to approximately 162,000 units.","Fifth, we implemented a mid-single-digit price increase for wholesale water heaters in May related to higher steel prices and inflation of other cost. The price increase has been accepted.","Sixth, as we have discussed in the past, 2014 will be negatively impacted by approximately $10 million of incremental ERP implementation expense. All the incremental ERP expense is expected to occur in the third and fourth quarter, with the significant portion in the third quarter.","The strength in our profitability in our Rest of World segment gave us confidence to upgrade a high-level 2015 outlook. We expect 2015 Rest of World margin to be 14%, up from 13%, and we revised our 2015 EPS to $2.60 per share from $2.50 per share. Our revised 2015 EPS is 10% higher than the midpoint of our 2014 guidance and reflects lower estimated outstanding shares as a result of our share repurchase activity. We maintained our 2015 revenue expectation at over $2.5 billion, which represents 7% to 9% annual growth. We maintained our North American forecast at 16%","Our acquisition strategy has not changed. We remain focused on water heating and water treating companies around the world, as well as leveraging our brand and distribution channel in China. The acquisition landscape continues to be competitive as sustained price appreciation in equity markets, overall, and higher leverage allowed by banks in their loans to private equity firm drives sellers' expectations higher. We walked away from several targets primary because of price and new names have been added to our pipeline. Our teams are energetic and engaged. Our capital deployment strategies continue to support a combination of investments for organic growth, acquisition, share repurchase and dividend.","You have seen this slide before. We show this only as another reminder that we will be a financially disciplined acquirer of companies within our stated corporate strategy.","And that concludes our prepared remarks. And now we are open for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham of Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions for you, guys. The first one is about the corporate expense and the implications on M&A. Corporate expense was not only down on a year-over-year basis by a lot but literally down versus the last 4 or 5 quarters' levels. And I'm wondering what that means exactly, Ajita. Is -- was there just a lot less due diligence in the second quarter because the pipeline has thinned out? Is there any kind of read there on what the pipeline looks like? Has it weakened?","John J. Kita","Scott, I'd say it's [indiscernible]. I'll talk to numbers, and Ajita can talk about the pipeline. The reason it sounds from last year is we spent a significant amount of money on 2 potential acquisitions in the form of due diligence. We got very deep into due diligence process, and it was very expensive. And it's one of the ones we've talked about, where we've walked away and we decided to walk away from that one because of price. So I would say last year's second quarter was abnormal compared to the other quarters. And we still have the same commitment in dollars, x due diligence, to acquisitions that we've had over the last several quarters.","Ajita G. Rajendra","And Scott, in terms of M&A activity, in fact, in terms of the total market, everything we are hearing is activity level is up quite a lot. And we are seeing that, too. And the pipeline is very robust, as it has been in the past. So there is no decline in activity or our energies behind the right type of acquisition.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got it, okay. The second question relates to the ERP expenditure of $10 million heavily weighted towards the third quarter. It sounds to me like not a lot was expended in the second quarter. We know something was expended in the first quarter. I'm not sure if you gave that or not, but I thought I heard you say, Ajita, that all of the incremental was going to be in the second half of the year. And again, I thought that we had some rung up in the first quarter. So maybe if you can just kind of connect those dots for us.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Yes, go ahead.","John J. Kita","The incremental, we said last year, we spent about $5 million on the ERP. Much of that was in the first half of the year last year because they only started capitalizing the cost. The first half of this year will -- we spent about $3 million to $4 million, again capitalizing most of the cost. But our first go-live will be in August of this year. So then you stop capitalizing and you start amortizing. So that's why we're saying the incremental year-over-year will be about $10 million, which is consistent, $15 million versus $5 million, but it will be basically $10 million additional in the second half of the year, most of which is the third quarter.","Ajita G. Rajendra","And on the whole project, we are right on track. So nothing has changed from the time we really started talking about it.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got it. So that -- would that imply then, John, something in territory of like $7 million to $8 million in the third quarter?","John J. Kita","It's probably incrementally, probably about $6 million to $7 million, I think, over last year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye of Northland Capital.","Noah Kaye - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","We're hearing some very positive commentary on your China water treatment products coming out of the Aquatech Shanghai expo last month. You gave us some figures on expansion of stores. Can you give us some figures on actual branded water treatment sales within China for the quarter?","John J. Kita","For water treatment, first half of the year was up close to 70%. And we're expecting that to continue the last half of the year, although there will be some tougher comps compared to last year. So we said that water treatment, we think, will be up at least 50% for the year. And so you're right. There's been a real acceptance of water treatment in general. There is very low penetration of the consumer for water treatment. So we are very optimistic about potential growth. I mean, we -- Ajita mentioned that one of the market research companies has estimated that, that market could grow at 40-plus percent CAGR for at least the next 5 years and probably longer than that. So we are very optimistic about that market.","Ajita G. Rajendra","The other thing, though, is that if you were at Aquatech, you saw the impact that the A. O. Smith brand has in that category in China. And it's one of those things that seeing it gives you the impression and gives you the right impression on the impact much better than trying to explain it. And so if you were there, you'd see the impact. It has clearly shown us as the leader in that market in China.","Noah Kaye - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Right. And just as a follow-up, we've seen softer housing demand in China in the first half of the year. Homes targeted to affluent buyers have certainly not been immune. So how do you reconcile this with your strong sales and margin growth in China? And can you give some thoughts on how you would expect housing market will impact your China sales going forward?","John J. Kita","You're right. The housing market has been relatively weak, but I think we've been pretty consistent on how we've said we'll grow. We grow a lot of different ways. We grow by gaining market share. We did that during the quarter, specifically on the gas side, additional distribution outlets that we did. Some of our ancillary product lines, like water treatment, are growing much faster than the 15% we'd highlighted. So certainly, that's helped us. We think the replacement market continues also to grow some. So that's been a benefit. So we have not been totally dependent on new housing, which is good because it has slowed down, but we think that's a potential upside for us because ultimately, housing will come back there we believe.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Robert Baird.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So first, on the residential side, just could you talk about what the different channels are looking like there? Obviously, you've talked about strong replacement, maybe a little bit more muted new housing but certainly something on the right path. So could you talk about what you're seeing in those 2 channels, as well as what you're seeing through the various wholesale, retail-type channels as well?","John J. Kita","We saw -- you probably saw the AHRI data for April and May. And they were relatively flat, but June was a very strong month. And so we've seen that. I think the wholesale has been a little bit stronger than the retail, which indicates maybe that there is some new housing going on, et cetera. But we're -- we originally forecast the industry to be up about 9 -- it's about 300,000 units up to about 9 million units for the year. And right now, we're very comfortable with that estimate.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Makes sense. And then the 2 cost items that you've talked about in China, specifically, one, could you help us triangulate on -- more from a magnitude perspective how that advertising expense will swing either year-over-year or as we go from the front half to the back half? And then also, just an update on how the new facility is trending and if there's any still lingering headwinds there or how that's working through.","John J. Kita","Yes, there still are some headwinds from the new facility, and we expected that. Again, when you're adding incrementally right on the edge, we had halfway [ph] for 2 million units in the old facility, and we added 1 million. And certainly, we are not filled with capacity on the new one. It's having some headwinds, which we expected, so nothing unusual there. At the advertising, 2 things about the advertising: Historically, when we look at advertising, first half to second half, the second half is 0.5% to 1% higher. And that's just really a function of prime water heater sales in September to December, covering the Fall Festival, et cetera. So when we look at those numbers, that's historically what it was. But in addition, the second quarter, our national ad spend was lower than what would be normal. And we expect to pick that up because, as alluded to earlier, we're going to spend more money nationally on television regarding water treatment, et cetera, and making sure that our brand is recognized in that category. So it will be higher, without a doubt, the last half of the year compared to the first half. When we look at the full year -- and that takes out some of the volatility, we started Rest of World by saying it would be less than the prior year. We said that when we got out of the first quarter -- I mean, at the end of the year. Then in the first quarter, we said it would be about equal. And now we're very comfortable that full year margins will be higher than the prior year. So they're making very good progress when you look at the whole year on their operating margin.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Just to add one thing. That also drove us, partially, to improve our outlook for next year, Mike.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That absolutely makes sense. Just want to make sure I understood the moving pieces.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady of BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can you comment on the price increase that went through in May? Do you think that had any pull-forward impact on Q3 sales?","John J. Kita","Not really because it probably had a little bit of impact in April, but it would have cleaned itself out, we think, by the end of May. So we really don't think at this point -- I mean, traditionally, the third quarter is less, and we certainly expect that to be the case again this year. But we don't really think there was any pull forward for the whole quarter.","Ajita G. Rajendra","There was pull forward within the quarter from month-to-month, but it was contained within the quarter.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Right, right, okay. And then just back on the advertising expense comment on Rest of World in Q2, you said it's below what would normally be seen in Q2. Can you quantify -- so the margins in Q2 Rest of World were certainly a bit better than we had modeled in. I'm just trying to square up how much of that was just kind of maybe a shift because advertising expense kind of moved into Q3 from Q4. Actually, what I'm asking is, how much was the lower adverting spend the Rest of World benefited margins in Q2?","John J. Kita","So lower advertising compared to the prior year was almost down 1%, and that was probably a lower run rate than we would expect on an ongoing basis. And again, the biggest factor was national TV advertising and lower spend rate in the second quarter compared to normal, I'll say. And we'll make that up. There was some -- the World Cup finished in the third quarter, and we were pretty aggressive with some national advertising for that, et cetera. So we'll make that up.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And there's one more, just kind of maybe an update on India. What -- any change there, any positive movement one way or the other?","John J. Kita","I would say India is kind of at the same run rate we expected. As you know, about 75% of the sales come in the second half of the year. So it's really hard to gauge until we get into that. I mean, there's been some positive talk about the election and the new leader. Time will tell if that will pass through into the market. That's relatively recent. So it hasn't happened yet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of William Bremer of Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","I'd like to go right to Lochinvar. Can you sort of give us a sense of the growth there, as well as do we have operating margins there up year-over-year?","John J. Kita","Well, we had very nice growth in Lochinvar. I think we said in the first quarter, it was up about 7% year-over-year. And now we've said year-to-date is up 10%. So the math works, it was obviously above 10% the second quarter. The margins were relatively flat, and we knew that. We're spending a fair amount on engineering and also selling, associated with the new products that are coming out. But margins were relatively flat, which is what we were expecting for Lochinvar. So they had a very good quarter.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Yes. And just to add a little more color to that. In the first quarter, the 7% we said, it was impacted by the cold weather because people were having a hard time getting around and replacing boilers, et cetera. And they caught up in the second quarter. So we are at the 10% rate that we've been talking about. And the new products that we've announced have been very, very well accepted, and the reviews have been terrific. We start shipping that the latter part of the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. And those new products, as John mentioned, the investment in engineering is an ongoing process at Lochinvar. And these are not the last of the new products that you are going to be seeing there. It's an ongoing process, and we have some very exciting new products on the drawing board, which we'll be seeing at very constant frequency out in the future.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Nice color, Ajita. And can I expect the second half to be greater again than the first half?","John J. Kita","Well, I mean -- again, we expect sales for the year to be 10%. So I'd say yes, we'll expect sales to grow. But again, there will be the margin impact from the engineering and the selling associated with the new product, but...","Ajita G. Rajendra","We'll have the normal...","John J. Kita","We have a good year.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Right. We will have the normal seasonality, first half versus second half being a little stronger.","John J. Kita","Right.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","And my final question regarding Lochinvar is just the international strategy going forward there and then timing of that.","Ajita G. Rajendra","It's moving forward. Like we said, the market in China is not quite ready for the condensing-type products that Lochinvar sells and has, clearly, the chief [ph] position in. But it's coming. There are indications it's coming. And it's been a little slower than we anticipated when we made the acquisition, but clearly, the market is evolving.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sam Eisner of Goldman Sachs.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to go back to the SG&A comment on the Rest of World segment. On a dollar basis, how much -- was there a benefit from lower advertising expense this quarter?","John J. Kita","This quarter, the advertising spend was pretty similar to the prior year, okay. But as a percent of sales, because we had a 17% increase, it was significantly less as a percent of sales.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right. And then in regards to Shanghai Water Treatment, is that business, kind of going forward, now fully profitable? I know that -- I think last quarter, you were breakeven or just slightly profitable. So I'm just curious what the expectations are for that. And then looking out to 2015, what is the expected profitability for that business now that you're raising guidance by about 100 basis points?","John J. Kita","What we really said, Sam -- and we said it at the end of the year, that when we looked at our full water treatment business last year, it lost about $3 million. And that was primarily amortization of customer lists associated with the acquisition. Then we said earlier this year that we thought it would be about breakeven, and now we're confident it could be nicely above breakeven. So we would anticipate this year, even after the $3 million of amortization, the entire water treatment business will be at $2 million to $3 million P&L benefit. So that's a pretty big swing from the prior year.","Ajita G. Rajendra","And just to add something to that, Sam, the -- we're not trying to maximize the profitability of the water treatment business right now because we are investing in terms of advertising and new products and all the things that are required to drive the growth in that business. And the other point is -- and we don't -- the gross margins of that business are very nice. And so we know that long-term profitability of that business is going to be right in line with the rest of our product lines in China.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then as it relates to the 2015 expectations, the 100-basis-point increase, is that all because of the water treatment business? Or are there other kind of benefits in there as well?","John J. Kita","No. I think it's just evolved. Certainly, that's a positive, but we've leveraged some of our SG&A as we've gotten larger. And the contribution from the higher volume that we expect next year, we still are comfortable when we look to next year at 2x GDP. So that's 15% or so. So that will, obviously, contribute nicely. So I think it's all of those factors.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just lastly, on India, given it's back halfway, and I think, John, you alluded to this in an earlier question, just curious what the expectation is for profitability of that business. I believe for the last few years, it's been breakeven or maybe even slightly down because of current space. So curious how you guys are thinking about that into the back half of this year?","John J. Kita","Well, when we said, Sam, at the end of last year, I believe that they lost -- India lost about $5 million in total in 2013. We also said at that time that we expect to lose a similar amount. I think as we look at 2014, we'll probably lose -- we'll probably lose maybe a little bit less but certainly in that $4 million to $5 million range again.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Summerville of KeyBanc.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, on the commercial side of the business in North America, you gave a little bit of granularity in terms of the month of June on the residential side. Can you provide some qualitative or quantitative comment on what you saw in your commercial business in June? And I guess, why -- you're obviously embedding in your guidance only 3% growth in commercial year-to-date. It's, obviously, tracking comfortably north of that. Can you help reconcile that?","John J. Kita","Yes. If you look at April and May, I think the industry was up 10% or 11% or something. And we saw similar-type numbers in June. So yes, commercial has been very strong. I mean, anecdotally, when we talk to the people in the field, there's the combination of replacement, repair, remodel, retrofit, and there are some pockets of new construction. So it's all of those things contributing. We're calling for the last half of the year right now to be flat to down a little bit. That's the potential upside. Again, we don't have quite as good as information to forecast that. The architectural index has turned positive a little bit. So time will tell. But you're right, it has been running better than that year-to-date.","Ajita G. Rajendra","And we hope you are right. Second half is stronger.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","On the ERP items, is it -- will that be reported through the North American segment? Or will some of that hit corporate? How should we model it?","John J. Kita","The majority will go through North America.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, with respect to China, sort of 2 questions, what's the magnitude of FX headwind that you're encountering in Rest of the World? And how does that compare to how you would have originally thought about it heading in the year? And then is there -- in percentage terms, can you break down, as you sit here, year-to-date in China how much of your revenue is coming from water treatment versus legacy electric versus newer products like gas instantaneous?","John J. Kita","Well, what I can say is all of them are up, certainly water treatment and instantaneous, because I mentioned we've gained some market share up there the most. But electric is also up nicely for the quarter and year-to-date. The first part of the question was -- oh, FX. Are you talking on the sales side? Clearly, on the sales side, FX has had a negative for us because when we did the planning for the R&D, we did a 6 05, and it's running at 6 20. So that's a headwind of a couple percent right here. And so we're modeling 6 20 for, I believe, the third quarter; 6 15 for the fourth quarter. They -- the -- from a standpoint of cost, it hasn't been too significant this year because the rupee has appreciated a little bit comparable to R&D. So I mean, we haven't had big headwinds from a cost standpoint. Where we are having some headwinds, quite frankly, and we've talked about it, is Canada purchases. We closed the Fergus plant last year. They're buying from the U.S. The Canadian dollar continues to be weak. So that has had some negative impact on earnings the first half of the year.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then, John, just maybe one more. Is there any sort of early information you can give us regarding 2015 and the ERP implementation and quarterly cadence or first half, second half cadence of any incremental spend you anticipate next year?","John J. Kita","As we look at it, we've said this year, the expense will be about $15 million. And we would guess next year, the expense will be about $15 million also. That will probably be more the first half than the second half. I'd be guessing, but I'd say -- let's say, $10 million, first half; $5 million, second half or so would be my best guess at this point in time. So we expect it to be relatively level year-over-year. So we won't have that headwind that we had this year of the incremental $10 million.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Rose of Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I think most of mine have been answered, maybe just a couple of small ones. On the water treatment, I don't understand your selling to Turkey. Is that correct? And I'm assuming that's not meaningful, but is that somewhere you're gaining a little bit more traction?","John J. Kita","Turkey was actually down. Turkey is kind of C&I market. So it's more project sales. So in the quarter, they were down less than $1 million. That can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. So we purchased them, I guess, a year ago, January. Sales were projected to be around $10 million. And I think they'll track pretty close to that, maybe down a little bit below $10 million, but I think it's proceeding okay.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Yes, it's proceeding on track.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then are you starting to get any replacement business from your RO membranes?","John J. Kita","Yes. When we talked to our people, the consumable numbers for this year are expected to be $3 million to $4 million. So it's starting to come in. As we've talked about, one of the advantages of this product is the main membrane doesn't have to be replaced. The main filter doesn't have to be replaced for almost up to 3 years. But some of the filters get -- other filters -- there is 4 or 5 of them in there, get changed periodically, annually, for example, on a couple of them. So we'll see a little growth in consumables this year, year-over-year. So we're expecting $3 million to $4 million.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Right. And then lastly, you didn't call it Internet sales. Is it something that you're starting to get still more momentum? Can you give us a number?","John J. Kita","Yes. Internet sales did extremely well. First half of the year, they're almost $20 million. Last year, the entire year, was about $15 million. So we're expecting that number to at least double year-over-year. And that's a combination of water heating and water treating. So Internet sales are doing extremely well.","Ajita G. Rajendra","And we continue -- we expect that trend to continue out in the future.","Operator","And at this time, I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any further remarks.","Patricia K. Ackerman","Thank you for joining us today.

Our mid-single digit sales growth in 2018 was driven by positive end markets for our boilers, residential water heaters in the U.S. and continued demand for water treatment products in China.","Here are a few highlights. Record sales at 3.2 billion grew over 6%. Record adjusted earnings per share grew 20%. We are proud of the global water treatment platform we have built over the last seven years. Beginning in 2011 with about $35 million of water treatment sales in China, we significantly grew to approximately $400 million in 2018. As we experienced rapid organic water treatment growth in China, we added several bolt-on acquisitions in the U.S. and in Europe, launched water treatment products in India and Vietnam and added water treatment engineers and technologists to our global engineering centers.","We achieved exclusive supplier status for Lowe\u2019s water treatment business in the U.S. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicated portion of our cash to return to shareholders. ","In 2018, we repurchased nearly 4 million shares for approximately $200 million. We announced two dividend increases in 2018 and the five year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is 30%. We repatriated over $300 million in overseas cash to the U.S., increasing the flexibility of our balance sheet.","John will now describe our results in more detail beginning with slide five. ","John Kita","Sales for the year $3.2 billion grew over 6% compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings of $449 million increased 19% from 2017. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.61 increased 20% compared with 2017. Sales in our North America segment of $2 billion increased 7% compared with 2017. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of residential water heaters and boilers and pricing actions related to steel cost increases.","North America water treatment sales including the newly launched Lowe's business in the third quarter incrementally added approximately $29 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of World segment sales of nearly $1.2 billion increased 5% compared with 2017. China sales increased nearly 2% on a local currency basis. The Chinese currency favorably impacted the translation of China sales by approximately $23 million.","In China higher water treatment sales including consumables were partially offset by lower sales of electric water heaters and air purifiers. Water heater and water treatment sales in India increased approximately $8 million or over 40% in 2018 in local currency terms compared with 2017.","On slide eight, North America adjusted segment earnings of $471 million were 10% higher than segment earnings in 2017. The favorable impact from higher sales of residential water heaters and boilers and the pricing actions in the U.S. were partially offset by higher steel costs and onetime costs associated with the launch of the water treatment products at Lowe's. As a result of these factors 2018 segment margin of 23% was higher than the 22.5% generated in 2017.","Rest of World earnings of $149 million or flat compared with 2017. The impact of profits from lower sales of electric water heaters and air purifiers, as well as higher SG&A expenses were offset by the favorable impact to profits from higher water treatment products sale and improved performance in India.","Higher advertising related to brand building and higher product development engineering costs were the primary drivers of higher SG&A in China. Segment margin in 2018 declined as a result of these factors.","Our corporate expenses were essentially flat compared with 2017. Our adjusted effective income tax rate in 2018 was 20.4%. The rate was lower than the 27.4% experienced in 2017, primarily due to U.S. Tax Reform and benefited 2018 results by $0.02 per share compared with our October guidance.","Sales for the fourth quarter of $813 million were 6% higher than the same quarter in 2017. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter of $126 million increased 21% from the fourth quarter in 2017. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 increased 23% compared with the same quarter in 2017.","Sales in our North America segment of $522 million increased 13% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of boilers and residential water heaters in the U.S. and pricing actions related to steel cost increases.","Rest of World segment sales of $298 million declined 5% compared with the same quarter in 2017. China sales were down 3% in local currency as the Chinese economy continued to weaken. Higher sales of water treatment products, including consumables were more than offset by lower sales of water heaters and air purifiers. The weaker Chinese currency unfavorably impacted translated sales by approximately $12 million. India sales grew over 25% compared with the same period in 2017.","On slide 12, North America segment earnings of $128 million were 22% higher than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2017. The favorable impact from higher sales of boilers and residential water heaters in the U.S. and pricing actions were partially offset by higher steel and other input costs. These factors drove fourth quarter 2017 segment margin higher to 24.4% compared with 22.8% last year.","Rest of World earnings of $40 million declined 22% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017, the impact to profits from lower sales of water heaters and air purifiers and higher advertising costs in China related to online selling holidays more than offset the benefits to profits from higher sales of water treatment products and improved performance in India.","China foreign currency -- foreign exchange negatively impacted earnings by approximately $2 million. As a result of these factors, segment margin declined significantly from the same quarter in 2017. Our corporate expenses were lower in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2017, primarily due to several miscellaneous items in the fourth quarter of 2017.","The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 18.4% was lower than last year's rate due to tax reform. Cash provided by operations during 2018 was $449 million and compared with $326 million provided during 2017. Higher adjusted earnings and lower outlays for working capital were the primary reasons for the improved cash flow.","Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong, our debt-to-capital ratio was 11% at the end of 2018. We have cash balances totaling $645 million located offshore and our net cash position was approximately $424 million at the end of 2018.","During 2018, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares of common stock for a total of $203 million. Our Board increased the number of shares eligible for repurchase by 5 million at its December meeting. Over 6 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of December.","This morning, we announced our 2019 EPS guidance with the range of between $2.67 and $2.77 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 4% increase in the EPS compared with our adjusted 2018 results.","Please turn to slide 15 for several 2019 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2019 to be between $500 million and $525 million, which is higher than the $450 million generated in 2018. We expect higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital this year. Our 2019 capital spending plans are approximately $85 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is estimated to be approximately $75 million in 2019.","Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $50 million in 2019, higher than the $47 million in 2018, primarily due to inflation. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5% in 2019. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately $200 million in 2019. We expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2019 will be approximately $168.5 million.","I will now turn the call back to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance and business assumptions for 2019 beginning on slide 16.","Kevin Wheeler","Thank you, John. Our outlook for 2019 includes the following assumptions. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will increase between 100,000 to 150,000 units in 2019 due to continued new construction and expansion of replacement demand, as well as continued growth in tankless units. ","Boiler revenues grew 9% in 2018, driven by solid demand for condensing boilers and new product related market share gains. We expect our boiler sales to grow approximately 10% in 2019. We improved profitability in India in 2018 due to scale in our water heater and water treatment businesses from losing over $7 million in 2017 to under $5 million loss in 2018. ","We project India water heater EBIT will be positive in 2019 and improvements to continue for water treatment. And our total India business will be profitable in 2020. The overall loss in India is expected to be $2 million to $3 million in 2019.","Our forecast for the Chinese currency in 2019 is slightly weaker than it is today and over 4% weaker than last year. Almost all of the FX impact is expected in the first half of 2019. As previously discussed, we believe customer inventory in China grew in the first half of 2018, with the majority of the growth occurring in the first quarter and was relatively flat the last half of the year after a decline in the fourth quarter.","We estimate 2018 sales increased at least 5% due to the customer inventory built. We are assuming continued weakness in the Chinese economy and relatively flat consumer demand for the full year in 2019. Without the impact of the 2018 China or channel inventory build, we're projecting full year sales to be down approximately 3% to 6% in local currency, all of which will occur in the first half of the year. Combined with an expected 4% unfavorable currency translation our 2019 China sales projection is a decline of 7% to 10%.","The first quarter of 2019 faces some significant headwinds. Due to our estimates that the majority of the China inventory build in China occurred in the first quarter of 2018, creating a difficult comp. We project China sales in local currency will decline approximately 20%, or approximately $50 million for the first quarter of 2018. The earnings impact in the first quarter will be approximately 50% of the sales decline. As headcount and SG&A savings will unfold as the year progresses.","In addition, China currency was at its strongest level for the year in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, we estimate currency translation will unfairly impact first quarter sales by approximately 7%. In addition, steel costs will be significantly higher in the first quarter of 2019 compared with 2018.","Please advance to slide 17. Continued momentum in North American water heaters, boilers and water treatment collectively expected to grow up to 7% in 2019. Our business model in China is solid and continues to achieve low-teen margins. We have near-term challenges to navigate through as the Chinese economy remains week. We project revenue growth will be between 1% and 2.5% for the year in U.S. dollars and 2.5% to 4% in local currency. EPS is projected to be between $2.67 and $2.77.","We expect North America segment margin to be between 23% and 23.5% and Rest of World segment margins to be between 12% to 12.5%. Especially in these uncertain economic times, we believe our stable defense replacement markets, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes positively differentiates A. O. Smith from other industrial companies. We have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisition that add shareholder value, as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we are now available for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Graham","Yes. Hi, good morning.","Kevin Wheeler","Hey, Scott. Good morning.","Scott Graham","So China, the 2019 view that you have, I guess, the simple 40,000 [ph] question is as we've been kind of chasing what the declines or the deteriorating situation in China is with sales guidance for some time. And now we have a first quarter that looks very difficult. I guess, the questions that come from there are; A, what gives you the confidence that you can eliminate the inventory in the channel mostly in the first half of the year. I guess, because I -- you thought you'd be able to do that by the year-end.","And secondly, it does appear as if your sales in China throughout 2018 were -- I understand that housings has been weak, but retail sales which is also an important number weaker, but still pretty decent. Do you think you're losing away from the inventory build, do you think you're losing share in China now?","John Kita","A lot of questions there, Scott. So I'll start with the last one, from a share standpoint when we look at the water heater market, what we're seeing for data it was probably down 2% to 3% in 2018. And if we lost any share it was minimal. So the water heater market was just very weak and it's what you said. I mean housing -- every housing metric we look at is weak and it's gotten weaker. ","Water treatment, we had a good year especially on consumables, but we'd also say we lost a few points of share there and that was really driven by the fact that we didn't have those mid-price products that we had talked about on an earlier call and we now have those late in the year.","I mean, your real question is we were up and we thought we'd be up for the year in October and we're now down and I think it's a variety of factors. One is, we didn't take the inventory down in the fourth quarter as much as what we anticipated and that's because the online holiday sales were not as good as what we thought. Number two, we had originally said that we thought that the second half of the year would be better in China. We are not forecasting that now. This is based on kind of a level the economy stays weak.","Then when we look at next year now the assumptions are that our sell out if you will is kind of level with 2018. So we're not going to have much of a pickup. We're going to see some recovery in air purifier water treatment because of the new products, et cetera. But you're right, the first quarter is difficult because last year we picked up our inventory build occurred in the first quarter. And we say that\u2019s not\u2026","Scott Graham","So it\u2019s actually not what I -- there's an opportunity here now in this first quarter for you to essentially flush this channel inventory out, we can suggest that you had.","John Kita","No, Scott, I wouldn't necessarily agree with that. What we're really saying is last year's first quarter probably had let's say $40 million to $50 million of inventory build in it and we're saying that's not going to repeat itself. So no, I don't think that's flushes out the inventory because we're having a weak quarter. It's just I'll say a very difficult comp because we built the inventory up last year and we're saying we're not going to build it up. We hope to take it down some in the first quarter. Now whether that'll happen will depend.","But I will tell you every housing metric we look at is negative. We ask the same question about retail sales that they're up 8%. And actually one of my advisors said, well you know retail sales also include some consumer commercial spending, et cetera not capital spending but -- so it's not a good number in our mind. ","All I can tell you is the market decline in water heaters was 2% to 3%. So it was very weak, water treatment was up and air purifier was down 30%, 40%. So we think after the first quarter we get to kind of a stable point. Again some of the new products we have in place starts adding. Water treatment consumables had a very good year, we went from $20 million to $30 million and we expect that to continue to increase. So it's just getting through the first quarter.","So I don't know, if I answered all your questions, Scott.","Scott Graham","For the most part John and I very much appreciate the broadness of your answers. If I could just sneak this one in within China would the down 2% to 3% market estimate that you're suggesting here was it weaker on the electric side than it was on the gas side would you say?","John Kita","Surprisingly the gas was weaker. I mean, if you would have asked me I would have thought that the electric would have been down the numbers we saw for the year was gas was down 4% electric was down about 1%.","Scott Graham","Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. ","Matt Summerville","Thanks. Just to clarify, are you talking about the channel has $50 million John of excess inventory? And then A.O. Smith itself is sitting on some amount of excess inventory. Can you just sort of\u2026","John Kita","No, let me -- I'll clarify that. So we're only talking about channel inventory and that's why we can't be exact, right. I don't know exactly what's in my customer inventory levels. I have pretty good indication, we've done a lot of discussions with them, we've done some analysis, we've looked at what we think is sell out year-over-year. And that's why we\u2019ve come to this 5%. Our inventory levels at A.O. Smith are really not up at all, they are no different than what they were. So we're only talking about channel inventories and that's why we're estimating because we don't have exact information.","Matt Summerville","Got it. And then for -- just sticking with China, for 2019, can you also clarify how much you expect water treatment to grow as well as air purification? And then what is A.O. Smith doing from a costs reduction standpoint in China and how much savings is baked in to that 12% to 12.5% segment margin? Thank you.","John Kita","Well. So air purifier, we expect to be up it was about $23 million, $24 million, it will be in the low-30s. We think that's the new product that we're bringing into play. We think water treatment will be up low-double digits, again led by the consumable piece, which is doing very well. Whereas -- and these numbers have base headcount, ultimate headcount reduction of about 10%. And we're expecting to take advertising down 10% to 15%. And that will occur throughout the year.","I will tell you certainly one of the factors we face is that a decent portion of our SG&A expenses is fixed because it\u2019s labor and we can take some of it out obviously, which we're doing and also store set kind of amortization. So we are certainly looking at every opportunity on SG&A that we can.","Kevin Wheeler","Yes, I would just like to add on that, I mean, those are the three areas that we've outlined over the last couple of calls. Certainly headcount is going to be reviewed regularly so that we get the right size of the business. SG&A, constantly looking for ways to improve productivity and make those cuts that are appropriate for the business so the business continue to go forward.","In the end, the store efficiencies remain high in our list as we continue to evaluate unproductive stores and take action with them overtime. But all the SG&A and all the cost reductions that we've talked about, we've implemented those over the last six months or so and we'll continue to make progress on them, but they're going to come in time. And we'll eventually get to that point where the business is right sized to the amount of sales that we have into the market. So that's an ongoing priority for our businesses along with increasing our sell out and driving new product sales. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Hammond of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Hammond","Hey, good morning guys. ","Kevin Wheeler","Good morning. ","Jeffrey Hammond","So just back on the margin in China, so I think you said down $50 million in sales and down kind of a 50% decremental on that, is that incorporate any kind of onetime restructuring charges in there or is that the true decremental? And then, I guess, with that big dip I'm just struggling on how you get back to kind of near flat margins in Rest of World?","John Kita","Well, so no that's really kind of it -- we said kind of publicly in the past, if you look at our gross margin at 41% that's more than in China in our commercial and Lochinvar boiler higher than that, Lochinvar boilers. So looking at that sort of -- and then contribution margin would be a little bit higher. Now obviously we're going to have some benefit from reduction in headcount and reduction in some SG&A. But you also have significant plant efficiencies when you\u2019re taking out -- when you compare that to the prior year.","So that is a significant decline over the first quarter. And then we are taking our margin assumptions down about on the low end of point. And again we expect India to improve, and so how we get there is the headcount reductions continue throughout the year, the SG&A and specifically advertising continues. And then you start getting hopefully our estimate of this low-end of 3 comes to play and you'll have some volume benefit. So that's how we get there.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay, helpful. Just on North America, do you announced any or contemplated any additional price in North America?","Kevin Wheeler","We -- pricing is always a subject that comes up on these calls. And what I would tell you is that and what we said in the past that A. O. Smith has the history of dealing with costs and addressing those over time. And that's our position and will continue to be our position as we go forward.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay. And then just on -- there has been some deflation in steel, what's kind of the timing where you\u2019d start to see some of the benefits from some of these lower inputs on cold roll?","Kevin Wheeler","It starts a little bit in the second quarter, and certainly the last half of the year if it stays where it is now, we\u2019re assuming, we've talked to our consultants and I think their feeling is and I can't tell you necessarily why, but their feeling is we\u2019ve kind of hit the bottom and that their expectation is that steel costs will increase from here, we'll continue to monitor that, et cetera. But you really get -- we start getting the benefit starting in the second quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy of Stephens. Your line is open. ","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, everyone. How are you today? ","Kevin Wheeler","Good morning.","John Kita","Good morning.","Robert McCarthy","All right, great. I guess, the first question, in terms of China and the 1Q compare, give us some sense of when do you think you're just going to have a better sense of the trajectory and visibility? I mean, do you think you'll have a comment sometime during 1Q in terms of how you're thinking about things shaking out, because obviously, your guidance is highly predicated on kind of how this all plays out in the near-term, and it's going to affect the various outcomes for the full year. And obviously, bears are somewhat skeptical given the fact that you've had to take down numbers for China versus October. ","What gives you any greater sense of visibility? So maybe you could just talk about what you're going to be looking for and what will that allow you to cast maybe a better view on China for the full year? When will we expect an incremental update, because, 1Q is really the hinge?","John Kita","Well, I'll start, Kevin can add, I'm not sure we'll have an incremental update. Obviously, we're going to continue as the quarter goes along, monitoring it very closely. I think what we have to kind of see as some of the statistics come out to play. So again housing has continued to be negative there's no doubt about that. Certainly, it would be positive we think from a consumer confidence standpoint if something got resolved with respect to the U.S., China trade issues. So we certainly think that would be a positive. So those are kind of the things we're monitoring.","Kevin Wheeler","Okay. Just to add on to that, Q1 is normally one of our lower quarters. So spring festival is coming up and so we'll get a better read as we continue to get through March and then obviously into the second quarter, which is a busier quarter for us. And again, as we're going to look at this, it'll be by product category, by channel really looking closely at our sellout as organization. And then also making sure that we introduce a lot of mid-price point products and in a lot of different channels and we expect those to add incremental sales to our business.","So as we get into the latter part of the second half of the year, we'll get a read on the China economy. As John said, we'll get a read on tariffs, so where they're going. So there's a few things that have to kind of work themselves through for us to give you a better answer than we are today.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. And then just switching gears over the longer term then. Obviously you mentioned the strength in tankless and I think in particular tankless gas in North America, that's a solid product category overall and you do have a suite of products there and a reasonable share. But that seems to be an area that seems to be gaining some strength and anecdotally it sounds like the cost of installs coming down. ","Are you concerned over the longer term that that product category could eat into kind of traditional tank and kind of what would be your response there? And how we manage that going forward, because it seems to be a category that could be, particularly attractive in the context of the replacement cycle.","Kevin Wheeler","Okay. And are you talking North American or?","Robert McCarthy","Talking North America tankless gas.","Kevin Wheeler","Yes. Our view hasn't really changed. We were in the hot water business. And as we go forward, we bring various solutions to consumers whether that be tank, tankless, if you look at very strong tank year just recently, we expect to be up in the 300,000 to 350,000 units increase this year. Tankless, we expect we\u2019ll probably come -- we\u2019ll decline a bit from 2017 a strong year, but still be in that low-double digits growth.","So, overall, I would agree probably the installation would decline, the cost of it would become more affordable. But again, as we step back as an organization, we provide various solutions because not every solution is the right solution for every consumer. And I think the broad breadth of our product line both residential and commercial provides those solutions. So as we go forward, we're comfortable where the market is moving. I think we're in position with products to capitalize on that.","You look at our brand, our strength in distribution, our sales organization. So as a whole, the industry itself were comfortable where it's going and we believe A.O. Smith will continue to be a major player and a market leader in those categories.","John Kita","It still is obviously we are monitoring it\u2019s very close, but it still is about 8% of the total market. So, I mean, it is a small part of the total market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is open. ","Ryan Connors","Great, thank you. Just want to continue on the China topic for a minute. On some of these past calls you've talked about the issue of consumer trade down I guess and we've seen some of that all the way up to the apples of the world. And you mentioned John that you've got limited if any share loss, but can you just talk about the growth or lack thereof in the various strata of the market from the high end on down and how that's impacted you as a player presumably on the high end.","John Kita","Well, I would tell you and there's no good data. But I would tell you we don't think the high end has been growing in this marketplace. You still have well to do people in China that there's still that group that is buying. But my guess is you're not seeing a lot of trading up going in this environment where the economy is not doing very well.","But again the fact that we really haven\u2019t lost share on the water heater, I think kind of says that that's the place so that everything's kind of stable when you look at the different strata. But that\u2019s an estimate, we just don't have good data on that.","Kevin Wheeler","And I would just echo that that's kind of the feedback that we get back from our sales organization, distributors and our store promoters that the premium market is relatively stable and not a lot of trade down. But the trade up has slowed or is not where it has been in the past.","Ryan Connors","Got it, okay. And then my other question is just can you discuss the relative impact and I guess the interplay between the deceleration in growth in China just on an organic basis versus the trade issues. When you mentioned Kevin potential trade resolution of some kind being a catalyst, but -- I think you'd be right in terms of the stock price certainly would probably trade that way. ","But what, -- how do you divvy up what's happening to you in China from people were discussing a slowdown in China long before these trade issues. So how much of this is just a natural deceleration in the market versus really related to trade and therefore potentially that being a catalyst?","Kevin Wheeler","Yes, I would tell you from a macro perspective we don't know exactly how that would parcel out. Wonder there has been a slowing down in China, but certainly if you just take it back from a consumer point of view in tariffs or in your market starts to slow down and just simply the way we've described it is the Chinese consumer is no different than a U.S or any other consumer when their job has slowed down, when they've seen maybe some layoffs in various parts of the industry and their friends that they simply just pull back.","And so, we believe that tariff has had some impact on consumer confidence on their spending patterns just for the fact that that's what we would do here in the U.S. And my comment is if the tariffs and when the tariffs get resolved it will take some time, but that will remove that one uncertainty for the consumer and that should free up.","We know today based on some of the information we get back that the Chinese consumer is saving more and more and that normally is an indication of their uncertainty and again once they feel things are settled down and there's more confidence in where the economy is going to go, we believe those resources and funds will free up. ","So that's where we're at. Certainly there has been a slowdown a bit from the housing side, but certainly on the other side, we really believe consumer confidence has been impacted by the tariffs and what's been going on in the recent months.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Halloran of Baird. Your line is open.","Mike Halloran","Hey, good morning everyone. ","Kevin Wheeler","Good morning. ","Mike Halloran","So first, what's the best estimate now that exiting 2018 for the splits on replacement versus newbuild oriented splits on China water heaters for your core business?","John Kita","I mean, it\u2019s hard to say, I don't think we have a data, you're talking about the China business. I don't think, none of -- I haven't seen any different data except that\u2019s 50%.","Kevin Wheeler","50% in tier 1 and a little bit less.","John Kita","And nothing that is necessarily increasing. I haven't gotten any updated data.","Mike Halloran","And what percentage is replacement on your water treatment side at this point? What part is consumables?","John Kita","I went all of -- the consumable part this year was about $30 million, so it was up from $20 million last year. So the consumable are tracking very nicely, we would expect that to again be over $40 million when we look at 2019. So that's progressing and tracking just the way we would have thought.","Mike Halloran","And then in North America, just from a cadence through the year. I suppose on China as well. It seems like China you're saying stable cadence from here, if you can adjust for the inventory side. In other words, no improvement, no deterioration in market from current level. Maybe just give us some thoughts on the U.S. as well on how you're viewing the cadence of underlying trends from here?","Kevin Wheeler","Well from the U.S. side of the business, I'll break that out residential and commercial. We talked about our residential guidance about $100,000 and $150,000. Again you got to remember that's coming off we believe a pretty strong year of over 300,000 residential type units. So modest growth, there is some talk about some housing slowdown, but still modest growth and of course 85% of that's going to be replacement.","On the commercial front, as we talked earlier we just came back from a large industry expo AHR and the consensus from our customers, from our sales organization is that there is about a 3% to 4% growth out there. ","Our order book is still pretty solid. And so, we're optimistic in the first half of the year, and we're a bit more conservative in their comments in the second half. But overall both sides of the channel residential and commercial not growing, extending rapidly, but solid growth in both sections.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning everyone. John, just want to go back to China and you talked earlier in the call about building representation in middle price points. So just I guess first of all just some clarification, when you talk about stable 2019 in China, are you talking about still seeing maybe some weakness in the premium market, but that you're going to pick up share in the middle price points? And as a consequence of all in that's going to provide you with your stability. Or just what are you expecting that would come incremental to your growth from participating in a segment of the margin that presumes doing a little bit better.","John Kita","Well we would hope and that's what we hope the last three quarters of the year that we will what I have said is that sell out we would expect for the year to be relatively stable. And if we can pick that up a little bit we'll be able to do two things, one either take inventories down a little bit or move from the 2% to 3% or whatever down for the year. ","So we don't expect basically where we are that the premium market is going to change much, we'll maintain share there. And we hope that there is some growth in the midpoint area and we have new products for that.","David MacGregor","Can you give us any sense from a sizing standpoint, how much bigger the commercial opportunity is in mid-price point versus kind of your legacy franchise in the premiums?","John Kita","I won't say it's necessarily significantly bigger, it's just when we had price increases going back kind of into 2017 and 2018, we had moved out of that market. And so, what we were trying to do so we have been in that market, the price increases we\u2019ll get out. So we call mid-price as RMB 3,000 to RMB 5,000. And so, now this is what we're putting products back into that, which will specifically help us we think on the online, which is growing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Cohen of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Andrew Cohen ","Thanks. I understand with China the Tier 2 and Tier 3 city footprint has how you roll out or how many places you roll out the change at all, are you guys approaching I guess expanding the locations differently or how has that been impacted?","Kevin Wheeler","Well, certainly we\u2019re much more selective in not growing at the same rate that we've had in the past. So yes, it slowed a bit again, we're continuing to opening new stores in distribution points, but at the same time as be candid, we're also making adjustment. So the net increase was -- is fairly marginal over the year. So that's where we're heading from a strategic standpoint. We still believe Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities have opportunity particularly 3 and 4 and we\u2019ll continue to look for those right partners and expand as appropriate.","John Kita","And I think that's consistent with what the last couple of years have been and that we've been adding 100 to 200 to 300 net, but it's a combination of sum in the Tier 2, 3, 4 and then closing some of the nonproductive stores. So we think that pattern will continue.","Andrew Cohen ","Okay, thank you. And then on Lowe\u2019s do you consider it to be fully rolled out and if you could give any color on how you think it's tracking going into 2019?","Kevin Wheeler","Yes, just some quick color, certainly we're -- I don't know if anything's ever always ruled out because you're always making tweaks and improving your displays and working with your customer to improve sales. But, overall yes, it's been rolled out and I would tell you it's -- the business is on track. We look forward to a terrific 2019 with Lowe\u2019s as a partner.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Charley Brady of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Charley Brady","Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Pat.","Kevin Wheeler","Good morning.","Charley Brady","So I'm going to continue beating the dead horse of China here for a little longer. I just want to make sure I understand the commentary around Q1 in Rest of World with China. You're saying China down 50% local currency in sales year-on-year with a 50%...","Kevin Wheeler","No, I think, we said $50 million, 20% in local currency, which is 20% and that's about equates to $50 million.","Charley Brady","Okay, great. Thanks. That's helpful. Connect with that question, I guess my bigger question maybe though as you look out to the back half of the year for Rest of World and China, I mean, what gives you the -- given the visibility you've got, what gives you the confidence that you're going to see maybe just a flat market and not a continuation of a down market in China?","John Kita","Well, again we're assuming that some of our as ancillary product lines like air purification will improve a little bit. The commercial water treatment will improve, the commercial will improve, the new midpoint products we have will offset any further weakness in the market. But it's hard to say, I mean, what we are calling is for the market to really be stable to where it was or down a little bit and we have some items that will offset that decline.","Operator","Thank you. And a follow-up from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Graham","Hi. Would you mind telling us specifically what the Lowe\u2019s number was in the quarter and how much is left to go on the field that was referred to a couple of questions ago for 2019?","Kevin Wheeler","Yes, I would tell you that we hit the numbers that we talked about in the past. And that there's again we probably not get into specifics about certain customers, particularly Lowe\u2019s and other public companies. So what I would tell you is that, we launched the fil is in, there's always going to be adjustments to additional areas of our product displays and product inventory. And that the overall outlook that we had with Lowe\u2019s is on track and again we look forward to continue in 2019.","Scott Graham","Understand. And then just this last one for me. So at the Investor Day, you guys talked about a couple of different initiatives that you're going to pursue. And I was hoping you can kind of update us on them with respect to what the plans are for 2019? Specifically tankless, your desire to increase your penetration there and also in digital.","Kevin Wheeler","Well, I'll take both of those. Tankless, I'm not specifically understand exactly where it's going, but on the tankless side of the business we are going to continue to expand our product offering bringing new products to market with features and benefits to be more competitive. We've talked about that, we look to be doing that in the second half of the year. ","And as far as digital, I think we're one of the premier companies, particularly in the water heater and the water treatment side, where digital has been an ongoing program for us for over a decade. We continue to enhance our websites, our e-commerce business, our ability to create demand through various digital media and marketing activities.","And that's going to continue to move forward by both parts of our organization whether we are in water heating, boilers or quite frankly in water treatment. That was a very generic answer, but that's about I think where we're going to be at with that with any more specifics.","Operator","Thank you. We have a follow up from Jeffrey Hammond of KeyBanc, Your line is open.","Jeffrey Hammond","Yes. Just on North America, just wanted to kind of unpack. I mean it seems like you're implying kind of 5% to 10% growth on that business for the year. Is that the right way to think about it?","John Kita","Yes, I think it's like close to low -- between 6% and 7%.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay. And then just what kind of growth rate so you're expecting for water treatment all-in?","John Kita","Well, obviously we get the benefit of the full year of Lowe\u2019s. And we're probably looking at an increase well we are looking at increase of the other businesses. So it will be up 40% or so from the prior year. So with the benefit of the full year of Lowe\u2019s obviously. And we are expecting the other businesses to grow nicely. And then Lochinvar again we continue that to be we're talking about the boilers growing at 10%. ","And we haven\u2019t mentioned that Lochinvar obviously had a great quarter. I mean they're -- the boiler market was up 15% in the fourth quarter for us. So it was very, very good quarter. So I think their backlog is in good position going forward as we look to the first half of the year et cetera. So\u2026","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next follow up is from Robert McCarthy of Stephens. Your line is open.","Robert McCarthy ","Got a few follow ups. If you can hear me right?","Kevin Wheeler","Yes, we can. ","Robert McCarthy ","Yes. So China, can you talk about just kind of in terms of the organic growth rate for the fourth quarter and for the first quarter. Any directional view of kind of the pricing impact, and how we should be thinking about it across your product portfolio?","John Kita","I mean, I have not heard of the significant price adjustments at all. And I don't know, Kevin if you have. But talking to our China people, I don't think there has been significant price adjustments by any means.","Robert McCarthy ","So as you'd assembled organic growth you wouldn't see a negative price variance in terms of -- okay. And then two more questions, on the tankless gas side, again I think your share right now within that market is kind of high-single digit to low-double digits within this category in the U.S. I mean is there -- and you do have some products there obviously, but I guess the question is, do you think at some point is it make versus buy decision whether you could take a technology or good adjacency and use your brand. Would that be a particular area of potential acquisition for you?","Kevin Wheeler","Well, I think we\u2019re always looking for potential acquisition that adds value. And again, going back to the tankless part of the business, we do have terrific products. We're continuing to bring new products out with our partners. And so it's again, I want to make sure we emphasize this is one of our solutions, not the solution. And yes, we're at low-double digits, but at the end of the day that's not where it's going to stay. And we continue to move forward and gain share and expand our products.","So overall tankless is -- we're always looking for ways to improve our business whether it be products, manufacturing, logistics working with our customers. So I think our strategy is in space and we'll continue to execute it as we have in the past.","Robert McCarthy ","The last question is just North America kind of -- I mean, one of your areas of potential capital deployment is around or has been and will continue to be U.S. residential filtration or filtration products. I mean can you talk about the TAM there, the total investable market and where you want to play in there, because it seems to be a very difficult market that\u2019s highly unconsolidated, a lot of ready substitutes. I mean do you see a future there for capital deployment and do you see a future for a business there a little longer term?","Kevin Wheeler","Certainly, long-term in the North America water treatment we see a significant business. We look at it somewhere as an opportunity when it\u2019s fragmented bringing somebody like us to be able to maybe do some consolidations and so forth in the right areas. I have said many times that this has opened a lens of our acquisitions possibilities and we continue to go down that path whether it\u2019d be capabilities, products, distribution dealers and work in our acquisition pipeline it certainly we\u2019re very active in that space.","So, yes, 100% for sure that we believe there is a viable and going market in North America water treatment and we believe there\u2019s lot of opportunities for A.O Smith and our brand.","Robert McCarthy ","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","Thank you, this concludes the Q&A portion, I like turn the call back over to Patricia Ackerman, for closing remarks.","Patricia Ackerman","Thank you for joining on our call today.

O. Smith. Ma'am, you may begin.","Patricia Ackerman","Thank you, James, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter 2017 Earnings Call.","Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning\u2019s press release.","Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of A. O. Smith, who will begin his remarks on Slide 3.","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. A. O. Smith's solid performance in the first quarter set record for sales and earnings. We continue to see strong growth in our consumer products in China and our water heater end markets in the U. S. were very positive.","Here are a few highlights; sales grew 16% to a record of $740 million. Excluding the impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar against the Chinese currency, our sales grew 18% in the quarter. China sales are up 27% in local currency. Amongst several revenue growth drivers, A. O. Smith branded water treatment sales grew over 50% in local currency, and air purification products grew over 80%.","Net earnings of $0.50 per share were 22% higher than our earnings per share in 2016. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion of our cash to return to shareholders.","During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 608,000 shares for $30 million. We announced a 17% increase to our dividend earlier this year. The five year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is over 25%.","John will now describe our results in more detail, beginning with Slide 4.","John Kita","Sales for the first quarter of $740 million were 16% higher than the previous year. Net earnings in the first quarter of $88 million increased 19% from 2016, and first quarter earnings per share of $0.50 increased $0.09 compared to 2016. Sales in our North America segment of $47 million increased 15% compared with the first quarter of 2016.","The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters in the U. S. and Canada, and pricing actions in August 2016 related to significant steel cost increases and inflationary pressure on other costs. Aquasana, acquired in August of 2016, added $10 million to our North American segment sales.","Rest of world segment sales of $260 million increased 19% compared with 2016. China sales increased 27%, in local currency, driven by higher demand for our consumer products in the region, led by water treatment and air purification products, as well as the pre-buy in advance of a price increase related to steel and other cost inflation.","On Slide 6, North America operating earnings of $104 million were 13% higher than segment operating earnings in the year-ago quarter. The favorable impact from higher sales of water heaters in North America and the pricing action and the U.S., were partially offset by higher steel and other input costs. The operating margins of the newly acquired Aquasana business, is lower than the segment average and explain the overall margin decline for the segment in the first quarter.","Rest of World operating earnings of $33 million improved 21% compared with 2016. Higher China sales were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses in China. Higher selling cost and advertising costs to support growth were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses. Currency translations reduced China earnings by approximately $2 million compared with the prior year. The China price increase had a minimal impact to earnings in the first quarter.","First quarter segment operating margin was essentially the same as one year ago. Our corporate expenses were higher in the first quarter compared with the year ago period, due to higher spending in our Corporate Technology Center.","Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2017 was 27.2%, which was lower than the 29% experienced during the first quarter last year. The first quarter 2017 rate was lower than 2016, primarily due to a larger benefit associated with stock-based compensation and a change in geographic earnings mix. The lower effective tax rate, compared with the effective rate a year ago, benefited 2017 results by $0.01 per share.","Cash used by operations during the first quarter was $11 million compared with $27 million provided during the prior year. Higher earnings were more than offset by higher outrages for working capital. These factors resulted in lower cash flow in 2017.","Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 19% at the end of first quarter. We have cash balances totaling $722 million located offshore, and our net cash position was approximately $353 million at the end of the quarter.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 607,000 shares of common stock for a total of $30 million. Approximately 4.3 million shares remained our existing repurchase authorization at the end of March.","This morning, we increased the mid-point of our 2017 EPS guidance by $0.03 per share with the range of between $2.03 and $2.09 per share. The mid-point of our EPS guidance represents an 11% increase in EPS compared with our 2016 results.","As a reminder, we do experience some seasonality in our business due to the boiler selling season, and China holidays, which benefit the second half of the year. Over the last seven years our first half earnings have consistently represented slightly less than 50% of our total annual earnings. ","Please turn to Slide 9 for several 2017 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2017 to be approximately $375 million, which is lower than the $447 million generated in 2016. We expect higher earnings in 2017 but also a larger outlays for working capital due to the higher than anticipated cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Over the two-year period from 2016 to 2017, we expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $825 million, which compares with $612 million during 2014 to 2015. We broke ground in 2016 on a construction of a new water treatment and air purification manufacturing facility in Nanjing to support the strong growth of these products in China. Our 2017 capital spending plans of approximately $100 million include about $45 million related to this plant.","Total cost for the facility, which is expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2018, will be approximately $65 million. After this expansion, we expect capital spending in 2018 and beyond to be at levels of approximately equal to our depreciation plus amortization.","Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2017. As previously discussed, expenses related to our ERP implementation were approximately $25 million in 2016, and are projected to decline to approximately $70.5 million in 2017.","Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $47 million in 2017, slightly higher than the $45 million in 2016, primarily due to higher expenses that our Corporate Technology Center and commissioned water treatment market studies.","Take note that our interest expense will be approximately $4 million higher in 2017, as a result of higher rates, share repurchase activities and our acquisition last year. Our effective tax rate is expected to be between 28.75% and 29% in 2017, slightly lower than the rate in 2016. This assumption is predicated on no change the current U.S. tax regime.","We expected repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately $135 million in 2017, under a 10b5-1 plan. We may opportunistically repurchase additional shares up to $65 million. If $135 million of our stock is repurchased, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2017 will be approximately $174.5 million.","I will now turn the call back to Ajita who will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for 2017, and our growth strategy beginning on Slide 10. Ajita?","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you, John.","We project revenue growth to be between 10.5% and 11.5% in local currency terms in 2017, and between 9% and 10% in U.S. dollar terms. We expect Aquasana sales to be between $55 million and $60 million this year and slightly accretive to earnings. With the full year of Aquasana sales, as part A. O. Smith, we expect our global water treatment products sales will be nearly $300 million in 2017.","We project the Chinese currency will depreciate slightly from current levels against the U.S. dollar, resulting in the 5% or $45 million sales headwind compared with the average rate in 2016.","Specific to our North America segment. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will increase approximately 200,000 units in 2017, due to new construction and expansion of replacement demands. We project U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes to be up modestly with little growth in large electric units, after the category grew significantly in 2016.","Lochinvar branded products grew 5% in the first quarter, driven by strong demand for water heater and modest growth in boilers. We do expect double-digit full year boiler sales growth, driven by continued market share gain, new product introduction and energy-efficient product growth. We expect the total portfolio of Lochinvar branded products to grow over 8% in 2017.","Since our call in early February, steel prices have continued to move up, and knocked down, as we previously projected. We expect steel prices to continue to be elevated and volatile. This assumption is significantly higher than the average price in 2016, and result in the most difficult comparisons for the year in the second quarter.","These factors lead us to affect our North American segment operating margin will be between 21.5% and 22%, despite the headwind from lower Aquasana EBIT margin of almost 50 basis points.","Specific to our rest of world segment, we are a consumer products company in China, which distinguishes us from most the industrial companies operating in China. We grew 27% in local currency in the first quarter, driven by continued strong demand for our high quality products and a pre-buy in advance of an announced price increase. We expect the pre-buy will be negatively impact the next couple of quarter\u2019s sales.","The several growth drivers underpinning our China business, we are confident to project an annual growth rate of at least 15% in local currency in 2017. These drivers include, overall water heater market growth driven by household formation and an emerging replacement market, geographic expansion, market share gain, continued strong growth of water treatment products and air purification product growth.","These benefits from China growth, smaller losses expected in India and our air purification products approaching breakeven, we project rest of world segment operating margin will be at least 14% in 2017.","I'm moving now to Slide 11. Our total company organic growth model continues to assume 8% growth for the foreseeable future. Especially in these volatile and uncertain economic times, we believe our organic growth potential and our stable defensive replacement markets, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes; positively differentiate A. O. Smith amongst other industrial companies.","Coupled with strong growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that adds shareholder value, as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks and now we are open for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson. Your question please.","Charley Brady","Hi, thanks. Good guys. Good morning Pat. On the China pre-buy, I know you mentioned it's going to pull some stuff down from the upcoming quarters, but can you quantify any more on that as to how much you think you pulled forward, particularly from Q2?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, it's pretty hard to calculate and actually determine what it is but we would say that we probably grew organically about 16%, which would result in approximately $15 million in pull forward. And we think that will be over the next couple of quarters. There's some promotion being run in the second quarter so sales will definitely be down, affected by that but it might leak into the third quarter also.","Charley Brady","Thanks. And sort of a follow up, you talked about the pricing not having, I guess, material impact on the first quarter. Do you expect an impact in the second quarter and beyond?","Ajita Rajendra","Yes, we think there will be some positive impact but clearly it was put in and it probably averaged about 3%, 3.5%, and it didn't cover all geographies but the major reason was to cover steel and also we increased what we're paying our installers, which we truly feel is a differentiator. Our service network in China is a differentiator. But there will be some net benefit coming in the last three quarters.","Charley Brady","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Your question please.","Jeffrey Hammond","So, just within the North America strength, which was a pretty big surprise. Can you give you a little more granularity on what you saw on Lochinvar and what you saw out of commercial and res, and maybe within that, talk about the issues that kind of hit you in the fourth quarter, in terms of cleaning those up, SAP and inventory destock? Thanks.","Ajita Rajendra","Well, on the Lochinvar, we said it was up about 5% and that was primarily residential and commercial, and you probably saw the first two months of AHR data, and they were very strong. The industry was up 67 plus units \u2013 67,000 plus units in the first two months.","And we think they're up even more given our March. So residential was quite strong. And when we look at commercial, it was up almost 4,000 units in the first two months and we think that trend continues. So the bottom line is, residential and commercial were quite strong for both Lochinvar and the base business would hit \u2013 quite to hit.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay. And then just as following to that, what's the coding and order activity in Lochinvar that would support kind of that 8% plus growth, and then also how do you feel about how you've addressed the product category that you're underserved in. Have you seen more business as a result of NAECA III? Thanks.","Ajita Rajendra","Well, we\u2019ve made progress on the commercial, greater than 55 gallons, so we made progress on that. We're not up to the share that our other businesses \u2013 our other commercial businesses is, but we definitely made progress on that.","Lochinvar, its somewhat the same story. If you recall we had a strong commercial boiler market in the fourth quarter and it was pretty flat, up a little bit, in the first quarter, still a significant amount of quoting going on. We think projects are going to be released.","We are coming out \u2013 we've come out with a new product of 6 million BTU condensing. We've come out with some non-condensing new product and we also have a Combi boiler coming up.","So I think when you add all that up and then you look at what the Dodgible Manheim index was talking about and the Architectural Builders index, I mean, I think we're optimistic that we can get that 8% plus growth in Lochinvar for the year. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your question please.","Scott Graham","Hi. Good morning all. I want to understand a little bit about, and you've certainly helped us with this little bit, John, price costs and kind of how it rolls through the rest of the year or so. My understanding, I think you guys talked about pricing up by 5% to 8% last summer to cover steel, and I think I heard you say that your realization so far have been 3% to 3.5%. Am I comparing apples-to-apples in here\u2026 ","John Kita","Say it again. I didn't hear the last part, Scott.","Scott Graham","It sounded to me like you just said that there was a price realization taking place of about 3% to 3. 5%. ","John Kita","No, that's in China. ","Scott Graham","Fine. Okay, so then the 5% to 8% last summer that is now and I guess I would've thought, given your sort of lag on how you pay for steel that - I'm a little bit surprised that the margin guidance you're thinking for the second quarter is where it is. So I guess what I'm asking here is that would you expect to have prices in place at today's steel prices, that you're pricing in place now. Should mean that your second-half margins are up in North America? ","John Kita","Let me take a shot at. There are several questions in there. First of all, steel, I will tell you that we put in prices of approximately 5% of residential last year. Commercial might have been a little bit higher. Residential was about 5%, and we did get that 5%. ","Ajita Rajendra","And this is August of last year ","John Kita","Yes, this is August of last year. And so we also talked to you that we were about covering costs, we were not picking up margin and that's the case. So I would tell you, in the second quarter, for the most part, that they pretty much offset each other; price and cost. And that's what we've talked about in the past.","Steel is much higher in the first quarter than the prior year. It's much higher in the second quarter than the prior year, and then it starts leveling off from a comparative standpoint compared to the prior year cost, if you will. So I don't know if that answers the question.","So I mean when you look at it in the first half of the year, we're going to have favorable price compared to the prior year. We're going to have favorable Aquasana compared to the prior year, from a revenue standpoint. The last half, not so much, kind of starting about August. ","Scott Graham","Okay. And that's where the steel comps get easier? ","John Kita","The steel comps get easier and I mean you can conclude we've talked about 21.5% to 22% North America margins and we were at 21.30% or something, in the first quarter so yes, we would expect margins. When you add Lochinvar, remember Lochinvar is very seasonal. The second half of the year is significantly better sales and significantly better EBIT. So that comes into play also. ","Scott Graham","Got you. Thank you. The other question I wanted to simply ask you guys is that when we look at where steel has sort of reinflated to after that sort of downdraft in the second half of last year, and views that steel will edge down a little bit from here. But even notwithstanding that, your customers, from our conversations with them, pretty much expect you to increase prices each year and it does appear as if you with steel, having reinflated again recently, that that window is now open again. So what's the plan here? Are you looking to increase prices again in the second quarter?","Ajita Rajendra","Scott, this is Ajita. As we\u2019ve discussed many times in the past, we are not going to speculate on pricing in the future.","Scott Graham","Well that was direct. Okay.","Ajita Rajendra","As it was meant to be.","Scott Graham","I do understand that. I guess my last question would be. Where do you see your acquisition pipeline now versus, let\u2019s say, not even a year ago, maybe six months ago. I know there were some trade press that did some speculating that you were involved in one situation served the bidding. Just sort of wondering where that process is now, in your eyes, versus six to nine months ago?","Ajita Rajendra","I'm not sure, what you're referring to in particular, but in terms of total acquisition activity, its very similar situation there. There is a lot of activity. There are opportunities out there. We are looking at opportunities. The prices are still high, and as we've always said, that we need to be able to speed the value proposition.","We need to able to see returning across the capital to our shareholders in a reasonable period of time and we are running a very disciplined process. And for obvious reasons, we are not going to be able to comment on something until it's a done deal. So we're not going to speculate on something that's in process. We can't.","Scott Graham","That\u2019s fine. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer. Your question please.","James Giannakouros","Thank you. Good morning everyone. On U.S. resi, are you seeing any influences on volumes from retail, storefront consolidation, and I guess an adjacent question there, are any sales, in a meaningful way, moving online in the U.S. specifically?","Ajita Rajendra","I'm not aware of anything moving online, and from a retail storefront, I don't think it\u2019s really affected our major customers expect for obviously Sears. There is some impact from that as they the pull some stores.","John Kita","You get the occasional water heater online, but its not anything big, but we do \u2013 Rinnai is on way fare, I mean it's a tankless product and that's the only thing I know of that's online. We know it\u2019s an online, we know it's a regular online retailer.","James Giannakouros","Okay. And as a follow up, and I'm sorry if missed it. Rest of word margins, I think you said you are confident in getting to over 14%. How should we be thinking about mixed influences, price cost and volume leverage, if not the - if you can't quantify, I mean, just if you can rank order the influences there that would be helpful. Thanks.","John Kita","Well, so we were at about very similar to the prior year, 12.4%, I think, compared to the prior year. And I will tell you first quarter margins that rest of world were negatively impacted by some decisions we made in the air purification market. That market has not been growing as fast as we expected. We want to position our brand strongly on that, so actually profitability was about $2 million worse than the first quarter of last year in air purification.","We think that's going to be a good investment as we talked about. We think by the end of the year, where air purification loss $5 million last year, we think we'll approach breakeven, we probably won't get there, but we'll approach it.","So we made that conscious decision to promote that product in the first quarter. So that's why you probably didn\u2019t see the contribution margin on that incremental sale to the level you would have expected.","But as we go forward, it\u2019s a combination of volume, obviously, we talked about price increases going to be negatively affected by steel and what we're doing from an installation standpoint, but we won't get much benefit of that as we look out specifically in the second, third and fourth quarters. So it's kind of a combination of things.","James Giannakouros","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bhupender Bohra with Jeffries. Your question, please.","Bhupender Bohra","Hi. Good morning, guys. The question for Ajita here. I'm just trying to understand the China - the rest of world margins here, if you can explain how? You said like there was pre-buy in the quarter and organically I think, John said I think you grew like 16%. So when you have organic growth, you definitely need to spend or do more advertising and selling expenses, but how does that work out when there is a pre-buy scenario like shouldn't - I believe like there should be less, those sales should be less SG&A weighted sales than actually organic sales?","Ajita Rajendra","So there are a couple of things that happened. The price increase, which was 3% to 3.5% went in late in the quarter. So we had - John has made about $15 million of in sales. That was the pre-buy portion of it. Okay, most of the pricing, we\u2019re not going to be seeing until the second quarter.","Also, the cost increases we were talking about, really but they are the fourth quarter, the steel price, the steel cost, the increase that they gave to our installer, et cetera was there for the whole quarter.","Also, as John explained, we did some very aggressive promoting of our air purification product because again, we see significant opportunity for that category to grow and when we see the opportunities to drive those sales and make sure the consumer understands clearly, the value proposition of our product and the fact that we're in that market, which is a new market for us, we take the opportunity like we said, we saw about an 80% growth in air purification in the quarter.","So, the opportunities to really drive home some very aggressive advertising too. So it's all of those things that come together that impacted. John you want to\u2026?","John Kita","Yes. I think to just reinforce depend on I try to answer it, but obviously I didn't. Yes, the incremental sales, from the pre-buy, were about $15 million. We did get, we think, contribution margin on that but that was offset by our additional investment in air purification where we lost an incremental $2 million over the prior year. So that's why you didn't see as much drop in to the bottom line.","Bhupender Bohra","Okay. Got it. I understand that now. The other thing was on the price increase, so that's basically broad-based on all the China products, not just water heater which is the bulk of the business there?","John Kita","Yes, it covers most of the products and most of the geographies and we would guess it probably covers 85% to 90% of our business.","Ajita Rajendra","There were some markets, some big markets there for example like Beijing, where we - the comparative situation we decided not to do things. So, it's like that and just giving an example, its wasn't an across the board, all geographies type of price increase.","Bhupender Bohra","Okay. And my last question on the - we have seen the water treatment business kind of the market growth for that business has been kind of 40% plus, I think that's what you said on the fourth quarter call and we saw much higher than that. Do you think the market growth itself has accelerated or was this just kind of the first quarter was like one-off?","John Kita","Some of that growth in water treatment was also associated with the pre-buy. We rose prices on water treatment. So there was a pre-buy in the water treatment segment. We grew 40%, but the industry, I think the last numbers we saw the industry in 2016 grew, about 30% to 31%. And I think the forecast for this year is about 30%, and we're certainly comfortable with that, but clearly water treatment had some pre-buy in the first quarter also.","Bhupender Bohra","Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors.","Matt Summerville","Thanks. Couple of questions. First, have you been surprised by the continued strength we're seeing in the small commercial electric product in North America and I guess, what you attribute that continued strength to at this point, relative to how fast the non-res market is growing more broadly speaking?","Ajita Rajendra","Well I guess when we saw the increase in the first quarter was a combination of two things. It was the greater than 55 electric and our guess is there is still some carryover associated with NAECA, where that product was eliminated.","So you either have commercial customers that were buying residential are now buying commercial or you would have residential customers that were buying commercial are now buying residential \u2013 I am sorry were buying residential are now buying commercial. So we think that's part of it.","And then yes, we saw pretty significant - I mean a couple of thousand units increased in the lower electric too. The less than 55 and the only thing we can come up with is high-rises and those sorts of things as the utilization of that has improved.","Matt Summerville","Now you've owned Aquasana for a couple of quarters, is the $10 million contribution you saw in Q1 consistent with your longer-term targets and how you built up the revenue synergy case around to making that acquisition? And have you started to shift product from China into the U.S. through that channel and vice versa Aquasana into China through your established channels there?","John Kita","I would tell you, Aquasana was up about 11% to 12% compared to the prior year which is what the expectation was. And very little process which was what the expectation was similar to the prior year.","Their fourth quarter is traditionally their strongest quarter as a primarily retail provider and we never expected the revenue synergies out of the gate because there is government approval.","We certainly want to as we've talked about we're doing some market studies. We want to understand the market and then make the determination of which products go where and under what brand et cetera.","So we're in the process of that and we never expected that for the first couple of quarters. We should start seeing we hope some revenue synergies you know later on second half of the Year Later here but after that.","John Kita","Yes. And the synergies are on track right?","Ajita Rajendra","If anything maybe a little bit ahead of track so I'd say there is only and that's - that's good.","Matt Summerville","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your question please.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning everyone congratulations on yet another solid quarter. I guess the first question Aquasana I think it should be about 10.3 million in revenues for the first quarter that's a little bit above bloats crew. Talk a little bit about the seasonality the business how should we think about modeling in?","John Kita","Well, I think traditionally the fourth quarter is the strongest in the first quarter. And you know the other two quarters in between the two to move up. So again it's very close to what we project with what we did or planned. And no surprise again that the fourth quarter been strong.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. And then obviously I think you're going to push this question back pretty quickly but you're not going to share with us in the quarter volume price acquisition on a percentage basis for North American or Western world.","John Kita","Well for North America we told you that $100 million for Aquasana okay?","Robert McCarthy","Yes.","John Kita","We told you that the price increase that went in place for residential and August you guys can do some math. And residential was off and commercial was up. So I mean I think you can you can do your calculations for the world. What we tried to say is that we think about 15 million of that increase to free buy in China.","India was fairly close. Europe was a little bit loss on profit and sales but - but again we continue to make big piece which is 15 million of what we think is pretty bad.","Robert McCarthy","The last question I mean obviously I think Scott Graham touched on - on acquisition uppercase as a whole but is ready for us in terms of Boushey capacity and wherewithal our appetites and we're not apatite but where with all how much how big a deal you can do from your perspective.","John Kita","Well if you look at we have 717 million or what up cash I think Pat 720 on cash we are under levered with 19% we said we could go up at 35 or 40 percent capital. So we have a significant amount of room obviously to acquisition and return cash to shareholders et cetera.","Robert McCarthy","Clear. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your question please.","David MacGregor","Yes. Congratulations on all the progress. I guess the question is on China as its kind of a bigger picture question, but a big part of the growth over there as I understand it is kind of expanding geographically, I realize you start from Q1 markets, you've been moving out to Q2 and Q3 and so. I guess the question is, underlying margin utilizations constant as you move out to those smaller markets? Or do fulfillment cost and other factors suggest that maybe that margin progression geographically is not constant? Thanks.","Ajita Rajendra","I would say there are fairly consistent, to my knowledge. As we move out into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities they are certainly, middle class and upper-middle class people in the outlying cities. Now, I will tell you our store sales in Tier 2 and Tier 3 as not as high as they are in Tier 1, on a per store basis. But from margin standpoint, I think not a significant.","John Kita","And the other thing is that the cities in China are getting bigger also. Beijing is still growing, the whole drive to urbanization, is driving people from the hinterland into the big cities, so it isn\u2019t just second and third tier cities that are growing. The big cities are also growing. So we see that growing happening all over.","David MacGregor","Okay. Thanks. Just as my follow-up, I guess, regulatory question on repatriation of cash under proposed tax reform. What would be your thoughts in term of repatriation of cash and how would you put those proceeds to work?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, it really depends on how they end up doing it. I mean, the initial talk was there tax cash that you have overseas at one level and then the difference between cash and under remitted earnings had a different level. I haven't heard much about a holiday's so that won't, happen, doesn't appear. But the cash overseas, depending on how it all falls out, we may not bring it back immediately because we're looking, from an acquisition standpoint, globally.","So obviously, if I did an acquisition in the U. S., I may bring it back. I if did an acquisition internationally, I'd rather have the money where it is now, in Europe and China, depending on where you do it. And then, there's also factors like do they eliminate interest expense. We have some interest expense in the U.S., we've evaluated, so we're not going to pre-decide what we're going to do until we see the ultimate.","David MacGregor","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood. Your question please.","Ryan Connors","Great. Thank you. So my question was a little more strategic in nature. I want to get your take on kind of brand and channel management for the A. O. Smith brand in particular, which I understand has always been an exclusively wholesale brand. So we're a little bit surprised to see the news, I guess a couple of weeks ago, that the A. O. Smith brand itself is not going to be available at Lowe's, and so \u2013 and actually couldn't help but notice that they've already slapped the A. O. Smith brand on one of the NASCAR racecar, and so forth.","So it seems like a bit of a shift there in terms of the branding and channel strategy for that particular brand. And I'm curious, how should we interpret that whether that means going to try to leverage the broader brand, as you have in China, through Aquasana and so forth and whether that's interpretation, and also just wanted the risks and opportunities are associated with going down that route?","Ajita Rajendra","Ryan, it's a great question. From our perspective, as we see the traditional channel boundaries blurring, the decision being made more and more by the consumer because online searches, and that's the first place people go looking products.","We feel that having the A. O. Smith brand both at wholesale and retail, it\u2019s just going to make it a stronger brand and help our growth across the board, in both wholesale and in retail.","The brand being at Lowe, gives it the opportunity to have 13 million viewings by consumers every week, and all of that will strengthen the brand which will make it a stronger brand at wholesale and at retail. So long-term, we think a great growth opportunity for the company.","Ryan Connors","Okay. And then just a follow up would be, managing the communication of what you've just communicated there with your wholesale and also hardcore contractor customers. I mean have you had any delivery efforts to manage that communication to make sure there was no misinterpretation of what you're trying to do and that sort of thing?","Ajita Rajendra","Yes, so we\u2019ve - so we\u2019ve done that. We have talked to our major customers. I mean if there is public information it\u2019s out there. We met face-to-face with most of our major customers and extended to them, and they understand what we're trying to do with the brand.","Ryan Connors","Okay. Great, well thanks for your time and congrats on the great results.","Operator","Thank you. So there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Ackerman for closing remarks.","Patricia Ackerman","Thank you, all for joining us today. Please take note that we will participate in several conferences in the second quarter. We will be at Oppenheimer on May 10, in New York City.

Please go ahead Ma'am.","Patricia Ackerman","Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on our 2019 results conference call. With me participating in the call are Kevin Wheeler, Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer. ","Before I begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include among others matters that we have described in this morning's press release. ","In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures, adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted segment earnings for 2018 that exclude the restructuring and impairment costs associated with our plant closure in Renton, Washington. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website. ","Also as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up return. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on slide four. ","Kevin Wheeler ","Thank you, Pat, and good morning ladies and gentleman. I'm pleased to review several items regarding our 2019 performance. Sales in our North America segment increased 2% and operating margin performance in North America improved 50 basis points compared with 2018. Our North America water heater operations continue to perform well. I'm particularly pleased with our performance despite a 1% decline in residential industry volumes. ","Productivity within our North American water treatment manufacturing and the effectiveness of our direct-to-consumer channel continue to improve. We expanded our North America water treatment platform with the acquisition of Water-Right and performance is right on track to our expectations. ","We announced a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend rate in early October to $0.24 per share, which represents a five year CAGR of 24%. ","In China the fourth quarter came in where we expected, with channel inventory declining by more than one month. Channel inventory ended 2019 within the normal range of two to three months of sales. ","I will now turn the call to Chuck, who will review the results in more detail on slide five. Chuck? ","Charles Lauber","Thank you, Kevin. Sales for the year of $3 billion were 6% lower than 2018. Adjusted earnings in 2019 of $370 million declined 18% for 2018. 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $2.22 were 15% lower than in 2018. Sales in our North America segment of $2.1 billion increased 2% compared with 2018. The acquisition of Water-Right in April added $44 million to 2019 sales.","The increase in sales was primarily due to incremental sales from recently acquired Water-Right, water heating pricing actions related to steel and freight cost increases and higher sales of water treatment products which were partially offset by lower residential water heater volumes.","Rest of the world segment sales of $936 million declined 20% compared with the segment sales in 2018. China sales declined 19% in local currency, primarily related to weaker end market demand, elevated channel inventory levels at the beginning of 2019, as well as a higher mix of mid-priced products. The weaker Chinese currency unfavorably impacted translated sales by approximately $39 million. ","India sales grew approximately 13% in constant currency compared with the same period in 2018. On slide eight, North America segment earnings of $489 million were 4% higher than adjusted segment earnings in 2018. The favorable impact from pricing actions, lower steel costs and higher sales of water treatment products, including the acquisition were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from lower residential heater volumes. As a result segment margins of 23.5% increased 50 basis points compared with 2018. ","Rest of the world earnings of $40 million declined significantly compared with 2018. The impact to profits from lower China sales and a higher mix of mid-priced products which have lower margins, more than offset the benefits to profits from lower SG&A expenses and material costs. ","Weaker China currency translation negatively impacted earnings by approximately $3 million. As a result of these factors, segment margin declined significantly from 2018. Our corporate expenses were lower in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to lower incentive costs. Effective tax rate in 2019 of 21.6% was higher than the 20.4% rate in 2018, primarily due to differences in geographic distribution of income. ","Our fourth quarter results begin on slide nine. Sales for the fourth quarter of $751 million were 8% lower than the same period in 2018. Earnings in the fourth quarter of $91 million declined 28% in the fourth quarter in 2018. Fourth quarter earnings per share declined 24% to $0.56.","Sales in our North America segment of $523 million were essentially flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. Incremental sales was approximately $14 million from Water-Right and growth in water treatment sales were offset by lower boiler volumes, and lower contractual formula pricing based on lower steel costs, associated with a portion of the water heater sales. ","Rest of the world segment sales of $234 million declined 21% compared with the same quarter in 2019. China sales declined 23% in local currency, primarily related to weak consumer demand entering the quarter with elevated channel inventory levels and a higher mix of mid-priced products. The weaker Chinese currency unfavorably impacted the translated sales by $4 million. ","On slide 11, North America segment earnings of $129 million grew 1% compared with the segment earnings in the same quarter in 2018. The net favorable impact to profits from lower steel costs essentially offset the unfavorable impact to profits from the lower boiler volumes. As a result, fourth quarter 2019 segment margin of 24.5% was the same as in the fourth quarter of 2018. ","Rest of the world earnings of $2 million declined significantly compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. Earnings were lower primarily due to the unfavorable impact to profits from lower China sales, the higher mix of lower margin products, and charges associated with customer support programs to reduce channel inventory, along with severance and other costs in the quarter. ","These unfavorable impacts to profits more than offset the benefit to properties from lower SG&A expenses and material costs. As a result of these factors, segment margins declined to 1% compared to 13.3% in the same quarter of 2018. Our corporate expenses of $12 million were higher compared with the fourth quarter 2018, primarily due to the lower interest income earned on cash as a result of lower balances. ","Interest costs were higher in the fourth quarter than the previous year due to higher debt levels associated with the acquisition of Water-Right in early April. Cash provided by operations of $456 million during 2019 was slightly higher than $449 million in 2018. Lower investment and working capital essentially offset lower earnings compared with 2018. ","Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong; our debt-to-capital ratio was 15% at the end of the year. We have cash balances totaling $551 million primarily located offshore, and our net cash position was $267 million at the end of 2019. ","During 2019 we repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares of common stock for a total of $288 million; approximately 3 million shares remain on our existing repurchase authority at the end of 2019. ","We expect our cash flow from operations in 2020 to be between $475 million and $500 million, compared with $450 million in 2019, primarily due to higher earnings. Our 2020 capital spending plans are approximately $80 million and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $85 million in 2020. ","Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $50 million in 2020, higher than 2019, primarily due to lower interest income on investments and higher incentive compensation. We expect our interest expense will be $10 million in 2020 compared with $11 million in 2019. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be between 21.5% and 22% in 2020. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of $200 million in 2020 and we expect our diluted average outstanding shares in 2020 will be approximately $162 million. ","As weakness in our end markets in China persisted, we implemented several cost reduction actions in 2019. Over the course of 2019 and through Q1 at 2020, we reduced headcount by nearly 20% from December of 2018 levels. We continue to review and rationalize brand building and advertising the spending, selling expenses and other SG&A costs. ","We closed over 700 non-productive stores on a net basis. We are continuing our existing, aggressive cost reduction programs in both manufacturing processes and in product costs, and we continue to evaluate our retail footprint and rationalize where we find nonproductive stores and redundancies. To that end we expect to close 1,000 net stores in 2020. Compared with 2018, total annualized savings as a result of these actions is estimated to be approximately $45 million in 2020, of which approximately $30 million was realized in 2019.","We introduced our 2020 EPS guidance this morning with a range of between $2.40 and $2.50 per share, a 10% increase at the midpoint compared with last year. Our 2020 EPS guidance excludes any potential impact to our businesses from the developing coronavirus originating in China. ","I will now turn the call Kevin, who will summarize our guidance and businesses assumptions for 2020 beginning on slide 16. Kevin?","Kevin Wheeler","Alright, thank you Chuck. Our outlook for 2020 includes the following assumptions, and I'll start with China. China inventory levels ended 2019 between two and three months of sales, meeting our expectations after being as high as four months in the second half to 2018 and earlier in 2019. As we stated, our customers tell us normal levels are between two and three months. ","We estimate sell-in will be modestly lower than sell-out, resulting in a modest further decline in channel inventory levels. We project China sales growth in local currency of 2.5%. Our forecast for the China currency is a modest appreciation from today's levels, resulting in a 1% increase in U.S. dollar terms. ","In China as we walk forward from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020, and with the Chinese New Year holidays earlier in the quarter and our continued focus on monitoring channel inventory, we project first quarter China volume will be approximately $40 million lower in the fourth quarter of 2019. The earnings impact in the 2020 first quarter from lower volumes is expected to be 50% of the sales decline. ","In addition, also compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, we do not expect customer support programs, severance charges or other certain costs of approximately $10 million to repeat. After 1% decline in 2019 we project residential water heater volumes will increase 225,000 to 275,000 units in 2020, driven by incremental new construction and expansion of replacement demand in-line with historical trends. ","Commercial industry water heater volumes are expected to grow 2% to 3%, primarily driven by growth in electric models. We expect our North America boiler sales to grow approximately 8% for the full year. In 2019 our boiler sales were flat with low single digit growth in condensing boilers. ","Several factors underpin our 2020 forecast. We believe the transition from lower efficiency to higher efficiency boilers continues and commercial condensing boiler volumes growth mid-single digits as they have historically. ","The ABI data has been recently strong and encouraging. We will enhance our product offering in 2020 such as adding O2 sensing capability on our commercial condensing boilers, which addresses a gap in our product portfolio that we believe impacted us in 2019. ","We continue to work with our reps to improve our visibility to track jobs. We are seeing and hearing that many projects in 2019 have been pushed into the first half of 2020. We ended 2019 with a $2.6 million loss in India and we are on track with our expectations to breakeven in that region in 2020. As the India economy has shown signs of weakness recently, we are monitoring our progress towards this goal carefully. ","Please advance to slide 17. We project revenues will increase by approximately 4.5% to 5.5% in 2020. We see sales growth in North America with our water heater, boiler and water treatment products collectively expected to grow approximately 6% in 2020, including $20 million in Water-Right sales which was acquired in April of 2019. EPS is projected to be between $2.40 and $2.50. Our EPS guidance excludes the potential impact to our businesses from the developing coronavirus originated in China. ","We expect North America segment margin to be between 23.25% and 24.25% and rest of the world segment margins to be approximately 5%. We are pleased with how our North America segment is performing, particularly on the water heating side. We see long term growth drivers in water treatment solutions and boilers across North America. ","In the near term the Chinese economy remains weak. We have a strong premium brand, right product offering in our key product categories, broad distribution and a reputation for quality and innovation. Over time we are well positioned to maximize favorable demographics in both China and India to enhance shareholder value. ","Our replacement markets remain stable, which we believe represents approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes. We have a strong cash flow and balance sheet, providing opportunity to continue to invest in ourselves, acquisitions and return cash to shareholders. ","That concludes our prepared remarks and we are now available for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. ","Saree Boroditsky","Thank you, and good morning.","Kevin Wheeler","Good morning. ","Patricia Ackerman","Good morning.","Saree Boroditsky","It may be too early for this, but just given your commentary around guidance, have you seen any disruption in your supply chain or any impact on retail sales as a result of the coronavirus? ","Kevin Wheeler","Let me take this in kind of the order that \u2013 the way we think about it. First, the coronavirus, our focus is on our employees and particularly the 7,000 employees we have in China. So we are focused on safety and doing the right things to make sure that our employees are safe during these difficult times. ","Secondly, to answer your question, at this time our supply chain we see no issues currently and going forward. So as we look at it right now, no immediate disruption expected by us at all. ","Saree Boroditsky","Great! And then given the decline in boilers in the quarter, can you provide some color of what you are seeing in that market that gives you confidence in the rebound for 2020 and maybe what you're seeing from the backlog of quoting perspectives. ","Kevin Wheeler","Yeah, sure. From the broader perspective, I\u2019m going to kind of look back on the year a bit. And first, the industry \u2013 we kept pace with the industry particularly in the commercial boiler sector. This year we as an organization are [planning mix skews] [ph] to more lower BTU models, and quite a few of our larger jobs this year as I mentioned in the comments have been pushed into the first quarter and the second half of the year. ","So \u2013 and on top of that our reps and our customers remain bullish about their activity. And as far as the market, job quoting and so forth remains active. And then on top of that we are introducing a O2 sensing device that goes on to our high commercial [commencing] [ph] boilers. So when you put all that together, the market, the ABI index, we had unusually skewed to lower BTU\u2019s this year, some projects that were delayed in the second half where we believe 8% is a reasonable number as we get into 2020.","Chuck Lauber","Yeah, and this is Chuck. I mean we still can see you know that the higher efficiency boilers moving away from the less efficient, non-condensing boilers to higher efficient. Where we focus, we still see that trend. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Please proceed with your question. ","Scott Graham ","Kevin, Chuck, Pat, how are you? Good morning! ","Kevin Wheeler","Good morning, thank you. ","Scott Graham ","Hey, so I do have two questions around the organic guidance. The U.S. business you guys are looking for you know went up here, looks like in the 2% to 3% vicinity. Could you \u2013 you know in past conference calls, I think the last one in particular you talked about what your estimate was for the replacement business only for the last two years; I think it was 4% each. What did that number come in on for 2019 and what\u2019s baked in to your 2020 on the replacement only? ","Kevin Wheeler","Well, if you looked at it back at the \u2013 this year was, our guidance was for overall replacement to come in at about 100,000 to 150,000 units down this year and we feel it\u2019s going to fall in that range once everything is published. If you look at it, you're right, 2017, 2018 were well above market average, growing 4% to 5%. It\u2019s not unreasonable to have a correction as we did in 2019. So as we go forward, we're basically saying there's a reasonable new construction activity, builders remain confident and that our historical replacement market will return to their normal levels. That\u2019s what\u2019s baked into our guidance.","Chuck Lauber","Yeah, if you take the mid-range of the residential units, that 250 range and you put 100,000 into new construction, new housing and you have the rest to the replacement. You don't quite get back to the 2018 levels. So you know we're kind of in between that. ","Scott Graham ","That's a very sharp answer. Thank you, I appreciate that. So on the China business, it looks like we're going to start in the hole again in the first quarter, not unexpected, but you are expecting the China organic to be up 2.5 on a full year basis. So what is your thinking as to when those sales pivot upward? Would that be as early as the second quarter and I'm asking that, you know with the backdrop of mix likely staying negative, as well it looks like China completions continue to run down low single, down mid-single, which I have found to always be a pretty good proxy for the water heater market. So against that sort of backdrop, you know maybe give us a little more color around 2.5% local currency guidance for China if you will? Particularly if you can give us an idea of when you think it pivots to positive within that context? ","Chuck Lauber","Let me start out with \u2013 I mean look, Q1 as we came in, looking at next year we thought Q1 was going to be a challenging year regardless of what you're hearing on the virus situation right now, and the reason we have little caution on Q1 is because the Chinese New Year\u2019s festival falls into January. And anytime \u2013 it was January 25. Anytime it falls into January, what we see is more interruption in the appliance market, less traction. So as Kevin kind of outlined on his introductory remarks, even without those considerations we see the Q1 in China to be a challenging Q1 because of the disruption of the earlier holiday. ","We would expect though going out of Q1, I think you've got a pretty spot on take on some of our assumptions Scott, so you know we expect going out of Q1 we're going to see a little headwind on channel inventories still. We were really happy with the progress that we made this year getting down into that normal range. We would expect another couple weeks perhaps come out of next year through the back three quarters of the year. ","Low single digit or low single digit declines on the water heating side are really consistent with what we've seen this year and kind of roll into next year in our assumptions. Water treatment, if you look at our outside market data, some of those numbers are slightly, slightly negative. We are a little more optimistic on the water treatment side. We really like some of the new products we put out and we think we're going to outperform some of those projections on water treatment. ","So and then you kind of roll into that some of the other \u2013 I'll call it less material categories that we have that kind of bringing up to that growth rate. I hope that\u2019s helpful. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. ","Robert McCarthy ","Hi everybody. Well, first of all good luck managing the situation. Obviously this is going to be dynamic and the human toll is going to be pretty challenging. And I guess you know it's like the old John Lennon quote, you know \u2018life is what happens when you're making other plans.\u2019 But how are you going to you know kind of come back to the market and kind of give us a sense of what you think is kind of fundamental end market demand in China versus the disruption you are going to see. Are we going to see a non-recurring charge in association with what happens in China or are you going to give some kind of \u2013 with your update on association with that. And then part and parcel of that, you know what\u2019s \u2013 how are you going to manage recourse in the channel for inventory? I mean, is there any force majeure we have to worry about? Just give us some sense about what we're going to see in terms of the disruption. So what is your guide, which was clearly baked and contemplated prior to these events?","Kevin Wheeler","Hi, this is Kevin. Let me take that. Those are all really good questions, but right now when you look at this market and you look at the coronavirus and where it stands, it's really too early to speculate. We still have many people on holiday that need to come back and we see how they are going to behave going forward. We don't know the scope outside the key province since that had been restricted right now. So if you just step back from that, we're going to have to get a lot more data on how consumers are behaving before we enter into some further guidance and speculations; it's where we're at. ","Robert McCarthy ","Okay, that\u2019s fair enough. And you know turning to North America, you know obviously you did talk about the phenomenon of you know potentially lower, all-in growth that you\u2019ve witnessed in years past. You know what are you seeing in terms of \u2013 you know in terms of your end markets, in terms of the shift to tankless gas and how are you feeling about kind of where your positioned from a market share perspective there, and do you think that still supports kind of still you know reasonable kind of low single digit growth here for the foreseeable future? ","Kevin Wheeler","Yeah, I think I\u2019ll. Let\u2019s just take from a market share perspective and remember, these are shipments, these are not sell outs. But if you look at it you know, we were down a bit on market share residential; we were up close to 100 basis points on commercial and as we go into this year, we just look at it \u2013 we\u2019ll be turning to a more normal level, and I look at the residential business and the residential industry, in 10 years it\u2019s been flat twice, down three times and up five. ","So it\u2019s not this linear equation, but you look at the positive news from a new construction standpoint, you look at a water being a must have product when again it stops operating. So our guidance is really getting back to historical levels and I think that's a reasonable guidance as we go forward. Our share is intact on both residential and commercial and to go back on tankless, that\u2019s an area that we continue to look at growing, expanding. We will be introducing some new innovative product lines this year, and that category actually has declined three years in a row, its growth rate. ","So overall I think we're in good position as we head in. I think the guidance is kind of getting back to a normal year that we basically didn't have in 2019. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Halloran with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Halloran","Hey, good morning everyone.","Kevin Wheeler","Hi Mike.","Chuck Lauber","Good morning Mike.","Michael Halloran","So first on China, just some thoughts on how you think the market share trends are on both the water heater side, as well as the treatment side in China, what you could point to and then any delineation between how you think you're doing on the water heater side and in the upper tier versus the middle tier where I know you've been introducing a higher end, mid-tier product. ","A - Kevin Wheeler","Yeah, let me just start out with that one Mike, on the share. So you know we look at it online, offline, all the caveats that we've heard before. We used a couple of different triangulations to get there and not all of our stores are covered in the specialty side. ","But on the offline what we're really looking at is quarter-over-quarter if you take heating, both gas and electric, relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. You moved into water treatment, we\u2019re up a couple basis points quarter-over-quarter, so we're pleased with that little movement up on the water treatment side. For the year, on the offline it\u2019s you know down a couple of hundred basis points on heating collectively and we\u2019ve held our share on water treatment. ","If you go to online, heating both of residential \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, both electric and gas is relatively flat for the quarter and we\u2019re up about 100 basis points on water treatment. For the year if you look online, we're down about a point on all three categories. So we're pleased with the water treatment in particular and we\u2019re barely holding on the other category. ","[Cross Talk]","Chuck Lauber","Also just to extend, just on the upper tier premium market, you know when I look at Q4, there wasn\u2019t a lot of change. The upper tier stayed where it was and its down about a couple of hundred basis points and that\u2019s been pretty consistent throughout the year. As important, from a brand perspective there's been no real retaliation towards a former American brand. So really we came through Q4 relatively kind of the same as we thought, with no real changes other than we have filled in our medium price points and we feel good about that going into 2020. ","Michael Halloran","I appreciate it there. And then on North America side, maybe just an update on the treatment business \u2013 you sound pretty constructive on progress you've made. So any thoughts on how the channel builds going and custom receptivity at this point and how you think the build out of that market is going, because it's still in the early stage of the build out. ","Kevin Wheeler","It is in the early stage. We had a very good year mid-teens growth. We saw core growth in all segments and you know that's our direct-to-consumer, that's a professional water quality dealer, retail and wholesale as well. ","So overall we feel pretty good about the way the business is moving forward, increased productivity as I mentioned in my remarks in our plants, on-time performance is up, and again part of our thesis is that water quality is becoming a bigger issue with consumers and we see that continuing not only with lead, but PFOA\u2019s and a number of other contaminants that are in the market, and we feel confident because we have the products that can remove all these chemicals and so the business is in good shape, had a good year and we look forward to building on it in 2020. ","A - Chuck Lauber","From a numbers perspective we're right on track to what we\u2019ve been talking about. Going into next year we look at you know revenues in the 170 to 180 range; we look at operating margins in double digits. So we're pleased it\u2019s in the progress. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. ","Jeffrey Hammond ","Hey, good morning guys.","Kevin Wheeler","Good morning.","Patricia Ackerman","Hi.","Jeffrey Hammond ","It just want to make sure I'm clear on the guidance. So I think you're saying 4.5% to 5.5% growth, and it just seems like a lot of these numbers are kind of low single digits, you know commercial res, you know China. So like what's kind of growing above average outside of Lochinvar to kind of get you into that 4.5% to 5.5% growth range. ","Kevin Wheeler","Yeah, I mean so Lochinvar goes back to a growth. So we see Lochinvar is at 8% next year, so that helps in blocking it forward. We also have growth in North America water treatment, so we expect America water treatment to grow in that low-teens year-over-year and that\u2019s starting to become a more meaningful base. ","India, we expect to grow also. India's in that low-teens range that we expect to continue to grow. So that\u2019s the major components. You know with the rest, you know China is rather modest and will be positive or these are assumptions that it will be positive.","Jeffrey Hammond ","Okay, and then just a couple of questions on China. One, it looks like I think you closed 700 stores in \u201919; you\u2019re going to close another 1,000 in 2020 I think is what you said. Can you just talk about where store growth \u2013 stores are versus peak and you know just any kind of revenue impact you think you have from all those store closures and then just, you know any plans for repatriating cash from China this year. Thanks.","Kevin Wheeler","Yeah, so you know the store closures, when you think about the terms of the stores that are kind of in the same geographic region, so it\u2019s really rationalizing stores that are pretty close to one another. So from a sales wise perspective, we do not view it as significant. What we view \u2013 our jobs do is to make sure we draw those shoppers into the stores that exist within the geographic region that\u2019s there. In some of the built-out years we had probably a little redundancy in some local areas. ","So the peak, you know the peak was about 9,800 and today we\u2019d be about 9 \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s about 9,000. So going forward that extra 1000 stores that we're looking at is probably not a significant impact on sale, and just a reminder that there are - some of those are our specialty stores, some of those are retail outlets, you know the cost for those. We do incur cost to support some of those stores, but it\u2019s our customers\u2019 storefront. So the closure cost on some of those are just not, not very significant. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Blair with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. ","Bryan Blair","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. ","Kevin Wheeler","Hey Bryan. ","Bryan Blair","Following up on Scott's initial line of questioning, asking from a slightly higher level, where do you think we stand in terms of the long term replacement cycle? Is there risk of an accelerated move off-of peak there and any differences between the resi andcommercial side you would call it?","Kevin Wheeler","We did quite a bit of analysis on this and reviewed it in our Investor Day and continue to watch it quite frankly. The bell curve on the replacement cycle on water heaters is really elongated. We have water heaters that can go out within five years and others that can last 25 years. So as we looked at it, we see that bell curve smoothing it out and we don't see \u2013 I\u2019ll use the word because people have used in the past, \u2018equipped.\u2019 We see it went out to 22, 23 maybe a slight decline, but nothing of any dramatic nature. ","We are even seeing some of our products even last even little bit longer. We've been using 14 years and then they are moving out to 15 years. So it's, from our perspective it's out a few years and the impact will be within that one or two point range. ","Chuck Lauber","And I guess the follow-up Bryan, you mention commercial, the cycle on commercial is shorter so we really just don't see the same tracking as residential. This is the shorter life cycle. ","Bryan Blair","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Moving to China, obviously there's a P&L hit to start the year, then boring spillover effect from the virus seems like there will be a decent reset, you know at least since the back half. How should we think about ROW margin cadence throughout the year, netting for that mid-single digit range. ","Chuck Lauber","Well, typically in China our strongest quarter in Q4 you know, so. I think you can look at it that way, it was the strongest quarter this year for us even though it was down a little bit from consumer demand compared to last year. But we are pleased with where we ended the year on channel inventory, where our customers ended the year on channel inventory. We would not expect in Q1 to cause that inventory to go up and we would feel pretty good about coming into the back three quarters of the year in that inventory position compared to last year. But as far as cadence, I mean the fourth quarter is always our strongest. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question. ","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning. You may have mentioned this and I may have missed it, but could you just talk about raw material prices in your guidance assumptions and how are you thinking about lower steel prices in terms of the benefit to the P&L. ","Chuck Lauber","Yeah, for 2020 we're looking to have lower steel pricing than we have this year. Just as a reminder you know, we see steel costs kind of 90 to 120 days hit us. So if you kind of look at where the market is today, we expect, steel pricing next year to be just slightly lower than where the market is today. ","David MacGregor","And just \u2013 so can you \u2013 is there any way of quantifying that back into the margin guidance or the EBIT guidance?","Chuck Lauber","We typically don't, but you can kind of get a projection just by looking at kind of taken it to the market. ","David MacGregor","Sure, sure. And then just with respect to China, can you talk a little bit about your online sales there, and I guess to what extent you may expect to see that accelerate as a consequence of coronavirus. But I'm more interested in just how you feel you\u2019re positioned in terms of market share or channel share on that platform. ","Kevin Wheeler","Our online sales last year were $207 million, really pretty flat to the year before. We've got our assumption is 2020 to grow at the mid-single digits. So we talked about reintroducing mid-priced products. So we feel pretty good about our position with mid-priced products which we do see more of in online sales. And you know our share, we still think there's opportunity to grow that share on the online side. So it\u2019s you know $207 million this year and we'll be growing mid-single digits. We feel pretty good with where we enter into 2020. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry De Maria with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. ","Larry De Maria","Thanks. Good morning. First question, the price actions you guys took for second half \u201919, how did they hold up through the rest of \u201919. I don't know if there is any push back in the market etcetera, and how you are thinking about price in 2020? ","Kevin Wheeler","Pricing question is always fairly sensitive to us you know. As we announced, we did put an increase through last year up to 4%, and really after that, we are really the only public company and we just don't want to comment any further on any pricing actions with regards to market conditions. ","Larry De Maria","Right. I know you guys have always been historically sensitive to that, but I\u2019m curious if it held up thought he rest of \u201819 or if there was push back in the channel, you know broadly speaking on price? ","Kevin Wheeler","Yeah again, we are just not going to comment on price with any detail like that. ","Larry De Maria","Okay, and then secondly in China, can you talk about that two to three months of inventory the you guys over the \u2013 this channel. Is that high end inventory, mid-tier inventory first of all; and secondly as it relates to the coronavirus which obviously you know originated in Wuhan, things from your competitors are there with fairly big production plants. You guys said that you know no big impact to your supply chain this far, but are you seeing or potentially seeing any interruptions in the market from \u2013 potentially in the industry from competitors because of what's going on in Wuhan. ","Kevin Wheeler","You know just to start with the channel inventory, so our channel inventory, I\u2019ll call it \u2013 it\u2019s a relatively even mix of higher end product, mid-priced product. As you know we've introduced quite a few mid-priced products in the last two to three quarters. So its maybe \u2013 I\u2019ll call it 50\/50. So we think we're balanced on where we're it falls on in the channel inventory. ","With respect to \u2013 I would say with respect to competitors and like I mentioned before, it's really too early to understand me. What I tell you from our supply chain, we did reach out to our suppliers and so forth and got feedback and we're comfortable with it, but we just don't have the information nor are we going to speak to any of our competitors\u2019 conditions. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Susan McClary with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. ","Susan McClary","Thank you, good morning. ","Kevin Wheeler","Good morning Susan. ","Susan McClary","I just wondered if we could talk a little bit about, you know what are you seeing in terms of the new construction side of the U.S. market, especially on the residential piece supporting some good order growth and how are you thinking about that coming through?","Kevin Wheeler","From a residential new construction, again if you look at it, there\u2019s been some positive information with builders. Certainly there was a spike in starts in December. So if you look forward it looks like from a new construction standpoint it\u2019s a positive, it\u2019s a tailwind. To what extent, Chuck talked about 100,000 units. ","On the commercial side, again things have been active there. However, there has just been a \u2013 items that are being pushed out. Labor is still an issue, I would tell you on both the residential and commercial side of the business. ","So it looks positive to us, to the degree that we can get things in the ground and finished. We think it\u2019s within our guidance of the range we gave on residential and our guidance that we gave on our commercial and boilers. ","Susan McClary","Okay, alright thank you. And then obviously your balance sheet remains in a really strong position within that cash balance there. Can you just talk about maybe what you are seeing in terms of the some of the M&A opportunities and how you are thinking about some of the capital allocation, things that could come up over the course of 2020? ","Kevin Wheeler","Normally, on the M&A side we are always actively engaged in and looking for opportunities and until we have any of that really materializing, we just don't talk about them. However we are \u2013 we do have a nice balance sheet that when those opportunities come along we can execute. When it comes from our cash, allocation, I\u2019ll let Chuck just comment on\u2026 ","Chuck Lauber","Yeah, we are looking to repurchase next year. So as we talked about before, we always invest in ourselves. We got some good capital programs that we're planning for next year, we're looking at repurchasing about 200 million. That 200 million is really based on what we look at for generating cash for the year, our dividends, net of CapEx, the goal what we are looking at, just to size that borrowing and acquisition would be just to not grow cash for 2020. So that's kind of how we are sizing that up. ","Operator","Thank you. And out next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. ","Robert McCarthy","Yeah, just back in queue with a couple of follow-ups. Thank you for taking the questions. The first would be just in terms of looking at historical trends in the residential channel in North America. I mean obviously you know historically I hear your point about the fits and starts in terms of how you are thinking about the kind of the replacement cycle evolving. But you know you did go through a period of pretty significant price increase with that standard change five years ago, which created a different margin structure, which could attract new entrants in the market. So, I mean how do you think of it about prospectively, a threat of new entrants in the context of the replacement cycle, maybe challenging your historical assumptions about how the cycle is going to play out. ","Kevin Wheeler","Well, let me just take \u2013 how we look at it. One, to be a market leader in this industry you have to have a broad line of products, both residential, commercial and that investment and that's not only in the products but in the technologies; condensing, non-condensing, heat pump, non-heat pump, gas tank versus electric tank versus all the commercials we have are tanks. ","So from a new entrance, that\u2019s always possible and quite frankly Haier has announced that they are going to come in a market with some electric products. But as we look at it, what we do is we try to provide the best value proposition to our customers and its based upon this broad portfolio, it\u2019s based upon driving value, not only with products, services and also what we do in the, with the engineers and the specifications. And then on top of that, you really step back; we got 60 years of long term relationships in all channels. ","So we're going to do the things that we believe make us the preferred brand of choice and so that's how we look at it, and as other people come in, it's going to take a broad portfolio, it\u2019s not an easy hurdle to come in and provide these broad portfolio of products and services that we have. ","Robert McCarthy","And then the final question for me is, I mean I think with the exception of probably Lochinvar, most of the growth initiatives are the positive growth variance to get the kind of 4% to 5% growth or the mid-single digit are growth to be decent growing business, business you are investing in, but clearly going to be challenge margin mix profile for you as a whole, at least on a normalized basis for China and certainly for North America. So are you concerned about that particularly in the context of what could be, you know a rougher traffic coming in China that you know the nature of the growth that you are going to see is dilutive and may create some incremental earnings risk or headwinds even to your base outlook? ","Chuck Lauber","You know you are correct in the fact that some of these growth businesses right now have lower operating margins than what you know the lesser growth business going forward. China is difficult to you know peg as far as \u2013 when we pegged China we said what our growth rate would be next year. So you know in China we expect to continue to reduce product costs; we expect to continue to look at our costs and expect to expand the margin in China at the pace at which the consumer confidence and market allows us to grow. ","In India and water treatment, we feel like we are making good progress in India. We expect to be breakeven next year. Water treatment, we're looking at you know 100 to 200 basis points improvement in the next couple of years to get that margin closer to North America water heating. So we feel like we're making progress on all those areas. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. ","Jeffrey Hammond","Hey guys. Just I wanted to go back on the repatriation; any plans to repatriate cash from China this year? ","Chuck Lauber","You know the last few years we've repatriated a $150 million each year. We are going through that process and looking at the things that are in front of us. We would expect to repatriate some cash and when we come up with the appropriate number as we go through that process, we'll be talking about how much we bring back. But we would expect to, and we have in the last two years brought back $150 million each year. ","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay great. And then on your North American margins your range is typically like 25 to 50 bips, but this year you have a 100 basis point range and just wanted to understand the change or if there is any moving pieces that would support the wider range. Thanks. ","Chuck Lauber","You know it\u2019s mostly within our range, it\u2019s mostly just based on volume assumptions. That\u2019s what drives most of the volatility. ","Operator","Thank you.

Continuing our strategy to leverage our distribution channel, we launched our A. O. Smith branded water treatment portfolio in the U.S. wholesale channel. We revised our China sales expectations as we moved into the back half of the year, with a path towards more normalized channel inventory levels, which as previously discussed, has been elevated for over the past 15 months.","Chuck will now describe our results in more detail, beginning on slide 4.","Charles Lauber","Thank you, Kevin. Sales for the second quarter of $765 million were 8% lower than the same quarter in 2018. Earnings in the second quarter of a $102 million declined 11% in the second quarter in 2018. And second quarter earnings per share declined 8% to $0.61. Sales in our North America segment of $524 million declined 2% compared with the second quarter of 2018. Lower residential water heater volumes due to a tough second quarter 2018 comparison, driven by a pre-buying in advance of the price increase were partially offset by the mid-2018 pricing actions.","In addition, our recently acquired Water-Right business added approximately $14 million to sales. Rest of the World sales of $249 million declined 19% compared with the same quarter of 2018. China sales were down 16% in local currency, primarily related to previously disclosed channel inventory build, which occurred in the first half of 2018 and did not repeat in 2019. The weaker Chinese currency unfavorably impacted translated sales by approximately $16 million. India sales grew over 30% in constant currency compared with the same period in 2018.","On Slide 6, North America segment earnings of a $123 million were 2% lower than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2018. The favorable impact from mid-2018 pricing actions were more than offset by the unfavorable impact from the lower water heater volumes and higher steel costs and other costs. As a result, second quarter 2019 segment margin of 23.5% was essentially the same as last year. Rest of the World earnings of $22 million declined 35% compared with the second quarter of 2018. The impact to profits from lower sales -- lower China sales more than offset the benefit to profits from lower SG&A expenses. Weaker China currency translation negatively impacted earnings by approximately $2 million. As a result of these factors, the segment margin declined to 9% compared with 11.3% in the same quarter of 2018.","Our corporate expenses of $9.6 million were lower in the quarter compared with the second quarter last year, primarily due to lower incentive-based compensation. Interest costs were higher in the second quarter than a year ago due to the acquisition of Water-Right in early April. For the year, we expect interest expense to be approximately $11 million. Cash provided by operations of a $144 million during the first half of 2019 was lower than a $173 million in the same period of 2018, lower earnings and higher working capital investment resulted in lower cash flow from operations.","Our liquidity and balance sheet remained strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 17% at the end of the second quarter. We have cash balances totaling $578 million located offshore. And our net cash position was $219 million at the end of June. During the first half of 2019, we repurchased approximately 2.8 million shares of common stock for a total of a $133 million. Through yesterday, we purchased approximately 4 million shares at a cost of approximately a $185 million, accelerating the pace of our repurchase due to valuation. Approximately 6.3 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of June. We continue to see prolonged headwinds in the appliance market in China. And recent indications from our customers in China inform us that they will reduce orders for the third quarter. As a result, we have revised our 2019 EPS guidance to a range of between $2.35 and $2.41 per share, a 9% decline at the midpoint compared to last year.","We expect our cash flow from operations in 2019 to be approximately $400 million compared with $450 million in 2018, primarily due to lower earnings. Our 2019 capital spending plans are approximately $85 million and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $75 million in 2019. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $49 million in 2019, slightly higher than last year due to inflation. Our expected effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22%. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of $300 million in 2019. We expect our diluted outstanding shares in 2019 will be approximately a $167 million.","I will now turn the call back to Kevin, who will summarize our guidance and business assumptions for 2019, beginning on slide 10. Kevin?","Kevin Wheeler","Okay, great. Thank you, Chuck. Our outlook for 2019 includes the following assumptions. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will be down 50,000 to 100,000 units in 2019 as replacement remained stable, but new home construction appears to be lackluster due to labor shortages and weather delays. Commercial industry water heater volumes are expected to be up 1%. Based on boiler sales growth of 7% in the first half, we expect our North America boiler sales to grow approximately 7% for the full year. We project India water heater EBIT will be positive in 2019 and improvements to continue for water treatment in 2019. Overall in India, we will be profitable in 2020.","Our forecast for the Chinese currency in 2019 is essentially level with where it is today and weaker than last year. Essentially all of the negative FX impact occurred in the first half of 2019. We see continued and prolonged headwinds in the appliance channel in China. Our third party analysis of overall market performance in the second quarter showed the electric water heater market was down 8% to 9%, gas tankless water heaters down 2% to 3% and water treatment systems down 1% to 2%. As previously discussed, we estimated 2018 China sales increased due to distributor inventory build, primarily in the first half of 2018. We are assuming continued weakness in the China consumer demand for the full year in 2019. We continue to improve our process to quantify inventories, while we experienced seasonality, a normal inventory level would be two to three months. Our current view is that the channel inventory is approximately four months.","Based on our recent conversations with key customers, we expect channel inventory levels to decline over the back half of the year to approach normal channel inventory levels by the end of 2019. Due to the 2018 channel inventory build and with the impact of the expected 2019 channel inventory decline, we are projecting full year sales to be down approximately 16% to 17% in local currency terms. Combined with our expected three points of unfavorable currency translation, our 2019 sales projection is a decline of approximately 19% to 20%.","We expect third quarter 2019 channel -- China sales to be down 20% compared to the third quarter of 2018. Due to the decline in sales, we expect plant inefficiencies, reductions in headcount and higher mix of mid-priced products will have a slightly lower contribution margin will weigh on margins. We forecast China third quarter 2019 operating margin will essentially breakeven. We expect fourth quarter performance to be similar to the second quarter as the fourth quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year, offset by expected continued channel inventory declines.","Please advance to Slide 11. We continued -- we see continued momentum in North America with our water heater, boiler and water treatment products, collectively expected to grow up to 6% in 2019, including approximately $40 million in Water-Right sales. Our profitability improvements and sales growth in India is also encouraging. Our business model in China is solid, and we are committed to the region for the long-term. We have near-term challenges to navigate through in China as the economy remains weak. We continue to stay close to our distribution customers as they worked down channel inventory and we continue to review our cost structure to right-size the business. We project revenue will decline by 2% to 2.5% for the year in U.S. dollars and 1% to 1.5% in local currency. EPS is projected to be between $2.35 and $2.41. We expect North America's segment margins to be between 23.50% and 23.75% and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 6%.","Our stable replacement markets, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes, the long-term growth drivers in water treatment solutions and boilers across North America and favorable demographics in China and India, coupled with our strong balance sheet position us well to enhance shareholder value.","That concludes our prepared remarks. And we are now available for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Saree [ph] with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. Could you update us on how you're thinking about price cost in North America in the second half of the year and maybe into 2020 given your price increase announced today and then lower steel costs?","Kevin Wheeler","We've been, typically we don't talk about price. I would say historically; we've been able to offset increased costs with pricing action. Our assumption -- I'll tell you that our forecast and assumption on steel is that currently we forecast that it will be like -- it will be in this level for the rest of the year. And we have seen recently this last month some increases in steel prices or some indication steel prices may be going up.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then, I believe you have previously done with headcount reductions in China, but given the lower outlook would you reduce this more or do you believe you have already right-sized the business for current market conditions?","Kevin Wheeler","No, we're going to continue to review the business, as we always have and we'll be aggressive. The first headcount reduction was about 10%. We completed that in the first quarter of this last year. We are planning an additional 5% reduction in Q3. And then the SG&A that we continue to look at and scrutinize to make sure that we're spending our money appropriately there and investing appropriately. And we're going to continue to close on productive stores. And so at the end, as we look at it, as the market was to and continues to evolve, we'll aggressively adjust our business and we will right-size the business to the current environment.","Unidentified Analyst","I appreciate it. That was helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our following question comes from Alvaro Lacayo with G. Research. Your line is open.","Alvaro Lacayo","Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to start with Rest of World and maybe if you could try to categorize for us the visibility that you see, I know you mentioned that you believe that the inventories may be more normalized towards the end of the year. But given the big step change from last quarter to this quarter, maybe if you could just talk about visibility and what you could see going forward? And in terms of the numbers you highlighted about the volume declines has that stabilized or has that's -- in your view or have they not found a bottom in terms of year-on-year declines?","Charles Lauber","This is Chuck. Let me just talk a little bit about China. So what we've talked about in the past is the weak economy and that continues. So we've continued to see weak economy that really has not changed. We've talked about elevated inventory in the channel that has not changed. The elevated inventory remains roughly or where it has been really since we started talking about at June of 2018. We've also talked about assuming our outlook last call, said assuming flat channel inventory, we'd be down 6% to 8%. What's changed in our visibility is that recently, as we come out of June and had conversations with customers, we've seen customers telling us that they are going to order less in the third quarter. Now, typically in the third quarter and we talked about this on last year's call because of the fourth quarter is typically our strongest call -- strongest quarter in the market, we would see inventories go up.","What we're looking at now and the visibility that we see and we've scrubbed it and we think we have a clear -- we certainly have a clearer picture in the last couple of weeks, is that we would expect that those inventories would start to come down in the third quarter and by the end of the year, we'd be going out of the year, at least in our assumptions at an inventory level roughly at what we went out of 2017 at. So really, really reversing out the inventory that went into the channel last year and we'd be flushed out, and back to what Kevin said, more normalized two to three months inventory levels by the end of this year.","Alvaro Lacayo","Got it, thank you.","Kevin Wheeler","And just to add on to that, you have to believe hit the bottom and we certainly hope so. And we're still going to sit back and make sure that what -- we're watching our business. And as I've mentioned to the previous caller, if additional adjustments are needed, we'll aggressively go after those to continue to right-size the business, but we do believe that we've given the best outlook based on all that what Chuck had said in our visibility into the inventory and we hope this is the bottom.","Alvaro Lacayo","And in terms of the cost reduction initiatives that you mentioned previously; can you maybe quantify for us how much savings you expect from the initiatives you've already taken?","Charles Lauber","Yes. So for the year, it's approximately year-over-year $24 million to $25 million of savings within the SG&A category. Think of that in terms of the split roughly first half, back half equally. The back half is a little bit less and that's because we've got some investments in advertising we're going to do to -- for the fourth quarter, but that's roughly the amount. There is a little headwind on the back half as we do have some severance costs that would be associated with the headcount reductions.","Operator","Thank you. And our following question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Your line is open.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, everyone. How you're doing?","Kevin Wheeler","Good morning.","Robert McCarthy","Good. So I guess the first question is thinking through kind of I think you've guided to flat margins in China in third quarter and then 6% for the full year, you talked about some deleverage there. Could you just walk us through kind of a bridge of where you think, because I think your initial guide was kind of in the 11% range. Could you just bridge us what's deleverage, what's restructuring, what are the buckets, sales volume that get you from kind of the 11% to the 6% for the full year?","Charles Lauber","Yes. So I'll just kind of take it in the big bucket. So we talked about the inventory coming down, that's a pretty big bucket. It's rather acute in the third quarter. So when we're thinking about third quarter, you have to kind of look to the first quarter to find something that's comparable which is 20% down from last year. And at that level, we've got some pretty meaningful plant inefficiencies that we were not had expected before that gets us through the third quarter. And then the fourth quarter looks quite a bit like the second quarter. So we still have some headwinds on channel inventory, but we get back to a little bit more of a normal, not normalized, but a little bit higher volume level that runs through the plant. So when you kind of take all the buckets together, first quarter -- I'm sorry, second quarter just gets hit fairly hard by the lower volume.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, how are you thinking about perhaps your balance sheet right now in terms of M&A, maybe considering, I mean obviously it looks like today there has been an anticipation of this cut given how your stock has traded intraday. But nevertheless, you're in a bit of the fight of a lifetime in terms of what's going on in China and the organic growth story. If you see a material market break with your stock, do you think given the fact that you've got a balance sheet that's may be sub-optimal from a cash redeployment standpoint, you would consider being very aggressive in terms of share buyback. If you think about it, you might be able to get your business at a substantial discount over the next 12 months as you kind of right-size restructure this business. How do you think about that in this environment?","Kevin Wheeler","Well, I would just back to China, I mean the China change that we have is we think we'll work through the inventories by the end of the year. Once we get through that, we would expect a bit more normalized operating performance. So we certainly have seen changes in China and we're going to work through them by the end of the year. So thinking of our balance sheet, we're going to buy back $300 million of shares or at least we're projected to buy back $300 million of shares this year. So we're going to continue to do that. So we're on track to repurchase more than we did last year.","Charles Lauber","To add on to that about China a little bit. Certainly, we are in a challenging environment. I won't categorize it a fight of a lifetime. We have an excellent management team that's going to work our way through these challenging times and we'll come out the other end as a strong organization. Positively, we have some great mid-price point products that are gaining share. Our share in Q2 was higher than Q1. So there is -- and there has been","Kevin Wheeler","No meaningful trading down, there has been really no noticeable effect to our brand. And as we look out, we still look at China as a long-term growth part of our business. We won't want to be any other place than China when it comes to the growth. And when you look at it, the urbanization, I would still believe it has a long runway, the move into the middle class. So yes, we have some short-term challenges here. We have the team in place. We're making the moves we believe are the right moves in the current environment and we'll continue to do that. We know how to do that. And then as we come out the other side, the company will be stronger. We'll probably be a bit leaner and we'll be in position to take advantage of one of the best growth markets in the world. So it's important for us to do the things we're doing. But again, I believe our management team has it under control and we have a line of sight of what we're going to do to manage our way through this challenging environment.","Robert McCarthy","Last question. Given what you see in the U.S. in terms of slightly negative organic growth and obviously this could just be just timing and price increases and still, you still feel good about the fundamental long-term outlook for U.S. and obviously that could impact obviously margins because you got great margins there, you have for some time and that's I've been skeptical of it, you've been -- you've delivered, which has been great. But do you see anything on the horizon that would give you pause that the market is changing or the cycle is changing where you think that the organic growth there is going to be more challenging going forward than it has been over the past several years where you've had very solid stable organic growth in North America?","Charles Lauber","Yes. The answer to your question first, we still believe there is stable organic growth there. What's going on in our opinion and what we believe is, if you look at the market through May residential water heaters; the shipments in the industry were down about a 150,000 units. And as we look at our June sales in our sales when we look out, we think it's going to be down another 100,000 units. And as we look at it, there has certainly been an impact of a wet spring that's limited new construction. There continues to be a labor shortage with most of the builders and so forth. So as we go forward, the reason we have a decline is we just don't think with the labor shortages out there that the industry can make up the full 250,000 units. We think it's going to be somewhere in the 150,000 range. But what's important, and we said in our opening comments, we still see a very stable replacement market. And again, as we go forward, we have no change to our North American growth pattern. Water heaters are at 4%. We believe a lot more will continue to grow at that 8% to 10% range.","So no, that was a long answer, but no, the answer is, we feel really good about North America. We think this is just some weather-related issues. And hopefully as the labor shortages in the market start to become less that the new construction will continue to move forward. So, no change in our outlook on either of our North American businesses.","Robert McCarthy","Well gentlemen, good luck. The market seems to be believing you today.","Kevin Wheeler","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Matt Summerville","Thanks. Couple of questions. Why do you think it's taking either the channel or A. O. Smith so long to react to the inventory situation in China?","Kevin Wheeler","We've had prolonged slowdown in China. So it's been a number of quarters that we've been talking about the elevated level and the prolonged slowdown. June typically is a favorable month for the appliance channel. It's a high promotion month. I think there is some disappointment perhaps in June, maybe wasn't as high as what expectations were in the customer base. And as we came out of June and the prolonged -- the prolonged level of what the downturn is, I believe our customers just said, it's time to de-lever a bit. So I would say those data points, and you know last year we went into Q4 with pretty high inventory levels and wanted and expected that the channel would flush those out and it was a little disappointing. So when they start looking -- when our customers start looking back historically and look at the data points of last fourth quarter June and maybe what they see in front of them, they've decided to take action in the third quarter.","Matt Summerville","So maybe if you can flush out in Q2 then and what your expectation is for the year between the water heater business, the water treatment business and air purification in China. Can you give a little bit more granularity as to actual performance in Q2 and full year expectation for those three buckets?","Kevin Wheeler","Well, let me kind of carve out water heating and water treatment. So water treatment, for the quarter, water treatment was down about 12%, largely channel flushing or you know reduction of the channel inventory impacted. When we look at our water treatment business over the course of the year, we would expect to be down about 12% on our sales. If you look at kind of the consumer demand, the customer demand and what we're seeing on sell-out, it's probably up about 8% to 10%. So we're seeing a little bit positive there. The water heater, you got to kind of look at the mix, right. So we've introduced some mid-range priced products. We've introduced new products. We do have headwind on the water heater side.","Our outlook for the back half of the year is to be similar to the first half of the year as far as consumer demand. We see -- we saw last year 2018 slightly downtick on consumer demand from 2017. But we've seen the first half of 2018 be fairly similar to last year and that's what we're assuming for the rest of the year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open.","Mike Halloran","Hey, good morning, everyone. So just continuing on that, there's a lot of inventory machinations [ph], as well as just the timing of when you guys are manufacturing this year versus last year. Performance relative to the market in the core China product categories, how do you think that's track lately? And what's the assumption moving forward from here?","Kevin Wheeler","Knowing that the best tracking for us is market share. And so, if you look at our product categories, we have -- we started the year at a couple of points down overall, but as we go forward, our market share in Q2 exceeded Q1. We're getting really good acceptance of our new products, mid-price point products in the market. So -- and as far as the premium channel is continuing to hold, it's down a couple of points overall, the channel, but the overall it's holding. So as we go forward, we believe we're getting our fair share and we're continuing to gain momentum on the online side of the business as well as with our offline. So overall, we think we're getting our fair share and we look for a back half on a sellout perspective, not so much as sell-in because that's the inventory side of it. We feel we'll continue to get our fair share and possibly move our market share up in couple of categories that we were down a point or so.","Mike Halloran","So Kevin, was that commentary exclusive to the water heater business or did that include treatment as well?","Kevin Wheeler","It includes both. It includes both. As we talk, we have so many different categories, but the three main categories that Chuck outlined, I feel comfortable that we'll be getting our fair share in all three of those categories.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Jeff Hammond`","Good morning. Can you just talk about market share, how your market share is holding in North America on the res, commercial water heater side? And then just how are things progressing relative to plan within North America water treatment?","Kevin Wheeler","Well, let me take the North America water heater residential share question. We had a very good Q2. And our market share on all of our key categories, particularly residential and commercial were back in line with our 2018 levels, actually slightly up. So we've -- we had a soft first quarter and we recovered in the second quarter and we don't see any reason that's going to change. On the water treatment front, we've -- Chuck will outline, but we've had a very good Q2.","Charles Lauber","Yes. We talked on the last call that we expect to be incrementally better in Q2 versus Q1 and that's -- that is happening. So the business is performing well. For the quarter, our sales were about $37 million, $14 million of that again was Water-Right, which is integrating well as Kevin -- it's on track as Kevin mentioned. So the kind of the customer acquisition in core growth is low-teens for us on the rest of the business. Operating margins were high-single digits for the quarter. So we're pleased with the way water treatment North America is progressing.","Jeff Hammond`","Okay. And then just on China, can you give us kind of early read or feedback you're getting on this new price point product and when do you think it will start to really gain traction? Thanks.","Kevin Wheeler","Well, the mid-price point products have gone in, in various phases; it does take time to certify. And I think what we've mentioned in the past, we just don't take a product and discount it and make it a bit price point. We will actually design the product for the right category with the right cost structure. So as you go across our residential water heating, it's continuing to do well and we're gaining share on the online side of the business. Gas tankless, we still have a bit of work to do to introduce a few new products to fill those gaps and those will happen by the second half of the year. And our water treatment continues to do well. So overall, the acceptance has been good. But more importantly, the products have been designed for the right price points with the right cost structure so that we could maintain margins. So overall, we've been accepted well. And we look at introducing just a few more to balance out our product portfolio in each of those categories.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning, everyone. Just while we're on the topic of the medium price point, can you give us some sense of what the mix is now in terms of premium versus mid-price point and where you think that might be a year from now?","Charles Lauber","Yes. Right now, we're probably got a little heavier mix of the mid-price point as we work through the back half of the year. A lot of those products are new. As Kevin said, they're pretty well accepted. The channel -- as they work down the channel inventory, there is product that is not as new. So those price points are different. But we would expect this to normalize next year, more normalized next year. And we're always -- as we grow e-commerce and as we grow the mid-to-mid-price point product, it will be slightly less margin, but we would expect this to normalize. We get just pressure on our margins in Q3, particularly because the lower volume. So it's from gross margin to be a little pressure on us.","David MacGregor","So when you say normalized, just from a proportional standpoint are we talking 50-50 or I'm just trying to get some sense of proportion?","Charles Lauber","Off the top of our head, I don't have that information. I'll be more than happy to dig into it and get it for you. But there is -- what I would tell you it's going to change by product category. And so what we're going to have to -- it's a great question, we will be sure to take a note of that and make sure that we get back to you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nick [ph] with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, guys. I was hoping to ask about a cash repatriation and maybe get a sense for how much of this currently disclosed cash number is in the U.S. and outside the U.S. and if you repatriated any cash from China in the first half or in the quarter?","Kevin Wheeler","Yes, we have, we've repatriated. We did it in and out of China about $150 million or $150 million for the first half of the year. So all of the cash that we mentioned is offshore, just to be clear on that. We did in and out of $150 million out of China and we've repatriated about $85 million of that back to the U.S.","Unidentified Analyst","So you said the $150 million is from China and the $85 million is back in the U.S.?","Kevin Wheeler","Back to the U.S., yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes. Thanks for taking the follow-up. It's two quarters a row I've been cut off. I guess I'm not going to get a Christmas card.","Kevin Wheeler","It's is not intentional. Sorry.","David MacGregor","I'd just like [indiscernible] we got here, I guess there was an earlier question about raw materials and price cost, and you noted that raw material prices were still high or maybe up year-over-year and obviously spot market has been coming down, you guys are contract buyers, I understand that part. But one would think that by now you're starting to see some leakage on the indirect component as well as maybe some supplemental spot purchases. So I guess the question is, notwithstanding, I know the mills have sent out letters asking for price increases a few weeks back, but when do we start seeing the benefit of lower steel prices coming through? Do we see some here in the third quarter or just can you help us with the timing?","Charles Lauber","Yes. We see a lag in 90 to 120 days to what you're kind of seeing in the marketplace. So we would expect to see a little bit of that benefit come through in the third and fourth quarter.","David MacGregor","Okay. Is there any way to quantify that for us or think about it quantitatively?","Kevin Wheeler","No, we'll just kind of go from the benchmark, which is quarter-over-quarter improvement.","David MacGregor","Okay. Okay, that's good. And then it's something we picked up on our checks was just talk of moving to kind of a national pricing model. And people are in distribution I guess now that distributors are acting more on a national scale, they're pressing for more of a national price as opposed to the disparities where I guess the southern markets were usually a discount to the northern markets. How does that play out for you in terms of price realization? Do your ASPs move up or down as you kind of normalize to a national level and how does the timing also play out?","Kevin Wheeler","Matt, pricing we're the only public company, okay? And so we just do not get into much detail on pricing with regards to strategy implement or expected implementation those type of things. And so, I just would prefer to keep that as kind of our policy. And again, what we've demonstrated over the years is being able to at the appropriate time, given time to address cost and inflation issues going forward. And I'm just going to leave it at that.","Operator","Thank you. And we have another follow-up from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Matt Summerville","Thanks. A couple of follow-ups; first, can you talk about what you're doing in the wholesale channel with respect to water treatment. I know when you launched in the Lowe's, you threw a revenue target out there. Do you have a revenue target for this wholesale initiative if you will?","Kevin Wheeler","What we have in for other revenue target for -- we just launched into that. We want -- it's right aligned with our channel strategy. So we're excited to have product into the wholesale market effective in May. What we will kind of talk about is because of our channel strategy, we are looking at growing water treatment year-over-year in that 10% to 15% range. So if you look at our whole portfolio of businesses, not guiding just for water -- wholesale, but we would look to grow year-over-year in that 10% to 15% range throughout kind of our, all of our channels.","Matt Summerville","If you aggregate your global water treatment business, what's your revenue objective for 2019, I believe that's a number you've shared in the past?","Kevin Wheeler","Yes. It's about 440 to 450.","Matt Summerville","Okay. And then lastly just with respect to Lochinvar on the boiler side of the business, can you talk about what you saw in Q2 and maybe what gives you a little bit of pause with the 7% growth target versus the 8% to 10% sort of longer term objective you have there?","Kevin Wheeler","Yes, that's -- let me just start with that. The backlog in the activity in the market remains -- it remains pretty active. But what I was talking about the wet weather and the labor shortages on the residential side of our business, water heating side, it's also spilling over into the boiler side and commercial side of the Lochinvar business. So the business remains solid. It's just -- we just don't think because of the wet weather and the labor shortages on either our water heater or our boiler side of the business that we'll be able to make up the complete ground in the second half of the year. So that's why we brought it down a bit to 7%. But the market is active and our coating is active. So the overall business is in -- it continues to move forward in the U.S.","Operator","Thank you.

As a reminder, this may call be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Patricia Ackerman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin, ma'am.","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you, Rania. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2016 third quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","Also, in respect of others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Ajita, who will begin his remarks on slide 3.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The third quarter of 2016 was another excellent quarter for A. O. Smith, setting a record for sales. We continue to see healthy end markets for our consumer products in China and commercial water heaters in the U.S. Here are a few highlights.","Sales grew 9% to a record $684 million. Excluding the impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar against the Chinese and Canadian currencies, our sales grew 11% in the third quarter. China sales were up 17% in local currency. Third quarter net earnings of $0.47 per share were 15% higher than our earnings per share during the same period last year.","We are delighted to welcome the Aquasana team to the A. O. Smith family through our acquisition of the US Water Treatment Company in early August. Aquasana fits squarely in our acquisition strategy to grow our core and expand into new geography. In this case, we are expanding our Asia-based reverse osmosis water treatment platform into the U.S. We are also excited about the opportunities Aquasana's carbon-based products bring us to cross-sell water treatment products in China.","We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion to return to shareholders. During the first three months of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares for $100 million. We increased that dividend by 26% six months ago. We also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, which became effective on October 6.","John will now describe our results in more details, beginning with slide number 4.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the third quarter of $684 million were 9% higher than the previous year. Net earnings of $83 million improved 13% from 2015. Earnings per share of $0.47 improved 15% over last year. Sales in our North America segment of $451 million increased 8% compared with the third quarter of 2015. Increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters in the U.S. The purchase of Aquasana in August added $6.2 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of World segment sales of $240 million increased 11% compared with 2015. China sales increased 17% in local currency, driven by higher demand for our water heaters and water treatment products.","On slide 6, North America operating earnings of $101 million were 11% higher than segment operating earnings in the previous year. An operating margin of 22.3% was higher than the 21.7% operating margin one year ago. Higher volumes in the U.S. were the primary driver of the improved North America segment financial performance.","Rest of World operating earnings of $31 million improved 14% compared with 2015. Higher China sales were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses in China. Segment operating earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $2 million due to currency translation, higher selling costs in China to support expansion in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and higher advertising costs to promote our products in China during the Summer Olympic Games and the European Football Championship were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses. Third quarter segment operating margin of 12.9% was slightly higher than one year ago primarily due to smaller losses in India.","Our corporate expenses were higher in the third quarter compared with the year-ago period primarily due to $1.2 million of Aquasana acquisition-related costs and higher expenses at our corporate technology center. Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2016 was 29.8% which is lower than the 31.3% experienced during the third quarter last year and similar to our 2016 guidance.","Cash provided by operations during the first nine months of 2016 was $264 million compared with $237 million during the same period last year. Higher earnings in 2016 were partially offset by higher outlays for working capital in the 2016 period. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt to capital ratio was 18% at the end of the third quarter. We have cash balances totaling nearly $680 million located offshore, and our net cash position was approximately $343 million at the end of September.","During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Aquasana, as we previously discussed. Primarily, as a result of continued strong cash flow and escalating PBGC (sic) [PBCG] premiums, we made a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of $30 million in the third quarter. The after-tax impact to our cash flow is approximately $18.5 million.","During the first nine months of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock for a total of $100 million. We completed a 2-for-1 stock split in early October 2016. Adjusting for the split, approximately 2.6 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of the third quarter.","This morning, we announced an increase to the midpoint of our 2016 EPS guidance in a range of between $1.81 and $1.83 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 15% increase in EPS compared with our 2015 results.","Please turn to slide 9 for several 2016 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2016 to be approximately $325 million, which is lower than the $344 million generated in 2015. We expect higher earnings will be more than offset by higher outlays for working capital this year compared with 2015 and the voluntary $30 million pension contribution made earlier this year.","Due to the strong growth of our water treatment business in China, we will reach the capacity of our existing leach facility in the next few years. Our 2016 capital spending plans of $95 million to $100 million for the total year include approximately $20 million related to construction of a new water treatment manufacturing and air purification assembly facilities in China.","Total cost for the facility, which is expected to be completed in early 2018, will be approximately $65 million. In addition, we completed capacity expansion at two North America plants in 2016 at a cost of approximately $7 million. Our 2016 capital spending plan also includes approximately $10 million to support the ERP implementation.","Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $66 million in 2016. Expenses related to our ERP implementation were about $16 million in 2015 and are projected to be approximately $25 million in 2016, higher than the previous year due to the larger number of scheduled go-live events in 2016. We recognized expenses of approximately $15 million during the first nine months of 2016, and we expect approximately $7 million of incremental expenses in the fourth quarter compared with the prior year. This, in combination with a significantly lower cash rate in 2015, will result in fourth quarter 2016 earnings per share being approximately flat compared with the prior year.","We started the final phase of our ERP system implementation on October 1, which consists of three major manufacturing sites. We expect to conclude our implementation efforts at a few of our small factories next year. At this time, we do not expect to implement the system at our foreign operations.","Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $46 million in 2016, higher than the $43 million in 2015 primarily due to higher expenses at our corporate technology center and acquisition-related costs.","Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29.7% in 2016, similar to 2015. We expect to repurchase shares in the amount of approximately 235 million in 2016. As a result, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares for the year will be approximately 176.8 million shares.","I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for the remainder of 2016 and our growth strategy, beginning on slide 10. Ajita?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you, John. We expect our businesses will collectively grow approximately 8% to 8.25% in local currency and approximately 6% to 6.25% in U.S. dollars in 2016. The assumptions for currency underlying our organic growth forecast are at current rate, with the exception of continued depreciation in the China currency rate to average RMB 6.8 per dollar in the fourth quarter. Specific to our North America segment, we will experience the full impact of higher steel costs in the fourth quarter due to the timing of steel cost realization in our P&L.","We expect slower growth in our Lochinvar-branded sales than we've originally projected. Our Lochinvar-branded products have historically grown as a result of the transition from lower-efficiency boilers to higher-efficiency boilers, new product introduction and market share gain. In 2016, we expect our condensing boiler business to grow at 10%, which will be essentially offset by a decline in water heater and non-condensing boiler volume, resulting in minimal growth this year.","These factors, in addition to the assumptions John discussed earlier, lead to our expectation that our North America segment operating margin will be between 21.75% and 22% in 2016. This implies North America margins will be down sequentially in the fourth quarter as a result of several unusual events.","First, the incremental ERP spend will impact margins negatively by over 100 basis points. Second, we expect lower commercial volumes in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter as we encourage our distribution partners to hold more inventory in advance of our October 1 SAP implementation, which included our commercial water heater plants. And, third, we will experience the full impact from higher steel costs in the fourth quarter.","Specific to our Rest of World segment, we are a consumer products company in China, which distinguishes us from most industrial companies operating in China. In local currency, our sales in China have grown by 18% in 2014, 16% in 2015 and 17% in the first nine months of this year despite the softer China economy.","We have various growth drivers underpinning our China business, which give us confidence to project an annual growth rate of over 15% in local currency for 2016. These drivers include overall water heater market growth, driven by household formation and an emerging replacement market, geographic expansion, market share gain, growth in water treatment and air purification product and improved product mix. The Rest of World segment operating margin in 2016 will be slightly higher than 13%.","I'm moving now on to slide number 11. We have refined our growth model to reflect the growth in our China business, which is now 32% of sales. Additionally, we modified our Lochinvar brand growth rate. During our ownership, our Lochinvar-branded condensing boilers have grown at a double-digit pace, driven by the continued transition to higher-efficiency boilers, market share gains and new product introduction. We think this is a reasonable assumption going forward. Assuming 4% growth for Lochinvar-branded water heater sales, our projected growth rate for total Lochinvar-branded sales is 8%.","Our refined total company organic growth model continues to assume 8% growth for the foreseeable future. Especially in these volatile and uncertain economic times, we believe our organic growth potential and our stable defensive replacement market, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes, positively differentiates A. O. Smith among other industrial companies. Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we are available for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just wondering if we could \u2013 on the third quarter margin, it looks like steel impacted less in the third quarter than it will in the fourth quarter. Could you give us \u2013 I know you said, John, and certainly in the text you said it was volumes. Was there anything else impacting the North American margin in the quarter? Was there an increment there from Aquasana that helped?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","No, Aquasana has very little impact in the quarter. In fact, it had a negative of about $700,000 or $800,000, but that's in corporate expense because those were the expenses we talked about regarding the acquisition related. So, no, it was primarily the residential and commercial volumes that dropped to the bottom line, if you will. We did have higher steel costs that was partially offset by steel \u2013 but price \u2013 partially offset by price, et cetera. But that's kind of the magnitude of it.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got you. Two other questions. Does the one's weakness \u2013 like, if we sort of use the year-end \u2013 the quarter-end rate, does that go from sort of $0.01 to $0.02 in the fourth quarter and then stay there?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I'm not sure of your question, if you used the fourth quarter EPS or the fourth quarter operating margin or what.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, from your press release, you indicated there was about a $2 million segment income hit, which translates to just a little bit below $0.01. And just \u2013 I was just wondering if that's an average for the quarter rate. So, based on the end of the quarter 3Q rate, does that \u2013 is that now $0.02 going forward?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Two million currency (18:25) rate you're talking about?","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah...","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah \u2013 no, I think, in the fourth quarter, it will be similar to maybe a little bit higher because we're using a 6.8 rate. So, it'll be slightly higher than $0.01. But, yeah, a little bit higher than a penny.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Last question. In the last couple of conference calls, you guys have said that you're looking at more deals this year than you have in some time, both from a change in some of your external resources but also from internal resources.","Could you give us an idea of, kind of, what the pipeline looks like? I know good. But is this something that we can expect six months \u2013 some type of monetization. I know Aquasana is done. I get that. But just kind of looking for more \u2013 size-wise, just some type of thumbnail sketch on what you think maybe the next six months looks like.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Scott, this is Ajita. The pipeline is active as it has been. But for obvious reasons, I can't comment on something that could happen in the future vis-\u00e0-vis acquisitions. We're active. The pipeline is interesting, and that's about all I can say at this time.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Let me ask the question in different way. Are you looking at a lot of Aquasana-sized acquisitions? Are you looking at some larger deals? And regionally, could you give us an idea of where you're more active, U.S. or...","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","There's a wide range of deals. There are little ones and there are larger ones. And that's been \u2013 that's about what it's been in the past.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","And in all geography.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","In all geography...","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Around the world.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got you. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alvaro Lacayo from Gabelli & Company. Your line is now open.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Good morning. I guess, I just wanted some commentary about your expectations for both the residential and commercial water heater shipments and how they've changed and if Q3 had any sort of unique choppiness to it, and then how all that sort of translates to the updated Lochinvar guidance with respect to the water heater piece and the non-condensing piece?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, I'll take a shot at it, Ajita, and then you can \u2013 I would say that the residential buy-ins we saw in July, which is public, where the industry was up 9% or so, and as we looked at August and September, we think it was up more than that. So, I think we're tracking pretty well to where we thought. I would tell you, on the last call, we said 8%, 9% for the year. We would probably say 8.8% to 8.9% now. So, we're tracking pretty well where we thought.","And on the commercial side, same sort of thing. I think we talked about a 2.25% to 2.30% (21:37) level. We saw the second quarter up 30%, which we know is being driven by that 55 to 90 gallon electric. We saw July up about 28% so it's kind of tracking at that level, so I don't think any surprises.","Now, to answer your question on Lochinvar, it's really two things. They had a very strong residential market last year, and that's come back to bite us this year. They're going to be down probably 15%. And the non-condensing, which quite frankly we think is probably a shrinking market because of the move to condensing, has got quite competitive and will be down kind of 15% to 20% in that part of the market.","Now, it's a relatively small part. It's just over 5%, but it hurts the growth rate. The way we're going to remedy that is we're coming out with some new non-condensing products late this year that we think will help us in that category, as well as other products that \u2013 two other categories that Lochinvar has coming out at the end of the year. So, they are having a difficult year from a growth standpoint. Their margins and margin dollars are growing, so that's very positive.","And we think, with the new product introductions that are going to happen next year as well as some help from some of their key verticals, their education has been weak and their multifamily \u2013 that category \u2013 those categories have been kind of flat. We would hope they would grow a little bit.","So, going forward, we're comfortable with that 8%. We've modified it a little bit to really just reflect the growth that we've seen historically and kind of modeled that going forward.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. Just to clarify, when John talked about the verticals, he was talking about the full market verticals have been tapped \u2013 those verticals that have been tapped. The only thing that I would add from a Lochinvar perspective is to just reinforce that the condensing boiler part is still growing double-digit, which is what we expect. And the other is that, in going back to residential water heaters, from what we are hearing anecdotally from our distributors, the inventories in the channel seem to be in good shape. And again, I want to remind you. We don't have real good information about that, but we do get anecdotal feedback that is usually pretty good. And the inventories seem to be in reasonable shape.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Yeah. I mean, it seems like a lot of the moving pieces are related to sort of these one-time items and things that happened last year. So, I was surprised to see sort of a long-term growth rate come down versus just \u2013 maybe just the Q3 and Q4.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","You mean with Lochinvar?","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Yeah, correct.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. What happened with Lochinvar last year, and we talked about that at length, is China hurt them because they were down significantly in China last year, as well as the Canadian market last year hurt them. So, again, we just kind of relooked at where they are this year, the new product introductions. Historically, when we've owned them, the condensing has grown 10% and we think we are very much in a position to grow it at 10% going forward, and that's about 60% of the business.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","And the water heater part is \u2013 our guidance really gets in line with the rest of our North American water heater business at around 4%.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Got it. Okay.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","So, it's just a logical shifting.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Okay. And then, it will...","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","When you look at our total portfolio, it's still at the 8% type of growth rate that we've been talking about.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Okay. And then, I guess, with regards to the Aquasana acquisition, maybe if you could just go over some of the synergies and how you'll be able to leverage the platform that you built out in China to support Aquasana in the U.S. and vice versa.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. What we've said is it's a very complementary acquisition. So, we are very, very strong in China in the reverse osmosis market. We do not have much in the way of carbon product. In the U.S., Aquasana is very strong in the carbon-related product. They have some RO but it's minimal. So, we think there is truly some sales cross-selling opportunities.","One of their important products is a whole-house filter, and that is installed by plumbers. We think we have some potential capability there to expand that. So, much of the opportunities are revenue synergies that we're very comfortable that we can end up getting. And then, on top of that, they have direct marketing capability that we think in the long run will be beneficial to us.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","I think, just to add to that, from an acquisition and integration perspective, it's just about two months under the belt and things are on track, no surprises. And things are as we expected.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. What I didn't say is it obviously gets us into the North American market, which is a...","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","For water treatment.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, for water treatment, which is a large market.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I think, Ajita, it was in your closing remarks. You made a comment that you were encouraging some of your distributors to, sort of, I guess, for lack of a better term, pre buy, stock up, buy more than would normally be necessary ahead of I believe you've said an SAP implementation. Can you talk a little bit more about that, if that event has already transpired, how sort of that progressed, how the systems are functioning and, I guess, how much pull-forward, if you will, was there in the Q3, if I understood your comments correctly?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Sure. We had three major factories and a distribution center go on live on SAP. And that's a fairly large portfolio of factories going live at the same time. The date was October 1. It was the go-live date, and all these things are in fairly long transition. Things are on track. I wouldn't say it's completely error free. When someone is doing an SAP transition and they say it's error free, I don't know how to say this nicely, but there's probably more behind the curtain, okay?","But things are on track. They are where we expect. The teams are \u2013 when issues come up, we've been addressing them very quickly. And so far, the customer is not being impacted any more than we expected and we encouraged some of our customers to buy ahead just because it's a prudent thing to do, and we've done that with every one of our other SAP implementations with other factories. And there was some amount of buy-in, I don't have an exact number, in commercial. In residential, there was hardly any.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, that's what we would have concluded from the numbers. In commercial, there was some buy-in, but very little on the residential side.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. But the gist of your question, in terms of how the transition is going and things like that, it's on track.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Got it. And then, just as a follow-up, with respect to China, what's your expectation for the full year for water treatment and air purification revenue? And then, just moving over to India. Can you talk about at what point \u2013 if you have a vision to break even, when you think that business starts to break even? Thank you.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I'll start. Water treatment had a very, very strong quarter. In the third quarter, it was up over 40%. Year-to-date, it's up, approaching 40% in local currency terms, so above 30% in U.S. dollars, and we expect \u2013 that's what we expect for the year. So, the water treatment business is doing very, very well.","Air purification is on track. I think, at the beginning of the year, we said that we would be double sales from about $10 million to $20 million. We're on track to do that. We think we could be a little bit higher than that. So, I'd say both those businesses are doing as good or better than what we expected.","With respect to India, you really got to break it into two categories. We have a water heater business there, which, I think we've said publicly, its sales are about $15 million to $16 million now. Let's say, this year, if we need to break even, at probably $30 million to $35 million to get that to break even. What we need is we need some help from the economy growth in housing, which hasn't taken place in the last two years. And then, we have a water treatment business which we've said is in its infancy. And this year will result in a (30:53) couple million dollars of it. We're in about six cities, and that's going to take \u2013 we haven't really done the break-even analysis yet on that business.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. Just to add a little bit of color to both those. In terms of India, the economy is doing well in many sectors, but not in housing and that's what impacts us. So, it's disappointing from that perspective, but we continue to add distribution and gain market share, which has been our game plan.","In China, as we look at the growth that we've seen in water treatment and air purification, the really exciting part of this is the fact that, in China, what we have is very strong consumer brand and very strong distribution. And about four years ago or five years ago, we said \u2013 we looked at how do we translate that brand into new categories beyond water heating.","And obviously, we've been very successful as we move into water treatment, and we think it's a little too early to spike the ball. But we've been on track or ahead when it comes to air purification. And that just tells us and gives us the confidence that there are a number of other categories and segments that we can get into, new segments where we can leverage our brand and our distribution to continue this type of growth in China.","So \u2013 and when it comes to India, it's the same type of game plan. It's going much slower. But building the brand, building distribution and then saying how do we expand in terms of our categories to be able to access those hundreds of millions of people getting into the middle class.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Hi. So, just a broad question here. When I look at A. O. Smith, like, if you look at the gross margins over the last five years, you have done an excellent job. It used to be a 30% gross margin business. We are inching or have been consistently above, like, 40% over the last four quarters, five quarters here since the second quarter last year.","How should we think about \u2013 I mean, this is kind of a light manufacturing company. How should we think about going forward over the next two years? And in the previous call, John had mentioned about \u2013 think about North America margins starting point to be like 21.5% to 22%. Can you comment on that going forward? Like, should we think about A. O. Smith has to be kind of a 40%-plus gross margin business with North America to be around that 20%-plus EBIT margin?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, yes. We're running about 40%, and we've kind of said that, historically, there's three businesses above that, our commercial, our Lochinvar, and our China. And our residential is below that. So, we certainly think those margin \u2013 those gross margin levels are sustainable going forward. You can have some volatility depending on steel pricing, et cetera. But we certainly think that's a realistic starting point.","I was asked on the last call regarding margins. And I guess, my comment was we have not done the plan yet. We're in the process of doing it right now. But I certainly think that 21.5% to 22% is a good starting point. Now, we've got to incorporate things like Aquasana into that plan, which has a little lower margin. But we certainly think that's a realistic starting point. And now, it's our objective to obviously continue to grow margins. We've said that once we get SAP in, the objective is to optimize it next year.","But certainly, we need to start getting some benefit from SAP as we look into the 2018 period, et cetera. Also, we think our spend on SAP next year is less that hits the expense. We don't have that finalized. It's probably $5 million to $10 million less, so we have some positive things helping us with margins, et cetera. And certainly, it's our objective to continue to grow margins.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","And also, just to add a little bit, Bhupender, we \u2013 when you look at \u2013 we have capacity. Most challenged margin business, as John mentioned, is our residential water heater business. And as you know, we have a deficit in housing that's not going to come back real fast, but it will come back. And our incremental margins in our residential segment are in the 30% type of level. So, there is leverage opportunity also as the volume grows.","And this \u2013 at this stage, again, John mentioned SAP and our ERP system cost. But we also have a number of businesses where we are in the investment stage, probably more so as a portfolio than we would on a longer term basis. And \u2013 but all of those are investments for growth. So, as those markets get traction and continue to grow, there's certainly leverage opportunities in every one of those \u2013 the segments that we talk about.","Lochinvar, we've consistently increased our margin. North America we've talked about. And China, because it's a consumer business, it'll be a little slower. But the opportunity to leverage is certainly there.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot. Just a second question on price increases. I know, Ajita, you had mentioned that price increases went pretty well. Can you give us what would be the impact \u2013 or have they been realized, like, most of it or are we going to see that realization happen in the fourth quarter on both, like, residential? And was it also applied towards commercial?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","We had a price increase effective August 1, and we are comfortable with what our guidance is in terms of how the pricing is impacting us. In terms of the marketplace and competitively and things like that, again, for obvious reasons, I'm just not going to comment on what's happening from a competitive perspective. But we are comfortable with the guidance that we have and the pricing that's built in there.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","And I think we said in the last call that it ranged from 5 to 8 (37:40) and to answer your question \u2013 apply to residential and commercial.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","That's right. I missed that. It did apply to both.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Good morning. Just a few quick questions here. You've taken your cash flow from operations guidance down from $340 million to $325 million. Was that just the greater working capital that you referenced in your remarks?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","It was primarily the pension contribution. We decided, in August, to make a pension \u2013 voluntary pension contribution, and that was the primary reason.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","About $30 million.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. So, $30 million, $20 million or so, after tax.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, after tax...","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Thanks. And then, secondly, when you were talking about your North American margins and the fact that you expect them to be down sequentially in 4Q, you talked about the ERP being negative or greater than 100 bps. You talked about the reduced commercial volumes. And then, you talked about higher steel prices. Is there any chance you could quantify for us just what you're expecting in the way of cost inflation pressure on North American margins there?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. We really haven't disclosed that. But we \u2013 I think we said on the last call that, sequentially, steel prices were going to go up because we have a delay, if you will, on what the impact is. And I can tell you the fourth quarter will be the largest hit compared to third quarter.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","4Q will be the largest?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, fourth \u2013 Q4 will be the largest.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And then, have you \u2013 yeah, I realize you're not going to provide a lot of detail on this at this point. But can you say whether you've settled on your 2017 steel agreements yet, or is that still in negotiation?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Those are still in negotiation, I believe.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks \u2013 great. And then, the last question is just on China. And I'm wondering if you can talk about any change in your share in the tier 1 markets and the extent to which you're seeing certain local brands trying to reposition to play more in the higher price points?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, I'll take it, Scott. (39:34) You were just there. So, you can probably say. I don't think we've seen, I mean, the data we looked at where units sold over $400 were still maintaining our share there. I think there's \u2013 it's certainly very competitive in the lower end, and I'll say the middle tier. But I think we still have very, very large market share on the high end. And we haven't really seen any change in that.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","No \u2013 and John is right. I was there last week in both Vietnam and in China and the teams are excited and very upbeat about next year and where we're headed, the new products that are coming out. And so, we feel pretty good about what \u2013 our guidance for China.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. So, I just wanted to come back to price and the margin. So, your fourth quarter guidance, does that reflect that you're getting those price increases you put through?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, I think it assumes the price increases we talked about. Now, a couple of things. We also said on the last call that, because of some project work, et cetera, you don't necessarily get all the pricing at that time, and we said some of that would carry over into the first quarter, if you will. But, yeah, for the most part, that does assume that.","The biggest impact, as we talked about earlier, is SAP is going to add $5 million to $6 million in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter and $7 million compared to the prior year. So, that's certainly having an effect on fourth quarter margins that we don't think, going forward, will have that impact. And then, the stronger commercial, which was unusual for the third quarter, has \u2013 strong commercial is what it did. But again, that was due to the pre-buy.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Because your implied margin is, kind of, right around 20% or sub-20% for the fourth quarter versus 23% in the first 3 quarters. So, it seems like, I guess, as you look into 2017, I guess, SAP costs roll off and the commercial issue goes away, but the steel dynamic stays with us? Is that the way to think about the moving pieces?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, yeah. That's one way to look at it. But I guess, if you talk about a 20% as your starting point and you adjust for SAP, you're over 21%. And then, you adjust for a kind of a leveling off of that \u2013 of commercial, you kind of get back to that starting point range that I talked about earlier, that 21.5% to 22%.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay...","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I mean, clearly, steel is having impact on the margins, without a doubt. We did have a price increase, but we didn't necessarily cover margin with that.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, the \u2013 in the \u2013 so, you mentioned the res industry numbers. How did your growth line up with that in the third quarter? And then, along those lines, I think you had a product hole in the \u2013 in that kind of small commercial category. How are you performing there as you've kind of filled that product hole?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I think that the quarterly market share was pretty similar, up a little bit from the previous quarter. So, again, we're forecasting what the industry is going to be. So, residential is holding pretty well for us.","We did introduce that product in the 55 to 90 (43:14). We have gained some share in that. Well, I'll also tell you, we're not back to where our overall commercial margin \u2013 I mean, market shares, but we have made progress on that.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors from Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is now open.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. I wanted to discuss a little bit of Aquasana and, specifically, the recent news in, I guess, Milwaukee that the company is in talks with the city about rolling that product out in certain homes where there are lead service lines remaining in operation. Recognizing that you can't necessarily disclose too much on that specific deal but \u2013 other than what's in the press. But obviously, that issue is not unique to Milwaukee and there's a lot more attention to this lead issue post Flint, Michigan.","So, my question is, how significant a growth opportunity do you think that is for Aquasana, that type of sell-in through a partnership with a municipality? And is that a transformational opportunity for Aquasana, or is that just incremental. And then, also, was that a specific element of the rationale for that acquisition? Or is that something that you're just sort of learning now more about as you get involved with the business?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","I'll try to answer all of those. The specific issue in Milwaukee was not a driver for the acquisition. But clearly, the fact that there are lead issues around the country like Flint and many other cities was clearly an indicator for us, among a lot of other things that there is a water treatment opportunity in the U.S. And we have world-leading products that take care of all of these types of pollutants, especially world-leading reverse osmosis products. So, we clearly see the opportunity to bring that technology to the U.S.","Aquasana was a great acquisition and a vehicle to get those products into consumers' hands and using the channel that we really don't have a lot of expertise in, which we expect to grow in the future, obviously, in terms of digital reach into every home.","The specific instance in Milwaukee, we are working with the local government and the United Way and other agencies, especially since we live here, to get the product out and help as much as possible. That's not going to be necessarily transformational for Aquasana, but it really has a terrific impact in promoting the name and getting the name out there as being a leader in the solutions for some of the problems that we have in many of our cities. So, long term, that's absolutely going to help.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. And I guess, just following up on the topic. I mean, I guess, one of the things that really jumped out at me reading what the city had said was that it was going to cost them something like $800 million, if they wanted to replace all these service lines. But yet, they could buy every single affected home \u2013 the city could buy each home a water filter and it would cost less than $10 million. So, the \u2013 to the extent those are the two options for dealing with this issue, it seems like a no-brainer.","Is there a model here where the cities actually get involved via some kind of a rebate or something like that and actually fund some of this? Or do you still think most of the sales will be funded by the homeowner?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I think it's going to be a combination. I think cities will get involved and fund some of this. It's hard to tell. But the city of Milwaukee is getting involved. And again, I think that the big opportunity is not only getting the product out there, but getting a brand name out there in terms of being a leader in this category.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then, just one final question on that. So, following up on the acquisition discussion earlier, do you feel that, with Aquasana, you've now got the platform you need in water treatment in the U.S.? Or do you feel like there could be a further roll-up on your part that you would still be interested in adding to that platform via acquisition?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Aquasana is a start. We would certainly be interested in appropriately adding to that platform. And that's an ongoing, and that's clearly on strategy, the way we've described our strategy.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Well, that's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady from SunTrust Robinson. Your line is now open.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Wanted to just drill down on the Rest of World op margin assumptions. So, you're saying it's over 13% \u2013 slightly over 13% for the year. It implies a pretty strong Q4, call it, 13.5%. Is that a function of just some of the promo advertising spending dropping off from the level it was in Q3? And I know you're not giving 2017 guidance. But would you expect that number flat with where you are in 2016? Or do you see it ramping up again?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, I think it's a combination of two things. Traditionally, our fourth quarter in China is our strongest quarter from a sales standpoint. We think that will continue. And, yes, I would think that our advertising as a percent of sales will probably be a lower percentage than what it was in the third quarter because of those two events we talked about. So, I think both of those help, in effect, get the margin \u2013 I mean, a relatively strong margin in the fourth quarter.","We have not talked about or \u2013 where our planning phase. Ajita and I have talked at length. Certainly, it's our objective to grow North \u2013 Rest of World margins, and you do that with a combination of things. You leverage the advertising spend and the SG&A in China. Number two, you turn a couple of the businesses that right now we're incubating like air purification. That's going to lose probably $5 million this year. We'll move that towards breakeven as we get higher sales level.","We're also incubating the commercial water treatment business where we'll lose $3 million or $4 million this year. So, I think those are ways to grow margin. And then, we talked about we need to get India on a path of improved earnings. So, we haven't come out with an estimate. But certainly, those are some of the things we're looking at.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","And also, just to add to that, when we talk about these incubating businesses in China like air purification and commercial water treatment, et cetera, it \u2013 we usually have what I call a can-see plan, which is a multi-year plan, that says here's how we are going to get \u2013 here are the specific projects and here's how we're going to get our growth margins to the level that \u2013 then, we need for it to start contributing to the bottom line. So, it isn't \u2013 it's more than we hope it will get there. There's very specific things we know we have to do and executing to get those margins up there just like we did in water purification.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. That's helpful. Thanks. And just on the Chinese water heater market, I know it's tough to regauge this. But can you talk a little about what you're seeing in terms of the replacement market there. We're getting to the lifetime expectancy of some of these water heaters and kind of what that might add to growth going forward. Are you seeing much of it today?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","We are \u2013 I'll take a shot. Then, John, you can jump in \u2013 from \u2013 again, there isn't any real good data, but they have reasonable data in terms of our own warranty cards and things being returned, so where people tell us where we ask the question as to the need for replacement or not. And in the largest cities, we think the replacement is around 50% and, in the smaller cities, probably 30% to 35%. That's the kind of range that we are seeing from the somewhat limited dataset that we have.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","(51:49) about comfort level from the standpoint, Charlie, that when we talk about the market \u2013 the water heater market growing at 7%, we think that's going to contribute to that.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","And also, what we also see is that the \u2013 since the A. O. Smith is at the kind of the top of the food chain as a high-end brand, it's an aspirational brand. So, when people replace lower-end products, very often, they upgrade to the higher-end brands which is our brand.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just quickly, the 17% organic growth in China, how much of that was from expanded distribution versus kind of same-store sales?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","We did expand our distribution, but I really \u2013 we don't have a good way of really measuring that. We've tried to do same-store sales, but we've had difficulty because we're continually opening stores and we're continually closing stores that are inefficient, et cetera.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on our 2015 fourth quarter and full year results conference call. With me, participating on the call, are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","Also, in respect of others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Ajita, who will begin his remarks on slide 3.","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you, Pat and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 2015 was another excellent year for A.O. Smith, setting records for sales and earnings. We continued to see healthy end markets for U.S. commercial water heaters, our Lochinvar branded products, and our consumer products in China. We believe our organic growth outshines almost all other industrial companies.","Here are a few highlights. Organic growth in both of our segments drove sales nearly 8% higher to a record $2.54 billion. Excluding the impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar against the Canadian and Chinese currencies, our sales grew over 9% in 2015. Despite being a sales record, this was lower than our previous estimate for the year as our year-over-year U.S. residential water heater volumes declined in the second half of the year, similar to the industry. China sales were up over 16% in local currency. Record net earnings of $3.16 per share were 30% higher than our adjusted earnings per share of $2.43 in 2014.","We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion to return to shareholders. We repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares for $128 million during the year. We increased our dividend by 26% earlier this week, following the similar increase one year ago. And during 2015, we returned almost $200 million to our shareholders.","John will now describe our results in more detail beginning with slide 4.","John Kita","Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the full year of $2.54 billion were 7.7% higher than the previous year. Net earnings of $283 million improved 28% from 2014. As shown on slide 5, net earnings of $3.16 per share improved 30% compared with adjusted earnings per share of $2.43 in 2014. Sales in our North America segment of $1.7 billion increased 5% over 2014, driven by price increases in the U.S. and Canada for residential and commercial water heaters and higher volumes of commercial water heaters and condensing commercial boilers in the U.S.. Based on our shipments, we expect residential water heater industry volumes in the U.S. to decline by approximately 300,000 units in 2015.","Rest of world segment sales of $866 million increased 13% compared to 2014. China sales increased $95 million, driven by higher demand for water heaters and approximately $35 million of incremental sales of A.O. Smith branded water treatment products. Our newly launched in-home air purifier products added approximately $9 million to China sales.","On slide 7, North America operating earnings of $340 million were 34% higher than adjusted segment operating earnings in the previous year, and operating margin of 20% was significantly above the 15.6% adjusted operating margin one year ago. Pricing actions in the U.S. and Canada, higher sales of Lochinvar branded products and commercial water heaters in the U.S. and lower steel costs contributed to the significantly improved segment performance. The impact of profits from lower residential volumes in the U.S. partially offset these favorable factors.","Rest of world operating earnings of $113 million improved 6% compared with 2014. Higher sales and lower steel costs were partially offset by lower sales of highly profitable commercial water heaters in China and increased selling, general, and administrative expenses. Segment operating earnings were reduced by approximately $2.5 million due to China currency translation.","Higher selling and promotion cost to support expansion in tier 2 and tier 3 cities and our e-commerce platform in China as well as higher development and advertising costs associated with the 2015 launch of air purification in China were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses. As a result of those factors, 2015 segment operating margin of 13% was lower than the 13.9% operating margin in 2014.","Our corporate expenses declined from the adjusted corporate expenses the prior year, primarily as the result of higher interest income. Our effective income tax rate during 2015 of 29.7% was higher than the previous year due to a change in our geographic earnings mix. Sales in the fourth quarter of $639 million were 2% higher than the previous year and below our expectations. Lower U.S. residential water heater volumes and weaker U.S. boiler sales contributed to less organic growth than we expected.","Excluding the unfavorable translation impact from the weaker Canadian and China currencies of approximately $13 million, sales grew 4%. Net earnings of $80 million was 39% higher than fourth quarter adjusted earnings of 2014. As shown on slide 9, net earnings of $0.90 per share improved 41% compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 in 2014. Sales in our North America segment of $414 million declined 4% over 2014. Price increases in the U.S. and Canada for residential and commercial water heaters and higher volumes of commercial water heaters were more than offset by lower volumes of U.S. residential water heaters and approximately $5 million unfavorable currency impact in Canada.","Sales of Lochinvar branded products were flat in the quarter. Industry volumes of residential and commercial boilers declined in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with the previous year. We believe warmer weather at the beginning of the heating season may have negatively impacted residential boiler volumes and longer lead times for commercial projects may have negatively impacted the commercial boiler industry.","Rest of world segment sales of $232 million increased 14% compared with 2014. China sales increased 19% in local currency, driven by higher demand for water heaters and water treatment products. Seasonally strong air purifier sales added over $5 million to China sales. Higher China sales were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of approximately $8 million.","On slide 11, North America operating earnings of $92 million were 30% higher than adjusted segment operating earnings in the previous year and operating margin of 22.3% was significantly above the 16.4% adjusted operating margin one year ago. Pricing actions in the U.S. and Canada, higher sales of commercial water heaters, and lower steel contributed to the significantly improved segment performance. The impact to profits from lower residential volumes in the U.S. partially offset these favorable factors.","Rest of world operating earnings of $29 million improved 27% compared with 2014. Higher sales and lower steel and advertising costs, all in China and smaller losses in India were partially offset by increased selling expenses in China. Segment operating earnings were reduced by over $1 million due to current China currency translation.","Fourth quarter 2015 operating margin of 12.3% improved from the 11% operating margin in 2014. Our corporate expenses declined from the adjusted corporate expenses the prior year, primarily as a result of higher interest income. Fourth quarter results included approximately $3 million or $0.03 per share of income tax benefits primarily associated with the recently approved extension of the research and development tax credit in the U.S. and additional R&D tax benefits in China.","Cash provided by operations during 2015 was $344 million, compared with $264 million provided in 2014, driven primarily by higher earnings and smaller outlays for working capital in the 2015 period. We exceeded our 2015 cash flow estimate by approximately $50 million, as a result of lower capital spending as well as improvements in working capital.","Our liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 15% at the end of 2015. We have cash balances totaling approximately $650 million located offshore and our net cash position was approximately $400 million at the end of December.","During 2015, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock for a total of $128 million under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan. At it's December meeting, our Board increased its authorized share available for repurchase by 2 million shares. Considering this increase, we had approximately 2.6 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of December.","This morning, we announced our 2016 EPS guidance to be between $3.40 and $3.55 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 10% increase in EPS compared with our 2015 results. Please turn to slide 14 for several 2016 assumptions.","We expect our cash flow from operations in 2016 to be approximately $320 million which is less than 2015, primarily related to expected higher outlays for working capital this year compared with 2015. We expect capital expenditures to be between $120 million and $130 million in 2016 and higher than the $73 million spent in 2015. Due to the strong growth of our water treatment business in China, we will reach the capacity of our existing lease facility in the next few years.","Our 2016 capital spending plans include approximately $40 million related to construction of a new water treatment manufacturing and air purification assembly facility in China. Total cost for the facility are expected to be approximately $65 million and it will be completed in early 2018. In addition, we expect to complete capacity expansion of two North America plants in 2016 at a cost of approximately $7 million.","Our 2016 capital spending plan also includes approximately $8 million to support the ERP implementation. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2016.","We successfully completed our first two ERP go-live milestones in August 2014 and May 2015. We expect to convert the majority of our North American plan sites by the end of 2016. ERP implementation expenses were approximately $16.5 million in 2015 and are projected to be approximately $25 million in 2016. Higher than the previous year due to larger number of scheduled go-live events in 2016. Approximately $4 million of incremental ERP cost is expected to incur in the first quarter, with the remainder primarily in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2016, higher than the $43 million in 2015, primarily due to expected lower interest rates than last year on cash deposits in China. Pension income is expected to be approximately $7 million in 2016 compared with zero in 2015. Costs associated with our replacement retirement plan are about $6 million in both years.","Our effective tax rate is expected to be between 30.5% and 31%, higher than the 29.7% rate experienced in 2015 due to a change in our geographic earnings mix. We expect to continue to repurchase shares at a value equal to our free cash flow after dividends for approximately $150 million in 2016 which is consistent with our stated policy to maintain our net cash balance at approximately $350 million. As such, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares for the year will be between 87.5 million and 88 million shares.","I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the business assumptions in our 2016 outlook and our growth strategy, beginning on slide 15. Ajita?","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you, John. We expect our businesses will collectively grow between 9% and 10% in local currency terms and between 7% and 8% in U.S. dollars in 2016. The assumptions for currency underlying our organic growth forecast are at current rates. We expect steel prices will remain at current levels, as global demand remains soft and capacity utilization remains slow.","Some comments specific to our North American segment. We expect four months of pricing benefit in 2016 as the 2015 price increase in the U.S. will anniversary in late April. We expect U.S. residential water heater volumes will grow by 100,000 to 150,000 units in 2016, primarily as a result of new construction. We expect U.S. commercial water heater volumes will be modestly higher after strong growth in 2015.","Due to the significant pre-buy which occurred in the first quarter of 2015, the first quarter of 2016 will be a difficult comparison for U.S. residential water heater volumes. After double-digit volume declines in the U.S. commercial condensing boiler industry in October and November, industry volumes grew 10% in December. We see this positive trend continuing in our business in January.","The continuing transition to condensing boilers and new product introductions give us comfort to project Lochinvar branded sales growth of 10% in the first quarter of 2016, as well as for the full-year. Recall that our Lochinvar branded sales are seasonally skewed to the second half of the year which coincides with the heating season.","The water heaters we sell in Canada are manufactured in the U.S.. The Canadian dollar weakness is expected to result in a significant product cost increase to our Canadian operations in 2016 which is only partially offset by announced price increases. The magnitude of this headwind is in excess of $5 million. These factors, in addition to the assumptions John discussed earlier, lead us to expect our North America segment operating margin will be between 20% and 21% in 2016.","Now, some comments specific to the rest of world segment. We're committed to our business in India. We remain optimistic about the long term opportunity in the country with the second-largest population and the second fastest growing economy in the world and its developing middle class who desire quality-of-life products.","India is an investment for the future and the $8 million to $9 million loss which we expect in 2016 is similar to 2015 and includes higher promotion and advertising costs related to brand building, as well as the expansion of our water treatment product distribution to six cities in 2016 from two cities in 2015. We expect to combined sales of water heaters and water treatment products in India to be greater than $20 million in 2016, an increase from 2015 sales of nearly $16 million.","We're a consumer products Company in China which distinguishes us from most industrial companies operating in China. The Chinese consumer demonstrated resilience in 2015. We have three growth drivers underpinning our China business which give us confidence to project an annual growth rate of approximately 15% in local currency for 2016.","The first driver is overall market growth which we believe has impacted by household formation and a growing replacement market. A proxy we use to project their potential for water heater market growth is the growth in the consumption portion of GDP. We have seen independent forecasts, including one from the IMF which project China consumption growth between 7% and 8% in 2016. With continued urbanization, growth in the middle class and a growing replacement and upgrade market, we expect supportive market growth to continue for quite some time.","The second growth driver is market share gains and increases in average price. We have a strong market position by value in the electric wall-hung category. Our position in gas tankless, while a leader, is less than 20% by value and we see opportunity to gain more share with our well-respected and patented super quiet models and as our newly launched high-rise models gain acceptance. Our commitment to engineering resources will continue to result in new products with features and benefits in which consumers see value and for which they are willing to pay an incrementally higher price. This results in a favorable mix impact.","The third growth driver is fast-growing ancillary product categories, the most significant example of which is water treatment. A.O. Smith branded water treatment products achieved sales of $110 million in 2015, up from $75 million in 2014, an added 5 percentage points of growth in each of the last three years. After successfully launching the A.O. Smith branded in-home air purifiers last year, we expect sales to more than double to approximately $20 million. The combination of A.O. Smith branded water treatment and air purifiers incremental sales is expected to add almost 5 percentage points of growth this year.","The last two growth drivers are primarily in our control and as we continue to invest behind them. The first is a function of the growing replacement market and household formation. Combining these three growth drivers give us confidence that we will grow approximately 15% in local currency in 2016. We expect rest of world segment operating margin in 2016 will be similar to last year's margin of 13%.","One final comment on China, the recent declines in the China stock market and value of the Yuan are unprecedented and we acknowledge the concerns of the investment community surrounding our China business. While it is not our practice to discuss monthly results, recent trends might add some perspective, given that the latest macro events in China materialized in mid-December.","In local currency, the average of our daily shipments in January increased over 15% year-over-year. Please also remember that the first quarter is typically our lightest China sales quarter, due to the New Year travel holiday in February. The Spring Festival in February.","Please move on to slide 16. Especially in these volatile and uncertain economic times, we believe our long term annual 8% organic growth potential and our stable defensive replacement markets which we believe represent over 85% of North American water heater and boiler volumes, positively differentiates A.O. Smith among other industrial companies. Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks and now we will take your questions. As Pat mentioned earlier, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. Please also note that John and I are in different locations and we will do our best to coordinate our answers to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Ryan Connors from Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is now open. ","Ryan Connors","I wanted to ask two different questions about China. One has to do with your cash position there, Ajita, and there has been some talk lately about, in light of all the issues, China reinstituting some of the capital controls, in particular clamping down on corporate profits leaving the country. How does that impact your view of your cash position there? Are there enough investment opportunities in China, given the environment, or should we look at that as kind of stranded cash?","Ajita Rajendra","Why don't I give a general comment and then let John talk specifically about the cash. I was in China last week, and as you know, I go there very often. It's interesting that all of the talk that we hear about China in terms of the stock market and all of the things happening -- the people on the street, that is not even a topic of conversation. They are looking at different drivers and different things.","I met with customers, I met with obviously a lot of people in our workforce. I had dinner with the ex-dean of the business school at Nanjing University. The focus and discussion are on very different topics. So things like this, they are not really -- it's not a topic of conversation within China. Specifically on stranded cash, obviously that topic wouldn't come up, but we don't have too many concerns about that. John, maybe you want to address it directly.","John Kita","Ryan, it's clearly one of the things they are talking about is capital controls. We have in the past -- we took out about $100 million out of China in 2014. We certainly have uses of cash in China. As we talked about, we\u2019re going to be adding the water treatment and air purification plant. We're looking at opportunities, always, to expand our product lines, as we did with air purification and water treatment both four or five years ago. So we will obviously continue to monitor the situation.","Ryan Connors","And then my follow-up was to do with China, also. I realize it's sensitive to comment on competitor moves, but it looked like General Electric's appliance business may end up in the hands of one of your notable competitors in China. Obviously, they've got a respected American brand like you do, so I wondered if you could just comment for us on how you view that potential development in the competitive landscape there, and whether that has a potential to disrupt anything competitively? Thank you.","Ajita Rajendra","Let me take that, John. I don't think so, because first of all, GE has been in the business for a while and obviously the GE brand name is very, very well-respected here. They have -- they essentially make heat pump water heaters. It's a very limited line and haven't had a huge impact on the marketplace.","Now Haier is a competitor; they are a very good company, also. They are a strong competitor in China. We have been gaining share from them in China. They have the capability of much broader product development. But again, it's early to tell. But it's not something at this point we're concerned about. Haier has -- when you look at the hierarchy of products at Haier, water heaters comes very low, and there is limited capacity that is available right now with the GE product line. We're not concerned about it, but it's something we're watching.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady from SunTrust. Your line is now open. ","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Patrick standing in for Charlie. Just looking at U.S. residentials -- obviously you added some color there, so thanks a lot for that. Once you knew what the outlook was for 2016, was any of the weakness that you saw -- obviously, you said back-half was weak. Was that mostly macro-related or was there any due to the pull-forward of the pricing increase in April? And if so, is there a quantification of that or just any color on that would be great.","John Kita","Our best estimate, if you go back to the end of 2014, the fourth quarter compared to 2013, that was up about 180,000 units, fourth-quarter 2014 versus 2013. Our guess -- and it is a guess -- is that a healthy portion of that was pre-buy, because it was already out that NAECA was coming and there was going to be some discontinued lines. There was going to be some effect on some of the multi-family units, et cetera.","So when we look back at it, we estimate it could have been as high as 150,000 units of pre-buy last year. When you incorporate that with the fact that completions were only up about 80,000 this year, you come up with the delta of about 220,000, explanation [ph] of the 300,000 units. We certainly have seen some of our customers reduce their safety stock because everybody now is delivering on time. So we think the combination of those two is the reason that it's down. We will obviously continue to monitor 2016 as it goes forward.","Unidentified Analyst","And just one question, I guess my follow-up is on the steel costs. How much of the margin increase in both your reported segments were attributable to these improvements -- declining steel costs for you guys?","John Kita","We haven't quantified that. As we said earlier, it's really -- the margin improvements really came from three different areas. Commercial was very strong. We put price increases in earlier in the year on NAECA product, on non-NAECA product, and on commercial. We also put price increases in, in Canada. The third component, if you will, is lower steel costs. It's a combination of all three of those that are contributing to the improved margins.","Unidentified Analyst","Would you say that they are on the list then? Or -- in terms of the improvement or is that fairly high up there? I want to get a good gauge of what that number could be?","John Kita","Pricing and steel were obviously the biggest ones.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka from BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open. ","Kevin Maczka","Two questions for me. If I can go back and revisit this pre-buy in North American resi volumes. John, I thought I heard you say that 2015 finished down about 300,000 units. You see up about 100,000 to 150,000 units in 2016. So over that two-year period, we're net down. I guess my first question does that, again, all relate back to that pre-buy and that hard comp from Q4 2014? Or is there something else going on, maybe share-wise? Because it seems like, with the construction up cycle and so much of this replacement, that over a two-year period we would still be positive?","John Kita","Well, it's not share. I would say our share was very consistent over the time period, so it was not share. Certainly, we're estimating some numbers. It's very possible this year, because of the downturn in 2015, could be closer to 200,000 up. We're just monitoring it. What we had, Kevin, is a significant increase in the industry from 2012, where it was 8.1 million units, up to 9.2 million units in 2014. Part of that was helped by new construction, but certainly part of it was helped by replacement. So it's really hard for us, quite frankly, to tell you within 100,000 or 200,000 units or within 2% of a 9.2 million units, what the exact number is.","Ajita Rajendra","Kevin, like you are saying, I hope we're being a little conservative.","Kevin Maczka","Right. Just to follow up on that, as we look out into Q1 in the first half -- I know you are not usually commenting on monthly progression here, but we saw industry numbers down double digits in Q4. Is that your expectation again going into Q1? Or should that start to normalize like your China business had?","John Kita","I think, clearly -- and we said it on the call last year -- 2015 first quarter, because of the significant price increase, the industry was up 300,000 units or so. And we certainly don't expect that to happen. I think -- as I looked at the history, the last couple of years, I would think we're going to approach more like the 2014 distribution by quarter. That would seem to be more sense for me -- maybe a little lighter in the fourth quarter because of the pre-buy. But otherwise, I think that's the more normalized distribution than what we had last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is now open. ","Robert McCarthy","So maybe you can just comment first on -- boiling down for 2016 -- because we have a lot of issues going around, obviously the carryover of pricing which you elucidated and then obviously some incremental pricing and then the volumes. But is there a way to break down, basically on a consolidated basis, what you expect on a percentage basis from volume and from price in 2016 or a range?","John Kita","Again, I think the best estimate for volume would be what I just said from the standpoint of residentials, our biggest business. I think that, that distribution in 2014 is probably reasonably representative. From a price standpoint, as we said in the call, we're about -- certainly through the end of April, we would certainly think we're going to see significant price, year over year. And then it starts leveling off after that, because that's when the price increases went in. If you look at our ownership since we've had Lochinvar, 2012, the distribution of our earnings has been 48%, 52%, first half, second half; and I guess as a high level, that is not in an reasonable estimate.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. And then, maybe you can just comment and just add to some of your comments around Lochinvar. Obviously, you saw a weakness in the fourth-quarter, but you saw some nice trajectory and exit rate. But just give some narrative around what undergirds your confidence there, given the change in regulatory standards? Or the progression that's going on there on the products that you think supports a 10% organic growth rate, there?","John Kita","A couple things. October and November were double -- the industry was down double digits; we were down about half that. And then we did see a decent recovery in the industry in December. As for us, if you look at the entire Lochinvar for the year, they were up about 7%. But when you take out China -- and the sales to China were about $4 million and we've talked about not only our China business struggling, commercial in China, but also Lochinvar.","You take out the Canada shortfall and quite frankly, from a competitive standpoint, because we're competing against some competitors in Canada and the currency has moved so much, it's more difficult. You take those two out and they were up about 10%, even with the fourth quarter. So when we looked at December and we look at where we're projecting for the first quarter -- up about 10% -- we're comfortable with the full-year growth of 10%, year over year.","Ajita Rajendra","And also comfortable with what we've always been saying in the longer-term conversion from non-condensing to condensing. You're going to have these short-term blips, but that longer-term trend and trajectory is solid.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Your line is now open. ","Jeff Hammond","Just a couple things back on North America. So you mentioned safety stocks coming down. Just maybe assess what your customers are telling you in general about inventory levels and specific to pre-buy overhang? And then, just on mix around the NAECA standard -- have you seen people trading down as a result of the higher pricing, particularly at the 55 gallon-plus level?","John Kita","Safety stock, we've just finished sales meetings and the input we got from the salespeople is, the inventory levels of our customers are reasonable, but as you've seen in the whole industrial landscape in the fourth quarter, the demand has been relatively weak. We have seen an improvement in our normal ordering patterns in December and January, but I'd say we're not quite normal yet. But I think we're on the right trajectory.","I was just going to answer the second one. The trading down -- Jeff, I don't know. If you're talking about the discontinued electrics, in effect what we've probably seen happen there is, the commercial business has been strong in the 55-gallon to 90-gallon range. So one of two things probably happened either residential customers -- that were buying those residential units in that size now are buying commercial; or commercial customers that were buying the residential in that size are now buying commercial. That's one of the explanations on why commercial has been better. And could they be trading down? Certainly, it's a possibility to a smaller size, if you will.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. And just quickly on the Lochinvar comment about longer lead times. Is that a function of macro uncertainty? Some slowing in commercial construction? Or is it something different?","John Kita","As we've talked to people, you would say it probably is due to macro uncertainty, but we don't know. The engineers are -- our customers are very busy; it's just the release of the projects weren't happening as quickly as they normally do. I don't know if that's financing; I don't know -- other macro issues. But again, we view it as probably only a temporary blip, because the good news is the engineers appear very busy.","Ajita Rajendra","Also, just to add some color to that -- this is more anecdotal than quantitative -- but I was at ASHRAE and I know many of you were at the ASHRAE show. Talking to customers, they feel pretty good about 2016 and where business is going to be.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. Your line is now open. ","Mike Halloran","Just thinking about the FX commentary and splits by division -- I think it was $5 million or so headwind, I think you said for the Canadian dollar impact to North America. So is it fair to think about 1 point of headwind in North America and then more like 4-ish for the rest of the world?","John Kita","In the fourth quarter, it was $5 million for Canada and about $8 million for China. What we're estimating, based on current rates now, what 2016 headwinds could be, is closer to $40 million for China over 2015. And maybe another $15 million or so for Canada for the year, top line.","Mike Halloran","Perfect. That's exactly what I was looking for. And then, on the China side, maybe you could just talk about the new product curve, as you see it through 2016, here? Anything interesting coming on the water purification -- I'm sorry, water filtration or the air purification side?","Ajita Rajendra","Yes. I feel very good about the new products. Like I said at the early part of the call, I was in China last week. We have an interesting slate of new products coming out. I don't want to be specific in terms of either new stuff that they haven't introduced yet. But the pace of new product introduction, the pace of innovation in bringing truly new things to the market as opposed to cosmetic changes -- because we do both -- There is some interesting new stuff that's coming out In water treatment.","In air purification, we had essentially two SKUs. We had one SKU that we came out with in April; and another one, a smaller size which we introduced around October. Those two SKUs had $9 million of sales last year which again shows the power of the brand in the right categories with the right products, even though they were only two SKUs. We will be expanding that line also in 2016. I feel very good about the new products that are in the pipeline.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of William Bremer from Maxim Group. Your line is now open. ","William Bremer","First question I just want to get a clarity on -- did you mention earlier that air purification contributed $5 million in revenue this quarter?","John Kita","Yes, it was around $5 million in the fourth quarter, $9 million for the year.","William Bremer","Okay. Second question, can you give us a little more granularity in terms of the replacement market in China and how large that is for you at this time?","John Kita","All we can look at is based on our surveying data, et cetera. We have seen, in our estimation, that increase over the last two to three years -- which is logical, right? We have been selling in some sort of magnitude for the last 10, 12 years. Our units last on average about 8 or 9 years and we think it is probably longer than our competitors. So in tier 1 cities specifically, we have seen an increase in replacement. Our estimate would be, it would be approaching 50% or so, based on our data. But we don't quite have the data we do in the U.S., where you can -- everybody is reporting and you can take new construction and subtract it to get replacement. It's logical it's increasing. We would expect it is.","William Bremer","Very fine top line performance in China. No doubt. Just want to get a sense of your feeling of the inventory that's in the channel there, right now?","John Kita","We're comfortable as we look compared to the year. I think the distribution by quarter was pretty reasonable, so I think we're comfortable where we're from an inventory standpoint. I don't know, Ajita, if you heard anything different when you were there last week?","Ajita Rajendra","No. I think says it. It's about where we should be. In the past we have expressed some concerns that it was a little high, as we did, I think, about one year ago. Right now, I would say we're where we should be. And like I mentioned, we don't normally talk about monthly results, but what we saw in January was the type of increase that we like to see for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Your line is now open. ","Bhupender Bohra","My question is around rest of the world margins, here, like we have spoken -- Ajita, we've spoken about. We have seen -- we have been hovering around 13% margins. Where do we see the rest of world? The China margins go forward, here? I think if you'll go back in 2014, we have hit 15% number here. If you can just give some color on that? And what would be the inflection point where we see from 13% to go to that next level of 14%, 15%, mid-teens margins, here?","Ajita Rajendra","If you look at -- a lot of it is driven by China. A lot of it is driven by what type of investments we also are making. At this point in time -- and when I say point in time I am taking a fairly -- you know, 12 to 18 month time frame -- we're investing in India, in terms of brand building. Again, in India we're following the same type of similar playbook as we did in China which is heavy investment in the brand and then following it up with categories in which we're strong -- products and categories in which we have strength. So we're investing behind the brand in India. We talked about what we expect in India.","In China, we're investing in a new category that we're getting into which is air purification. We're continuing to invest heavily behind water purification even though we have a $100 million-plus business. Again -- and for the last few months in China, we have been the leaders in that category, in terms of market share. But, we continue to invest heavily behind it to really solidify our position as being the leaders in that category, because for 20 years we were a water heater guy and now we're a water guy and now we're getting into air purification.","So we're expanding that brand and that takes heavy investment. Also, we're investing in terms of getting into those second and third tier cities. The smaller cities. So there is a heavy amount of investment going on right now. There has always been a question of, can we see more leverage in China for the increased volume? Yes, at this point in time we're investing a lot of that back into new products and new distribution and new categories.","John, you want to add any color to that?","John Kita","You are right. From the standpoint of China, margins have come down a little bit. They were about mid-teens this year, about 15%, down a little bit from 2014. I think there are a couple things driving that, that Ajita talked about. I think the core businesses -- electric, gas, water treatment -- doing very well. But we're investing in air purification and will have a larger loss next year than this year as we grow the distribution platform. Commercial -- we've talked about, had a difficult year this year. That had a negative effect on China's margins and rest of world. And quite frankly, there's other businesses we're incubating that had larger losses, like combi boilers, where we think that's an important market in the future and we're committing to engineering.","We're very comfortable, but the anticipation is down the road. Certainly it's to grow these margins and also to improve our profitability in India. So it's not going to happen overnight, but that is certainly an objective down the road.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Rose from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. ","David Rose","I just wanted to have a question on China and there is an embedded question within that and then I have a follow-up. On China, just on the margin side -- to be clear, what was the change in the advertising spend year on year?","John Kita","I think as we talked last year, the margins were negatively impacted because we were running a fair amount of CCTV advertising for water treatment. We did not have that this year. That was a pretty significant contributor to the improvement in the margins year over year in the fourth quarter. That was the major delta, is just we did not have that advertising on national television. And we kind of talked about in the past, these advertising spends can vary quarter to quarter and I think we outlined that last year in the fourth quarter. We did see better improvement in China margins this year than last.","David Rose","Okay; and then the question on margins for China for 2017 is -- if you open up the facilities, do you have under-absorption in factory in your fixed costs, depressing margins? Should we think about it that way in 2017?","John Kita","I don't think we would expect significant -- obviously we'll avoid some of the lease costs we have, et cetera and we're going to be able to be at a decent occupancy. To be honest, I have not -- it's really 2018 that -- it's going to open early 2018. I have not done a lot of analysis of that. But I wouldn't expect it is going to have a huge effect.","Ajita Rajendra","Also, I think it's fair to say that we have ongoing -- because we always have been expanding. We expanded our factory, opened the new factory, October -- year ago October. We've expanded that facility right now; we haven't moved into it yet. We always have more capacity than we need in some areas and we're filling it up very quickly and building new factories and moving in. So I don't think -- as John said, I don't think you're going to see an unusual under-absorption level in the next couple of years.","David Rose","And then the follow-up question was a housekeeping one, the other income was up meaningfully from Q3. Can you just clarify what that was?","John Kita","I would have to look, but I know year over year it was interest income. When we saw that China could potentially lower rates, we laddered some volatile while away, but that will be expiring towards the end of this year -- towards the end of 2015. And that's why we said corporate expense goes up next year; interest income will be down, I think, $4 million or something from year over year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is now open. ","Robert McCarthy","Yes, one follow up. Just wanted to talk about the margin outlook for North America. What goes into that aside from just the anniversarying of the price increase and how we see it playing out? Should we think about some core operating leverage on the basis of that? Obviously, if you look at the implied run rate, it's around the 21% range through 2Q through 4Q. Any kind of dynamics about how you're going to achieve that? And tentatively your confidence level in achieving that, would be helpful?","John Kita","I think what we've done the last two quarters is above that, but that's been driven by mix as much as anything -- commercial and Lochinvar which is our highest margin product lines, certainly contribute to that; and resi being weaker. But I think there is puts and takes. Obviously, steel will probably be a benefit this year. On the other hand, we talked about the Canadian currency issues. That is going to be a negative. And then the other thing that ends up in the play in North American margins is, SAP is going to be up about $8.5 million to $9 million. That and the currency are probably the biggest factors on why there is a little bit of headwind from that standpoint.","Robert McCarthy","Ajita, do you have any other thoughts on that or not?","Ajita Rajendra","No, I think that hits it. Because one of the things we didn't talk about a lot is the fact that the SAP, the ERP is going to be that much higher in 2016 over 2015.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady from SunTrust. Your line is now open. ","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Patrick again. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I wanted to touch a little bit on the online sales from China that you guys mentioned a little bit briefly. What was the level in 2015 versus 2014? And if I'm not mistaken, these higher-margin sales, right? And do you have any expectations for that number, in terms of 2016?","John Kita","It was about $140 million. It was higher than what we thought it would be when we put out our projections. That compares to what -- $55 million or something last year. It's hard to say a higher margin. We would say at least as good a margin, but we're putting a fair amount back into advertising, et cetera, in development of that channel. So that is certainly the case. We would expect that's going to grow. I think right now their estimate is about 20% to 25% growth over where it was. But that is certainly becoming an important channel for us.","Unidentified Analyst","And one very quick question about India. The $8 million to $9 million loss expected for 2016 on -- I think you said $20 million of it expected?","John Kita","Yes, we said over $20 million and we had about $16 million. What's happening in India is, we're making improvements on the water heater side. We still have a ways to go. But as we talked in the release, here, we're expanding our water treatment. We think that's a potentially large market for us and to enter a market like that is going to take a decent amount of investment from an advertising, distribution, expansion, et cetera, standpoint. So water heaters is improving and we're spending more on water treatment, ending up about the same point.","Unidentified Analyst","Actually, my question was at what sales level will we be able to have a breakeven number?","John Kita","On the water heater side, I think we've talked about in the past, it's about a $15 million business. Our expectation is to be a $30 million business. Somewhere around there would be a breakeven. I have the number for water treatment, but I can't recall it. It's probably a similar type of number. Maybe a little bit less.","Operator","Ms. Ackerman, I'm showing no further questions at this time. Please proceed with any further remarks you may have.","Patricia Ackerman","Thank you all for joining us today. Please take note that we will be at the Wedbush Sustainability Conference on March 9 and the BB&T Industrials Conference on March 23.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the conference over to Ms. Patricia Ackerman, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ma'am, you may begin.","Patricia K. Ackerman","Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2013 conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we are providing non-GAAP measures, which include -- which are adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted segment operating earnings that exclude certain items, as well as nonoperating pension costs consisting of interest costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and curtailments. Prior year results are provided on a comparable basis.","Ajita, I will now turn the call over to you.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 2013 was an excellent year for A. O. Smith. We continue to see the benefits in our performance from the housing recovery in the U.S. and our expanding consumer business in China, an outstanding execution by our operations worldwide. Here are a few highlights.","Our organic growth drove sales 11% higher to a record $2.2 billion. Sales of A. O. Smith-branded products in China exceeded our expectations and increased 26% compared with 2012. Our adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.06 per share set a record and were 32% higher than the $1.56 per share recorded last year. Incremental margins associated with higher volumes of water heaters and boilers drove earnings higher.","We celebrated the grand opening of our second water heater factory in China. This factory will increase capacity in the region by 50% when it is fully utilized. We moved production of our fast-growing gas tankless products and added an electric water heater production line to the new factory late in the third quarter.","In April, we announced a 20% dividend increase and a 2-for-1 stock split. In addition, this morning, we announced a 25% dividend increase, and this reflects our confidence in our business.","John will now describe our results in more detail.","John J. Kita","Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the full year of $2.2 billion were 11% higher than the previous year, driven by higher volumes of water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and higher sales of A. O. Smith-branded products in China.","Adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $191.2 million improved 32% from 2012. In 2013, we transferred our residential water heater production from our Fergus, Ontario plant to other North American facilities. As a result of the capacity rationalization, we incurred a pretax restructuring and impairment charge of $22 million in 2013.","Adjusted earnings from continuing operations in 2013 excluded after-tax nonoperating pension costs of $11.9 million, an after-tax gain of $6.8 million related to a settlement with a supplier and an after-tax restructuring and impairment expenses of $16.4 million.","Adjusted earnings from continuing operations in 2012 excluded after-tax pension costs of $4.2 million, an after-tax gain of $16.8 million on the sale of Regal Beloit stock acquired as a result of selling our water business, an after-tax gain of $2.9 million related to a settlement with a supplier and an after-tax gain of approximately $2 million related to an earnout associated with an acquisition.","Adjusted earnings of $2.06 per share improved 32% compared with $1.56 per share last year. A reconciliation from GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included at the end of this presentation and covers the previously discussed adjustments.","Sales in our North America segment of $1.5 billion increased 6% over last year, driven by higher sales of residential and commercial water heaters and boilers in the U.S. Rest of World segment sales of $668 million increased 23% compared with last year, driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products in China and market acceptance of our newer, higher-value A.O. Smith-branded products in China. We continue to innovate our product lines with features and benefits which provide value to our customers and differentiate our brand. We introduced our eighth upgrade to our electric water heater offering in early 2013, and the products have been very well received.","Other innovations launched in late 2012 that contributed a full year benefit in 2013 include an ultra-quiet gas tankless water heater product line and water treatment products which have longer-lasting filters and waste less water. The return on investment in engineering and innovation is one of our key success factors in China.","North America adjusted operating earnings of $238 million were 21% higher than last year, and adjusted operating margin of 15.6% improved almost 2 percentage points. Higher incremental margins associated with increased volumes of water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and lower material costs were the primary drivers of the significant margin expansion.","Rest of World adjusted operating earnings of $88 million improved almost 50% compared with last year. Higher sales and improved mix of A. O. Smith-branded products in China and smaller losses in our non-A. O. Smith-branded water treatment business drove operating earnings higher. This was partially offset by larger losses in India due to higher costs for new product introductions and brand building in the region, as well as currency devaluation.","Segment operating margins of 13.2% improved significantly compared with last year. Our adjusted corporate expenses were $53 million, an increase from the prior year, primarily due to lower interest income, as well as higher expenses related to management incentive programs and acquisition due diligence.","Sales for the fourth quarter of $559 million were 7% higher than the previous year, driven by higher volumes of boilers in the U.S. and higher sales of A. O. Smith-branded products in China.","Adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $48 million improved 11% from 2012 as a result of higher profits in North America and a lower tax rate compared with last year. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations in 2013 excluded after-tax nonoperating pension costs of $2.9 million, and after-tax restructuring and impairment expenses of $2.7 million.","Adjusted earnings from continuing operations in 2012 excluded after-tax pension costs of $1 million, an after-tax gain related to a settlement with a supplier and an after-tax expense of approximately $1.9 million related to the Lochinvar earnout.","Adjusted earnings of $0.52 per share improved 13% compared with $0.46 per share last year. The reconciliation from GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included at the end of this presentation and covers the previously discussed adjustments.","Sales in our North America segment of $382 million were $6 million higher than last year, primarily due to an increase in sales of Lochinvar-branded products. Fourth quarter residential water heater volumes were essentially flat compared with last year as demand was favorably impacted by Superstorm Sandy in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Rest of World segment sales of $185 million increased 18% compared with last year, driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products in China.","North America adjusted operating earnings of $59 million were 5% higher than last year, and adjusted operating margin of 15.4% improved as well. Higher sales of Lochinvar-branded products were the primary driver of the increase in profits and the margin expansion.","Rest of World adjusted operating earnings of $20 million was the same as last year, primarily driven by higher sales in China, which were offset by larger promotion and advertising spending in the region and higher depreciation costs related to the opening of a second manufacturing plant. Despite these additional costs, operating margins in China were in the mid teens, but lower than 1 year ago. As a result, operating margins for the segment fell to 11% from 13%. Recall that our non-branded water treatment business and India are not yet profitable.","Our adjusted corporate expenses were $13 million, slightly higher than last year due to less interest income earned in the current quarter compared to last year.","Cash provided by continuing operations was $282 million in 2013 compared with $172 million last year, primarily driven by higher earnings from operations and significantly lower outlays for working capital.","During the year, we repurchased approximately 1,770,000 shares of common stock at an average cost of $41.62 per share or almost $75 million under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan and in the open market. At the end of the year, we had approximately 1.2 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority from our board.","Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 13% at the end of December. We have sizable cash balances located offshore, and our net cash position was almost $300 million at the end of the year.","We expect our cash flow from operations in 2014 to be between $235 million and $245 million and lower than last year. Even though we expect earnings will improve in 2014, we are expecting higher outlays for working capital in 2014 than in 2013.","Our capital expenditures in 2013 were $98 million, which included approximately $45 million for capacity expansion in China and India to meet growing demand for our water heaters in those regions, as well as approximately $19 million related to our ERP implementation. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $75 million to $85 million in 2014, which includes approximately $20 million to support the ERP implementation.","Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $65 million in 2014 compared with $60 million in 2013.","We estimate our effective tax rate to be between 30% and 31% in 2014 and higher than in 2013. Our effective tax rate of 28% in 2013 was unusually low, primarily due to tax benefits associated with manufacturing and research and development activities, a portion of the 2013 tax benefit related to the 2012 tax year. Our effective tax rate in 2014 will not benefit from the research and development tax credit as they have not been extended beyond their 2013 expiration date.","Excluding the impact from nonoperating pension costs, our corporate and other expenses are expected to be lower in 2014 at about $49 million. The impact from shorter amortization periods for management stock-based compensation is expected to incur in the first quarter of 2014 and result in estimated corporate expense for the quarter of approximately $14 million.","This morning, we announced our adjusted earnings guidance of $2.15 to $2.30 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance represents a 10% increase in pretax earnings and an 8% increase in after-tax earnings compared with our 2013 results.","Nonoperating pension costs are expected to be $0.14 per share in 2014, slightly above the $0.13 per share in 2013. Recall that in 2015, our pension plan will sunset for almost all beneficiaries. We expect this to result in a considerable reduction to our pension costs for 2015.","Our GAAP EPS guidance is $2.01 to $2.16 per share. Our adjusted EPS and our GAAP EPS guidance does not include the impact from future acquisitions.","I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the assumptions in our 2014 outlook, update our 2015 aspirations and reiterate our acquisition strategy.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Thank you, John. This year, we celebrate our 140th anniversary. We think our founder, C. J. Smith, will be very proud of the people, values and performance that embody our company today.","Our outlook for 2014 includes the following assumptions. First, we see strong growth in China, which is expected to increase at a rate of 2x that country's GDP. The team continues to serve our customers and introduce products that enhance our premium brand. In 2013, we consolidated the management of water heating and water treatment in China under one management team. We made significant progress in sales growth as the team achieved over $65 million of sales of water treatment products in 2013 compared with approximately $40 million in 2012. The business achieved breakeven in 2013, excluding acquisition-related amortization costs. Going forward, we will no longer separately call out A. O. Smith-branded product sales from our non-branded products in China.","Second, we expect our Lochinvar brand to continue to benefit from the transition from lower-efficiency non-condensing boilers to higher-efficiency condensing boilers, as well as strong market acceptance of new products like our Lochinvar CREST condensing boiler product line. Lochinvar-branded condensing boilers continue to offer a compelling payback in the form of energy savings, and we have built a reputation for innovation, outstanding product quality and support. As a result, we expect Lochinvar-branded sales to grow approximately 10% in 2014, well ahead of GDP growth in the U.S.","Third, we are cautiously optimistic about the developing recovery in U.S. housing. After a strong industry growth in 2013, helped by improved levels of home completions and significant expansion of the replacement market, we expect residential water heater volumes in the U.S. to be up slightly to be between 8.8 million and 8.9 million units, including tankless units. We expect commercial water heater volumes to be essentially flat at 160,000 units.","Fourth, as we have discussed in the past, 2014 will be negatively impacted by higher costs associated with the new factory in China and approximately $10 million of higher ERP implementation costs. In addition, we expect our effective tax rate will be higher in 2014 than it was in 2013.","Fifth, our brand acceptance in India gained momentum in 2013, resulting in market share improvement of over 14% and our retail footprint expanded to approximately 4,000 outlets. However, the unforeseen continued weakness in the Indian economy and the significant devaluation of the Indian rupee resulted in sales in 2013 of approximately $20 million or at about the same level as 2012, despite sales in local currency increasing by 11%.","We remain optimistic regarding the Indian market, and we are committed to the country with the second-largest population in the world, its developing middle-class and its growing desire for quality of life products. In 2014, we will complete an expansion of our Bangalore facility, which will extend the range of water heaters produced locally and mitigate currency fluctuations, which have challenged the business.","The expansion will also serve as a platform to launch residential water treatment products in India this year. We reviewed a number of entry strategies and decided initially to develop and market our own products, and we will continue to review options that can add value to our customers and shareholders. We expect the entry into the water treatment category and continued investment in brand building activities to offset the expected performance improvement in our water heater business, resulting in losses in 2014 of approximately $5 million or at about the same level as 2013.","Strong performance in our North American segment in 2013 prompted us to update our 2015 aspirations for organic business -- for our organic business. Based on our expectations for EBIT margins driven by new construction and 10% revenue growth of Lochinvar-branded products through 2015, we are revising our North America segment margin expectation to 16% from the previously reported 15.5%.","Our Rest of World segment margin expectation continues to be 13% by 2015, reflecting a continuation of our brand building investments in that region.","We expect organic sales will grow on average 8% per year through 2015, resulting in revenues of over $2.5 billion.","Our earnings aspirations for our existing portfolio of businesses are now expected to be approximately $2.50 per share by 2015 versus the previously disclosed $2.25 per share.","This continues to be an exciting and transformative time for our company. We have cash and borrowing capacity for additional acquisitions, and our pipeline of acquisitions supporting our stated growth strategy to expand our global footprint in water heating and water treatment solutions remains active.","You have seen this slide before. We show it only as a reminder that we will continue to be a financially disciplined acquirer of companies that fit our stated corporate strategy. You should know that while we came close to completing a handful of acquisitions over the past 12 to 18 months, we walked away for various reasons. In the end, we held fast to our financial criteria and are focused on creating return to our shareholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we are open for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charley Brady from BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So I just want to talk about the Rest of World margin, in particular China, it was down this quarter and the aspirations to get it to 13%. Was it impacted this quarter, I guess -- or to what degree was it impacted by the promo spending and some inefficiencies in starting up that new plant? And do those -- you kind of get rid of those inefficiencies and the promo spending as we move to '14 to help the margin up.","John J. Kita","Well, yes, you hit on a couple of the items. One was certainly the advertising. We mentioned in the third quarter that it was artificially low because we were transferring ad agencies for our national television advertising. So that moved approximately $1.5 million to $2 million. The fourth quarter was overstated compared to -- because it was up $3 million to $4 million compared to the third quarter. The second is the plant. I mean, we've consistently said that it will have an impact, and we've said it will be less than 1% of EBIT and that's in the $5 million to $6 million range, and we still expect that to be the case. A little higher in the fourth quarter mainly because of what you alluded to, some startup, et cetera. So it was a little less than $2 million was the effect on the quarter. And then there was also some onetime items associated with adjustments for warranty, et cetera. So we're very comfortable with what China's margins were for the quarter and, certainly, for the year, they were up significantly for the year. And the only impact we see going forward is the plant. But I mean, as we've talked about, if we hadn't built that plant in the fourth quarter we couldn't have produced -- because of the significant increase in demand we experienced this year. So long term, it was clearly the right decision, and short term, it will have some impact.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Just so I'm clear, the fourth quarter impact on the plant of a little less than $2 million, that is -- that is not repeated going forward, it is just a fourth quarter hit, is that correct?","John J. Kita","No, well, it won't be that high going forward, but on an ongoing basis, that will be $5 million to $6 million a year. So about $1 million to $1.5 million a quarter. And that's primarily just higher depreciation and some overhead. If we look into 2014, I think Rest of World margins were a little over 13%, they'll probably be a little under 13% in 2014.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Summerville from KeyBanc.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","This is Joe Radigan on for Matt. Shifting to North America incremental margins, they've been better than expected all year. Obviously, the mix of the strong commercial units you've seen, as well as Lochinvar a factor there, but generally, how should we think about the right operating leverage on revenue growth going forward considering some of the improvements that you made in the factories?","John J. Kita","Well, without a doubt, what's helped us significantly in 2013 is increased volume. The residential industry, we're guessing, was up almost 600,000 units. The commercial industry, we're guessing, was up 9,000 to 10,000 units. And we said all along that when we get that incremental volume, it's going to certainly benefit us. When we look into 2014, we said we would expect to see some improvements from the restructuring. We kind of said about $5 million. We got about $5 million in 2013. We said the total will be about $10 million. So incremental, we'll get about $5 million. We certainly -- as we look into 2014, we'll have incremental volume, which, again, will contribute nicely but it will be offset partially by the higher FAT [ph] costs. In addition, when we look at steel costs, when we look at the average of the current price of the index compared to the average of the index in 2013, steel costs are up about 8%. And so that will have an impact. So all in all, we wouldn't expect much difference in the operating margin of North America year-over-year when all is said and done. I should mention Lochinvar grew over 10% and had a very nice margin increase and it's doing extremely well.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you said industry-wide, residential units were up about 600,000 in your estimation. So I mean, that's significantly more than the delta in housing completions this year, so obviously -- and you've talked about the residential replacement market growing. When you look at your guidance for 2014, what is the home completion number you're using? I guess, what I'm getting at, are you factoring in continued growth in that replacement market, or is it based just on what you think new housing is going to do in 2014?","John J. Kita","It's basically the latter. You're right, the 600,000 was much higher than what we expected. And that comes up with about a 400,000-plus growth in the replacement market in 2013. We've talked about the possibility, as you've alluded to, that happening because if you look at our industry in the late '90s to 2000, it grew significantly with the new housing build, and an average water heater lasts 12 years. So we have said that was a possibility. I don't know if that's the biggest impact this year, but obviously, we were surprised by the growth. So we're guessing the industry was about 8.7 million units for 2013. We're forecasting 8.8 million to 8.9 million, which would represent that the replacement business stays strong but doesn't grow, and that completions are in that 150,000 rate.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if I could just get one more in on China. Revenue was up almost 20% in Q4 despite the tough comp. I think you benefited last year from -- at least from somewhat of a pre-buy ahead of volume-related incentives, I think. Was there anything in there this quarter that pulled demand forward? Or just maybe a little color, because I think that was stronger meaning it increased the -- I think it was stronger than what you were looking for out of China, just maybe some color on what you're seeing there demand-wise.","John J. Kita","It definitely was. I mean, we had a stronger quarter revenue-wise than we thought. When we look at our major customers' inventory, they aren't up significantly compared to what they have been. I think it just attributes to what they've accomplished with the new products they brought out. And we alluded to in the script, we had 3 significant new product introductions that we got a full year benefit in 2014 and -- in 2013, and all of them were very successful.","Operator","And our next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Ajita, John, Pat, can we -- so let me understand the operating margins in the Rest of World. Again, so we get a $2 million hit from the new factory roughly, and that's going to be going forward, about $5 million to $6 million throughout '14. When do you expect that to cease?","John J. Kita","Well, I mean, I think as you get more volume in it, so it will gradually go down as we progress over the next 2 to 3 years, but clearly, you're starting up a new plant with $5 million or so incremental depreciation just by itself that now has to be absorbed.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","And how's pricing there? How's pricing in China?","John J. Kita","Pricing has held up very well in China. We had announced increases in 2011 and 2012. And then I think what we've been able to accomplish is bring out higher-value products with a higher price point, which gives a higher average price. So again, to repeat myself, we are very comfortable with the mid-teen margin that we're experiencing in China. For the year, they're up year-over-year, and they had extremely good year.","Ajita G. Rajendra","I think just to add to that. This is Ajita. The whole formula in -- and business strategy in China just continues to work very well. There's a combination of things that help us there, we have a strong management team, we have a very strong brand and we continue to invest behind the brand. And that's why you saw the added SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter because we were a little light in the third quarter. You saw the margins higher in the third quarter because of that. And we went back and invested heavily in the fourth quarter because we really believe that the continued investment behind the brand is an essential ingredient in the success that we have in China, and we will continue to do that. The new products have been -- as John mentioned, have been very successful, and we have a tremendous pipeline of new products that we've been bringing out, and that has really helped us continue to grow our market share. And we grew our market share in both the water heating business and the water treatment business in China. And it's all of these things together that have helped us considerably outgrow the market in China. And what we did with the new factory is, in anticipation of continued growth, the new factory increases our capacity by -- our capability and capacity by about 50%. And obviously, it won't be full day 1, but we do have the full load of depreciation day 1. And as we fill that factory, we are going to be absorbing those costs, and it's going to become a non-factor as we go along. The lines that we moved in there, some of the lines, the electric line, for example, has also shown considerable productivity improvements because we've been able to lay it out efficiently. The tankless line is about the same because that's essentially an assembly operation, so there isn't quite the opportunity for productivity improvement. So the new factory gives us productivity improvement and additional capacity for growth in the future. So all of it put together is what helps us grow at 20-plus percent -- helped us grow at 20-plus percent last year.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. Let's switch to Lochinvar here. Nice quarter. Can you speak a little bit about the aftermarket there and how that's increased? John mentioned margins up materially year-over-year. And have we rolled it out abroad, or are we making introductions there? What's the status there?","John J. Kita","Well, the aftermarket, I don't have the specific numbers, but clearly, the fourth quarter is traditionally their strongest in the aftermarket, so I would expect that's the case. Their margins, as I said, year-over-year, we published last year, we separated out Lochinvar, I think their operating margins were about 23% last year. Those improved nicely in 2013, so they're doing extremely well. The rollout in China is taking longer than expected. And the primary factor there is getting the approvals, et cetera. We will be introducing the residential side, I think, late this -- I mean, early this year. But the real benefit ultimately will probably on the commercial side, which is taking longer than expected.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","And why is that?","John J. Kita","The primary reason is just getting the licenses, and the licenses required have some requirements to suppliers, et cetera, that we're not able to get at this time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So I would like to get underneath 2 things: the North American resi water volume assumption and the M&A outlook. On the water heater market, is it fair to state that tankless is still about 4% to 5%, which kind of represents, I guess, 480...","John J. Kita","That's roughly 400,000 units.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Right. How many, 400,000?","John J. Kita","400,000 units, yes.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Right. So that would suggest that your -- if we would take that number out of your assumption here, that you're expecting the storage market itself to increase essentially 2.5%.","John J. Kita","The midpoint would be about 150,000 to 175,000 units, but that's if complete.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Right. Whereas residential construction spending is running double-digit and is now apparently starting to move into kitchen and bath areas. I'm just trying to get to -- there's this piece that we've always talked about, there's the replacement market, there's the new and then there's the discretionary, and it seems as if within this assumption, the discretionary has been kind of assumed to be 0.","John J. Kita","Well, what we don't know, Scott -- you're right, I mean, all we're building in is completions. But what we don't know is the replacement\/discretionary, whatever you want to call it, grew over 400,000 units in 2013. And what we're assuming is that's going to stay the same, that, that's going to hold and stay the same. We could be surprised on the upside, I mean, if there's that continued growth. But that was a significant increase year-over-year that -- and we've talked about it that we expect to have some growth in the replacement because of what I alluded to earlier. But they grew by 450,000 units probably in 2013. So we're assuming that's going to hold. Now upside would be that grows.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. Is there any reason why you think that your competitors last week at the HRI show were both saying 5% or better? Do you think that they think that they're going to take share? Or, again, are you -- is it just that you're not considering the discretionary?","John J. Kita","I would say it's the latter. No, all we can be pretty comfortable with is the completions are going to continue to grow, and that's what we built in to our estimate.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. On the M&A side, obviously, it's been quite some time and we've passed on a number of transactions, which I would probably have a chorus of agreement that, that's a good thing. At the same time, you guys have been hitting the pavement now for a while. Just can you kind of size in any way you can what you're comfortable with? The funnel, is it we're looking at several large, multiple small? Because I guess I would have thought at least a couple of smaller ones would've closed by now, or are you not looking at smaller ones? Can you maybe size that for us?","Ajita G. Rajendra","Scott, this is Ajita. Let me put it this way. We are satisfied with what we have in terms of the opportunities we're looking at. The -- whether large or small don't really matter as long as it's strategically relevant and strategically fits. And like I consistently said, we are going to be very disciplined about this process. And we want to make sure that we are in that small minority of acquisitions that actually add value to the buyer in addition to adding value to the seller. So we are being disciplined about our process, happy with the opportunities ahead of us, and nothing has really hit. Like we've said, we've gone to the due diligence stage a number of times but pulled back because it didn't quite fit or we found something. Due diligence did its job, and we found things that we were not -- that we didn't like and we were not happy with.","John J. Kita","The only additional comment I'd make, Scott, is to your size of it. I think we have passed on some smaller ones that just won't have an impact. Because in a lot of ways it's as time-consuming to integrate a small one as a big one. And so we're not actively looking at $10 million to $15 million ones, I'll say, that doesn't mean we won't do it. I think the only other comment I want to make is a good example is India. We talked about our entry into water treatment there. We had looked seriously at opportunities there. And we were just very uncomfortable with the valuations that would have had to have been paid. So at least, starting out, greenfield may have more of a hit to the P&L than if we had made an acquisition. But we think long term, it's going to provide rewards for our shareholders because the all-in costs will be less. So I mean, when we look at acquisitions, we're looking at it compared to greenfield all the time.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Understood. I guess I'm a little bit surprised to hear your comment that you're really not looking at smaller ones. Now I don't know what you mean by smaller, but I guess that surprises me a little bit because it would kind of give a deployment of capital into bringing some balance sheet earnings onto the P&L, so to speak.","John J. Kita","But the example I used was $10 million to $15 million.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair. Here's my last question on this. At what point does the lack of acquisitions start to have the company rethink a little bit more aggressively share repurchasing? And I don't say that in a vacuum. You guys, the balance sheet is so liquid. It doesn't have to be all or none. It can be a balance. When would you expect to maybe rethink where you are on share repurchases, not just what you have on the current authorization remaining, but perhaps something a little bit more balanced with what's been a little bit of a shortfall in M&A activity?","John J. Kita","Well, I think we clearly have thought about it. We purchased back stock of $75 million worth in 2013. We purchased stock back in 2012. So I mean, we've said there's 4 capital allocation options for us. One is organic growth. We're investing in India. We're investing in China. We're investing domestically. The second is M&A, which we actively look at. The third and fourth are returning cash to shareholders. We've had our third consecutive 20-plus percent increase in dividend, and we bought back stock. And I think buying back stock will still be 1 of the 4 that we'll certainly continue to look at.","Operator","And our next question comes from Samuel Eisner from Goldman Sachs.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","When you look at the 26% growth rate in China for this year, can you maybe talk about how that compares to last year and in particular maybe breaking out the difference between pricing and volume or maybe price mix and volume? Just want to understand the components of the growth that you're expecting for '14 and how that performed in '13 as well.","John J. Kita","I don't have the data. I mean, I can make some general statements. Clearly, market share helped. And it was the super quiet growth in the instantaneous market, that helped. That was a contributor. The average selling price of the super quiet is higher, so we got some average selling price benefit there. The electric model we talked about, the increase in price was 4% to 5%. When we brought out that new series 8, that was a benefit because it had value-added features. But that contributed to a higher average selling price and quite frankly, the water treatment grew, as Ajita alluded to, the A. O. Smith-branded more than doubled. So it was a combination of higher price, higher unit sales and higher-watt ancillary businesses like water treatment, combi boilers, et cetera, all of those contributed to the growth. And we also had a distribution growth. We probably went from 5,500 units to about 5,900 units. Now when we turn to 2014, when we talk about the 15%, we won't have those year-over-year benefits for those 3 major product launches that we talked about because we have a full year benefit in 2013. Now what we will have is we expect to still gain market share in both water treatment and the instantaneous. We'll probably grow our distribution outlets some. And more importantly, we'll grow them larger and close some of the non-efficient ones, so the net growth may not be significant but the ultimate growth will benefit. And we expect to still have unit growth because the replacement upgrade market that's happening in China we think will continue to happen. So as we've said, we've grown a lot of different ways in China, and we think that will continue.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","When you think about the cadence at 2014, maybe going through the different quarters here, obviously, you have some very tough comps in the middle part of the year where you're comping against 35% growth rates. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about how you think the year will play out, do you think that 15% is pretty constant throughout the year? Or do you think, obviously, with those tough comps, it's going to be much weaker during the middle part of the year?","John J. Kita","I guess -- I would guess -- I mean, if you look at China and you look how it proceeds during the year, the first quarter is always the weakest quarter because of the spring holiday, spring festival. So that is always the weakest quarter. When we look out throughout the year, so we would kind of still expect the 15% growth, plus or minus a little bit, being pretty consistent across the quarter.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then on the new ERP system, I think you called out $10 million or so in the press release but $15 million on the slides, so I'm just trying to understand the difference in the 2 numbers. And then also, in terms of the payback, I mean what specifically are the investments that you're making in the ERP system, and when do you expect to receive the payback and the timing for that? Just trying to get some more information behind the ERP system.","John J. Kita","To answer the first one is the total cost in 2014 will be $15 million, but we had about $5 million of expense in 2013. So the incremental is about $10 million year-over-year. When we look at payback, this is going to be an ERP system we're putting initially through North America, completely through North America, and as we look at the paybacks, the installments will start kind of third quarter this year and carry into 2015. And we've done internal IRRs, and we expect to pay back this investment, but it really won't start paying back until late 2015 and going forward because that's when the full install will be done.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just lastly, on water treatment, particularly in China. The expectation, obviously, you broke even this year, but is the expectation that you'll be profitable next year in that segment? Just want to understand the year-on-year difference.","John J. Kita","Yes. We had, as we mentioned, we were breakeven before amortization, and amortization was about $3 million. So it lost a little less than $3 million on an operating basis. We would expect that to be total breakeven, i.e. an improvement of $3-plus million. We continue to invest significantly on the SG&A side. There were -- we're in about 2,900 stores for water treatment in China. We expect that to grow by 600 or 700 stores. So we're in that period of rapid growth, but we're reinvesting from an SG&A standpoint. But as an entity, we expect it to be above breakeven even including the amortization next year.","Ajita G. Rajendra","And Sam, I think that, that last point is a key point because what we are driving the water treatment business in China is not to get to profitability as quickly as possible but to make sure that we're making the right investments behind the brand and also, making the promotions and advertising to make sure that the Chinese consumer knows that we are in this new category. And that's -- all of that is what helped us grow market share. But those investments are continuing. And it's all included in the numbers that you're seeing in terms of the profitability of the business. We've been planning to invest for the long term in that business.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And are you expecting another 50% to 60% growth rate in that business from a revenue standpoint?","John J. Kita","If we have a business of $65 million of which we said about $45 million is non-branded and say $20 million is the legacy, we would expect that non-branded to grow by 50% or so, yes. So the $65 million should grow to $85 million or so next year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Molnar from Lorem Ipsum.","Michael Molnar","My question is around the growth of gas heating in China over the next couple of years. And specifically, China is on the cusp of a massive migration from centralized coal heating in many parts of the country to gas heating, given some of the air pollution. About 90% of heating in China is coal-based, and gas heating is only about 3%, most other economies, it's 50% to 70% gas. And my questions to you are the following: Number one, do you see this transition occurring from coal to gas heating in China? And if so, how is AOS positioned to benefit and, specifically, do you have products -- or what is the product plan to take part in this transition? And then number two, can you help quantify the market size and potential growth? I've seen numbers as much as 1.6 million gas-fired wall-hanging furnaces sold in 2013 projected to double by 2016, and will be interested in your view.","John J. Kita","We have -- I don't have data on the space heating market. I'll say we do have products. We have combi boiler products which hit both space heating and potable hot water. It's a relatively small business but it basically doubled last year to over $10 million. So we have that product for the residential side. The products we're talking about for Lochinvar would be residential and commercial boilers for space heating purposes. So we have the products there. And then I think where we very possibly could see some benefits moving off of space heating is we are the market share leader in gas tankless water heating. And as the country moves more to gas, we think we're very well positioned from a tankless product standpoint. So I don't have any of the data on the market size. As we've talked, China has some big migrations. They're going to a consumer driven economy, which will certainly help us as they go to gas. We certainly think we're positioned from a product line. So I think those are some of the benefits we think that are going to help us continue to grow nicely in China.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Wheeler from Buckingham Research.","Edward W. Wheeler - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I wanted to, I guess, probe a little bit on the aspirational margin in Rest of World. I guess I'm hearing progress in India, losses improving at water treatment. You've got a big plant where absorption should be rising, I mean, these are things that normally drive margins quite a bit higher. And I don't quite get how we get -- essentially, I guess the guidance is flat margins through '15. I wonder if you could just fill me in on maybe some other aspects.","John J. Kita","Well, I think I alluded to a little bit earlier, I think Rest of World margin was a little over 13% in 2013. We expect that they'll probably be a little under 13% for 2014, and that's going to be driven primarily by the new plant. We don't expect to see improvement in India because of the investment we're making in the water treatment will offset the investment that we're seeing -- the improvement we're seeing in water heaters. So -- and as Ajita has said before, we're going to continue to invest in the business, and that investment is in the form of promotion and...","Edward W. Wheeler - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I guess I was thinking in '15, though, these issues, I just -- I guess I would think that the impact of the issues and the improvement in the areas that are dragging the company by '15 should give you some margin lift. And I'm wondering why you're sticking with that 13% margin for '15.","John J. Kita","Well, as we go under 13%, the margin assumption or aspiration assumes we will get back to 13% or above. And so, we'll start seeing some improvement in India, although India water treatment will continue to be an investment we're going to make for the long term, and it's an advertising-driven type business, so we'll continue to invest in SG&A. So that's why we say we'll be below 13% next year and we expect to be 13% or above the following year.","Edward W. Wheeler - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And I guess, maybe Lochinvar, there might be some margin headwinds as you enter China, is that also part of it?","John J. Kita","Yes.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time.","Patricia K. Ackerman","Okay. Thank you very much, and you all have a great day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, the Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Patricia Ackerman. You may begin.","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2016 results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Ajita who will begin his remarks on slide three.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 2016 was another excellent year for A. O. Smith, setting records for sales and earnings. We continue to see healthy end markets for our consumer products in China and for boilers and commercial water heaters in the U.S. Here are a few highlights.","Sales grew 6% to a record of $2.7 billion. Excluding the impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar against the Chinese currency, our sales grew 8% in 2016. China sales are up 19% in local currency. Among several revenue growth drivers, A. O. Smith branded water treatment sales grew over 40% in local currency. Our e-commerce sales in China reached nearly $200 million.","Net earnings of $1.85 per share was 17% higher than our earnings per share in 2015. We welcomed the Aquasana team to A. O. Smith through our acquisition of the U.S.-based water treatment company in early August. A. O. Smith global sales of water treatment product totaled $194 million in 2016.","We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion of our cash to return to shareholders. During 2016, we repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares for $135 million. We announced a 17% increase to our dividend last month. The five-year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is over 25%. We announced a 2-for-1 stock split which became effective on October 6.","John will now describe our results in more detail, beginning with slide number four.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the year of nearly $2.7 billion were 6% higher than the previous year and 8% higher in local currency terms. Net earnings of $326.5 million improved 15% from 2015. Earnings per share of $1.85 improved 17% over last year.","Sales in our North America segment of $1.74 billion increased 2% compared with 2015. The segment benefited from a full year pricing related to the U.S. regulatory change in April of 2015 as well as a price increase related to steel and other cost inflation in August 2016. Higher volumes of boilers and commercial water heaters in the U.S. also contributed to higher sales.","Lower volumes of U.S. residential water heaters partially offset these benefits. The purchase of Aquasana in August added $18.4 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of world segment sales of $966 million increased 11% compared with 2015. China sales increased 19% in local currency, driven by higher demand for water heaters, water treatment and residential air purification products.","A. O. Smith branded water treatment sales in China totaled nearly $148 million in 2016, compared with $110 million in 2015. Sales of in-home air purification systems almost tripled to $26 million in 2016 compared with $9 million in 2015.","On slide six, North America operating earnings of $386 million were 14% higher than segment operating earnings in the previous year. And operating margin of 22% was 200 basis points higher than the 20% operating margin one year ago.","Pricing actions, lower material costs in the first half of the year and higher boiler and commercial volumes in the U.S. were partially offset by lower residential water heater volumes in the U.S. These factors were the primary drivers of the improved North America segment financial performance. Rest of world operating earnings of $129 million improved 14% compared with 2015.","Higher China sales were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses in China. Segment operating earnings were negatively impacted by almost $8 million due to China currency translation. Higher selling cost in China to support expansion in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and higher advertising costs to support brand building were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses. Segment operating margin of 13.4% was higher than one year ago.","Our corporate expenses were higher in 2016 compared with the year ago period, primarily due to $1.2 million of Aquasana acquisition related costs and higher expenses at our corporate technology center. Our effective income tax rate in 2016 was 29.4% which was slightly lower than the rate of 29.7% recorded in 2015.","Sales for the fourth quarter of $698 million were 9% higher than the previous year. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of $83 million increased 4% from 2015. Fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.47 increased $0.02 compared with 2015.","Sales in our North America segment of $436 million increased 5% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of commercial water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and pricing actions in August 2016 related to significant steel cost increases and inflationary pressure on other costs.","Lower U.S. residential volumes partially offset these factors. Aquasana added $12.2 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of world segment sales of $268 million increased 15% compared with 2015. China sales increased 24% in local currency, driven by higher demand for our consumer products in the region, led by water treatment and air purification products.","On slide nine, North America operating earnings of $89 million were 3% lower than segment operating earnings in the year ago quarter. And as expected, operating margin of 20.5% was lower than the 22.3% operating margin one year ago. The favorable impact from the pricing action in the U.S. and improved profitability of Lochinvar branded products were more than offset by higher material costs and over $6 million of incremental ERP implementation expenses. These factors resulted in lower segment operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2016 when compared with 2015.","Rest of world operating earnings of $38 million improved 34% compared with 2015. Higher China sales were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses in China. Segment operating earnings were negatively impacted by $2.5 million due to China currency translation. Higher selling costs in China to support growth and higher advertising costs to promote our consumer products were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses.","Fourth quarter segment operating margin of 14.2% was higher than one year ago, primarily due to higher gross margins as a result of a more profitable China mix and improved water treatment profitability in the 2016 quarter. Our corporate expenses were essentially the same in the fourth quarter compared with the year ago period.","Our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 28.9% which is higher than the 27% experienced during the fourth quarter last year. The fourth quarter 2015 rate was lower than 2016, primarily due to the extension of the U.S. research and development tax credit in late 2015 and additional R&D tax benefits in China. We finished 2016 with a strong fourth quarter when adjusted for the $0.04 per share unfavorable impact from the expected incremental ERP expenses and the higher tax rate.","Cash provided by operations during 2016 was $447 million compared with $352 million for the prior year. Higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital, primarily in China, were the primary drivers of improved cash flow in 2016. China experienced a series of favorable cash flow impacts in the fourth quarter.","First, accounts receivable balances declined from the prior year end, despite considerably higher fourth quarter sales. We received a series of unexpected large customer payments late in the fourth quarter and benefited from improved terms with a few customers, all resulting in lower AR balances. Second, trade payable balances were higher, most notably due to higher inventory in advance of Spring Festival occurring this week. And third, cash received in advance from distribution customers was higher than expected.","Our liquidity position and balance sheet remained strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 18% at the end of 2016. We have cash balances totaling $755 million located offshore, and our net cash position was approximately $431 million at the end of December 2016. Our year-end 2016 net cash level was higher than we expected as a result of the working capital factors noted previously as well as lower capital spending than planned in 2016.","We completed the acquisition of Aquasana, a U.S. residential water treatment company in August 2016, primarily as a result of continued strong cash flow and escalating PBGC premiums, we made a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of $30 million during 2016. The after-tax impact to our cash flow is approximately $18.5 million. During 2016, we repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of common stock for a total of $135 million.","At December 2016 meeting, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional 3 million shares. Approximately 4.9 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of 2016. This morning, we introduced our 2017 EPS guidance in the range of between $1.98 and $2.08 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 10% increase in EPS compared with our 2016 results.","Please note that our first quarter, historically, have had the lowest EPS of our four quarters, resulting from softer sales in China during the New Year travel holiday and the seasonality of Lochinvar branded products which favors second half of the year.","Please turn to slide 12 for several 2017 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2017 to be approximately $350 million which is lower than the $447 million generated in 2016. We expect higher earnings in 2017, but also larger outlays for working capital due to the higher than anticipated cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Over the two-year period from 2016 to 2017, we expect to generate operating cash of approximately $800 million which compares with $612 million during the two years, 2014 to 2015. We broke ground in 2016 on the construction of a new water treatment and air purification manufacturing facility in Nanjing to support the strong growth of these products in China. Our 2017 capital spending plans of $90 million to $100 million include approximately $40 million related to this plant.","Total cost for the facility, which is expected to be completed in early 2018, will be approximately $65 million. After this expansion, we expect capital spending in 2018 and beyond to be at levels approximately equal to our depreciation plus amortization. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2017.","Expenses related to our ERP implementation were approximately $25 million in 2016 and are projected to decline to approximately $17.5 million in 2017. We expect to conclude our implementation efforts at a few of our small factories in North America this year. At this time, we do not expect to implement this system at our foreign operations.","Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $47 million in 2017, slightly higher than the $45 million in 2016, primarily due to higher expenses at our corporate technology center. Take note that our interest expense will be approximately $4 million higher in 2017 as a result of higher rates, share repurchase activity and our acquisition last year.","Our effective tax rate is expected to be between 29.4% and 29.7% in 2017 and similar to the rate in 2016. This assumption is predicated on no change to the current U.S. tax regime. With regard to tax reform and border adjustment proposals, we have had several discussions with Big Four accounting firms. As you can appreciate, the proposals are fluid. We believe A. O. Smith could benefit significantly from tax reform.","Approximately 60% to 65% of our total profits are derived in the U.S. Our 35% federal rate is reduced by approximately 2% for our manufacturing tax credit which would likely be eliminated. The savings on federal income taxes as a result of using the proposed House plan tax rate of 20% or the Trump plan tax rate of 15% would be a significant benefit compared with our current tax rate. With this reform, we expect our net effective state income tax rate would increase approximately 100 basis points.","As many of you know, we manufacture water heaters in the U.S. and export a portion of them to Canada and elsewhere. Additionally, we have manufactured a minority of our water heaters sold in the U.S. in our maquiladora plant for almost three decades, and we import our tankless water heaters for sale in the U.S. If the net import concept is adopted, we believe we would experience an impact from border adjustments as our net imports are estimated to be approximately $75 million.","Depending on the final tax reform, we could incur one-time income tax expense associated with repatriation and remeasurement of deferred taxes. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately $135 million in 2017 under a 10b5-1 plan. We may opportunistically repurchase additional shares up to $65 million. If $135 million of our stock is repurchased, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2017 will be approximately $174 million.","I will now turn the call back to Ajita who will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for 2017 and our growth strategy, beginning on slide 13.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you, John. We project revenue growth to be between 9.5% and 11% in local currency terms in 2017 and 8% to 9.5% in U.S. dollar terms. We expect Aquasana sales to be almost $60 million this year, an incremental $40 million in sales over last year and slightly accretive to earnings.","With a full year of Aquasana sales as part of A. O. Smith, we expect our global water treatment product sales to be nearly $300 million in 2017. We predict the Chinese currency will remain at current levels against the U.S. dollar, resulting in a 5% or $40 million sales headwind compared with the average rate in 2016.","We expect steel prices to continue to be volatile and decline slightly from current prices. This assumption is significantly higher than the average price in 2016 and results in the most difficult comparisons for the year in the first and second quarters.","Specific to our North America segment, we project U.S. residential water heater volumes will increase approximately 200,000 units in 2017 due to new construction and expansion of replacement demand. We project U.S. commercial volumes will be up modestly with little growth in small electric units after the category grew significantly in 2016.","Fourth quarter 2016 sales of U.S. commercial boilers were strong, up double-digits due to the introduction of new Lochinvar products and the continued transition to higher efficiency boilers. We expect the total portfolio of Lochinvar branded products to grow over 8% in 2017 which includes slower growing Lochinvar branded water heaters.","These factors lead us to expect our North America segment operating margin to be between 21.5% and 22.25%, despite the headwind from lower Aquasana EBIT margin of almost 50 basis points.","Specific to our rest of world segment. We are a consumer products company in China which distinguishes us from most industrial companies operating in China. We grew 19% in local currency last year after growing approximately 17% in each of the last two years.","With several growth drivers underpinning our China business, we are confident to project an annual growth rate of 15% in local currency in 2017. These drivers include overall water heater market growth driven by household formation and an emerging replacement market, geographic expansion, market share gains, continued strong growth of water treatment products, and air purification product growth. With benefits from China growth, smaller losses expected in India and our air purification products approaching breakeven, we project rest of world segment operating margin to be at least 14% in 2017.","Please advance now to slide 14. Our total company organic growth model continues to assume 8% growth for the foreseeable future. Especially in these volatile and uncertain economic times, we believe our organic growth potential and our stable, defensive replacement market, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volume, positively differentiates AOS among other industrial companies.","Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add to shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks and now we are available for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Just the first question, I mean I think, John, Ajita and Pat, could you just expand upon your comments around the steel pricing and the volatility and the compare for 1Q and Q2 in terms of how you're thinking about how that plays out in terms of growth and profitability for the company in the first half as we get some texture around kind of the first half versus the second half dynamic for your guidance?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, so I can tell you it began in 2015 cold rolled steel was about $535 a ton or $550 a ton, I think. So we're now at $830 a ton. And so the first two quarters are certainly as we talked about on the call, are going to have negative steel costs compared to the prior year. And as you move to the end of the year, you'll be more equal to what we were paying in late 2016.","It's, obviously, been extremely volatile. We have \u2013 we talked to many experts. I think their forecast is for it to go down from here, but there's a lot of variables. Capacity is at 70%, but cold rolled is higher than that. Some of the input costs have been coming down, but then you have some of the potential tariffs and duties that could take it the other way. But clearly, steel will be a negative comparison first half of the year of 2017 compared to 2016.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","You laid out a very impressive outlook for organic growth as you always do. And obviously, there's a lot of teeth and underlying assumptions that kind of support the organic growth. I guess my question is you do have this outsized exposure to China sales as everyone is well aware of. Is there anything \u2013 and you talked about border adjustability as well, so you \u2013 and then net export position, taxes, so you've given a lot of detail. But in terms of the potential for, I guess, trade war or tariff adventure in association with the Trump administration, how do you think about kind of your headline risk there with respect to your business because you are well entrenched locally in China? But is there anything on the fundamental basis you're concerned about, certain policies or certain regulations, certain actions that could happen in global trade between China and the U.S. that could really cause fundamental problems from you aside from a headline risk?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","So I'll take a shot at it, and then Ajita can add. The China entity is basically vertically integrated and sources and sells everything in China. From the U.S., we import very little from China. So, from that standpoint, we shouldn't have too much impact. And the other thing is both countries' trade is very intertwined. And our assumption is that ultimately it gets resolved reasonably. But with respect to China imports or exports, we really don't have much of either way going on.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","And just to reinforce that, I think the key is \u2013 because you're right that we do have a lot of revenue exposure there which we like. The growth has been fantastic and we have very strong fundamentals in China with a strong brand and strong distribution, a great team. At the same time, we do worry about it, nothing new now on an ongoing basis. And that's why we have, in fact, not just for the three of us and our team to be looking at it, but we hire outside experts to give us advice in terms of what's happening. And we've talked about it before. We have the Eurasia Group on retainer and we work with them in terms of understanding the risk out there.","They're experts at this. And we've consulted with them. And we are very comfortable in terms of where we are and from a risk perspective and even in these economic times. And as John said, at the end of the day, the two economies are very intertwined and we feel that cooler heads will prevail as time goes on if there is anything.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So I really wanted to dig in on the res data. Looks like through November, it was up kind of 7% if you adjust for some of the NAECA III shift from res to commercial kind of low single-digits. Can you just talk about how you did relative to that? And what you see as kind of holding back the residential water heater business through 2016. And then kind of how you're framing it for 2017, I guess particularly where you can gain share or mix and price to kind of grow that unit number?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, you're right. The industry was up the first two months of the year, probably about 80,000 units. We were during that same time period down about 20,000 units and there was really two reasons for that. One is SAP went in at our wholesale plant, and our lead times extended a little bit there. So we didn't pick up as much on the wholesale side as we should have. And then number two, our largest retail customer dropped their inventory from September to December to more normal levels, consistent with where they were at the end of last year. And so we didn't participate as much on the retail side either. But those were, in our mind, kind of two one-time events, if you will.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","And they were approximately half and half...","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yes, half-and-half.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","...in terms of the impact.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","What we're looking at in 2017 and we've done a lot of modeling, obviously, trying to forecast the industry. It's been difficult over the last three years. Our forecast base level kind of assumes that the industry is going to go up about 200,000 units, and that's 100,000 in completions and 100,000 in replacements. We think that's a reasonable assumption now that we think the inventory has kind of cleaned out of the system from all the activity that happened with NAECA between the combination of price increases and the elimination of some products. So that's our base assumption going forward.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. So if I \u2013 it looks like \u2013 so your guide, all in, is 8% to 9.5% which it looks like FX can offset the Aquasana. Is that sort of a fair...","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Right, right.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So the China one's easy. I'm just trying to bridge your 8% long-term target versus your 8% to 9.5%. Like what's kind of the upside scenario? Because it seems like China, you're saying plus 15%, Lochinvar plus 8%. And so...","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, I think what we have is a little bit of pricing carryover from 2016. So, on the high end, that certainly helps us. If the industry is a little bit higher than we expected, that gets us to the high end. To get to the low end, if the industry doesn't do as well as what we expect. So that's kind of the bridge. You're correct that essentially Aquasana and what we're assuming for currency effect on China in 2017 pretty much offset each other.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","John, just wanted to \u2013 on North America margins, you have the guidance out as 21.5% to 22.25%. And I believe in the prior calls, I think you had capped the high end at 22%. What makes you a little bit more comfortable like extending that guide by 25 bps here at the high end, especially with the steel cost and some of the headwinds you've been talking about?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Sure. Well, as I had spoken, I said our starting point was 21.5% to 22%, and we hadn't done our estimate. I think on the high end, if volumes come in at the 200,000 to 300,000 range, those come in at a very attractive incremental margin. If steel does recede more than kind of a little bit, that would obviously help our margins. So it's a combination of those things. I think the high and low end of the margins will be driven primarily by the volumes in North America residential and commercial. I mean I think we're pretty comfortable on the Lochinvar of 8% to 10%. And then where steel goes, plus or minus.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And any other \u2013 we have been talking about SAP cost and some of the synergies which you had \u2013 we had, not officially, but as we talked about you will be getting from the SAP implementation over the next two years. Is that built in the guidance too, like the North America margin guidance?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","No, I would tell you that the savings that I think we talked about on the last call that we would expect to start generating savings in 2018 were not completely installed yet. We'll finish that in North America this year. We'll make some improvements to the system. And then I think our focus will be on things like shared services, looking at our supply chain and the benefits we can get from consolidated spend and some of those things. So we would start seeing that, we think, in the 2018 range. I mean, one of the benefits to margin is we've said we spent about $25 million in 2016, and we're forecasting $17.5 million in 2017. So that does help the margins out.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","And this is \u2013 Bhupender, this is very consistent with what we've said in the past, so it's not any change. It's that 2017 is going to be a year where we really stabilize the system, really get to understanding how we use it. And then 2018 is when we really start \u2013 and setting plans to reap benefits. And 2018 is when we really think that's going to begin and 2018 into 2019 onward which, again, from talking to other people who put in systems like SAP, pretty consistent.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay, okay. And my last question, on Lochinvar China growth strategy. I mean, we have \u2013 since your acquisition in 2011, I think the China strategy has been \u2013 it seems like it's delayed by a couple of years over the last several years now. And could you just update us like how big China is for Lochinvar in terms of potential? And we saw \u2013 I think you guys talked about some new product introduction in China in the third quarter last year, how the traction is coming along for that particular product.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Let me take a stab, and then you jump in. So, Bhupender, you're right. When we made the acquisition, we anticipated at the time that the Chinese market would become, would open up for \u2013 the timing would be that the Chinese market was opening up for this high efficiency condensing products that Lochinvar makes, obviously, world-class products. And we were wrong in the sense that that commercial \u2013 that condensing market hasn't quite opened up at the speed that we anticipated. But in the meantime, we did see the opportunity for high BTU input non-condensing products. And Lochinvar developed some products which we started shipping to China end of last year. And we also manufacture that product in China.","So from a strategic viewpoint, we are doing what we said we would. It's been pushed out more, and it's a different type of product because the market for condensing product has not really developed at the speed we thought. We know it will. The indications are it's coming, but we just don't quite see it there yet. However, the non-condensing part, the high BTU non-condensing part, where the technology from Lochinvar really helps us, we've developed products. We are manufacturing some of them in China. We are exporting some of them. And the growth of that segment is going, actually, very well. Anything to add, John?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","No.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Summerville of Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Thanks. Good morning. With respect to China, you've sort of disclosed kind of revenue numbers and year-over-year growth numbers for the treatment portion as well as purification on the air side. What did your legacy water heater business do in China in local currency in 2016? And then I guess moving to 2017, the bridge to that 15% number that you're calibrating everyone around and you, obviously, had that number for a long time, what growth expectations do you have for those three pieces in 2017 that gets you to that 15%? Thank you.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, when we look at the model compared to 2016, phase water heater, which is about 70% of the business, grew at 6% or 7%. Okay. So a little bit more than \u2013 contributed a little bit more growth than what we expected. Pricing was 4% to 5%. Pricing, market share was 4% to 5% as we expected. And then, obviously, the ancillary product lines added about 8%. So that's kind of the math on how you get to the 19%, if you will.","And obviously, two prior years, we averaged about 17%. So, from a growth standpoint, 2016 was a very good year. Now, when we look into 2017, we're pretty much following our model, saying that we expect to get 5% from our legacy businesses, i.e., our electric and instantaneous gas. We expect to get 5% from either pricing, market share. And then we expect to get 5% from continued growth in water treatment, air purification, et cetera. So the model is tracking very well for what we thought, a little bit better the last couple years. And we're comfortable with the 15% growth.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","And I think the individual pieces of the model, long-term, we're very comfortable. Short-term, they're going to vary. But overall, we are very comfortable with the average.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, you talked about your ERP implementation costs and what they're doing from 2016 to 2017. I guess, long-term, what does that $17.5 million number go to? Does it eventually go to zero? Are you done? Is there a reason you're not migrating your SAP platform to your international operations? Can you just sort of give a picture on your ERP please?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Sure. So, as I said, we're about $17.5 million next year \u2013 I'm sorry, this year, 2017. We would expect a run rate is probably about $15 million. And the pieces of that are the amortization of what we capitalized is almost $6 million. So that's going on for the next 10 years or so. Then you have the services, the external services, the hosting services, the SAP support services which are $3 million to $4 million. And then you have the license fees that you pay these guys going on, whether it's SAP, whether it's SuccessFactors. So I think we think $15 million is probably a reasonable number. And then you have the COE which is people that are supporting the system, et cetera.","So we're saying $15 million is a reasonable number. Now Ajita and I have had a lot of discussions on taking it internationally. And we're not saying we're not going to at some point. But right now, China, when we sold EPC in 2011, we put QAD, a very good system, into China. And it can handle their growth for quite some time.","India, we think SAP at this time would be overkill for them. So we'll continue to evaluate. And again, our focus is, starting towards 2018, is starting to get savings in North America from the system. And that's where we're focusing on.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. And just to reinforce, QAD is a very good system and is working extremely well for us. And also, what we \u2013 we did do some \u2013 maybe this is more detail than you want. But we did do some customization with QAD so that it handles not only the manufacturing, but also giving us really good data on the retail side of the business which, as you know, is growing very well. So that's working really well for us. And we don't think that putting SAP in there today is the right thing from a long-term \u2013 from a consolidation perspective because it's working for us.","Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Understood. Good color. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charley Brady with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, this is actually Patrick Wu standing in for Charley. Thanks for taking my question. I'm looking at China, up 24% excluding FX. What was the number including FX, all in? And then what is the \u2013 sort of how would you attribute or maybe parse out some of the buildup normal seasonal demand leading up to the Chinese New Year versus the large customer orders that you talked about a little bit? Because I think versus last year ex-currency, it was up 19%. There was a 5% delta there, just wanted to bridge that gap.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, the first one, so I think we said that currency affected 2016 by about $50 million. And that was all China essentially.","Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","What about at the fourth quarter? Sorry.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","The fourth quarter, it took it from what, $20 million?","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","(41:28)","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","$19 million, it was $19 million down to what?","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, down. The impact was about $17 million. Yeah.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","So we have \u2013 I can tell you the fourth quarter impact for sales was about $17 million. So, in local currency, it was 24%, and in U.S. dollars, it was about 16%. So that was the fourth quarter impact. And we also talked about that it affected the profits by about $2.5 million. Does that answer that question?","Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. Yeah, the first portion, definitely. But I was more looking at in terms of normal seasonality. You generally have a buildup leading up to Chinese New Year in the fourth quarter. I think last year, ex-currency, it was up 19%. And the fourth quarter of this year, it's up 24%. How would you parse out the seasonality versus maybe some of the larger orders that you mentioned during your prepared remarks?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, I wouldn't expect much change from the prior year. And what we were trying to allude to is that the first quarter is always their weakest of the four quarters, just because of the 10- to 12-day China holiday. We did get some orders, but those came in late in the year versus \u2013 and last year, they would have came in early in the year. So that was part of the timing, et cetera. But what we're trying to get across is first quarter is clearly China's weakest quarter. But we would still expect to see nice year-over-year growth.","Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. When I'm looking at the water treatment sales for the year, I think if you ex out Aquasana and then ex out your China numbers, I think it leaves around $28 million in terms of water treatment. Is that mostly India? And then also can you frame a little bit about how you guys view the losses in 2017? I think you guys said that there will be smaller losses in 2017 than 2016. But can you maybe give a little bit more granular color on that?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Sure. So, in 2016, you're right. Branded was about $148 million. The legacy business we bought in China was about $18 million. Turkey was about $5 million. India was a couple million. Vietnam was about $4 million. And U.S., Aquasana, the $18 million we talked about. So that's how you kind of get to the $194 million for water treatment product sales. So that's the first question.","The second one was with respect to India?","Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. How should we think about the framework for sort of losses into 2017 versus 2016?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","You're fading. The last part of your question didn't come through.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I think he said losses.","Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Just thinking about how to frame the losses in terms \u2013 in 2017 for India versus 2016 and how we think about that?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Sure. So, in 2016, we lost almost $10 million. That was the high end of the range. And we would say that the fourth quarter was impacted by the demonetization, I think, the elimination of large bills which you probably read about. So that had a negative effect. So we lost \u2013 our loss was towards the high end of the range. Our forecast when we look into 2017 is that sales will grow, we think, over 30% and the losses will reduce to, let's say, around $8 million.","Patrick Wu - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So really two questions. The one is the easier one. M&A, any type of update you can give us, Ajita, obviously, with the share repurchase upping in December. Is that any type of a signal that you're maybe not seeing a lot in the M&A pipe, or is that just sort of a just in case something doesn't happen?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","No. There's no signal at all, no change in strategy. The market out there is active and we are looking with a wide net as we have talked in the past.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I would attribute the, certainly in part, the performance or lack thereof of the stock during this Trump rally on concerns over China backlash, China consumer backlash on the US. So if you could walk us through again why you think the fact that you're landlocked, we all get that, but why wouldn't a U.S. brand as strong as A. O. Smith maybe not get any type of backlash? Certainly, we understand that you're kind of like the only game in town at your price point or what have you. But still, I think there is still a concern out there about that. If you can maybe address that more fully?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","I'll give it a shot. In terms of \u2013 a lot of the rally has been around infrastructure related types of stocks that have really done very well. But I can't judge what's happening in the market. But from our perspective, like we said before, we are pretty much vertically integrated in China. We export a little bit from here to China, glass and a few components, very little. And we hardly \u2013 I don't think we export anything from China -- we export very little, very little from China to the US. So we are pretty much self-contained in China. So that's number one.","And then also at the end of the day, the two economies are very intertwined. And what the experts are telling us, okay, because this is not something that Pat and John and I sit around the table and say here's what we think will happen because we are certainly not the experts. But what the experts are telling us is that as you look at all the pluses and minuses, that if there is anything, it'll be short-lived and is going to be impact more the cross-border type traffic and is not going to impact the companies that are self-contained in either place, okay. And we are comfortable with that. We don't see any evidence of anything happening. And so, from a risk perspective, we are comfortable in terms of where we are.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So what I think I hear you saying is that ultimately cooler heads prevail. In other words, you have a powerful brand, everyone knows it's a U.S. brand. You've talked ad nauseum over the years about how the power of a non-China brand works so well in the customer segment that you're targeting. So it sounds to me like you're saying that if there is an impact, it will be short-lived because people will realize that everything you sell in China, you make in China.","But I guess \u2013 and, look, it's impossible to handicap this at this point. But I think the greater, larger concern is not about necessarily being landlocked, but just about U.S. brands in China in general. And what the new president's \u2013 with the potential for renegotiating trade agreements, what that could mean. And I'm sure your experts probably have an opinion on this, but that was really the nature of my...","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, but \u2013 so let me address that. There are two issues, okay. One is in terms of renegotiating trade agreements which is what will impact the cross-border type traffic, of which, we have virtually none, okay. So that's one.","The second is the secondary impact of what that would do in terms of the relationship and impact on U.S. brands in China. I think that's what you're saying, okay. In terms of the latter, like we said, we \u2013 from talking to the expert, we aren't concerned. And also, if you go back and look at what's been happening historically in China, not with the U.S., but very, very similar circumstances with a country that there's been constant ups and downs, and that's Japan.","Japanese brands continue to do very well in China. We compete with Japanese brands in China as you know. And when these issues flare up, and with Japan it flares up at least once a year, okay, with the visit to the shrine that happens in Japan every year, things flare up for a short while and then it goes back down. This is in terms of the rhetoric and all the newspapers and all the rest of it. We see no impact in the marketplace and it's business as usual.","So we put it all together and we say the best we know and the best we are hearing from the experts, we are not concerned.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Understood. That's a comprehensive answer, Ajita. Thank you. Here's just my last one, if I may. The transitory issues or quote-unquote transitory issues you talked about, hitting the North American volumes. It sounds like from the guidance that you are assuming that that is, in fact, a transitory issue. But I was wondering if you could bring to bear what you're seeing in January as sort of proof that they are transitory issues. Are you seeing sort of a return to normal trade volume in the \u2013 did you see that in January?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, we've seen \u2013 but in the two areas, first of all, our lead times are coming down because \u2013 there were \u2013 John said, he used the word two one-time issues, okay, which are there, which explain about half and half, which explains the gap. So our lead times are coming down. Is it down to where I want it to be right now? No, but it's coming down very nicely. That's number one. And number two, we see our customer building back inventories and the order rate is up. So we are comfortable as to where we are.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","And we've lost no customers.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Right, , yeah, we haven't lost any customers. The lead time being down, but not a loss of customer. That's a good important point.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Very good. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alvaro Lacayo from Gabelli & Company. Your line is now open.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Good morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","My question is in regards with, I guess, the comments around sort of the way volume went in the fourth quarter and tying it into sort of the August price increase. Can you just maybe talk about market acceptance on that price increase versus what you've seen in the past? And you mentioned those two one-time issues. Did rising price have anything to with the volume issues that you had in the fourth quarter?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Absolutely not, on the second one. No, no. The two reasons were we put SAP into our three major wholesale plants. Two of them are residential and our lead times extended a little bit associated with SAP. Number two is our largest retail customer from September 30 to December 31 adjusted their inventory levels down, putting them to more normal levels and very comparable to the prior year. So, no, it had nothing to do in our mind associated with price.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Okay, great. And then I guess around just high level thinking on the M&A strategy and with everything that we've been talking about with regards to trade tensions, repatriation, tax reform. In terms of how you're developing the pipeline and how you think about what the strategic pieces are going forward, how do you see sort of any differences or potential opportunities, given all the changes that you're seeing in the market today?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I'll take a shot at it. I don't think our strategy has changed. I mean, (54:20)...","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","No, our strategy certainly hasn't changed.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","... (54:21) segments in areas we've talked about for the last couple years on where we're focused.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Our strategy has not changed, no. And also in terms of \u2013 there's a lot of speculation in terms of what's going to happen. We don't know what's going to happen. When things do happen, if that's going to impact our strategy or open up more opportunities because of repatriation, et cetera, then we \u2013 or differences in the tax impact, then that would certainly go into impacting our strategy and tweaking our strategy or changing our strategy. But right now, we are very consistent with our strategy in terms of where the opportunities are and where we want to grow.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Okay, got it. And then in China, you talked about the better profitability. You mentioned better mix and better profitability in water treatment. If you could just provide more color on what the mix improvement drivers were, and then what was making water treatment more profitable? Was it just price increases or is something else going on?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","It wasn't price increases. It was just kind of scale and much higher, so we're starting to get more contribution, et cetera. And they have very \u2013 their water treatment has very attractive gross margins.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. So, just to add a little more to what John said, we've always said when we get into a new business segment, okay, obviously, there's going to be an initial investment in terms of getting into the segment. We're going to lose money for a while until we build up the scale. But also, remember, we are a consumer products business in China. So, in addition to building up scale like we would do with a normal manufacturing business, we're also investing in the brand and investing behind making sure the consumer knows that the A. O. Smith brand is in that category. And what our features and benefits are, I mean, typical marketing, okay.","So it's that combination that makes that investment period and getting us to breakeven longer than a typical industrial type business, okay. But at the same time, whenever we get into a category, we make sure that our gross margins are high and that we have a plan and a can-see path to get us to the right level of profitability. And we make sure that the teams are working towards getting up there.","So we are along that path. And as the volume grows, the scale grows and the contribution grows, and also we can appropriately scale our investment behind the brand in that category to make sure that we are reaching our profit targets at the right pace. So it's all of that. I know that's a mouthful, but that's all of that that's impacting us. And it's on track in terms of us getting the water treatment profitability to the levels we want them to be at.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sam Eisner from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, good morning, everyone. I think actually most of my questions have been answered. Thanks.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Okay.","Operator","And our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Brandon Roll\u00e9 - Longbow Research LLC","This is Brandon Roll\u00e9 on for David MacGregor. I was going to ask you if you could talk quickly about your 2016 growth in commercial water heaters and to the extent that you may have gained share. And then also if you could just talk about what might change competitively, if anything, in 2017 with a possibly stronger U.S. dollar environment. Thank you.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I think share \u2013 well, the whole industry grew about 20%. And I think we talked about the major reason for that being the 55-gallon and up electric which was eliminated under NAECA from a residential standpoint. So, if you look at the 20% growth, I think about 17% of the growth was specific to that. And then small electrics under 55-gallon were the majority of the reminder, the 3%. We really, from a share standpoint, it was pretty constant except we did talk about the fact that we didn't have equivalent share in the 55-gallon and up electric. We brought out a product to compete in that late in the first quarter, and the product has been doing fairly nicely. But clearly, that had an impact on our overall share. So the industry, except for that specific, was pretty level for the year. Does that answer your question?","Brandon Roll\u00e9 - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, that answered my question. And also I was going to see if you could just comment on if you think there will be a shift in competitive dynamics with a stronger U.S. dollar in 2017?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, the good news for us is it's very hard to ship in water heaters from the outside. So the stronger dollar we're not concerned about \u2013 that's going to make imports better positioned. So we're not concerned about what the effect is here. The stronger U.S. dollar could have an impact on the Canada market a little bit. I don't (01:00:08).","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, and we have some \u2013 we have some Canadian competitors in the U.S. market too. But they are seeing the advantage today. And we're not concerned about it.","Brandon Roll\u00e9 - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Well, looks like we're drawing to a close here, guys. But maybe you just \u2013 have you provided any kind of implicit assumption for price in your outlook for 2017?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","No. As you know, we can't speculate on price. And we talk about price only once something happens in the marketplace.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. And then just in terms of thinking about ERP spend, how do we think about it beyond this year in terms of incremental spend over the next two or three years from a long-term modeling standpoint? Are we done or where are we in terms of a certain base level of spending?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, I think what we tried to say is that was $25 million in 2016, about $17.5 million in 2017. And we would say probably the run rate is $15 million going forward. And it's those components I talked about which is the amortization of what we capitalized, the outside services, the license fees, et cetera. So I think the run rate after this, our best guess is $15 million going forward.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And the question comes from Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Just one more question here, which I forgot, was on the Aquasana. You have some cross-selling synergies over the next two years which you gave last year. Could you just update us on that and how the cross-selling between China and the U.S., keeping in mind the border adjustment tax, which we think will play or not play, I don't know, but has anything changed along with your strategy, keeping that in mind? Thank you.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","No, I think at this time, nothing's changed. We expect their core business to grow over 20% this year, and then we will start to see some of the synergies associated with the cross-selling this year. We said it would be back end loaded, but we would expect that to be in the area of $5 million of cross-selling this year with the ultimate objective after a three-year period to be in the 25% to 30%, I think is what we've talked about. So I'd say Aquasana is on track, no surprises. And we're not going to change our strategy until there's something firm out there on...","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","On the cross-border.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, that's (01:03:01).","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","And also, Bhupender, I think the overall question, if I can take a step back on your question, in terms of \u2013 and not to put words in your mouth, but how that Aquasana are doing. I think from our perspective, it's right on track. Strategically, we are absolutely convinced this is the right thing to do which is why we did the acquisition. And from a synergy perspective, one of the things we didn't talk about are the cost side of the synergies. It's going well. In fact, if anything, even a little better.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","At this time, I'm showing no further questions.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","Also as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Ajita, who will begin our prepared remarks on slide 3.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Our 13% sales growth in the second quarter was primarily driven by higher sales of water heaters and boilers in North America, and higher sales in China, including currency gains. Here are a few highlights. We achieved record sales of $833 million. Net earnings of $0.66 per share were 25% higher than our earnings per share in 2017.","We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion of our cash to return to shareholders. We repurchased 1.1 million shares for approximately $70 million through the first half of the year. As a result of continued strong cash flow, our board approved an incremental 2.5 million shares to repurchase at its meeting earlier this month. We plan to continue buying back our shares at the previously stated $135 million annual pace using a 10b5-1 plan, and in addition, opportunistically buy back shares in the open market.","We announced the 29% increase to our dividend in January. The five-year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is over 25%. We repatriated nearly $240 million in the first half of 2018 using the proceeds to pay down floating-rate debt and improving the flexibility of our balance sheet.","John will now describe our results in more detail beginning with slide number 4.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Sales for the second quarter of $833 million were 13% higher than the same quarter in 2017. Net earnings in the second quarter of $115 million increased 24% from the second quarter in 2017. Second quarter earnings per share of $0.66 increased 25% compared with the same quarter in 2017.","Sales in our North America segment of $534 million increased nearly 14% compared with the second quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher volumes of water heaters and boilers in North America and pricing actions related to steel cost increases. North America water treatment sales comprised of Aquasana and Hague, incrementally adding approximately $7 million to our North America segment sales.","Rest of World segment sales of $308 million increased 13% compared with the same quarter in 2017. China sales growth was 12%, including a benefit from currency translation of approximately $19 million. China sales grew 4% in local currency. Pricing actions in mid-2017, primarily due to higher steel and installation costs, as well as higher sales of gas tankless water heaters and water treatment products, contributed to higher sales and were partially offset by the decline in air purification products and e-commerce sales compared with the prior year.","On slide 6, North America segment earnings of $125 million were nearly 15% higher than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2017. The favorable impact from higher sales of water heaters, boilers and pricing actions in the U.S. were partially offset by higher steel and other input costs. North America segment margin was slightly higher than last year.","Rest of World earnings of $35 million improved 7% compared with the second quarter of 2017. Higher China sales, including the price increase, were offset by higher engineering and advertising costs. In addition, higher depreciation and utility costs and inefficiencies, all associated with the new water treatment plant negatively impacted earnings. Translation gains compared with last year added approximately $2 million to earnings.","Second quarter segment margin of 11.3% was lower than one year ago due to these factors. Our corporate expenses were similar to last year. Our effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2018 was 21.7%. The rate was lower than the 27.8% experienced during the second quarter last year, primarily due to lower federal income taxes related to tax reform. The lower effective income tax rate benefited second quarter 2018 earnings by $0.05 per share.","Cash provided by operations during the second quarter of 2018 was $173 million compared with $73 million provided during the same period in 2017. Higher earnings and a smaller investment in working capital were the primary drivers of higher cash flow compared with last year.","Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt to capital ratio was 12.5% at the end of the second quarter. We have cash balances totaling $658 million located offshore and our net cash position was approximately $410 million at the end of June.","During the first half of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for a total of $70 million. Our board approved the repurchase of an additional 2.5 million shares at its meeting in July. The new authority is in addition to the authority to repurchase approximately 1.3 million shares, which remained at the end of June.","This morning, we upgraded our 2018 EPS guidance with a range between $2.59 and $2.63 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance represents a 20% increase in EPS compared with our adjusted 2017 results. Our EPS guidance excludes $0.03 per share of plant closing costs. Excluding the U.S. tax reform benefit, our operational performance is expected to improve by 12%.","Please turn to slide 9 for several 2018 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2018 to be approximately $475 million, which is significantly higher than the $326 million generated in 2017. We expect higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital this year.","Our 2018 capital spending plans are approximately $100 million. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $80 million in 2018. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2018, slightly higher than the $47 million in 2017, partially due to higher projected spending at our Corporate Technology Center.","Our effective income tax rate is expected to be between 21.5% and 22% in 2018, lower than the previous year due to U.S. tax reform. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately $135 million in 2018, under a 10b5-1 plan, similar to 2017.","We may supplement our 10b5-1 plan with opportunistic share repurchase in 2018. We expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2018 will be approximately 173 million.","Kevin will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for the remainder of 2018 and our growth strategy beginning on slide 10.","Kevin?","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you, John. Our outlook for 2018 includes several tailwinds and headwinds. First, our tailwinds. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will increase approximately 350,000 to 400,000 units in 2018 due to continued new construction and expansion of replacement demand. This assumption includes tankless units. Boiler revenues grew 10% in the first half of 2018, driven by solid demand for our commercial boilers and recently introduced products. We expect our boiler sales to grow approximately 10% in 2018.","As a result of significant higher steel prices and inflation in freight and other costs, we announced a price increase effective in early June, which will average approximately 10% on the majority of our U.S. water heater products.","Given significant depreciation of the China currency in the last month, we now project the full-year translation benefit of approximate $33 million compared with sales in 2017, which is $22 million smaller than our April forecast. Our projection assumes the China currency will appreciate slightly from current levels during the second half of 2018, resulting in a small translation detriment of approximately $7 million to sales in the second half compared with rates in 2017. We expect the losses in India to decline from $7.5 million loss in 2017 to a $5 million loss in 2018.","The headwinds are higher steel prices and lower China sales growth. In the second half of 2018, we expect local currency sales in China to grow at a slightly higher rate than the first half or approximately 6%. Sales are expected to be negatively impacted in the second half of the year by high channel inventory levels, which we believe to be the result of recently significant declines in the growth rate housing sales in China. For the full year, we project more than 8% growth and 5% in local currency terms. We are confident the underlying fundamentals of our China business, including a well-known premium consumer brand and reputation for innovation, reliable products.","In housing, sales recover before the end of the year, we project China's sales contribution of double-digit sales growth for the next year and beyond to remain intact. New product introductions, fast-growing water treatment products, improvement in housing formation and growing replacement demand are expected to drive future growth.","Lastly, we launch our A. O. Smith branded water treatment products at Lowe's next month. The combination of our recent acquisitions of Aquasana and Hague, coupled with our globally accepted and innovative water treatment technologies and internally developed product selector tools and branded displays provide a compelling product proposition to customers interested in the quality and safety of their homes' water. We expect $15 million of sales and a $1 million to $2 million loss this year due to startup and transition costs.","Please advance to slide 11. Primarily as a result of strength in North America, we are optimistic about our growth in bottom-line performance for 2018. We project revenue growth will be between 9.5% and 10% for the year. We raised our guidance for the full year to $2.59 to $2.63. As a reminder, our third quarter will be burdened by lighter water heater volume, driven by seasonality and a water heater price increase related to pre-buy, which benefited the second quarter, start-up costs for the new Lowe's water treatment business, and higher steel costs.","Despite subdued third quarter performance, we expect 2018 second half earnings will be stronger than the first half of the year. We expect North America adjusted segment margin for the year to be between 22.25% and 22.5%, with the third quarter negatively impacted by the startup and transition costs of the new Lowe's water treatment business and lower water heater volumes.","We project weaker performance in the Rest of World segment in the third quarter, but recovery in the fourth quarter as normal seasonality is expected to favorably impact China and India volumes later this year. For the full year, we expect Rest of World margins to be flat to slightly down from last year.","Please advance to slide 12. Earlier this year, we updated the components of our growth model to be consistent with the new disclosure rules for disaggregation of segment revenues, as well as to incorporate recently acquired and organically fast-growing businesses. We're comfortable with our 8% local currency growth model for 2019 and beyond predicated on housing recovery in China.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we're now available for your questions.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Before we go on, I want to just kind of summarize and put it all together. This is Ajita. 2018 is turning out to be a very solid year for us, where it's almost 10% top-line growth, 20% EPS growth over last year. And we are achieving this without all of our units performing at top performance \u2013 at top levels. And this shows the strength of the portfolio of businesses that we have. And as Kevin said, we're very comfortable with the longer-term 8% organic growth guidance that we've been giving you.","Pat, anything else you want to add?","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","I'll wrap up at the end.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Okay. I guess we're done and open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Hey, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And, Ajita, I know that you are not leaving us. But as this is, I'm assuming, your last conference call leading the call, I just want to say congratulations and good luck again, even though I know that you'll still be around.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you. Yeah, I'll still be around quite a while (15:56).","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Sure. So, I guess, my question, of course, will be on China. And I guess the way I'm looking at this is that you have a CEO transition taking place. You've got an analyst meeting coming up in November. So, I'm assuming, internally, you've kind of flushed out what you're thinking on China, at least in large part, I'm guessing. And so, I guess my questions are these. First of all, the slowdown in housing in China has kind of been with us for a while. The completions have been weak for a while. I guess I'm kind of wondering why all of a sudden is there an inventory channel build as opposed to not having occurred earlier.","And then, secondly, I guess my thinking here is that, obviously, water treatment is now kind of taking the lead there. Would you expect the water heater market to revert back to that 7% growth next year and why?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","So, Scott, I'll start and they can fill in. I mean, it is kind of a first half\/second half, there are different items that have come up. We had talked about the first half being up about 4%, and that's about where it came up. And it was due to two reasons. The growth wasn't as much as we expected, but it was the 4% that we had talked about, and that was two reasons. One, air purifier's down about $18 million from last year's first half. And then the second piece is our online sales are down about 13% when you take out the air purifier portion of that.","Now, we had talked on the January conference call that there was a pre-buy and we had actually even said that some of that was for online. So, the decline in online was impacted by that as well as, quite frankly, we didn't come out with a water treatment product for online as quickly as we thought we were going to. So that impacted the first half.","Now, your question is what's changed with respect to the second half, and I would tell you it's a series of things. One is when we were talking in the first quarter, appliance sales were strong, consumer spending was strong, but you're right, it had started flattening. Housing had started flattening, which was the first time it hadn't grown for a long period of time.","The inventory levels from the year-end to the first quarter grew exactly the same amount in units as the prior year December to the first quarter, okay? So when we look out at the second half, we were saying we think we can get back to more normal growth.","Now, let's roll through the second quarter. What happened is inventories actually grew. They grew about 15%. Historically, first quarter to second quarter, they would've been flat or down. Number two, we re-looked at what we're seeing in air purifier. We talked on the first call $40 million. We are coming out with new products, but we think more realistic is last half down a little bit from last year's last half. So that's a $15 million decline from what we said about first quarter. And then as we talk to our distributors, I mean, there is concern, right? Consumer confidence, the economy is slowing down there. Housing hasn't turned. It's been flat now for two or three quarters. The currency has dropped dramatically in the last month. It's dropped 6%.","So it really had us step back and kind of take a look and say, we need to kind of get through the inventory, we need to get through this half of the year. And that was really the driver on saying our second half sales are going to be up from the first half, but not what we expected. So, that's a long litany, but I mean that's how we looked at it internally recently. And again, our people have talked to distributors in July, and we just thought it prudent to take it down.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Well, that was very clear, John, as far as what's going on in this year. I very much appreciate that. I guess I'm hoping the part two of the question is, you guys have expressed \u2013 Ajita, your wrap-up comments as well expressed a lot of confidence in your business model in China, and it's understandable. I guess the question would be, you're comfortable with the 8% organic long term, but is 2019 the year where that business is just so big now in China that maybe the target shouldn't be 15%, maybe it should be 12%? Is 2019 the year where maybe we have to pull that down a little bit and then maybe water treatment in the U.S., for example, fills the gap between that and the 8%?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. Let me make some comments on what you said. First of all, the longer-term fundamental, I feel very comfortable with, as I said. What's going to happen in 2019? I don't know, because right now what's driving this slowdown in China is the economy in China and the slowdown in housing. Now, we know that that's going to improve at some point. And in fact, you would have seen over the last few days, the Chinese government has started taking steps to increase liquidity and put more money into the economy. Okay? So when that comes back, we expect the economy to come back.","The fundamentals in China in terms of the massive movement of people into the middle class, the strength of our very strong consumer brand and our distribution, all those fundamentals are very solid. And I think that as you look at this and you look at \u2013 put this, overlay this on our results so far this year and the guidance for the full year, which is almost 10% growth and the 20% EPS \u2013 10% top-line growth and 20% EPS growth, it just shows the strength of the portfolio that we have, that even without all the businesses at top performance, we are still able to get this kind of performance. So, we feel very comfortable going forward.","The specific question you had in terms of what's 2019 going to be like, it really depends on how quickly the Chinese economy comes back.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","The only other comment I'd give you, Scott, is you know our growth model now talks about 14% growth for those high growing, and you're right, we do expect India to grow above that. We do expect North America water treatment to do that \u2013 do above that.","We don't need China to grow at 14%, but we're not giving up by any means because of the issues that \u2013 I mean the macro factors that are there. But that's why we're comfortable in total with that 14% for 2019 for the high-growth piece (23:08).","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","With the understanding that you might have to lean on that diversification that I alluded to and that you're alluding to now that China might actually be going forward not to 15% organic growth, but maybe something a couple of points less than that.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. Again, I'd say we're certainly not giving up on that. But in 2019, that's certainly the possibility, without a doubt.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. It depends on when it comes back, but we've always said, every portion of that equation is not going to be hitting every time. But in total, we are very comfortable. And again, I go back to 2018 as a great example that we're hitting our longer-term guidance, top and bottom line, without every unit performing at peak performance.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right. And I appreciate that. If I can just sneak in a follow-up here on the Rest of World margin, because I know you guys have been frustrated at its level for some time. In fact, 2018's Rest of World margin, call it, 13-and-change, there was a lot of trials and tribulations within that number. So, would that suggest that the setup here for after this year that you can actually start to push that margin up having, again, with the 2018 issues kind of doing a bit of a reset on purification, maybe even on water heaters, does that portend well for improvement in margin in the Rest of World after this year?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I mean, I'll let Kevin answer the going forward. But I think this year, margins are certainly being impacted, and we've actually dropped them from our last call, because air purification, we had told you, was going to lose $5 million. It's now going to lose, we think, closer to $8 million. So, we certainly have an area there that we have to address.","Number two, what also is having a factor on margins this year, which we've also talked about, is we brought a new water treatment plant on board, and we had inefficiencies. As we talked about in the script, we had higher depreciation and utilities, which we knew and that was all built into the $5 million. But you're right, going forward, we certainly expect efficiencies in that plant are going to help offset that.","So, I'll let Kevin talk to going forward.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, going forward, we certainly will get efficiencies from our new water treatment plant. Some of the, I guess, headwinds behind us will be behind us. We'll improve our e-commerce sales. We'll have new products coming to market in number of categories, water treatment, tankless and in water heaters. So going forward, we do see being able to leverage our operations and also increase those margins. Again, they'll be incrementally 0.25 points, 0.5 points moving forward, but we do believe, and we continue to put programs in place where we believe we can move the Rest of World margins forward. Again, John talked about India. There's a number of other areas that are going to help us as we go forward to increase those incrementally over time.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Sir, your line is open.","Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you. Couple of questions. Just again, sticking with the China business. Can you give more specificity, you mentioned where you felt air purification would come in, where you feel the water heater business is going to come in, in 2018 versus 2017, as well as water treatment?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, I'll start with water treatment. So, water treatment was up in local currency terms about 15% in the first half. But again, it's a tale of two cities. The offline was up significantly, over 25%. The online was down almost 25%. And again, the online being two factors. One, there was an inventory build; and two, we didn't have the product that we wanted to bring to market. So, I would tell you, in general, we're very pleased with the first half of water treatment. When we look at the full year, we expect the second half growth to be more than the first half. So, we're calling for air \u2013 water treatment to be in kind of the 18% to 19% type in local currency terms, and even more than that U.S. dollar terms. So, we're pleased. Again, we get that new product out. It's going to eliminate a lot of the connections. So, we're optimistic on that product. But again, it's complex and we had a big move go on. So we're later than we expected. So, water treatment's doing very well.","Water heater offline had a good first quarter, a good first half. But quite frankly, we're not expecting that in the second half as we work down the inventory. So, we'll say the second half is going to be somewhat flattish to up a little bit in RMB terms. But we think it's important to reduce those inventory levels.","Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.","And then as my follow-up, with respect to the price increase you've put in place in early June, would you say the majority of that 10% or the full 10% is sticking at this point? And then, can you also just maybe put that in the context of you mentioned, I think it was maybe, Kevin, in his prepared remarks, that you felt that the pre-buy you saw in Q2 would impact volumes in Q3. But I thought on your first quarter call, you'd felt that maybe that wasn't the factor. So, I guess, I'm trying to understand the change in stance on that issue. Thank you.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Let me take the \u2013 as far as the price increase that we announced in early June and the up to 12% with a 10% average across the board, that's been executed and implemented. With regards to the pre-buy, what we said is there would be a minimal to, we believe, no pre-buy just because of the timing of it, early June. If you look at our AHRI data, we had a very strong April, had a very strong May. And I will tell you, we had a strong June. When you put them all together, we believe the industry is up about 300,000 units. And that would indicate there was some type of pre-buy. The math that we've done, we figure somewhere in the neighborhood of 100,000 to 150,000 units were pulled forward. And I would tell you, that's about a week, maybe even a little bit less. So, it was minimal, but there was a pre-buy, and we felt that it was important for us to explain that to you on the call.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","And we don't know for sure. But I think, as Kevin said, June being up was a surprise to us. And we talked to our customers, and I'd say inventory levels are a little bit heavy, not bad, but a little bit heavy. So, I think we just assume, for the most part, that the June excess was pre-buy. That's our caution (30:34).","Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning, Jeff.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So just on North America, is there a way \u2013 if you look at the 12% growth, is there a way to break out units versus price, and then maybe just speak to what \u2013 I jumped on late. I don't know if you mentioned what boiler growth was in the quarter.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, I'll start. North America, we don't traditionally break out price and volume. But I will tell you, residential volumes were up significantly in the quarter. Commercial volumes were up in the quarter, not as much. Boiler sales were up 10%. I will tell you, Lochinvar, as a whole, was up even more than that, because they were strong in their water heater and their custom commercial water heater. And then you throw in what we talked about North America water treatment of $7 million or so. It's all of those factors come into why volume was very strong in North America.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just it looks like the margins year-to-date are 23%. North America, you're guiding to a lower second half. Can you just speak to why the margins stepped down just given that price seems to be running through?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. And it's really the third quarter. I mean, we would expect fourth quarter margins to be fairly consistent with last year. It's really the third quarter and it's a few factors. One is, we talked about the loss we're going to experience on Lowe's as we buy back the inventory and the transition costs. Much of that hits in the third quarter.","Seasonally, third quarter residential volumes are lower than normal, than the other three, I'll say. And then we think that gets extended because of a little bit of pre-buy. So, I think those are probably the two biggest factors on why the third quarter margins, we would expect, would be down. But, again, fourth quarter back to normal.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then D&A, it looks like you're running \u2013 you're saying $80 million and you're running, I think, $35 million through year-to-date. What's the dynamic there that that steps up?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I would have to look. I think we've obviously had some capital, but I would say that number might be a little bit high.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Charlie Brady of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Pat.","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Can you guys quantify the Lowe's impact that's going to hit in Q3, either dollars or margin wise?","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. Right now, we anticipate Lowe's to be on the sales side about plus $15 million. And then there'll be a loss of about $1 million to $2 million just due to the various transition costs, the displays and so forth that we'll need to do to convert the 1,700-plus stores.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","In the third quarter, it costs us almost 1 point compared to \u2013 if you didn't have North America water treatment and just the other businesses, it costs us almost 1 point.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Got it. Makes sense. And then just in terms of the \u2013 talked about China advertising cost and I guess looking at the Rest of World margins, I mean, and you talked about getting that up. I mean, can you just \u2013 is there something driving a short-term spike in some of that? Is it a function of you trying to get air purification sales up and doing more advertising in that area? Or what's really pushing some of that?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, we have done some of that. We had run some promotions. If you're talking the second quarter, the second quarter is traditionally higher because we have some of the trade shows, et cetera. And so, we have Aquatech, et cetera, et cetera. So, those costs normally are more in the second quarter. We would expect those to come down as we go into the third and fourth quarter.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just one more on the planned efficiency ramp, is that a one quarter kind of ramp or you think we're just going through 2018 and we get the full efficiencies starting in 2019?","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","The inefficiencies will be second quarter, and then part of third. And we look to make up the balance of our deficit by the end of the year. So, it will be contained within the 2018 timeframe.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Halloran of Baird. Your line is now open.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Morning, everyone.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","So, first, just following up on the Lowe's water treatment side. Obviously, you have probably a little bit of revenue on-boarding above trend and then, obviously, the profitability level pressures. Could you help, on an annualized basis, once you get past the startup costs, talk a little bit about what that annual run rate for revenue looks like and then also how you're thinking about profitability on that business?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, I think we talked a little bit about that on the last call, and we had said that next year \u2013 so Lowe's is adding about $15 million this year and we said it could be adding about $20 million incremental next year, so up to $37 million. This year, North America water treatment, because of the one ramping up and then these transition costs are going to be in the high-single digit. But, as we go into next year, I think our focus is \u2013 I think we even talked on the call, to get those to about 13% for the entire business, and then be able to continue to grow that as the Lowe's business continues to grow.","So, as we go down the road, I think we're still focusing on trying to get to that 20%. It's going to take us probably three years to get there, 2019, 2020, 2021, but we think those are achievable as volumes pick up and we get through this transition.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That makes sense relative to previous comments as well. So then the follow-up there from an earlier question. Did I hear right that you said 300,000 units on-boarded for the front half of this year for residential water heaters? Is that accurate?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. I would say we're up a little bit over 300,000, probably in tankless, you're close to 325,000 or so.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And then, full year expectations are in that, what was it, 350,000 to 400,000, kind of implying a slowdown in the back half of the year.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, so what you have is you have to move, right? If you say you're up a little over 300,000 and you expect that about 100,000 of it was maybe a pre-buy that would have had the first half be up closer to 200,000, right? So, I would tell you, the pre-buy is probably the biggest factor in that year-over-year.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. That's what I was looking for. And then, what you're essentially saying then is you normalize for pre-buy relatively smooth consistent underlying demand pattern.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. And I'll tell you, and Kevin can talk better than I can, but I talked to the salespeople couple days ago, and the industry is strong, there's no doubt about it, as they talk to their customers, et cetera, both commercial and residential.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","I would say that it's across the board in our distribution contractors, both businesses, Lochinvar and our U.S. water heater business. There's just a solid trend and good growth rates across the board.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","And we haven't talked enough about Lochinvar, probably. We talked about them being up 8% for the year. First half of the year, they're up over 10% and we expect them, for the year, to be up over 10%. So, that's one of the pluses when we looked at the full year is we're taking Lochinvar up because not only has their first half been strong, their orders are strong, their backlog is strong. And as you look at some of the data, quotes are up. So, we're optimistic on it.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Appreciate the time. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors of Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is now open.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to first talk about the China situation from a bit of a different angle. There has been a lot of talk in some of the popular financial press about branding impacts for American companies more \u2013 that talk's been more on the auto side and things like that. But obviously, your brand is an American brand. It's English characters on the brand and all that, so it's clearly American. And you've got all the saber rattling and there's talk about that having a negative impact on American brands in China. So, what's your take on that? Obviously, it's a tough issue to handicap it with any kind of granularity, but what's your take on that and what are you doing \u2013 you talked about advertising and so forth, what are you doing to kind of ensure that there is no negative impact on the brand with all this talk?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Let me take a stab at that, and I was in China last week. So, this is pretty up to date. There's a lot of chatter in social media and stuff like that. But we haven't seen any impact that we can directly point to it impacting our brand, and we don't really expect it, because compared to much more visible brands like Coca-Cola, or KFC, or Apple, we kind of fly under the radar. So, we don't really expect to have much. In terms of advertising, it's the normal game plan. We're not doing anything too different. We are not pulling back. It's the normal game plan.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. And we probably stopped what, I think we pulled that two years ago focusing that it's an American company.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Right, in terms of our advertising.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Because we had so many different SBUs that we're working with that we had pulled back on that from an advertising two years ago.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Our advertising is much more focused on products, innovation, bringing benefits to the consumers and the markets, rather than what it has in the past.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Right. We started off way back as being U.S. water heater company was the focus of our advertising and our brand. But now our brand has evolved into water technology innovation brand. And so, our old advertising message has evolved with that.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then, I guess, my second one just had to do with Lowe's. And my question is, is there a aftermarket service element to the arrangement with Lowe's? I assume Lowe's play some role in installation. But then in terms of aftermarket servicing on the systems, is that something that's going to be taken care of for the customer through Lowe's or is that something that A. O. Smith is involved directly and how does that work?","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, certainly there's an aftermarket with filters. And so, Lowe's will carry a full line of our filters as far as from a replacement standpoint. So yes, there is some installation which Lowe's will provide on some whole-house activity that we have in products. But overall, the products will have a replacement market for many years as the filters \u2013 the various filters we have are used in and replaced.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Got it. Okay. But in terms of service, you're not involved directly in any kind of service work, not the resell, the filters or the replacement filters, but an actual system troubleshooting if there's a problem or something like that? It's not something that...","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","No, we're not involved in that at all.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thanks for your time.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","I'll just add to that, we'll have toll-free numbers and call centers and so forth to walk people through. So yes, we'll be involved in, if they need some questions, certainly, we'll have some items on the Internet to walk them through the process. But overall, to service them on an ongoing basis now.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Got it. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Just a question on China again. If you think about the situation there, you've got a slowing macro, you've got high channel inventories. In the Western world, this would be ripe for some very aggressive promotional sort of channel clearing. Maybe in China, business practices are a little bit different. But given that you're up against Midea and Haier, which are both pretty aggressive players, it would seem to me that the promotional environment must be picking up here pretty aggressively. And I was just wondering if I can get you to comment, and maybe Ajita, you mentioned you just got back. What are you seeing there in terms of inflection in promotional activity and how is that likely to impact the margin play here in the second half?","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, there has certainly been quite a bit of promotional activity by various competitors. We talked about that during the air purification. Our approach is we certainly have many programs to move our inventory and we'll do some promotions, some bundling. We'll do it in a systematic way. We'll also do it looking at where our inventories are at, what categories do we have higher inventories, and we'll continue to move that forward. But our approach will be not \u2013 it will be, again, a thoughtful, a systematic approach to reducing inventories over time. And we're going to be looking to reduce our inventory somewhere in the neighborhood about 30 days by the end of the year.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","And it's the balance between how do we get the inventories down by \u2013 but still maintaining the type of price points that our brand calls for. So, it's that balance and our team is very good at doing that and has done it in the past, and we are very comfortable with the programs that we have. And we tend to, as Kevin said, bundle with other products and promote in that manner. So in that sense, it is somewhat different in China than the U.S. market.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Do you sense that your channel inventory situation is unique to you and your competitors are not seeing a similar situation, or do you feel like maybe all the major players are dealing with this inventory surplus?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","We don't know. We don't really have any data that can say what the other competitors are like in terms of inventories. But the slowdown has to be hitting everybody.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I'm just wondering...","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","We don't see the numbers. From a share standpoint haven't moved much. So as Ajita said, we don't know, but you have to assume everybody's kind of in the same.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Sure, that would make sense. I guess that you've always demonstrated tremendous price discipline and you talked about your commitment to continuing to do that. I'm just wondering how you manage \u2013 maintain that first discipline dealing with this inventory and also maybe competitors that aren't quite as disciplined and historically haven't been. How do you manage those potentially mutually exclusive goals?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","It's a tough balance, but it's a day-to-day management of it. And in fact, there is channel conflict and pricing conflict and things like that in the market. And we try to stay very disciplined. And in fact, some of our customers, especially e-commerce customers, have come back to us and complimented us on managing that whole process as best we can, given the rules and the laws and what we can do and what's under our control.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Right. Well, you've got a history of doing well there, so good luck with that. Second question, if I could, is just on your raw material inflation. What's your expected second half steel cost inflation versus the first half?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Up significantly. It really started, as we said, there's a three, three-plus month delay depending on the situation. So, we've said that on the last call that first quarter \u2013 the second quarter was up, but the last half of the year was up significantly. And that's why we had this price increase, matches up with that pretty well.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. Is there any chance of getting a little more granularity than up significantly?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","No. But I mean I can tell you these facts. I can tell you how much steel is up. Steel is up from the end of the year, it's up 20-some-percent. It's up 20% from the first of the year. Hot rolled is up 41%. When we talked in April, hot rolled is up even more from that, while cold rolled has steadied, which is good. And again, a lot of that impact is coming in the second half of the year.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","But those are spot price dynamics, I'm guessing through your contracts...","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","No, we end up getting price off of spot, to a degree. So, I mean, plus or minus. So...","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. Because even though we have contracts, they're based off of pricing indices, the steel indices.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","So, I guess, you can assume that the majority of that increase is in the second half.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And presumably, those contracts, there's some leakage of inflation coming through. So, you're not getting perfectly fixed costs there? As the spot price is increasing, you're getting some \u2013 leakage of that inflation is coming through your contracts?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I'm not sure what you mean, but I guess we're not going to get into details of the contract with our suppliers.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Well, thanks for the detail that you provided. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alvaro Lacayo of Gabelli. Your line is now open.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Good morning, everyone.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","So I just wanted to start with the Rest of World. Two questions, one, for that 5% organic China growth number or if you want to just talk about the first half, the 4% organic number, how much of that was volume driven? And maybe comment just on water heater and water treatment products, separately. And then, can you quantify the inefficiencies from the water treatment plant? And with regards to the delay of the product launch, if the inefficiencies had anything to do with that? And if not, what was the cause of the delay of the product launch?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I'll start with the last. The cause was it's a complex product and that we were in the process of moving a major plant from one to another. So, those were the two factors that entered into where we thought we would have that product, which is going to help us on the online in the first half. And now, it's going to be probably later third quarter, I think.","But when you look at volumes, volumes in the first half of the year, water treatment was up significantly. I don't have the percentage in front of me, 10-plus percent. So, there was some price in there. And I think water heater volumes were up a little bit, as the transition continues, where electric was down a little bit, but gas was up. And then we had some pricing in effect. So I don't know if that answers all your questions or not.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Yeah, it does. Thank you. And just the inefficiencies, is there a dollar amount with regards to how...","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","So, I mean, if you break out the efficiencies, so if I look at that $5 million we talked about hit this year, the efficiencies (sic) [inefficiencies] hit in the second quarter primarily. It's really three pieces. I'll tell you, the electricity, because of the size of the plant, is probably about $2 million of that increase. The depreciation is about $ 1 million for the remainder of the year. So, you have that $3 million. And you had efficiencies (sic) [inefficiencies] running first half, first half and the first and third quarter, and what Kevin's saying, by the end of the year, we start offsetting those efficiencies.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","So, that's how you end up in kind of the $5 million-ish.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Got it.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","And I'll tell you, the plant \u2013 the feedback I received, the transition's going well. It's producing at the levels we thought or better. So, those numbers are well within line, what we told you.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","But it was a major move.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Major move.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","It's a major move.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Got you. Okay. And then in North America water treatment, if you can maybe update us on just the organic sort of industry growth that you're seeing. And then just from a selling point expansion standpoint, what kind of opportunities you have, if you can quantify that in any way, that'll support that 14%-plus growth rates or even higher than that going forward.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, so I think we've talked about, and it depends if you're talking softening, you're talking about treating, et cetera, I think the numbers we've seen this year is kind of high-single digit kind of increases. I think what we confidently can do is leverage our distribution channel. So, we've talked about expanding it ultimately to plumbers. We think we're the premier online seller of water treatment. Now as we get in Lowe's and we're able to leverage that role, I think as we look at those opportunities and bring new products, I think we're comfortable as we look out for that 14%-plus growth for North America water treatment for the next several years.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. And I would just add the dealer network that we have and continue to expand and grow that in the markets that we have some gaps in. So, overall, the wholesale business is still very early stages. Plumbers are very early stages. Dealers, we're continuing to expand; and Lowe's, we're just in the process of getting in the store. So, you put that all together and you look forward, the water treatment business has a good runway heading into 2019 and beyond.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","And also, when you look at the opportunity, I mean, the awareness of how good our water is in the country is getting more and more. And the whole water treatment category in North America, I think, has tremendous opportunity to grow very fast.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Great. Thank you very much and congratulations to Ajita and Kevin on the transitions.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thanks.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry De Maria of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Curious. I believe you guys said you want to reduce inventory by 30 days, I guess, by the end of the year, I think, is what you said. Just curious, what is the normal level of inventory? Obviously, it's at least a month different than that. And would that be normalized? If you get it down 30 days, going into next year, if we have a similar rate of growth, call it, mid singles in local in China, would that be an adequate inventory reduction or would that require further inventory reduction next year?","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","I would tell you that that is going to be a move in the right direction. If we're close to where we want to be, we'd probably like to drive it down just a little bit more over time. But, again, moving to 30 days would get us right into the level that we think is appropriate going forward.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And you're moving it down to 30 days or you're moving it down by 30 days? I'm just trying to understand what's the normal level of inventory in the market?","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","I'm sorry. Moving it down by 30 days.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Down by 30. And what would that be then? That's like you end up with a quarter's worth of inventory? How big is the inventory normally?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","That would be a little bit less than a quarter.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, bit little less than a quarter.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","(55:04) level.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Little less than a quarter. That's great. Thank you.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","And that's kind of what we run. Days kind of in the 70, 80, 85 range.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Given the complexity of the channels, that's about the level that's required to keep it efficiently moving.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","(55:20).","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. So, it can't go down much more than that. And then, secondly, are you guys dramatically rethinking the China air purification strategy long term? And to also be clear, can we get that to breakeven next year if we have, obviously, continued volume headwinds there?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","My answer is no, we don't if we continue to have volume headwind. Kevin can talk about the new product we're bringing out and...","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. At this time, we're certainly committed to the air purification market. Granted there has been some \u2013 the air and the things we've talked about in the past. But you look at the products that we recently introduced that are going to address formaldehyde, and that's a year-around issue within most Chinese homes, that's still in the very early stages. As we have mentioned in past that we remain committed. Our engineering product development continues to move forward. And it's early, but we still believe there is a place in air purification for A. O. Smith and the products that we can bring to market through our distribution.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I mean, it's like we talked about on the last call is what is \u2013 some of the stuff that the government's doing, is that sustainable from an air standpoint, and time will tell.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Right.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","It's difficult to shut down plants and do some of the things they're doing and have that impact on business. So, we'll see if they continue to do that in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this coming year.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Right. And I think just to expand on that a little, when you look at the air quality in China, it's impacted by two things. One is what's outside in the environment, and that's what we kind of focus on and that's driven by pollution and coal-fired power plants and all of that stuff, cars and all that.","Then there's also the air quality that's impacted from the inside of the apartment or the home, which comes from furniture and the glues that are used in furniture, and things like that. And this is where the formaldehyde comes out. And as we've talked before, if you recall, a few years back, we had the Lumber Liquidators issue, et cetera, which was the formaldehyde concerns in this country. And that was driven by the glues and the adhesive used in cheaper-quality furniture. Okay? So, that's another issue that's very prevalent in China.","We have the products that Kevin talked about that we just introduced. It's the only credible product in the market today that addresses that formaldehyde issue. Now, certainly, there'll be other products that follow. But we feel that with this and the initial \u2013 it's very early because we just introduced it. But the initial reaction from the marketplace, especially our retailers, has been very positive.","So, we feel there is going to be a market. We are going to be in the air purification market. The size of the market we can't tell, which is why we are being conservative in pulling it down, because we don't know how sustainable the actions that the Chinese government has taken to clean up the outside air is going to be. But the inside part, the pollution caused by furniture, et cetera, that's going to be there for a while. There's no indication there's anything happening to address that, and we have the products to address that.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","To address your earnings question, I think everybody at this table and Chinese management realizes we can't lose $8 million on a $25 million business. But I will tell you we spent a lot on engineering this year to bring the formaldehyde product, we'll bring a fresh-air product to market late in the year, but we all understand you can't lose $8 million on that size business. So, there will be an improvement. We just can't add $25 million sale be breakeven.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. We won't get to breakeven, but there will be...","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","But there'll be improvement.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","...there'll be certainly improvement.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. That's really helpful. Thank you and good luck to you all.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Cohen of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.","Andrew Cohen - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thanks. Very nice quarter. My question and I don't know how well you can quantify it, but you're talking about the Chinese housing market slowing or flattening. But one of the underlying things that's supposed to be supporting you is the growth in the upper middle class. And I'm just wondering if that is also mitigated with the slowdown or if they're independent variables?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","I think they're independent. I think the growth in the middle class and the move in the middle class or the massive amount of people moving into the middle class is continuing. Those macro drivers in China, the indicators are very strong and continuing. And in addition to that, the move made by the Chinese government to move their economy to be much more consumption-based and less dependent on exports, all that is happening. And all of those things and all of those drivers are very positive for our business long term. We have the short-term impact of housing, and we expect that that's going to come back. It has to come back at some point. We just don't know when.","Andrew Cohen - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thanks. My other question, it's actually fairly simple, but this formaldehyde and the furniture issue that you brought up, does that exist in India as well?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","I don't know the answer to that question. There is certainly an air purification opportunity in India. We haven't fully investigated it yet. The issues in the Indian market are different. The homes are built differently. So, it's not a one-to-one match, but there certainly is an opportunity.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","But the price point is...","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","The price point's high.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","...is much different in India.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Right.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","So, that's why we're not focusing on it at this point.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Right. Price points in, really, all appliances are different in India.","Andrew Cohen - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you.

I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Patricia Ackerman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin, ma'am.","Patricia Ackerman","Thank you, Earl. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2015 second quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release. Ajita, I will now turn the call over to you.","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you, Pat; and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We set sales and earnings records again in the second quarter. Higher-than expected volumes of residential and commercial water heaters, earlier realization of higher pricing associated with NAECA III compliant water heaters, improved performance at Lochinvar, as well as lower than expected material costs resulted in stronger performance in the second quarter than we originally projected.","Here are a few highlights. Organic growth in both of our segments drove sales 10% higher to a quarterly record of $654 million. China sales were up 15%. Net earnings of $0.79 per share were 20% higher than the adjusted earnings per share of $0.66 in 2014. We continued to review our capital allocation and dedicated a portion to return to shareholders. In addition to our regular dividend, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares for $27 million during the second quarter. Our transition to NAECA III compliant products is complete. This is a very complex, complex project, impacting approximately 80% of our residential water heaters.","I'm now going to hand it over to John, who will describe the results in more detail.","John Kita","Thank you, Ajita. Sales in the second quarter of 654 million were 10% higher than the previous year. Net earnings of 71 million were 18% higher than second quarter adjusted earnings in 2014. Net earnings EPS of $0.79 per share improved 20% compared with adjusted earnings per share of $0.66 in 2014.","Sales in our North America segment of 443 million increased 8% over 2014, driven by a price increase effective in April for both commercial and residential water heaters in the U.S. as well as higher sales of Lochinvar-branded products. Rest-of-world segment sales of 221 million increased 14% compared with 2014.","China sales increased 15%, driven by higher demand for water heaters and the water treatment products. North America operating earnings of 86 million were 28% higher than adjusted segment operating earnings in the previous year, and the operating margin of 19.4% was significantly above the 16.4% adjusted operating margin one year ago. The favorable impact from higher water heater prices in the U.S. and Canada, higher boiler sales, and lower material costs was partially offset by approximately 4 million in expected incremental ERP implementation costs.","Rest of world operating earnings of 31 million improved compared with 2014 due to higher profits in China. Operating margin of 14% fell from the previous year due to higher selling and advertising costs as a percentage of sales in China, including promotion related to the Company's new air purifier product and larger expenditures in India to support the launch of our water treatment products.","Our corporate expenses declined modestly from the adjusted corporate expenses the prior year. Cash provided by continuing operations during the first half of 2015 was 59 million compared with 91 million provided in 2014. Higher earnings were more than offset by larger outlays for working capital in the 2015 period.","Increases in accounts receivable balances, primarily driven by higher sales was a major driver of higher working capital requirements in 2015. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remained strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 16% at the end of June 2015. We have cash balances totaling 552 million located offshore, and our current net cash position was approximately 273 million at the end of June.","During the first half of the year, we repurchased approximately 730,000 shares of common stock for a total of $47 million under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan. We had approximately 1.8 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of June.","Depending on factors such as stock price, working capital requirements, and alternative investment opportunities, we expect to spend approximately 125 million on share repurchase activity in 2015, resulting in net cash levels similar to 2014 year-end levels.","This is a $25 million increase in our expected share repurchases due to projected improvement in earnings and cash flow. And it is consistent with our stated capital allocation strategy. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2015 to be approximately $300 million. We expect capital expenditures to be between 100 million and 110 million in 2015, which includes approximately 20 million to support the ERP implementation and approximately 30 million related to capacity expansions in China and in the U.S., with the U.S. portion in support of Lochinvar-branded sales.","Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately 65 million in 2015. We successfully completed our first two ERP go-live milestones in August 2014 and May 2015. We expect to convert all of our major North America plant sites by the end of 2016.","ERP implementation expenses were 14 million in 2014 and are projected to be 19 million to 20 million in 2015. As we expected, the incremental ERP costs occurred in the first half of 2015. We estimate our effective tax rate to be approximately 30.5% in 2015, higher than earlier projections due to a change in our geographic earnings mix. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $45 million in 2015.","This morning we increased our 2015 EPS guidance to be between $3.04 and $3.09 per share. The midpoint of our upgraded EPS guidance represents a $0.30 per share increase over our previous guidance and a 26% increase in EPS compared with our 2014 adjusted results.","I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the assumptions in our 2015 outlook and our growth strategy. Ajita?","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you, John. As John mentioned, the midpoint of our updated 2015 guidance implies growth of 26% over last year. Our outlook for 2015 includes the following assumptions. First, we continue to expect strong, profitable growth in China, driven by expected and continued overall water heater market growth, including an emerging replacement demand, which is most prominent in Tier 1 cities; market share gain; expanded distribution; improved product mix; and significant water treatment product growth.","Collectively, we expect these drivers to deliver growth at two times China's GDP growth rate. China inventory levels at our seven largest distributors are about the same as last March but up about $10 million from the end of last year and from a year ago. As we have expressed in the past, China inventories can rise as customers increase orders ahead of buying holidays or to ensure volume incentives. We are watching China inventories, as they are higher than normal.","We do not expect the 30% decline in the Shanghai Stock Exchange Index to have a meaningful impact on the economy or our sales due to a number of factors. There is relatively low participation in the stock market by urban households. We estimate that to be around -- less than 10%. Stock holdings represent 10% to 15% of household wealth, and we have seen no historical evidence to support correlation between consumption and stock market level.","Despite the recent decline, the stock market is up about 70% from last July. There was relatively low impact on retail appliance sales and our China sales when the China stock market corrected in 2008. And also, we do not view water heaters or water treatment systems to be discretionary purchases in China. Our second major assumption: we announced to our U.S. customers an average residential price increase of approximately 20% on NAECA III compliant products.","We also announced a price increase on our U.S. and Canada commercial water heaters and non-NAECA III compliant residential water heaters. The price increases became effective in April. The magnitude of the NAECA pre-buy now appears to be lower than we expected, and we have increased our U.S. residential water heater industry volume forecast to add an incremental 150,000 units, or 1% to 2%, over last year.","We also increased our full year outlook for the U.S. commercial water heater industry and expect growth of 3% to 4% in 2015 after a strong first half.","Third major assumption, we forecast Lochinvar branded product sales to continue to grow at 10%, keeping pace with the annual growth rates we have achieved since purchasing the business in 2011.","This is well ahead of GDP growth rates in the U.S., and we believe our Lochinvar brand will continue to benefit from the expected transition from lower-efficiency non-condensing boilers to high-efficiency condensing boilers and new products driven by market-leading innovation.","The acceptance of our newly-introduced expansion of the CREST boiler family, which targets the 750,000 to 2 million BTU portion of the condensing boiler market segment, continues to be very strong. We launched these products earlier this year in advance of the 2015-2016 heating season.","Fourth major assumption, we continue to seek ways to leverage our very strong brand and distribution channels in China. Launching an A. O. Smith branded water treatment product line in 2010 was our first foray into a new product category in the region.","Growing A. O. Smith branded water treatments from $18 million in 2012 to predicted sales of over $100 million in 2015 continues to prove the power and the value of our A. O. Smith brand distribution and infrastructure in China.","Our experienced Chinese management team continues to leverage these assets to succeed in the very competitive and crowded Chinese marketplace.","China Market Monitor, or CMM, estimates that the point-of-use residential water treatment category in China will grow 35% to 40% per year over the next five years. And we are excited about the opportunity and very pleased with the market share gains we have achieved through leveraging our engineering, distribution, and brand strength.","In China our brand attributes include quality, reliability, safety, and trust. These attributes translate very well to air purifiers which, along with water treatment products, are among the fastest growing home appliance categories in China, as measured by CMM.","We launched the A. O. Smith brand air purifier in China late in the first quarter of 2015. An investment for the future, our air purifier sales are expected to be approximately $8 million to $10 million in 2015, with losses of approximately $4 million primarily related to advertising and promotion costs.","Fifth, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity in India, and we are committed to the country with the second largest population and the second fastest growing economy in the world and its developing middle class, who desire quality-of-life products.","India is an investment for the future and the $7.5 million loss we expect this year is similar to 2014 and includes higher product development and advertising costs related to the launch of water treatment products.","We expect our overall sales in India to be approximately $20 million in 2015. We believe our 8% organic growth potential for the next several years differentiates A. O. Smith among other industrial companies.","In fact, we expect North America water heater sales will grow faster than 4% in 2015 due to the April 2015 pricing action in the U.S. and Canada and result in total company sales growth of approximately 11%. Our historical organic growth rate and lack of currency exposure to the volatile Euro increases our comfort with our growth forecast.","Our acquisition strategy has not changed. We remain focused on water heating and water treating companies around the world as well as leveraging our brand and distribution channels in China. The acquisition landscape continues to be very expensive, as sustained price appreciation in equity markets, lower financing costs, and the lack of organic growth for many strategic buyers drive higher multiples in prices.","Our teams are energetic, engaged, and disciplined. Our capital deployment strategies continue to support a combination of investments for organic growth, acquisition, share repurchase, and dividends.","You have seen our investment criteria before, and we show this only as a reminder that we will continue to be a financially disciplined acquirer of companies within our stated corporate strategy.","And this concludes our prepared remarks, and we have now time for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your question please.","Robert Paul McCarthy","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on an excellent quarter. I guess the first question would be, if you are thinking about 2016 in terms of anniversarying kind of the factors around the pre-buy and how we are thinking about it -- now, I know you are not initiating 2016 guidance here. But can we think of, qualitatively, about the factors that are going to impact kind of growth in North America in your business in 2016? Or how should we be thinking about it, because it's going to be difficult to model, because we just had such a strong year this year.","John Kita","Well, you are right. We have not looked at the 2016 plan yet. We'll do that later in the third and fourth quarter. I think from a modeling standpoint, we are very comfortable still with that 8% to 9% organic growth that we have consistently talked about. So from a top line, we think that's very achievable. And from a margin standpoint, we've said we are going to try to continue to increase margins. Obviously there's factors that affect that, including steel costs, which are volatile, et cetera. But again, we haven't really done the modeling yet for 2016.","Ajita Rajendra","Yes. And I think, to add to what John said, the 8% to 9% is driven by a number of assumptions which we have talked about, which include North America, which we feel is going to be a little stronger because of the pricing action for NAECA III products and also China, driven by two times GDP and Chinese GDP. We are very comfortable with the overall guidance that we've been giving and that also includes the Lochinvar growing at 10%.","Robert Paul McCarthy","And just a follow-up on the comments -- which we appreciate, obviously, about the context around China and the inventory -- when do you think you are going to have a better sense of how you think the growth trajectory is going to play out kind of into 2016 from moderating the inventory levels? When do you think we will get a better sense from your customer distribution base in terms of how to -- thinking about planning for next year, given the inventory levels you cited?","John Kita","As Ajita just said, I think we're comfortable with that two-times GDP. You have seen the model, Rob, on how we've grown water treatment from an ancillary product line -- continues to grow significantly. It was 75 million this year. It will be over 100 million next year. So that's certainly -- we expect that to continue as the market continues to grow.","We've said consistently we think the water heater market in China will grow somewhere in that 7% range, helped by higher replacement, which we're certainly seeing in Tier 1 city. And you know, the third bucket we've talked about is gaining market share, which we're continuing to do on the GAF side. We're adding distribution; we're over 7,500 outlets. And we'll continue to have higher price increases at higher price as we bring products to market that have values and features the consumer wants.","So the model we have to grow the business, we think, is intact. You're going to have some lumpiness on a quarterly basis, when you might have higher inventories because of VIP incentives that they are trying to get, etcetera. We don't necessarily look at a quarter-to-quarter. What we're looking at is full-year of that two-times GDP.","Robert Paul McCarthy","Thanks. I'll leave it there for now. Congratulations on an excellent quarter.","John Kita","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies. Your question please.","Scott Graham","Good morning, and nice quarter, you guys. I did also want to ask about China, because obviously the overriding driver to your sales there is GDP, but sort of de facto GDP. It's more, from what we've discussed, household formations. Like you, it doesn't seem as if household formations are going to slow a lot because the stock market slows. But there could be some temporary disruptions. And so I guess what I'm wondering is: is the combination of that -- if that's in your thinking, in fact -- plus the little bit of higher inventory could give us just some China sales numbers in the second half of the year that may be more toward, let's say, the 10% rather than the 15% growth?","John Kita","I think, Scott, overall -- as John said -- we try not to react too much to the quarterly ups and downs. And we're very comfortable with the two-times GDP guidance for the year.","Scott Graham","Yes.","John Kita","And like I said, and you indicated, we are not concerned about the stock market and the impact, because I listed out the reasons we are not. And everything that we check on and the people we consult reconfirm to us that that's going to have little to no impact on, as you mentioned, household formation and the other drivers that really drive our volume.","Scott Graham","Okay. Got you. Two other questions -- the price increase that you have the higher-priced versions of the water heater units that went out the door in the second quarter -- when did that actually start? Was that a middle-of-a-quarter phenomenon? You said it didn't really affect as much as you thought. My sense was that you guys were thinking sort of May. Did it actually happen in May, or was it -- you know, the higher-priced units start to go out the door earlier than that, in fact?","John Kita","They actually went out earlier, Scott. We would've said -- we thought the industry would be down over 10% in the second quarter year-over-year for both residential and commercial. And we thought there would be a little bit of a lull after \u2013 you know, we could only manufacture the old one from April 2015, and the new one we started manufacturing on April 2016. We thought there would be a little bit of a lull, but we really did not see that.","Essentially, the residential and commercial markets, we're thinking, are going to be about flat year-over-year for the quarter. And that surprised us. But the benefit of that is we have higher volumes than we thought. We also started selling the higher priced NAECA units earlier than what we thought. And so if you ask me when, I guess I would say kind of third \u2013 you know, third \u2013 certainly sometime last half of April, we started seeing the benefit of that. And that was earlier than we thought.","Scott Graham","And last question is: you indicated the incremental upward change on North America water heater volumes within your view. Could you just remind me what your view is on North America residential water heater volumes for 2015?","John Kita","So last year it was 9.2 million units. We said we thought there was some pre-buy in the last half of the year, and that it was going to be flat to up very slightly is what we said in the first quarter. Now, based on what we've seen in the first quarter and the second quarter, we would say industry units will be up 150,000 to 200,000 units, so somewhere in that 9.350 million to 9.4 million range.","Scott Graham","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Northland Capital. Your question please.","Noah Duke Kaye","Thank you. Good morning, Ajita, John, and Pat. How are you?","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning.","Noah Duke Kaye","First, maybe we could start on the gross margin line. At a 40%-plus gross margin, I would love to unpack that a little bit. You mentioned lower steel prices. You have also had the price increase. I know in the past you have said that you didn't think that gross margins would benefit necessarily from the price increases. And then, as you said, the volumes in some parts of the business have been stronger, leading to capacity utilization. So I would love to just kind of get a sense of what was the biggest driver among those three things in contributing to the higher margins? And how do you think about this? Is this a sustainable gross margin level over the next several quarters into 2016?","John Kita","Well, so gross margins were up significantly. And it was primarily in North America, and it was a combination \u2013 Lochinvar and a very, very good quarter and year-to-date. So their margins were up several points. And on North America, margins were up. And as we had talked about, we had some price increases for commercial and non-NAECA III products due to wage and medical cost inflation. So that went in place during the quarter.","We had two price increases in Canada during the first half of the year, and then we had higher-priced NAECA products, which had higher cost. But in addition, what you said is material costs did come down during the quarter and that benefited. So it was primarily in North America, and it was a combination of items.","Now, to your next question, I think obviously there is \u2013 volume that can skew that. I think you are aware, when you look at the history of the water heater industry, the third quarter normally represents about 22% to 23% in the volumes, which -- so that can theoretically affect gross margins. But I mean, I think at current price and current material costs, those margins are reasonable on a several quarter basis.","Noah Duke Kaye","Okay. Very helpful. Second question, we've been hearing even more recently a possibility by Congress to enact legislation that would include repatriation connected to the Highway Trust Fund. I'm sure you're watching that closely. You have talked about this in the past, but can you just remind us, first, if there were to be a repatriation, have you already assumed for income statement accounting purposes that the cash is coming home? And I guess the second there would be, if there were to be such a repatriation, how might that impact your views on doing foreign acquisitions? Thanks.","Ajita Rajendra","Well, a portion of it -- we do have accrual for a portion of it. It's approximately $200 million coming back home. So we do have an accrual on the books for that. Congress and the administration have talked about this probably four or five times over the last two years. So at this point we are not holding our breath on this happening. But we're happy to hear they are talking about it.","And depending on what the cost is to bring it back, right now, in our mind, it's prohibitive to bring it back. So depending on what the cost is, we'll certainly consider that. But I think we've said all along -- and I don't think these changes it \u2013 that we're looking globally for acquisitions. And I think we'll continue to do that. So I wouldn't see us necessarily bringing back everything immediately, by any means. But we'll certainly evaluate it. We certainly do hope it goes through.","Noah Duke Kaye","Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Congrats on the quarter.","Ajita Rajendra","Thanks.","John Kita","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital. Your question, please.","Jeffrey Hammond","Hi, good morning guys.","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning.","John Kita","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Hammond","Can you just \u2013 so back to the North America margins, I mean, it seems like the big variable going forward is really input costs. And if those go back up, then maybe this margin is not sustainable. But it doesn't seem like there's any real aberrations in the margin.","Ajita Rajendra","No, nothing significant from an aberration standpoint. No unusual items in the quarter.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay. And then can you just talk about how ERP rolls off into 2016?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, we're looking at that as our planning process. We said this year we'll spend $19 million to $20 million in expense. Our best guess is that will be similar to maybe up a little bit next year, as we take more sites on in 2016. But we're evaluating that right now. We did our Johnson City plant, as we said, in August 2014. We did Lochinvar in May of this year. And given some of the NAECA items that have developed along the way, because it's been all-hands-on-deck from a NAECA standpoint \u2013 we probably will not do any more sites in 2015.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay. And just finally, on NAECA III, have you seen any dislocation from competitors, where you've been able to maybe perform better in the near-term or capture share? Or is everyone kind of transitioning well?","Ajita Rajendra","I mean, as I think we talked about last time, we weren't expecting anyone to really have any significant hiccups. So this has been in process for quite some time. From what we see, there really has not been much in the way of share changes during the first half of the year.","John Kita","Yeah. We didn't model anything or expect anything. And it's kind of playing out.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group. Question please sir.","William Bremer","Good morning, Ajita, John, Pat. Outstanding quarter.","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you.","John Kita","Hi, Bill.","William Bremer","Hey, good morning. My first question \u2013 and maybe you could just help me out on this \u2013 is on the China market: what is the breakdown of, say, replacement versus new? I know you emphasized Tier 1 replacement in your remarks, but can you give us a sense of what's currently the run rate there or the split there?","John Kita","I can tell you, based on our survey data, there is no good data put out by the government on that, or at least we haven't found it. But when we look at our surveys that we have of people that bought, when I was over there two or three years ago and I ask every time I'm over there \u2013 they had talked about Tier 1 cities kind of being in the 35% range or whatever. And as we've been over there more recently, the talk is closer to 50% in Tier 1 cities. And that's logical, because you've now got pretty high penetration rates in Tier 1 cities for water heaters. So now we talk about our life being eight years. We're not going to comment on the life of what our competitors are, but at eight years you'll start having some replacement. So we think it's a bigger piece of the pot. And quite frankly, it will probably grow into bigger pieces of pot, especially in Tier 1 cities.","Ajita Rajendra","And also I think, Bill, anecdotally our brand is positioned at the high end. It's an aspirational brand. So as people's incomes get higher, and they replace, then if they decide on buying a better brand, then they gravitate more towards A. O. Smith. So it was a combination of all of that. But as John said, we don't really have any good quantitative data to back it up.","William Bremer","Right. Now, shifting to Lochinvar, seems as though it's been stellar, stellar performance. The market is starting to gravitate towards it. You are doing more and more fabrication for some top clients. And now we are starting to see it truly accelerate. Could you give us a sense of, first \u2013 not only the expansion, but give us a sense of the contribution to the quarter as well as the aftermarket?","John Kita","Well, I'll start, and then Ajita can fill in. The aftermarket was up about 9%, which has been pretty consistent with what we had expected. Their commercial market has been very strong. We have talked about beginning of the year we thought the commercial industry for water heaters would be flat, and now we're talking it's going to be up 3%. They are continuing to see very strong commercial build. As I alluded to earlier, their margin points are up several points in the first half of the year. Their sales are up over 10% the first half of the year and their business continues to do very, very well. It's helped, obviously, by the new products that have come out. They expanded their line on the CREST down to 750,000 BTU. They bought out a fire tube boiler in the smaller range, and that's doing well. So all in all, Lochinvar had a great first half of the year. And they contributed to the performance in North America.","Ajita Rajendra","And you know, the only thing I would add to that is that the strategy behind Lochinvar is new products and coming out with new things. And we continue to invest in that area. As you saw during the Analyst Day, we are expanding our capacity in terms of engineering and testing capability and expanding the factory. And all of that is going well. And we will continue to invest in the key drivers, which is technology and being first to market with the best products in the marketplace.","William Bremer","Right.","Ajita Rajendra","And it's working.","William Bremer","I appreciate it. My last question is on the operating margins in North America. Very solid. The 19.4% -- that includes the 4 million of ERP systems, correct?","Ajita Rajendra","Right. Well, the incremental of ERP. So I mean you can kind of look at -- we're talking about $20 million of expenditures in 2015. And it's roughly flat lined, 5 million a quarter -- not quite, but about 5 million a quarter. What we're saying is last year in the quarter, it was about 1 million or so. And so there was an incremental four. So second quarter compared to third quarter ERP costs this year will be relatively similar.","William Bremer","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instruction] Our next question comes from Todd Vencil from Sterne Agee. Your question please.","Todd Vencil","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","John Kita","Hi, Todd.","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning.","Todd Vencil","I want to focus in on the margin in North America again I know you've had a few questions on it and given a few answers, but it was a big number, so I really want to make sure I understand it. John, you laid out the factors, and you kind of talked about them. Is there any way you can sort of size up how much was price and how much was sort of lower materials costs and things like that in terms of maybe the incremental operating profit in North America in the quarter? Or is that just kind of too hard to do?","Ajita Rajendra","Yes. We really are not going to break that out. And it's difficult to get your hands around it. But those -- the pieces I alluded to, the Canadian price increase, the price increase on non-NAECA, Lochinvar, the sale of higher-priced NAECA product, and lower material costs -- all of those where relatively significant factors in the improvement.","Todd Vencil","Got it. And can you maybe let me know how much those -- you know, I think you have talked about the NAECA -- the step-up on the NAECA-compliant product being about 20%. Can you remind me what the price increases were on the other products?","Ajita Rajendra","I think we said that they were -- commercial, we said there was a wide range depending on the geographic location and the type of product. I think you are probably somewhere in the high single digits on the other type products.","Todd Vencil","Got it. That's helpful. And on the lower raw materials, is that something that per your -- either your arrangements with distributors and customers or, given the competitive environment, that you are enjoying it for now but going to end up giving back? Or do you think you get to hold onto that raw material benefit?","John Kita","Ajita, he was asking about raw material costs and pass-throughs etcetera. On wholesale, it's done traditionally through price adjustments, price increases or decreases, depending on the marketplace. But there is no direct pass-through on the wholesale side.","Todd Vencil","No. Yes.","John Kita","Retail with some of our customers -- we do have some pass-through of steel, etcetera.","Todd Vencil","Would those be kind of yet to come? Or those have impacted?","John Kita","I think they vary. They go in different cycles. And some of them are sooner than others. But they tend to be a little bit after.","Todd Vencil","Okay. And so if I kind of look at that 19.4% margin in North America, it feels like there's a whole lot that went right in the quarter. So would you think, like, a 19%-plus level is sustainable? Or just going to continue to kind of trend higher on a trailing four-quarter basis, or something like that?","John Kita","Well, I think I alluded to it. I think the 19.4 -- what it was, based on current prices and current material costs and the continued strength in the commercial market -- which, remember, helps two of our operations; it helps our commercial water heater, and it helps our Lochinvar, which are higher-margin business. We are not uncomfortable with that range, given those factors.","Ajita Rajendra","Yes, and I think the key -- the wildcard is material costs. That can have an impact.","Todd Vencil","Well, I'll put steel on my screen, then, and keep an eye on that. Final question, kind of relatedly, kind of not: how does the inventory in the channel look? I know you were expecting some -- I guess a lot of guys were buying the non-NAECA III compliant. And I'm speaking -- I know you have talked about China, so I mean specifically about the U.S. now. But for you guys and for your customers, how do you feel like the inventory looks?","Ajita Rajendra","Maybe I'll take a stab, and John, you add to it. You know, unfortunately the visibility of inventory in most of our channels is very tough. Okay? In wholesale it's very difficult to take a look at. The retail side -- it's a little easier. And China, like I said, China is the one that -- again, it's an estimate. We feel it's a little on the high side, but not higher than last quarter. It's higher than the end of the year or from one year ago. But again, this tends to be lumpy sometimes when you look at it quarter-by-quarter because of the fact, as we have talked about in terms of people trying -- sometimes buying in to hit volume targets -- quarterly volume targets for VIPs; sometimes buying in for holidays, etcetera., that have high sales. So we're watching it. We are not concerned about it, but we are watching it.","John Kita","When we look -- Todd, when we look at North America, as Ajita said, we don't have great visibility. But when we talk to our customers, our impression is that levels might be slightly elevated -- but not to any significant level, which is good. And that's why we felt comfortable increasing the full-year residential and commercial, because of our understanding of what's in the channel. Again, with the caveat we don't have great visibility. But certainly, we talk to our customers.","Ajita Rajendra","Right. So bottom line, we are comfortable with the annual guidance. And we are not overly -- we are watching, but not overly concerned about the inventory levels.","Todd Vencil","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Connors from Boenning & Scattergood. Your question please.","Ryan Connors","Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of different type questions. First off, it was our understanding that there was an effort in the Senate to exempt certain water heaters used in electric utility demand\/response programs from the NAECA III regulation. I wasn't ever sure what the outcome of that was. Do you know about that effort and whether that was successful?","Ajita Rajendra","It's still pending, but we don't expect a big impact on the market because of that for some time. It's a long period of time.","Ryan Connors","Okay. So that's not been finalized at this point?","Ajita Rajendra","Yes.","Ryan Connors","Okay.","Ajita Rajendra","And it's for really very, very large capacity type water heaters.","Ryan Connors","Yes. Now, do you manufacture any of those, to the extent that does go through? Or is that other players?","Ajita Rajendra","You know, we do manufacture some of them, but it's not a huge impact. But again, like I said, we don't see a huge impact of that legislation hitting this industry, if at all, for a long period of time.","Ryan Connors","Okay. Separately, a lot of news by one of the very large companies in the industry, General Electric, about some acquisitions they are planning, if they can get them through. Does that have any impact potentially on you all? What's your view there of how their recent strategic shifts impact their focus on this industry or not?","Ajita Rajendra","Not really. When you think of the water heater industry and General Electric, they are small player in one category which is heat pump water heaters. And that's part of their appliance business, which is pending sale to Electrolux. And so we expect that to continue. We don't know of any change in strategy by Electrolux, and so we have no idea \u2013 it's a very small impact on the industry.","Ryan Connors","Okay. And then finally, just the issue \u2013 I don't think you have addressed online sales at all in China, and how that's trending, and how all the noise in China that you have talked about a lot on the call here impacts the outlook for that piece of the business?","John Kita","We haven't seen \u2013 so last year online sales were $55 million. Through the first six months they were about $50 million. We're still tracking towards the $90 million to $100 million that we have talked about on previous calls. So we haven't seen any impact whatsoever, and we are progressing as we expected.","Ryan Connors","Okay. And you envision that continuing \u2013 I mean, do you believe that's going to flatten out at some time? Or do you think that really will continue to grow at that kind of a trajectory and pretty quickly become the majority of the business?","John Kita","No, I don't think it's going to grow at that trajectory. It's not going to go at 100% a year. There's still an \u2013 and again, we have different components of that. So water heaters probably represent about 75% of net sales. Water treatment represents 20% of net sales; and air purifiers, maybe 5% of net sales at most for the year is what we're expecting. So we think it will probably still continue to grow, but not at that trajectory.","Ryan Connors","Okay. Great. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Rose from Wedbush Securities. Your question please.","David Rose","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a couple last ones. And not to go too much into the margin side, but just to clarify, as we look at the ERP comparison, it's easier in Q3 and Q4 than it was the prior year. Margins should be the same, all else being equal, but you get the benefit from the ERP. So am I missing something that would suggest that your margin in North America wouldn't be higher?","John Kita","No, I guess what we're saying, David, is we were about \u2013 we'll be about 19 million or 20 million this year. And it was flat-lined -- somewhat flat-lined at 5 million a quarter, let's say. Last year, the first half of the year, it was 14 million. It was only about $4 million. Okay? So the 10 million versus 4 million is -- it affected us $6 million compared to the prior year. This year, the last half of the year, it's going to be roughly 10 million of ERP in 2015 compared to 10 million of ERP in 2014. So I don't know if that clarifies for your question, but it won't have an impact on margins over the prior year.","David Rose","Okay. And so, then, there really shouldn't be any negative drag other than the possibility of kind of the pass-through costs for steel, if that happens?","John Kita","And volumes. So when you look at volumes for the water heater industry, it's normally about 52% or so in the first half of the year, 48% the last half of the year. Commercial is very similar. So, volumes second half of the year will be a little bit less than the first half of the year, which has an impact.","David Rose","Okay. That's helpful. And then, China, just lastly, you provided some good commentary about market sentiment. Maybe you can provide a little bit more commentary about your strategy in terms of pricing and promotion in light of what you may see a slightly weaker market or potentially a weaker market? Do you plan to be more aggressive? Do you plan to do more promotional work? Do you think you may limit your ability to increase prices?","Ajita Rajendra","There's a lot of questions there. So, promotion-wise, certainly we are spending more on promotion on air purifiers, water treatment, and also online. So that's a fact. We are spending more on those areas, as they are relatively new areas. So we are spending more promotion dollars there.","As we have talked about in the past that SG&A spend can be very volatile. Last year it was very volatile. And we ended up at about 13.8% or so for rest-of-world, which was driven by China. But there was wide differences by quarter-to-quarter. This year we're thinking it's going to be more leveled out.","And we have talked about being about 13.5% to 13.75%, let's say, for the full year. And that drop is driven by a couple things: it's driven by our investment in air purification. It's driven by our investment in water treatment in India. And also, we started selling water treatment in Vietnam, and that's having a negative effect on those margins.","So we're very comfortable with where the margins are. They're pretty much what we had talked about. And again, what differentiates us from a lot of people in China is our growth model isn't dependent on only one item. We have those three buckets, and that gives us some comfort going forward. We will continue to build the brand and invest in the brand. I don't know if that answers your question.","David Rose","Well, actually \u2013 I mean, the commentaries are pretty consistent, obviously, with what you've said in the past. I guess what I was really trying to get at was \u2013 and maybe you answered it earlier \u2013 you don't seem to be terribly concerned about the environment in China, the current stock market volatility in China, to make you change any of your pricing or promotional strategy or SG&A strategy. And that's really what I was getting at.","Ajita Rajendra","No, we don't. Like we've always said, we are always going to \u2013 there are going to be quarterly ups and downs in the marketplace in China. And we are very comfortable \u2013 or anywhere \u2013 and we are very comfortable with the longer-term guidance that we've given. And we manage the ups and downs as best we can, as we see them coming. Specifically in terms of the stock market, like I said, we are not concerned about the impact of it in terms of looking at the number of people it impacts, and all the reasons I gave -- and the fact that it's up 70% from last year, anyway, even with this recent drop. So we don't see that as having a long-term impact on our type of customer.","John Kita","And I think as Ajita has alluded to, in 2008 the market dropped much more significantly than what it did. And it didn't have a significant effect on consumer spending. So we've looked at a lot of economists work, and there's no empirical evidence that ties to stock market move to consumer spending. And again, we also say \u2013 or household formation, so time will tell if this is something different, but there's nothing from a historical standpoint that supports that.","David Rose","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Question, please.","Robert Paul McCarthy","Yeah. Just a couple of follow-ups. You cited the strength in kind of your commercial-facing end markets. Clearly, you updated your guidance there. But any other additional color about how \u2013 you know, did you feel like this is real and sustainable? How do you think about where we could be? Could this be a multiyear thing in terms of the growth you are seeing?","John Kita","I wish I could answer that. We haven't done a great job of estimating the commercial market. We continue \u2013 you know, we talk to our salespeople, and they are seeing it in a lot of different components. You know, gas, high-efficiency is becoming a bigger piece in the last three years. And that certainly is in one of our areas of strength. The hotel and the restaurant business is doing fairly well. So we are seeing construction there as well as retrofit work. We're also seeing for redundancy work being done. That's on kind of the commercial water heater. And then the verticals that Lochinvar works with are the educational side. And they are starting to see some potential in the healthcare side, et cetera. So there's been a lot of talk about commercial coming back, and it hasn't. But it has, for our businesses, come back pretty well. So we certainly cross our fingers and hope it will continue for the next several years.","Robert Paul McCarthy","And it sounds like you haven't seen material weakness in Canada. I think you alluded to some pricing as well. But I mean, could you comment there in terms of what you are seeing, and \u2013 just to give the macro outlook there?","John Kita","Not much change in the industry. It's relatively flat year-over-year. But obviously, because of the currency, it's been affected. I mean three of the four players on manufacture in the U.S. So there's been impact there -- three of the four major players, I should say -- impacted there. We had some currency translation, adjustment of our top line, obviously, as the currency has devalued. But as I said, there's been price increases that have gone in there.","Robert Paul McCarthy","And then, finally, on China, just in terms of -- two questions. One, have you seen -- I mean, you are talking about the fact that you expect this replacement cycle to kind of manifest itself. Could you cite just specific -- just incremental or anecdotal -- data points that you are seeing that, number one? Obviously aside from the strong growth rate; I understand that. And then just number two, perhaps comment on how we should think about the long-term growth trajectory for water treatment vis-\u00e0-vis your core business?","John Kita","Well, it's anecdotal replacement, and its anecdotal surveys that we do of people that buy water heaters. And it really is kind of the Tier 1 -- where I alluded to earlier. It's gone from 35% to 45% and 50%. So it truly is anecdotal. But it also makes sense, right, because of the high penetration rate for some time. Water heaters don't last forever, so they are going to be replaced. Water treatment Ajita alluded to: CMM has estimated a 35% to 40% growth rate over the next four or five years. We are comfortable with that growth rate. We have the right product in the right market with our reverse osmosis and our tankless product. We feel we have the best product on the marketplace. So we are comfortable with those types of growth rates as we look at it.","Robert Paul McCarthy","Thanks for your time.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from William Bremer from Maxim Group. Your question please.","William Bremer","Follow-up -- maybe if you can just comment a little bit on the pricing environment in China. And given the $10 million inventory build there, what should we expect?","John Kita","It's fairly flat, I think.","Ajita Rajendra","Yes. In terms of pricing in China as we go on \u2013 first of all, for obvious reasons we can't talk about pricing. But in China in the environment is \u2013 we rarely \u2013 our pricing comes from new products with new features, and benefits, and different value propositions that we are able to then get higher prices in the marketplace.","Being a consumer appliance, that's essentially the way we improve unit price in the marketplace in China. The environment for pricing is \u2013 you know, it's a very tough environment. If you look at the CPI and PPI in China, they are actually headed downward. But in terms of tying to inventory levels, like I said, we are watching it. We are aware of it. But at this point we are comfortable with the guidance for the year.","William Bremer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'm not showing any other questions in the queue. I would like to hand the call back over to Patricia Ackerman for closing remarks.","Patricia Ackerman","Thank you all for joining us today.

O. Smith Corporation Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Pat Ackerman, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please begin.","Pat Ackerman","Thanks, Shawn. Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2012 conference call. With me participating in the call are Paul Jones, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ajita Rajendra, President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Paul will begin with our presentation this morning with our third quarter highlights. John will then elaborate on our financial results and Ajita will wrap up with our outlook and acquisition strategy update.","Before we begin with Paul's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","Paul, I will turn the call over to you.","Paul Jones","Okay. Thank you, Pat, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to start off with an apology. I've got a cold and my voice will probably come and go, but I'll try to do the best I can. I feel like I got my head in a trashcan talking. But in the third quarter, we continued to see improvement in sales and earnings as a result of our acquisition strategy and global footprint. Here are a few highlights.","Our organic growth and acquisitions drove sales 12% higher to $462 million. Lochinvar acquired in the third quarter of last year achieved $63 million in revenues. We are seeing normal seasonality in boiler volumes as our customers prepare for the hydronic heating season in the US. In China, our sales of A. O. Smith branded products grew 22%. Our earnings improved to $0.71 per share, which excludes a $0.08 gain related to an adjustment to Lochinvar earn-out.","Lochinvar continued to contribute significantly and meet the high end of our profit expectations. We met with many of you in late September at our Analyst Day in Nashville where we presented our 2015 growth aspirations as well as showcased our manufacturing excellence. To those of you who attended, we thank you for spending the day with us. Our slide deck from the day is currently available on our website.","Last but not in any way least, I'm very pleased that our Board named Ajita Rajendra as my successor and the CEO role beginning January 2013. Ajita and I have worked together at A. O. Smith and at prior companies and he is an outstanding leader and manager. He and I developed the strategy we laid out at our Analyst Day last month together and Ajita is committed to it. I plan to serve the company and its shareholders in the role of Executive Chairman at least through 2013, and I have complete confidence in Ajita and our whole operating team. This positive transition will be seamless and positive for our company and shareholders.","John, I'll now turn the call over to you to elaborate on our third quarter results.","John Kita","Thank you, Paul. Sales in the third quarter of $462 million were 12% higher than the previous year. Lochinvar, which we acquired in August last year, added $63 million in sales compared with 21 million last year. Sales of A. O. Smith products in China grew 22% to $109 million. Adjusted earnings of $0.71 per share were 82% higher than last year when the $0.08 per share Lochinvar earn-out adjustment 2012 and the $0.19 per share net gain for several one-time items in 2011, as excluded from the comparison.","Third quarter earnings per share also benefit from a decline in the world wide effect of tax rate to 29%, primarily as a result of larger than anticipated deductions available for US domestic manufacturing activities. Let me take a minute to explain the earn-out adjustment. We call that under the terms of the Lochinvar purchase agreement, Lochinvar shareholders than earn up to an additional $35 million that certain revenue objectives were achieved from December 1, 2011 to November 30, 2012.","At the time of the closing, the company projected the earn-out to be $16.8 million due to an estimated 16% increase in sales over the prior year. Based on the current estimate of a 12% increase in sales, the earn-out is projected to be $10.4 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $6.4 million that was recorded in the third quarter.","Sales in our North America segment of $336 million increased 8% over last year. This segment includes our US and Canadian water heater and boiler businesses. In addition to incremental sales of $39 million from Lochinvar in North America in the third quarter, we experienced higher volumes of commercial water heaters in the US. Lower sales of residential water heaters and tankless products in the US, more than offset higher US commercial volumes.","Based on our shipments, we estimate industry shipments of residential water heaters were down mid-single digits during the third quarter. The result of our China, India and Europe businesses are captured in our rest of world segment. Segment sales of $134 million increased 21% compared with last year, due to a 22% increase in sales of A. O. Smith branded products in China.","Our growth in China is driven by several factors. Our distribution channel continues to grow. Our premium brand continues to gain market share and our gas tankless and water treatment products are growing faster than out overall business. North America adjusted operating earnings of $44 million was $13 million higher than last year. The adjusted result excludes the $6.4 million benefits from the adjustment to the Lochinvar earn-out.","The Lochinvar acquisition added $15 million to operating earnings in the quarter compared with $3 million last year. In addition, the segment benefited from higher commercial volumes and material costs which were lower than the relatively high levels last year. These benefits more than offset the volume decline in residential water heaters. As a result, the segment's adjusted operating margin improved significantly to 13.2% in 2012.","Rest of world operating earnings of $13 million improved 41% compared with last year, driven by China, higher China sales and lower losses at our water treatment business. As a result, operating margin improved to 9.5%. Our corporate and other expenses were $9.5 million, essentially the same as last year or adjusted for the benefit from the RBC share activity net of Lochinvar professional fees in 2011. Total operating profit, excluding these one-time items, improved 57% to $47.5 million.","Cash provided by continuing operations was $101 million at the end of the third quarter compared with cash used by operations of $68 million last year. 2011 cash flow through September included an approximately $140 million after-tax contribution to our pension plans. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt to capital ratio declined to 19% compared with 30% at the end of 2011. We have sizable cash balances located offshore, primarily related to the sale of electrical products and our net cash position was over $200 million at the end of September.","We project our cash flow from operations for 2012 to be between $155 million and $165 million. Our capital expenditures are expected to be $65 million to $75 million, which includes approximately $35 million for capacity expansion in China and India to meet growing demand for our water heaters. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be $55 million this year.","I will now turn the call to Ajita who will summarize our outlook and acquisition strategy. Ajita?","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you, John. Given our strong performance in the third quarter, we raised our expected 2012 EPS guidance to be between $2.85 and $2.95 per share. Our guidance does not include the impact from future acquisitions, again related to the sale of our RBC shares or the adjustments in the Lochinvar earn-out.","Our outlook for 2012 includes the following assumptions. First, we continue to remain positive on our growth in China. We expect our growth of A. O. Smith branded products for the full year to be over 15%. We expect China sales in the fourth quarter will be approximately 10% compared with 19% in the first nine months. The growth rate in the fourth quarter will be impacted by more difficult year-over-year comparisons as well as our belief that some of our distributors as carrying larger inventories than normal as a result of promotions related to our new product introductions and a weaker holiday season for water heaters in late September, early October of this year compared to a stronger season last year.","Second, we expect Lochinvar to continue to benefit from the transition from lower efficiency, non-condensing boilers to higher efficiency condensing boilers. Lochinvar's market leading condensing boilers continue to offer a compelling payback in the form of energy savings and the company has built a reputation for innovation and product quality. The new line of Crest boilers launched last year exemplifies this reputation. This new line of condensing high efficiency boilers expands the Lochinvar portfolio to larger BTU input models and has gained excellent market acceptance. As a result, we expect Lochinvar's growth rate in 2012 will be approximately 10% well ahead of GDP growth in the US.","Third, our commercial volumes are higher than we expected so far this year and therefore we expect commercial water heater volumes in the US to remain at approximately 2011 levels. We do not expect to see the benefit from new residential construction in our volumes this year as water heaters attract more closely with housing completions than starts. We estimate our residential industry shipments were down over 100,000 units in 2012 through September. As a result of what we've seen so far this year, unit volumes for the full year could be 1% to 2% lower than last year.","And forth, given the challenging macro environment in the eurozone, I want to remind you that we have minimal exposure in that region. I want to now move from the outlook to our strategy. This is an exciting and transformative time for our company and the acquisition of Lochinvar represents a significant first step in building our global order platform. We have cash and borrowing capacity for additional acquisitions and our pipeline of acquisitions supporting our stated growth strategy to expand our global footprint in water heating and water treatment solutions is very active.","As we presented at our Analyst Day, we expect to grow organically over 7% per year which will result in $2.4 billion in sales by the end of 2015. Adding our dry powder and making some assumptions about acquisitions, we expect to achieve revenues in excess of $3 billion, one-third of which will come from higher growth emerging regions of the world. Using these growth assumptions, we expect earnings to reach $5 per share in 2015.","Based on our core competencies, our strategic focus for growth is simple; hot water and clean water. We are pursuing actionable acquisitions to backfill these two areas around the world and particularly in developing and emerging geographies. We are also pursuing acquisitions which expand our core product line. We are particularly keen on products and technologies that offer energy and water efficiency gains. And finally, we are considering water-related adjacencies which can leverage our distribution and brand equity to provide value to our shareholders.","Our integration of Lochinvar is essentially complete. We have the human capital, financial resources and strategic focus to continue to add companies to our global platform which creates shareholder value and our business development teams are pursuing opportunities all over the world to do just that.","One final point on geographic expansion, which I think is worth reiterating. We are somewhat unique given our size to operate such a strong platform in China and a strengthening platform in India. These investments made over many years have proved to be very rewarding. These two countries are by far the largest emerging and fastest growing regions in the world. We continue to look for opportunities in these markets to leverage our brand and distribution capabilities. In addition, we are also exploring the suitability of these two platforms to serve as export basis to other smaller yet fast growing markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.","And finally, we continue to pursue acquisition candidates which presently operate in other fast growing regions around the world to further compliment our platforms in China and India. And finally our investment criteria, you've seen this before, we show this only as a reminder that we will be a financially disciplined acquirer. Our transactions will be focused on creating returns for our shareholders.","Those are the end of our prepared remarks and now we'll open the phone lines up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Matt Summerville of KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.","Matt Summerville -- KeyBanc","Thank you. First, I want to talk about in North America how we should think about your product mix progressing through the fourth quarter with a couple of moving parts, Lochinvar benefits from favorable seasonality, in residential you have tough comps but in commercial you also have tough comps with last year's pre-buy. So how should we think about mix in Q4 relative to what you saw in Q3?","Paul Jones","Well, Lochinvar traditionally third and fourth quarter are pretty comparable depending on the preseason buy in, et cetera. So we wouldn't expect a lot of difference between third and fourth quarter actually to be down a little bit in fourth quarter because we do think there was probably an early pre-buy. So that will come into play. Certainly, we do have a tough comp because of the pre-buy in commercial and we would expect that to be lower than last year's commercial level by quite a bit as we talked about.","Residential, you can see by numbers we talked about the third quarter was down, somewhat unexpectedly. We expect the third \u2013 the fourth quarter to be fairly comparable to the prior year from a residential standpoint.","Matt Summerville -- KeyBanc","Okay. And then if we think about \u2013 you had very good incremental margins in North America in the quarter. They've gotten better all year. In rest of world, they sort of fluctuated in that 10% to 20% range. What needs to happen to get the incrementals in rest of world, maybe in more firmly into say a 20% to 30% range on a ongoing basis?","Paul Jones","I think on an ongoing if you recall, we said our objective for rest of world at our Analyst Day was to be at 13% level at 2015. We think we'll see improvement in India as we go forward, as we get some volume improvements there. We've also talked about SWT reductions and the operating losses there. So I think those two will be the biggest components. The China operating margins continue to be pretty steady. They were comparable to last year, a little bit down from the second quarter, but there were a couple of one-time items that affected them in the second quarter \u2013 in the third quarter, I'm sorry. So I think it's the combination of all three business units continuing to progress.","Matt Summerville -- KeyBanc","And then just maybe two more questions on China and then I'll hop off. With regards to, I'd say it was 109 million you mentioned in China A. O. Smith branded products sold in China, how does that breakdown between the water heater business and Shanghai water really trying to track the progress on the later? And then with regards to same-store sales, can you comment on what your experience was tier 1 versus tier 2 and tier 3 and how's it deferred relative to the prior quarter or two? Thank you.","Paul Jones","On the water treatment we've talked about that the sales last year were about $8 million through A. O. Smith branded. We expect those to be more than double in the 18 million to 20 million range. So we've had pretty steady improvement on the water treatment and that's what it's benefiting. I'm not sure, what was the second question there?","Matt Summerville -- KeyBanc","Same-store sales\u2026?","Paul Jones","Same-store sales are up slightly. I don't think the story has changed much. Tier 1, there were up a little bit more than they were last year's numbers. So that's a little bit of improvement because we have been running flat. Tier 2 cities are still running positive but as we talked about, they are running 20% plus last year and that number has been coming down. So we're still seeing some improvement in same-store sales.","Matt Summerville -- KeyBanc","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Good morning.","Paul Jones","Good morning.","John Kita","Good morning.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","So I was just wondering what your \u2013 maybe two housekeeping questions, what your full year tax rate is going to look like?","John Kita","Well, it's been running kind of year-to-date, we would expect the fourth quarter is going to be around 30%. We've had some variation in the tax weight rate without a doubt, I think it was 28% plus first quarter, 30%-some second quarter and now the average is 29% this year, so this quarter. So we're expecting about 30% to be the best guess for the fourth quarter.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. And on the other income line, that is I assume interest income from the cash balance?","John Kita","Yes, that's primarily an interest income from the cash balance.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. But could you also tell us what kind of the first couple of weeks in October look like in resi water heaters in the US?","Paul Jones","Yeah, this is Paul. We're off to an okay start that's about all we'll say. If I could, the industry data as you follow \u2013 sometimes it has some really wide fluctuations and so we tried to look at it on a rolling average basis, where one month can be off double digits and next month could be up double digits. We just keep operating business as usual through those cycles.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. Are you sensing a different tone in the channels with your customers, maybe a little bit more optimism in that these positive resi data points are maybe gaining momentum or no change in tone?","Ajita Rajendra","Scott, this is Ajita. We sense a little bit of positive. There are the ups and downs, but overall people are feeling little more positive than they were feeling before.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Very good. Our last question is on Suning and GOME to your knowledge, is there any even inflection in tone from the management teams of those companies about a change in store built plans?","Paul Jones","No. I mean they've announced earlier they've slowed down and that's to be expected and they're working on the quality which frankly we see as positive. They're starting to actually close a couple of stores non-performing or poor-performing stores and which we think it means they're running their businesses very well. They're looking \u2013 making sure that where they had their capital investment, they're getting a return. But they obviously are affected by the slowdown in China. You can see the data. It's available out there and they're affected by that. The good news is the water heater business and some of their other appliance lines continue to do very well.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Right. But they're not indicating to you anything incremental from that chain versus that change?","Paul Jones","No, they're sticking to the same thing they had before. Ajita, do you want to add to that?","Ajita Rajendra","No, that's essentially right. I was in China a few weeks ago and met with some of their top management and they see the slowdown and they're managing through it. And as Paul said, shutting down some of the non-productive stores we see as very positive because it's volume that doesn't have a lot of profitability for us if we lose any volume and it's picked up by the other stores. So all that is very positive.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Very good, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","Mike Halloran \u2013 Baird","Good morning, everyone.","Paul Jones","Good morning.","John Kita","Good morning.","Mike Halloran \u2013 Baird","So can we talk about inventory levels, I know with the pre-buy the inventory levels spiked up and you were expecting a little bit longer tail and I'm assuming that was part of why the volumes were a little tough here in the quarter on the residential North America's side. Can you talk about how that trended through the quarter, if you've worked it off now and what the growth or the volume trends look like as you move through the quarter?","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah. We feel the inventories have worked themselves just out of the system. We were a little surprised at the lower residential volumes that we saw in September. But as Paul said that sometimes with a one month, we don't really pay a lot of attention to it and on the other side we were frankly very positively surprised by the strength in the commercial side of the business. So overall, things are moving along just as we have been seeing.","Mike Halloran \u2013 Baird","Are you seeing any differences in the wholesale versus retail channels at this point and talk a little bit about the competitive dynamic?","Ajita Rajendra","The wholesale is showing a little more strength than retail and retail inventories are a little bit on the lower side and they're managing them low. But we see that as a short-term type of cycle.","Mike Halloran \u2013 Baird","And then last question on India, could you just comment on how that's tracking relative to the expectation so far this year to the third quarter and what the profitability outlook looks like, as you move forward?","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah, the volumes are down and for a couple of reasons. One is that the rupee has devalued about 18% from when we planned this, so that's impacting us negatively. And we ran into some issues in terms of our supply chain and installing some equipment as we were expanding our line and going into our good, better, best strategy. So that held us back a little bit. But all those issues are behind us, not the currency issue but the operational and the supply chain issues are behind us.","But the really good news is that the brand and the product continues to be very well accepted in the marketplace. And so we'll be seeing 20% plus growth this year, not where we expected it to be because of the issues that I indicated to you. But the product is very well accepted and showing a lot of strength in the marketplace.","Mike Halloran \u2013 Baird","I appreciate the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charley Brady of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is Andrew (inaudible) for Charley Brady.","Paul Jones","Good morning, Andrew.","Unidentified Analyst","I had a question regarding the earn-out, just kind of what made up the difference between 15% expected when you closed and 12% now?","Paul Jones","When we closed they had a very aggressive internal plan and we said fine and we tracked our earn-out according to that. Internally, we \u2013 as you know, we're conservative. So we took a little more conservative approach. We were hoping they would hit their plan because every dollar of revenue that they achieved in this earn-out was good for our shareholders and the shareholders win throughout the whole process but we're just adjusting to a little more realistic date.","We're not disappointed at all. The folks at Lochinvar have done a fantastic job and we're delighted with how well that business is doing. It's just when you have a supper aggressive plan that there's about a 10% chance to hit, 90% of the time you don't hit it and that's \u2013 and with a bright light of hindsight that's the way we're seeing it right now.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Understandable. The next question was just kind of Lochinvar's margins, I think in the past you've mentioned that prior margins before the acquisition were about like 20% EBIT. Do you guys seem like you will hit that kind of minus the earn- out this year (inaudible) this quarter?","John Kita","Actually their profit margin was up significantly this quarter, almost 25% -- I think 24.5%. So they had an excellent quarter. And that's just a function of the higher volumes contribute very well.","Paul Jones","Mostly cost reductions\u2026","John Kita","And the cost reductions as Paul said, the synergies we achieved that had pretty much all been in by the third quarter. So I think it's that combination but clearly the volumes helped them.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjay Shrestha with Lazard. Please go ahead with your question.","Sanjay Shrestha -- Lazard Capital Markets","Great, thank you. Good morning, guys. Ajita, first of all, congratulations on your new role for '013.","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you.","Sanjay Shrestha -- Lazard Capital Markets","My first question is on China since you just came back from there. So is there any incremental talk about introducing some type of a stimulus program and maybe actually impacting sort of your sales out for 2013?","Ajita Rajendra","They talk about it and the government has been talking about it and they have introduced some programs, but I think all of that is tied into their outlook and what's happening out there right now. They also feel very positive. This is internally about the changes happening in the government and the leadership, and feel that the right programs will be put in place to get the economy back. They have been pushing that out because earlier on this year they said the second half will be stronger. Now they're pushing it out to next year. But they overall feel that the government will have the right programs in place.","Sanjay Shrestha -- Lazard Capital Markets","Okay, got it. And now shifting gears back to North America, right, so when we really look at (inaudible), this is also a mixed issue in the quarter, even excluding Lochinvar margins for the traditional North American business look pretty good and how much of a benefit did you guys get from the lower input cost in the quarter, and can we expect that, this is the new level of the margins going forward, there was some raw material benefit that you saw in the quarter which actually ended up hurting the margin a bit in Q3?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, we definitely got some benefit from the raw material as we talked about that \u2013 the raw materials are down from very high levels last year, third quarter, but we also got some help from commercial. I mean commercial was much stronger this year than last year, so I think those were the two biggest contributors to the margin improvement, ex-Lochinvar obviously. And the operations are running very well.","Sanjay Shrestha -- Lazard Capital Markets","Great. So on the commercial side, right, guys, it's done better than expectation given the sort of flattish on a year-over-year basis. Is that a phenomenon that that segment of the market is relatively healthier, is it one of those dynamics as energy efficiency getting [good] attractions, so payback is better and interest is sort of embracing that and that's why this trend will continue and sort of get better if anything going forward. How should we think about that?","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah, I think that's exactly the way to think about it is the energy efficiency suddenly having an impact and especially on the commercial side where the payback is much more obvious. People are making the investment and we feel very positive about that because we have the products that can leverage that.","Sanjay Shrestha -- Lazard Capital Markets","Okay, great. Well, one final question I have to ask is I don't know how much color I'm going to get on it, but since the Analyst Day, you guys have been very disciplined about going out for the acquisition, but if you were to sort of think about what's in the pipeline from a size standpoint or the level of discussion where it is right now, can you give us any incremental color as to sort of what is the size like, what is the level of discussions or talking now, where are we, anything incremental you guys could share with us would be great?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, thanks for asking the question everybody else wanted to ask. But obviously we can't show our hand. With regard to the acquisition pipeline, we continue to have active conversations with Japanese and both the US and in emerging economies that have a growing middle class. We've identified these regions in the past; Asia, Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa and we have nothing else that we can add at this point.","Sanjay Shrestha -- Lazard Capital Markets","Okay, fair enough. Thank you so much guys.","Operator","The next question comes from William Bremer with the Maxim Group. Please go ahead with your question.","William Bremer -- Maxim Group","Good morning.","Paul Jones","Good morning.","William Bremer -- Maxim Group","Congratulations Ajita.","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you.","William Bremer -- Maxim Group","My first question let's go back to Lochinvar, North American sales were a little bit over 50 million, altogether 63 million. What is the strategy to roll this out globally and really leverage the AOS name in distribution?","Ajita Rajendra","One of the positives in terms of value creation with Lochinvar was the ability to take this product to other markets where we can leverage not only our brand but also distribution capability and service networks. So we are actively working on that. It is something that this product \u2013 the Chinese market which is the first area we would be looking at is not quite ready for this product. This type of application is handled by Cast Iron Boilers and much more regional type players. And what we're trying to do is to set up the distribution and the channels that can take this product to market.","So there are teams from China who are \u2013 who have come here for training. In fact they have a Lochinvar team as we speak in China, gone the other way in terms of looking at the market and looking at how best we can build this. So it's a definite opportunity. It's not going to be something that's going to come right away. It's going to come in the next year or so and onwards from there.","William Bremer -- Maxim Group","Okay. And then on the water treatment, can you give us some \u2013 a little more color in terms of the underlying product that are now in China that you may be rolling out into all the geographic areas around the world?","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah, we've introduced some new products in China. One is the site stream which has much higher efficiency [RO] type of filter. And this is unique to us, it's a patented product and we charge a higher price for it and it's doing very well in the market. We've just introduced it, lots of promotions, just introduced it. And under the A. O. Smith brand and that's one of the things that's driving the A. O. Smith brand to be double what it was last year. So we see lots of positive things happening on the water treatment side.","On the SWT side of the business, obviously that sale we had the major issues in the past and that's making improvement, not as fast as we'd like, but making improvement. I anticipate this year that our sales will be up about $3 million and our pockets will be up about $3 million, still negative but it is an improvement from last year.","William Bremer -- Maxim Group","Okay, that's good to hear. And then Paul, maybe a little housekeeping, maybe this goes to John. The corporate expense 9.5 million, is that a good run rate going forward, do you see things possibly tweaking up a little or there maybe some additional streamlining that can occur over the next couple of quarters?","John Kita","I think it was a little bit lower this quarter. We have a couple of accrual adjustments, et cetera. I think we had been running the first half of the year at 10.5 million to 11 million a quarter and I think that's a reasonable run rate going forward.","William Bremer -- Maxim Group","10.5 million to 11 million, okay, versus the 9.5 million that we just came through right now, okay John. All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead with your questions.","Ryan Connors -- Janney Montgomery","Thank you. Good morning.","Paul Jones","Good morning.","Ryan Connors -- Janney Montgomery","I had a question, it's a comprehensive call, so most of my questions have been answered at this point, but I did want to talk a little bit about the pricing environment in China. I know obviously from your comments you're comfortable on the volume outlook there, but I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the pricing side in the Chinese market?","And I guess a related question would be your strength on the higher end of that market, you talked about $400 plus being a sweet spot. Is that a segment of the markets that \u2013 does the outlook there differ from the lower end segments given the economic macro headwinds there?","John Kita","Our pricing in the past \u2013 let me go a little back in history. In the past before the last two years, we've never really raised prices. We introduced new products with new features and benefits and drove our margins up through the new products and new features and benefits. The last two years, which is 2011 and 2012, we have increased prices on existing products and the price increases have stuck. So that's the good news. And during that time we've also gained market share in that higher price segment.","So we've been able to drive that because \u2013 again, because of the strength of the brand and the new products and we continue during this time to introduce new products with new features and benefits. So all of that has helped to build the equity of the brand and for us to be able to sustain those prices, and the pricing is wholly. Now I don't want to imply that increasing prices in China is easy and can be done at any time, but so far the prices are holding and our position in that higher end is very strong and we continue to slowly increase our market share.","Ryan Connors -- Janney Montgomery","Okay, (inaudible). And then also just you talked about the corporate line item in the previous question there, if you could kind of give us a similar analysis on SG&A, it's kind of being trending up sequentially. Should we expect that to continue or do you think that that's kind of leveled out here and you'll be able to leverage that going forward?","John Kita","I think it was a little higher this quarter mainly because of the residential, et cetera. We still have most fixed SG&A costs and sales were down. I think the year-to-date run rate is 23% and I think that's probably a reasonable percent as we look into the fourth quarter.","Ryan Connors -- Janney Montgomery","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Rose with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead with your questions.","David Rose -- Wedbush Securities","Good morning. I think most of mine have been answered. I did have one last on China. Can you provide a little bit more color, maybe some data points on the number of specialty store entrepreneurs that are [staying] open and if there has been any closures both in Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 for these?","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah, I think it's yes to all of them. I mean we are opening stores and we are also closing stores. And that's been an ongoing process because we have very strong requirements and tight requirements in terms of the performance of those stores. And if the entrepreneurs are not performing, then we shut them down or bring in new people. And that process is ongoing. I think with the turndown if anything, we are probably being a little more aggressive in shutting down the non-productive stores. And that's a good thing because that ensures that the sales that we have continue to hold their profitability.","And we are expanding into the second and third tier cities and that expansion is moving along. And that's part of the reason that we've been able to show growth in our business beyond what's normally \u2013 what's happening in China and beyond what we see our traditional retailers experiencing. It's a combination of expanding into the second and third tier cities, expanding our stores with the new products, the pricing, putting all of that together is what's helping to drive our sales in China and we would certainly continue that formula.","David Rose -- Wedbush Securities","That's helpful, Ajita. And maybe a follow-up to that is on your \u2013 kind of on the look through and in terms of the pipeline of new entrepreneurs, do you see economic conditions changing the number of entrepreneurs that are willing to open or because there's lack of other opportunities for them, it's actually encouraging them?","Ajita Rajendra","No, the number of entrepreneurs, they are more than we can handle because the brand is so strong that there are lots of people who want it and we have not run into the issue where we see a reason and don't have people who want to come on board. It's the other way around.","David Rose -- Wedbush Securities","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Ajita Rajendra","And we manage that because we don't want to have too many people too close to each other and so we want to manage the number that's out there.","David Rose -- Wedbush Securities","Okay, that's helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Samuel Eisner with William Blair. Please go ahead with your questions.","Samuel Eisner -- William Blair","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.","Paul Jones","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel Eisner -- William Blair","In terms of the commentary on the commercial business, obviously volumes are trending higher. Can you make any comments regarding if this is strictly retrofit or if there is any new that's actually embedded in that, I guess those higher volumes?","Ajita Rajendra","I think it's the normal combination. I don't know that I can't say that there's been a whole lot of new activity that's unusual. It's a combination of both them and frankly we've been very presently surprised at the strength of the commercial market. It's stronger than what we anticipated it to be, especially given the buy-in at the end of last year.","Samuel Eisner -- William Blair","Great. And then moving over to China, obviously the commentary regarding same-store sales this quarter to be a little bit better than I was expecting given the fact that second quarter, I think you were flat in both tier 1 and tier 2 cities. So I guess what is the \u2013 what is causing the increase I guess this quarter? And then maybe looking out to 2013 even if you're going to be only about 10% growth, how should I be thinking about looking out to 2013 when you're exiting '12 at about 10% levels?","Ajita Rajendra","John, you're going to help us out. We've been \u2013 we were pleasantly surprised at the 3% and the people have been saying things are going to be getting better, probably getting \u2013 this was getting a little better, a little faster than we thought. But I don't want to spike the ball too early. I think things are getting better slowly and that's what we see in China.","Samuel Eisner -- William Blair","Okay. And then just last two questions here. John, I think you mentioned there were some one-time items in China that affected the operating margins there this quarter. Can you call those out just so we can understand what\u2026?","John Kita","Yeah, there were a couple of them. One is there was a new tax on a property tax like type tax that was put on multinationals and it was going back to the first part of the entire year, so we had to pick up the first three quarters. So that probably affected it by 50 basis points. And then as Ajita said, we've come out with a couple of really new and exciting products; one was the [side screen] water treatment as well as the low noise instantaneous and so we have some pretty hefty incentive type programs during the quarter that probably affected margins, another 50 basis points. So both of those I would view as somewhat one-time type items.","Samuel Eisner -- William Blair","So a clearer number would look close to 10.5%?","John Kita","Well, I remember that's the 9.5 is the entire rest of world, so it would be a little bit less than that, right?","Samuel Eisner -- William Blair","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","I'm not showing any other questions in the queue. I'd like to turn it back over for closing comments at this time.","Paul Jones","Okay, we appreciate everybody's interest and you know our phone number, so give us a call if you have any follow-ups. Thanks much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect.

Smith Corporation First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Patricia Ackerman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ma'am, you may begin.","Patricia K. Ackerman","Thank you, Ben. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2013 conference call. With me participating in the call are Paul Jones, Executive Chairman; Ajita Rajendra, Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Paul's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, effective with this first quarter of 2013, we are providing non-GAAP measures including adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted segment operating earnings that exclude certain items, as well as nonoperating pension costs consisting of interest costs, expected rate of return on planned assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and curtailments. Prior-year results are provided on a comparable basis.","Paul, I will now turn the call over to you.","Paul W. Jones","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I get to make a few brief comments this morning but they're going to be quite enjoyable.","In the first quarter, we begin to see the benefits from the recovery of new construction activity in the U.S. Here are a few highlights from our very strong quarter.","Our organic growth drove sales 9% higher to $510 million. Sales of A. O. Smith brand of products in China grew 15%. Our adjusted earnings of $0.96 per share were 41% higher than the $0.68 per share recorded last year. Incremental margins associated with the higher volumes of water heaters and boilers drove earnings higher. Based on our solid performance and strong balance sheet, we recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by 20% to $0.24 per share. We also announced a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend. John will now describe our results in more detail.","John J. Kita","Thank you, Paul. Sales in the first quarter of $510 million were 9% higher than the previous year, driven by higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters in the U.S. and higher sales of A. O. Smith branded products in China. Adjusted earnings of $44.7 million improved 41% from our first quarter performance last year. As we announced earlier this month, we are transferring residential water heater production from our Fergus, Ontario, plant to other North American facility and expect the majority of our production will be consolidated by July 1.","As a result of a capacity rationalization, we incurred a pretax restructuring charge of $12.7 million in the first quarter related to employee severance costs and impairment of long-lived assets. Additional restructuring charges are expected to total approximately $5 million for the remainder of the year. Excluding restructuring costs, we expect operating savings will offset operating inefficiencies in 2013. We expect the majority of the operating inefficiencies to occur in the second quarter. We project pretax annual savings of approximately $10 million in 2014.","Adjusted earnings in 2013 excluded after-tax nonoperating pension costs of $3 million, after-tax restructuring and impairment costs of $9.5 million and an after-tax gain of $6.8 million related to a settlement with a former supplier. Adjusted earnings in 2012 excluded after-tax pension costs of $1 million and an after-tax net gain of $16.8 million related to the sale of RBC shares.","Adjusted earnings per share of $0.96 per share improved 41%, compared with $0.68 per share last year. Adjusted EPS in the current period excluded nonoperating pension costs of $0.06 per share, restructuring costs of $0.20 per share and the gain from a settlement from a former supplier of $0.14 per share.","Adjusted EPS in 2012 excluded nonoperating pension costs of $0.02 per share and a gain associated with the sale of our RBC shares of $0.36 per share.","Sales in our North America segment of $379 million increased 7% over last year. This segment includes our U.S. and Canadian water heater and boiler operations. Higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters in the U.S., as well as higher boiler volumes more than offset lower sales in Canada.","The results of our China, India and European water heating businesses and our water treatment business in Asia are captured in our Rest of World segment. Segment sales of $138 million increased 11% compared with last year, driven by higher sales in China, which more than offset lower sales in Europe and the Middle East.","We are encouraged by the market acceptance of our newer A. O. Smith branded products in China. We continue to innovate our product lines with features and benefits, which provide value to our customers and differentiate our brand.","Recent innovations include an ultra-quiet gas tankless water heater product line and water treatment products which have longer-lasting filters and waste less water. The return on our investment in engineering and innovation is one of the success factors of our business in China.","North American adjusted operating earnings of $59 million were 38% higher than adjusted operating margin of 15.7% was 2.5 percentage points higher than last year. Improved performance was due to higher incremental margins associated with increased volumes of water heaters and boilers in the U.S., as well as improved pricing associated with the price increase effective in the second quarter of last year.","Rest of World adjusted operating earnings of $18 million improved 28% compared with last year. Higher sales and below-normal promotion expenses due to the Chinese New Year holiday and a smaller loss at our non-A. O. Smith branded water treatment business more than offset higher expenses in India related to new distribution outlets and manufacturing inefficiencies due to the seasonality of sales. As a result, operating margin gained almost 2 percentage points.","Our adjusted corporate expenses were $12.5 million, an increase from the prior year primarily due to lower interest income, as well as higher stock-based compensation cost related to shorter amortization periods.","Cash provided by continuing operations was $37 million in the first quarter compared with $15 million last year, primarily driven by higher earnings from operations, which were partially offset by higher working capital requirements to support sales.","Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio declined to 16%. We have sizable cash balances located offshore and our net cash position was over $220 million at the end of the first quarter.","We project our cash flow from continuing operations for 2013 to be between $210 million and $230 million. Our capital expenditures are expected to be $80 million to $90 million, which includes approximately $40 million for capacity expansion in China and India to meet growing demand for our water heaters in those regions. Our depreciation and amortization expenses expected to be between $55 million and $60 million this year.","I will now turn the call over to Ajita, who will summarize our outlook and acquisitions strategy.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Thanks, John. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.","Our outlook for 2013 includes the following assumptions: First, we expect our sales growth of A. O. Smith branded products in China to be approximately 2x China GDP rate in 2013, largely driven by products with new features and benefits that provide value to our customers. We also have seen a positive impact in sales coming from online purchases and we expect online sales to more than double in 2013 from $5 million last year. We also continue to evaluate the productivity of our distribution footprint, and our customers are doing the same thing. As a result, a net 300 stores were closed in the first quarter and we ended the quarter with approximately 5,200 outlets.","The closure of underperforming stores had little impact on overall first quarter revenue in China, which grew at 15% compared with last year.","Second major assumption in our outlook. We expect our Lochinvar brand to continue to benefit from the transition from lower efficiency, non-condensing boilers to higher efficiency condensing boilers. Lochinvar branded condensing boilers continue to offer a compelling payback in the form of energy savings and we have built a reputation for innovation and product quality. As a result, we expect Lochinvar branded sales to grow 10% in 2013, well ahead of GDP growth in the U.S.","I should remind everyone that we do have some seasonality related to the boiler products that we sell for hydronic heating. We typically have sales and profits of our Lochinvar branded products in the second half of the year that are lower -- that are higher than in the first half of the year.","Third, we are cautiously optimistic about the developing recovery in U.S. housing. We expect residential water heater volumes in the U.S. to be 200,000 units higher this year than last year, based on an upward revision of our housing completions forecast. Even though our commercial volumes were very strong in the first quarter, which we believe was largely due to a pre-buy related to a Northern California regulatory change, we expect commercial volumes to be up only about 1% for the full year.","Our business is performing well and our balance sheet and cash flow are strong, which affords us the confidence to continue to pay a very competitive dividend yield. As such, we increased our dividend by 20% last week.","Our outlook for the U.S. water heater business has fundamentally improved from 3 months ago, when we originally announced our 2013 guidance. We have increased our 2013 adjusted EPS guidance to between $3.40 and $3.56 per share. The midpoint of our new range represents a 13% increase over 2012 adjusted EPS of $3.08 per share.","This guidance does not include the restructuring charges associated with the planned rationalization, the settlement with the former supplier, nonoperating pension costs or future acquisitions. Our GAAP EPS guidance is now expected to be between $3 and $3.16 per share due to the impact from the restructuring charges partially offset by the settlement, neither of which were in our GAAP guidance at the beginning of the year.","This continues to be an exciting and transformative time in our company. We have cash and borrowing capacity for additional acquisitions and our pipeline of acquisitions supporting our stated growth strategy to expand our global footprint in water heating and water treatment solutions is very active. As we presented at our Analyst Day last fall, we expect to grow organically over 7% per year which would result in $2.4 billion of sales in 2015.","Adding our dry powder and making some assumptions about acquisitions, we expect to achieve revenues in excess of $3 billion, with 1\/3 from higher growth regions in the world. Using these assumptions, we expect our existing businesses to deliver earnings of $4.30 a share in 2015.","We expect to achieve $5 per share in 2015, and use of our cash and borrowing capacity are added to our organic growth.","Based on core competencies and our strategic focus -- our strategic focus for growth is simple, hot water and clean water. We are pursuing actionable acquisitions in these 2 areas around the world. We are also pursuing acquisitions which expand our core product lines. We are particularly keen on products and technologies that offer energy and water efficiency gains. And finally, we are considering water-related adjacencies which can leverage our distribution and brand to provide value to our shareholders.","Our integration of Lochinvar is complete. We have the human capital, financial resources and strategic focus to continue to add companies to our global platform which create shareholder value. And our business development teams are pursuing opportunities all over the world to do just that.","You've seen this next chart before, and we show this only as a reminder that we will be a financially disciplined acquirer. Our transactions will be focused on creating returns for our shareholders.","Ladies and gentlemen, that's the end of our prepared comments. And now we are open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of William Bremer from Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Can you give us a little color on the Lochinvar contribution for the quarter? And if you could give me even a little bit more granular on the aftermarket contribution there?","Paul W. Jones","Well, the Lochinvar did as we expected. In north -- in the U.S., it was up about 10% in sales and profits were up even more than that. I don't have a detail on the spare parts, et cetera, but you would expect that to be lower in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter with the [indiscernible].","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","And John, the operating margin there, year-over-year up as well?","John J. Kita","Yes.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Significantly? If we do sequentially to the fourth quarter, was it as high as that? Can you give us a little bit...","John J. Kita","No, I don't think -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, I don't think it would have been as high as the fourth quarter, but it was sequentially up from last year's first quarter.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And in addition, can you give us an update on the water treatment facilities and the recurring revenue there?","John J. Kita","Well, water treatment -- the A. O. Smith branded water treatment continues to do very well. We expect that to be up over 50% this year. Last year, it had sales about $20 million, so we expect it to be up over 50%. We've come out with a new product, that wastes less water and also has a longer-term filter but I think its unique filter to our systems. So as we go down the road, I think we will pick up more and more replacement filter business from that product. So A. O. Smith branded water treatment is doing very well. And we've made a lot of cost improvements in the legacy, non-A. O. Smith branded water treatment. And we expect to see nice improvement from the losses that they had last year.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","And my last question, just a little housekeeping. Corporate expense line came in a little bit higher than what I anticipated and given the restructuring that you're voicing and implementing, what should be a nice run rate for '13 there?","John J. Kita","I think we went out at the end of the year and got approximately $48 million for the year on an adjusted basis. And we think $48 million to $49 million is still reasonable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Shrestha from Lazard Capital Markets.","Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","A couple of question. Again, coming back to that margin question for North America, right. And even after you exclude sort of the Lochinvar contribution, sounds like your core residential and commercial business, I think, had almost a record margin here. And so one, I wanted to ask you sort of, is that thinking right? And two, sort of help us remind the contribution margin as the housing starts continue to improve here? And was there anything that was one-time that says this is not repeatable going forward?","John J. Kita","Yes, really not being one-time in there. We mentioned that there was a little pull-forward of commercial. The bottom line, Sanjay, is we think the industry had its highest quarter in the last 5 years. And we've been talking about that incremental volume would be very beneficial to our bottom line and we saw it in this quarter. Very strong both residential and commercial. And as I said, those both quarters where we think records for the last 5 years. And so that's a big contributor to the margin improvement.","Ajita G. Rajendra","And our mix was helped by the higher proportion of commercial sales.","Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. So got it, that, that's what we thought. So now shifting gears a little bit, guys. So when we think about China, right? And you guys have done a great job there in terms of sort of evaluating enough stores performing well versus lack thereof. So but as we look at your existing footprint in China, how would you sort of break that down in terms of exposure in the Tier 1 cities versus Tier 2 and Tier 3? And especially more for Tier 2 and the Tier 3 cities, what would you say is sort of the growth driven by store addition versus the same-store sales growth at this point?","John J. Kita","Well, we saw a very good same-store growth in both Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. We have more Tier 2 and Tier 3 stores now than we do Tier 1. And as we talked about that, it's an opportunity for us to get to those cities quicker than, say, our large customers who have to build a department store, if you will. We can put out specialty stores, et cetera. So we saw a very good same-store sales in both Tier 1 and Tier 2.","Ajita G. Rajendra","If there's anything that was a pleasant surprise in China is the online sales coming on very strong. That's been good.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of KeyBanc.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","This is actually Joe Radigan on for Matt. Just a couple of questions. Can you give a little more color on the commercial pre-buy? What were commercial sales up, on a percentage basis in the quarter? And then can you quantify the magnitude, you think, you got a benefit from the pre-buy? And is this a new regulation? Or is this the same regulation we talked about last year?","John J. Kita","Well, it's kind of the same regulation. But it applies to Northern California this time. We think the industry and ourselves were up double-digits in the commercial over last year. Where our guess is about half of that is related to this pre-buy. And it's really a factor of you could manufacture the product up through the end of the year and still sell it, and we think our distributors wanted to get that product in-house and it's lower-priced than the new product that will come out. So we think that helped in the quarter.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then could you talk about your product mix in China? What percentage of sales are coming from new products or these up-featured products? What is your product pipeline on that front look like going forward? Do you expect to be able to get a formal price increase, like you've successfully done the last couple of years? Or is this your more -- a reversion kind to the way it used to be where you get a little bit of ASP bump because you're selling an up-featured product?","John J. Kita","I'm not anticipating a formal price increase, as we've had the last couple of years. We will be coming out with a new electric model line. That might have a little bit higher cost because of different features, but we're certainly seeing a positive from the super-quiet tankless that we came out. We came out with an 16 liters last year. We're expanding that across a bigger product line, and that, it does provide. So there is some positive mix that we anticipate.","Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the last question. In terms of the announcement, to shutter the Fergus facility, was that move driven by, kind of -- as you looked at your capacity needs? Or was it just the weakening of construction markets there? And then what is your utilization look like in North America after that closure? Can you just comment kind of on the decision that -- the factors that went into the decision there?","Ajita G. Rajendra","This is Ajita. We're always looking at our footprint and looking at ways to make it as effective as possible. And so that's essentially what we've done. And so it's not seeing any long-term trends of weakening of construction in Canada versus the U.S. It's just optimizing our footprint. And from a capacity viewpoint, we can comfortably take care of any sort of increases that we anticipate out in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Vencil from Sterne Agee.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","On the residential shrink that you're seeing, are you -- thanks for talking about that. Are you seeing any particular sort of regional strength there? Or is it sort of spread out evenly?","John J. Kita","I think it's spread fairly equally. I mean, there's strong new housing starts again today, so I mean we're just kind of taking a wait-and-see. While it's been a lot of fits and starts on new housing, but clearly there was some benefit in the first quarter.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Yes. And it's across the board.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you've said that the incrementals there are strong. I mean can you -- is there any way you can put a number on what the incrementals from the initial volume looked like or you think they're going to look like? I think you talked about 35-ish percent in the past?","John J. Kita","Yes, I didn't do the calculation. But between the combination of the commercial and the residential, that's probably not an unreasonable percentage, 30% to 35%, when you have the two.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on -- you're -- switching to the strategic actions or things you're looking at. You mentioned water-related adjacencies. Can you talk about that a little bit and just expand on what that might encompass?","Ajita G. Rajendra","I'll be general because, obviously, I can't get too specific. But we've been very clear in our strategy in terms of we are in the heating water and cleaning water business. We are a water technology company. And those are the types of acquisitions that we'll go after. So -- and so we'll be spreading out a little bit further from just the water heating that we've been doing so far in North America. And we're looking at regions of the world that are growing faster than U.S. GDP, but not focusing entirely on companies or segments that are outside of the U.S. We are looking at growth markets that's going to increase the growth potential of our total portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So you're doing a lot of things and upgrading products in China that look like they're really working. Could you maybe give us a little bit more on what your plans are for the next year or so? Is this essentially a large product line or set of product line refreshments that are going on? Is it affecting the company stores? Is it affecting all channels? Just give us maybe a little bit more about what you're doing.","John J. Kita","Scott, it's the ongoing process of renewing our products in China. And I wouldn't say that it's anything new or unusual. It's the pipeline that we have, that we keep driving all the time. And so, the pipeline is pretty full in terms of new products that are going to be coming out in the future. And it's the nature of our business in China because it's a consumer appliance and it's something that needs renewing and a new look and a fresh look all the time. But also, in addition to the fresh look, we add features and benefits. And where we can, over time, we charge extra for those features and benefits. And the Chinese consumer is very willing to pay for those as long as they see value. And our teams there have been very successful in doing that over time and continue to do that. We do have a quite a few of them coming out right now, but we always have quite a few coming out.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. Could you talk about where you think inventory levels are within the wholesale channel right now? North America?","Ajita G. Rajendra","I think, nothing unusual. I can't quote any numbers because, again, that type of information is very tough to come by. But we don't know of any unusual building of inventory or driving down of inventory.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, the last question is, of course, is on the M&A pipeline. I know with Paul, you're starting to move away from the operations and with Ajita fully in control, just wondering, has that given us an additional thrust on the M&A side, how does the pipeline look? And anything you can give us on that will be helpful.","Paul W. Jones","Well, Scott, it's -- we have been working on it pretty steadily since, actually, the balance sheet got in better shape after selling the motor business. I do think we have, maybe a little more energy level right now with the teams that are out scouring the world right now. Obviously, there's nothing we can talk about at this time. But it's a very robust effort. I want to reiterate what Ajita said. It's still a disciplined process. We're not going to do something that doesn't add shareholder value. Our focus is giving returns to shareholders, and we're not going to waver from that. Other than that, there's nothing that I can specifically talk about.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors of Janney Montgomery.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I just have a question for you on this -- you laid out kind some of longer-range guidance, I guess, for 2015. And I apologize if I missed some of the assumptions there, but can you just give us a little more granularity on your kind of modeling to get to that $4.30 number and specifically, the contribution of kind of top line versus margin and then also whether the CAGR there over the next 2 years is pretty linear in your minds to get to that figure, or whether we kind of accelerate in '14 and then decelerate? Any kind of color you can get us around how you're getting to that number will be helpful.","John J. Kita","Sure, Ryan. We talked about a 7% to 7.5% organic growth from 2011 through 2015, 2011 adjusted for a full year of Lochinvar. And for the most part, we would think that would be relatively linear as we continue, we think, kind of a gradual increase in new housing, et cetera. We think Lochinvar will continue to grow at the 10%. We think China will grow at about 15-or-so percent. And we think there will be -- North America who will continue to grow as housing starts increase. I think -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I think we said that North America we think will return about a 14% -- 14.5% EBIT margin. And Rest of World of just a 13%. And so I think everything we've seen, we're comfortable with those forecasts.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one other question I guess, just keeping in the vein of guidance, echo the sentiments of the others. Obviously a great quarter, at least versus our expectation. The guidance for '13 kind of implies a little bit of a deceleration in the growth rate going forward. So any commentary you can give on kind of what your thoughts are there? Whether you think maybe us and the street were a little just ahead of things? Or any comments you can have on kind of the huge upside in the quarter and a little more of a limited upside in the guidance would be helpful, too.","John J. Kita","Well, I'll tell you we were surprised by the strength of the residential and commercial. I know I've seen it myself but it was the best quarter for both of those in 5 years. So we're stepping back and taking a look and trying to make sure that it's real and it's going to hold. We did have some one-time items, like we said, the pre-buy of the commercial, et cetera. So as we've done in the past, we're being conservative to make sure we have good visibility. But it was an extremely good first quarter. And again, when we get the volume, we are in a position to provide very healthy margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Samuel Eisner from Goldman Sachs.","Samuel Eisner","I have a couple of questions here on the guidance and the expectations for North America. I mean, John, I know you were just saying that you were surprised by the strength in the quarter. Was there any benefit from maybe delay in spending post-Hurricane Sandy that benefited installations in water heaters or boilers in kind of the northeast region?","John J. Kita","No, we don't think we've got anything, for example, in the boiler business. What had happened in the fourth quarter, they had to replace cast iron with cast iron because they had to get it done quick. So we don't think that there was any benefit in the quarter from a delayed of Sandy. That would be our guess.","Ajita G. Rajendra","I think we saw the Sandy benefits last year.","John J. Kita","Yes.","Samuel Eisner","Okay, so no overhang there. And then your expectations, I know that you kind of upgraded the guidance for the year. Could you call out what the actual expectations are for housing starts for 2013?","John J. Kita","Well, we forecasted that we'll see about a 200,000 increase in the residential market. And that's really a move of completions from about 650,000 to 850,000. So we're calling the replacement business to be flat. Commercial, because of the strong first quarter, we've raised that also a couple of thousand units, I think from 148,000 last year to 150,000 this year. So we have built in a little bit higher increase and that certainly contributed to the increase in the estimate.","Samuel Eisner","Great, and just switching gears over to Rest of World. I think you called out that there was less of a loss in nonbranded structural products, as well as lower promotional items. I mean, was any of that one-time? Should we expect it to come back in as we look forward throughout the course of the year? Maybe if you could just talk a little bit about that.","John J. Kita","Well, I think for China, the lower promotion expenses of let's say, $2 million to $2.5 million, were one-time. We think, because of the Chinese New Year's holiday, we did not spend as much during that time period. So we think that will pick back up in the following 3 quarters. The non-A. O. Smith branded had a very nice improvement in profitability and we expect that to continue throughout the year.","Samuel Eisner","So that I would say, that's more structural rather than one-time?","John J. Kita","Yes, certainly on the non-A. O. Smith branded, we've made some significant, we think, manufacturing and operating efficiencies and we think that will be continuous.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from the line of William Bremer of Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Yes. Just a quick one. You sort of voiced the pre-buy here in commercial. How much do you feel really contributed to the seller gross margins of 35.2%. Was it 50 basis points, it's 100 basis points? What's your gut on that?","John J. Kita","On the commercial?","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Yes.","John J. Kita","I have to do some math. As we've said, historically, gross margins of, say, 35%, that commercial, Lochinvar and China are above that. And that residential is below that. We said that publicly. So obviously, commercial being strong is a big benefit for us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Kelly of Sidoti.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Maybe I missed it. Did you put a dollar value of the commercial pre-buy?","John J. Kita","No, we didn't.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","It's just -- you thought it was half of the double-digit increase?","John J. Kita","That is [indiscernible] up over -- we think double-digit for the industry, we know they were for us.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And you thought the pre-buy was half of that?","John J. Kita","And we thought the pre-buy was about half of that.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay, great. Just as far as the comments on the residential side, is there any way to parse out the strength as you call it, whether it's coming from the replacement or the new construction side of the business?","John J. Kita","I don't think we have real visibility into that. We certainly would assume some of it's coming from the new construction, as the numbers have been coming out fairly strong. So I think the replacement, our best guess, is holding pretty steady.","Ajita G. Rajendra","The replacement business tends to be steady. So when we see a spike, it's usually driven primarily by new construction.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then as far as the strength you're seeing in res and commercial, any plans to implement price increases in 2013, now that volume seems to be picking up?","Ajita G. Rajendra","Obviously, we don't talk about pricing ahead of time. But over time, we make -- we try to make sure that we balance out any cost increases with price increases. Over time.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And then just one kind of on the long range guidance, talking about a full year, 14.5% for North America when you get to 2015. I mean, obviously, you're stressing that 1Q you may have had some prop to it just given the commercial pre-buy. But we're well north of that today, and your seasonal low quarter, Lochinvar gets stronger in the back half of the year. Is it -- and then, the 35% incremental margins. Is there some -- what sort of, should we rethink the goal for 2015, just given that where things seem to be picking up here and your margin's coming in a lot better than expected with the cost savings from Calgary?","John J. Kita","It's too early to reset the goal. Again, we had a very, very strong quarter from a volume standpoint. Traditionally, the first quarter is the strongest quarter, from a commercial and a residential standpoint. We saw it even stronger than we expected. You're right, Lochinvar helps in the back half of the year. But we also have the third quarter water heater business is the weakest for us of any quarter. I think it's too early. We're certainly very pleased with the performance this quarter and we'll continue to evaluate that as we go on.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And one final one. You talked about maybe getting more conviction just given how surprised you were by the strength of res and commercial demand in 1Q. Anything that transpired since the end of the March quarter that gives you pause? Or has demand held up pretty solid?","John J. Kita","I think things are on track. Not much have changed.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions in queue and would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Patricia K.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","Also in respect of others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Ajita, who will begin his remarks on slide three.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The first quarter of 2016 was another excellent quarter for A. O. Smith, setting first quarter records for sales and earnings. We continue to see healthy end markets for our consumer products in China and boilers in the U.S. We believe that our organic growth prospects differentiate us from most other industrial companies.","Here are a few highlights. Sales grew 3% to a record of $637 million. Excluding the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar against Canadian and Chinese currencies, our sales grew 5% in the first quarter. China sales were up 17% in local currency. Record first quarter net earnings of $0.83 per share were 28% higher than our earnings per share during the same period last year.","We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion to return to shareholders. We repurchased approximately 430,000 shares for $30 million during the first quarter. We increased our dividend by 26% three months ago.","John will now describe our results in more detail beginning with slide four.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the full year of $637 million were 3% higher than the previous year. Net earnings of $73.5 million improved 26% from 2015. Earnings per share of $0.83 improved 28% over last year.","Sales in our North America segment of $424 million declined 1% compared with the first quarter of 2015. Price increases implemented in April 2015 in the U.S. and Canada for residential and commercial water heaters, as well as higher boiler sales were more than offset by lower volumes of residential and commercial water heaters in the U.S. January and February 2016 industry volumes declined 16%, primarily due to a pre-buy in the 2015 first quarter. We expect the trend continued in March.","Rest of World segment sales of $217 million increased 11% compared to 2015. China sales increased 17% in local currency, driven by higher demand for water heaters and A. O. Smith branded water treatment products, as well as seasonal demand for our in-home air purifier products.","On slide six, North America operating earnings of $92 million were 29% higher than segment operating earnings in the previous year, and operating margin of 21.7% was significantly above the 16.6% operating margin one year ago. Higher prices in the U.S. and Canada and lower material costs contributed to the significantly improved segment performance. The impact to profits from lower residential and commercial water heater volumes in the U.S. and $3 million of incremental costs associated with our ERP implementation partially offset these favorable factors.","Rest of World operating earnings of $27 million improved 3% compared with 2015. Higher China sales were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses in China and a larger loss in India. Segment operating earnings were reduced by approximately $1.5 million due to China currency translation. Higher selling costs to support expansion in Tier 2 and 3 cities and our e-commerce platform in China, as well as higher developmental costs associated with new products, including expansion of our air purification product portfolio in China, were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses. As a result of these factors, first quarter segment operating margin of 12.4% was 100 basis points lower than a year ago.","Our corporate expenses increased in the first quarter compared with the year-ago period, primarily as a result of higher expenses at our Corporate Technology Center. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2016 was 29%. The rate was similar to the prior-year quarter and lower than our previously disclosed effective tax rate guidance for the full year 2016 of 30.5% to 31%, due to the early adoption of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation. The lower effective tax rate compared with our previous guidance benefited our first quarter 2016 results by $0.02 per share.","Cash provided by operations during the first quarter was $27 million compared with flat operating cash flows during the same period last year, driven primarily by higher earnings in the 2016 period. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt to capital ratio was 16% at the end of the first quarter. We have cash balances totaling over $640 million located offshore, and our net cash position was approximately $354 million at the end of March.","During the first quarter, we repurchased, under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan, approximately 430,000 shares of common stock for a total of $30 million. We had approximately 2.15 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of the first quarter.","This morning, we announced an increase in the midpoint of our 2016 EPS guidance and a range between $3.47 and $3.55 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents an 11% increase in EPS compared with our 2015 results.","Please turn to slide nine for several 2016 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2016 to be approximately $330 million, which is less than 2015, primarily related to expected higher outlays for working capital this year compared with 2015.","Due to the strong growth of our water treatment business in China, we will reach the capacity of our existing lease facility in the next few years. Our 2016 capital spending plans include approximately $20 million related to construction of a new water treatment manufacturing and air purification assembly facility in China. Total cost for the facility, which is expected to be completed in 2018, will be approximately $65 million. In addition, we will complete capacity expansion at two North America plants in 2016 at a cost of approximately $7 million. Our 2016 capital spending plan also includes approximately $9 million to support the ERP implementation.","We've revised our capital spending plans for 2016 and now expect capital expenditures to be between $110 million and $120 million in 2016, a reduction of approximately $10 million due primarily to changes to the construction timeline of our new plant in China. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2016.","We successfully completed three ERP go-live milestones since 2014. We expect to convert the vast majority of our North America plant sites by the end of 2016.","Expenses related to our ERP implementation were about $16 million in 2015 and are projected to be approximately $24 million in 2016, higher than the previous year due to the large number of scheduled go-live events in 2016. The majority of the remaining 2016 incremental ERP cost is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2016, higher than the $43 million in 2015, primarily due to higher expenses at our Corporate Technology Center and expected lower interest rate than last year on cash deposits in China.","Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 30.5%, higher than the 29.7% rate experienced in 2015 due to a change in our geographic earnings mix.","We expect to continue to repurchase shares at a value equal to our free cash flow after dividends, or approximately $175 million in 2016. The repurchase amount is higher than our original estimate of $150 million for the year, as we incorporated the lower capital spending projection into our repurchase plan. This is consistent with our stated policy to maintain our net cash balance at approximately $350 million. As a result, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares for the year will be 88 million. This is the high end of our previous guidance as adoption of the share-based compensation standard results in more diluted shares outstanding.","I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the business assumptions in our 2016 outlook and our growth strategy beginning on slide 10. Ajita?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John. We expect our business to collectively grow between 9% and 9.5% in local currency and between 7% and 7.5% in U.S. dollars in 2016. The assumptions for currency underlying our organic growth forecast are at current rates, with the exception of a modest decline assumed in the China currency rate. We expect steel prices to remain firm, as they are up over $150 per ton since the beginning of the year. This will have a negative impact on margins starting in the second half of the year.","Specific to our North America segment, we expect four months of pricing benefit in 2016 as the 2015 price increases in the U.S. will anniversary in late April. We expect U.S. residential water heater volumes will grow by 100,000 to 150,000 units in 2016, primarily as a result of new construction.","We are seeing a trend emerge in the commercial water heater industry. The majority of the growth in commercial industry units so far in 2016 has been in the 55-gallon to 90-gallon electric category. You may recall similarly sized electric residential units were discontinued by NAECA III. Driven by continued growth in the small electric category, we expect U.S. commercial water heater volumes will grow 10,000 units in 2016 after strong growth in 2015.","Residential and commercial boiler sales growth in the first quarter exceeded 15% as the continuing transition to condensing boilers and Lochinvar's new product introductions drove growth. Recall that about 55% of our Lochinvar-branded products are boilers and related products, including parts.","The remainder, which is composed of residential and commercial water heaters, which declined in the first quarter primarily due to a heavy pre-buy a year ago. Our Lochinvar-branded sales are seasonally skewed to the second half of the year, which coincides with the heating season.","The water heaters we sell in Canada are manufactured in the U.S. The Canadian dollar weakness has resulted in a significant product cost increase to our Canadian operations in 2016, which has been partially offset by announced price increases. The magnitude of this headwind is over $5 million. These factors, in addition to the assumptions John discussed earlier, lead to our expectation that our North America segment operating margin will be between 20.5% and 21% in 2016.","Specific to our Rest of World segment, we are a consumer products company in China, which distinguishes us from most industrial companies operating in China. In local currency, our sales in China have grown by 18% in 2014, 16% in 2015, and 17% in the first quarter of this year, despite a softer China economy. We have various growth drivers underpinning our China business, which give us confidence to project an annual growth rate of approximately 15% in local currency for 2016. These drivers include: overall water heater market growth driven by household formation and an emerging replacement market; geographic expansion; market share gains; growth in water treatment and air purification products; and an improved product mix. The Rest of World segment operating margin for 2016 will be similar to last year's margin of 13%.","I'm now moving on to slide 11. Especially in these volatile and uncertain economic times, we believe our long-term annual 8% organic growth potential and our stable defensive replacement market, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North American water heater and boiler volumes, positively differentiates A.O. Smith among other industrial companies. Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and now we are available and open for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","So I just wanted to get some color on the China. Ajita, in the press release you guys have talked about higher selling cost to support expansion in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Can you expand on that, like where is this expansion happening and which particular markets we are talking about here?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Why don't I give a headline, and John maybe you want to add some color to it? A couple of things. We are expanding into \u2013 we have always been expanding and we are expanding into smaller cities. We are expanding our own A.O. Smith stores. We are also investing in some new categories, which is continued investment in water treatment and air purification, and we are also investing in the commercial side of the water treatment market. So there's lots of investment going on for expansion in the future.","One of the things as we think and as I have talked about very consistently, we are never going to be dependent on a stagnant portfolio of products in China for growth, okay, because that obviously doesn't last forever. And as we are always going to be investing in new categories to be able to leverage this incredible asset that we have in China, our brand name, our distribution, our manufacturing capability, the very strong team we have in China. So we are constantly investing in these new categories which are going to be our growth engines in the future.","And right now, like I said, we are continuing to invest in water treatment and the commercial side of water treatment, air purification expansion geographically. And as we've consistently said in the past, we are looking at mid-teens type margins in China over the long term. There's going to be leverage as our volume grows, but the leverage is going to be less than what you would find in the U.S., because we are investing and because the SG&A in China tends to be much more variable than the SG&A expenses in North America.","John, you want to add anything to that?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think the only thing I would add is obviously wage inflation is going up faster in China, and so there is some inflation cost also in that SG&A number.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Just a follow-on on China, again. When you look at the headline news about the property prices or the residential prices in China, home prices going up and the household formation you talked about in your commentary, can you give us some color? Like as we talk about like some of the consumer markets kind of slowing down, you look at like auto companies talking about slower growth in China over the next five years, how does that hold actually with your 15% view over the next few years here?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Bhupender, that's a great question. And again, John, you maybe want to add some color. As we look at it, in the appliance, in the consumer appliance categories, we are not seeing that, okay. And some of the things that we look at, if you look at the some of the forecasts we have IMF, UBS, they are forecasting the consumption component of GDP to grow between 7% and 8% in 2016. We are also seeing the sales of retail square footage of housing actually go up. So some of the indicators we are seeing in the macro economy, we hear different numbers and different parts of it, and certainly the export related industries are not doing well. But the consumption based industries seem to be doing well and we are seeing that in our market. John, anything you want to add?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And I think just remember that in our China growth model, we're assuming about 7% market growth in water heaters. And we're comfortable with that as appliance sales seem to be going up 6% and 7%, and I think we're going to benefit from the fact that replacement is becoming a bigger component. So those are kind of our assumptions in our 15%.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks so much. I'll be joining the queue.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And maybe just one thing also, Bhupender, when we look at \u2013 for our 15% growth we look at a market growth of about 7%, and then the other components in terms of things like new products, market share growth, et cetera, are coming in to add up to our 15%. So right now, we feel comfortable with what we see.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady from SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open.","Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Back on the China question, your comment on the replacement market coming to China, can you just maybe comment on what the replacement market is starting to look like in China and sort of what kind of growth you'd expect over the next 18 months, 24 months out of that?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, all we have, Charley, is kind of our survey data. And as we look in Tier 1 cities, if you go back two or three years, that percent was about 35% replacement, and now it's approaching 50%. And that's just logical as penetration in Tier 1 cities is probably approaching 90-plus-%, and units fail. I mean we talk about our units lasting eight years to nine years and we think maybe our competitors' last less, and now replacement is going to become a bigger component.","Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Does that over time, maybe in the next 12 months, have any positive impact on reducing the promotional spend that you've got to put out there, or is it just something you've got to keep doing because you're still expanding in the market, and now you've got the water and the air added into that?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I don't think that by itself results in lower promotional expenses, I don't know if you can see that, but I don't think that would.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No.","Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","But I guess do you see it coming down, I guess is where I'm getting at?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think without a doubt, as Ajita said, our long-term objective is to have SG&A as a smaller percent of sales. I mean we want to be able to leverage our top line growth. But right now, we're investing \u2013 we're incubating some businesses like Combi Boilers, like water treatment, like air purification. And as we expand the distribution outlets, we incur costs for display, we incur costs for promoters, et cetera. So that's still kind of the mode we're in right now. But clearly, our objective is down the road to be able to leverage that.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. And also, we are always very cognizant of these costs and doing things to bring them down. John said something that reminded me. In the past when we had \u2013 when we expanded, and we had new promoters, we spent a lot of money training those promoters. Now, we do obviously still train them, but we use things like WeChat and different tools that bring that promotion \u2013 the training cost of these promoters down very significantly, okay? So we are always looking at how we make those SG&A expenses go down and become much more productive. But at the same time, as we expand geographically and get into new categories, we are going to have to be spending, investing to make sure that we have the adequate presence in those categories with new competitors.","Charley Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Hey, morning. A couple of questions. First of all, just with respect to steel prices moving higher as of late, and you mentioned this in your prepared remarks, how should we think about the cascade, if you will, or progression of margins as we move through the year, particularly in North America relative to where you are in Q1? And obviously mix may or may not play a role in that, so if you could fold that in, that would be great.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I would say, it won't really affect margins much in the second quarter. As you know, there is a lag. But we certainly do see a progression of margins affecting the third quarter and fourth quarter because this increase really started happening in March, late February. And so it's going to affect us in the third quarter and fourth quarter.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","I guess as a follow-up and unrelated, moving over to China, historically you've given some quantification of water treatment, air purification revenues. If you're willing to do that for the first quarter and what your expectation is for 2016, that would be helpful.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Water treatment did very well, was up 30%. We would expect it would be up about 30% for the year. Air purification did quite well. As we've said it's a seasonal business. It was up about $8 million or $9 million. We didn't basically have a product the prior year. And as we've said in the past, it'll really be the fourth quarter and the first quarter will be the major selling points for air purification. So we're still comfortable with that forecast of $20 million or so, and it'll be primarily first quarter and fourth quarter.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we have some market leading products coming out during the year that'll help the fourth quarter season. So we feel pretty good about that forecast.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Morning, everyone.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Mike.","Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Morning.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So a couple questions on North America, first on the commercial side. Obviously, you're still expecting growth for the full year. What happened in the first quarter on the volume side? AHRI numbers seem to point to a decent environment still. Anything specific you'd point to there, and then what gives confidence (27:15)?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It really relates, Mike, to what Ajita said, the 55-gallon to 90-gallon electric category, that represented all of the growth. We just recently introduced products to better compete in that portion of the commercial water heater market and we expect to get our share of this market as the year progresses. But that's really the reason we were down a little bit while the market was actually, we think, up a little bit.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That makes sense. And then talk about the inventory levels on the residential channel in North America, obviously challenged in the first quarter on the comps side. Are you seeing the right sequential patterns in the numbers to help give some confidence in that up 100,000 plus units this year? And maybe just talk about what the customers are saying on that side?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, obviously, the first quarter was down, and quite frankly it was down more than we expected. We would have thought it would have been down 300,000 or so, the pre-buy that we said last year and it will turn out to be down more than 400,000. We're still comfortable with that 100% increase -- I mean, 100,000 unit increase for a couple of reasons. One is we obviously have very favorable comps as we get to the last half of the year. We expect completions to be up about 100,000 to 150,000, so that should pass through. We just completed our regional sales managers, and I think as the input we got from them is that they're positive and their customers are positive for the year. So we'll continue to monitor it. But yeah, it did start out a little slower than we thought, but we think that forecast of $9 million, $9.1 million is certainly achievable at this point.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And also, Mike, in terms of what customers are saying and what we're hearing in the marketplace, so this is anecdotal, but things we are hearing and consistently is that there was \u2013 obviously the buy-in was bigger than we anticipated, I thought it was. And part of the reason, which is what we're hearing, is that, normally, when there is a buy-in because of a price increase, it's the distributors who buy in. But this time, it seems like contractors bought in also, okay, that's what we're hearing. And the reason is that some of the new NAECA III type units were slightly bigger than the older units.","So it was a tight fit, especially in multifamily housing, which is doing very well. And so there seems to be a new component of the buy-in. In talking to other plumbing industry suppliers to the wholesale marketplace, obviously people we don't compete with, also their thoughts in terms of new construction is very similar to ours, in that 1.1 million to 1.2 million type new construction. And so putting it all together, talking about what the sell-through rates are at distribution, we feel pretty good about the forecast and the guidance.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. I appreciate the additional color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is open.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Yes.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Okay. So I guess the question I have, obviously you had some price costs and some movement in this year in terms of North America, and I'll talk to Pat offline about some of the details of that in the back half. But just conceptually going forward, what are you thinking in kind of a steady state environment? You can get a couple of points of price, volumes will be a couple of points, what do you think you can get incremental margins on a sustainable basis in North America for the next couple of years?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Rob, we really haven't come out with a forecast on what margins are going to do in the next couple of years, and there is obviously a lot of variables in that. I mean we still expect that the industry is going to continue to grow, because that 1.1 million completions, that's below the norm we think. So we think that's going to continue to grow. We think that Lochinvar, given where they are specifically from a boiler standpoint, we think will continue to grow at 10%. And they obviously contribute at very attractive margins. So it's certainly our objective to grow margins, but we have not put out any forecast on what they're going to do in the next couple of years.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But also I think it's \u2013 you can say that our most challenged category from a margin perspective is our residential water heater category, which we've talked about in the past. And again, we've said in the past that we expect 20% to 25% type incremental in that category and we feel pretty comfortable with that.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Now, that's helpful. And then switching gears to China and about water treatment, could you just expand about some of the investments you've made there on the CapEx side and does it point to some of your ambitions as to how big that market could be? Obviously, you had 30% growth I think in water heaters in the quarter. I think that was probably just a nominal number. But maybe you could just \u2013 not water, excuse me, in water treatment in China, but could you speak about kind of the opportunity you see there? Do you think there is a chance that perhaps investors are kind of underselling that opportunity over the longer term?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, CMM has put out an estimate that they think the water treatment market can grow over approximately 30% for the next several years. And the basis for that is the low penetration rate of units in China. We also are familiar with the water issues they have. We have the best product in the market. It wastes less water, longer lasting filter. And it's RO which is the area that is the preferred method for water filtration in China. So we're very comfortable as we look out that a 30% growth rate is achievable. And so whether investors are incorporating that or not, I mean we think we're building a very good water filtration business. Last year, the A.O. Smith brand sold $110 million worth; that was up from $75 million the previous year and up $43 million the prior year. We also have some small sales in Vietnam, some small sales in Turkey, and we're also still selling the legacy business. So I think we're developing a very solid water filtration business.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think also to add to that, as I look out into the future in terms of our \u2013 again, to be the leader, we have to have market leading products and we have a tremendous portfolio of products in the pipeline which I feel very good about. The other thing which I alluded to at the beginning of the conversation is that we are also now expanding and stepping into the commercial side of the water treatment business. This would be appliances for small restaurants and things like that. So we feel very good about the potential for water treatment in China and frankly around the world in emerging markets.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Ajita, just wanted to get back to just this whole inventory dynamic. So when you talk to your distributors about inventories and sell-through and maybe their visibility into the contractor, what's kind of your conclusion on the inventory situation? And I guess around that, any kind of pause or digestion from customers, just given how big the price increase was here for NAECA III water heaters?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","First of all, like I said, this is anecdotal, so I don't have real good facts and numbers, it's conversation. One of the questions we were wondering about was whether people cut back on inventories and had the same dollar investment as opposed to unit investment because of the price increase, which is what I think you're alluding to. From what I understand in talking to some of our larger customers, they did not do that, okay, because their replenishment is really based on units. And so there wasn't any cutback because of that. I think that inventory levels in wholesale are okay. Retail maybe a little low, wholesale are where they should be, normal level. John, anything you can add to that?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I think to answer your last question, we have not seen any pushback from the end customer. And I've said this in the past, I mean if you look at what a water heater costs, it is the cheapest appliance out there. It's at a six-year warranty. It's going to last 13 years to 14 years, and it's very energy efficient. So it is a very realistically priced product to the end consumer, which is obviously important.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So if you look at the different components \u2013 the different segments of people buying, if you think of new construction, it's going to happen. If you think of forced replacement, it's going to happen. If you think of \u2013 there is about, we think, 20% to 25% depending on the year and the economy of the replacement market is discretionary replacement. Now, that component you can say, wait a minute, maybe price does impact it, we don't have any real good facts.","But at the end of the day, someone's going to buy a water heater maybe once, maybe twice in a lifetime. So it's not a price point that people have in their minds as being something familiar. When they are in the market, they go in and they check on a price and then they decide whether they're going to go ahead or not. That component could be impacted, but we don't really see evidence of that. We'll know more as time goes on because we have techniques, which we do track things like that and track people who buy water heaters and some of the reasoning. But some of those things \u2013 that data lags and we'll have to \u2013 it'll take us some time to really get to the bottom of that.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just on China, you have quite a bit of cash trapped over in China. What's kind of the cost to repatriate that? We've heard about people kind of, with the FX volatility, wanting to kind of move cash out of China. How does that kind of inform your view on that trapped cash?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So we've taken out in the last two years or so $150 million of dividends out of China. When you take it out of China to Europe, you pay about a 10 \u2013 not about, you pay a 10% withholding tax to China. And then to bring it back from Europe back to the U.S., it would be an incremental low 20% type charge. So I mean that's the whole discussion going on in Washington, right, is it's very expensive to repatriate money back to the U.S. And until the government makes some changes in it, companies are going to keep it offshore. So we continue to look for opportunities in China. So at this time right now, we're leaving that money there, and we're comfortable with that.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Scott.","Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So is there anything that you see in the market right now where the increase in steel prices that we've seen cannot be passed on to customers later this year?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think, look, the pricing that we had last year is holding in the marketplace. In terms of the future, I really can't speculate in terms of what could or couldn't happen.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","But correct me if I'm wrong that we're talking here mostly, right, about the distributors, because on the retail side, it's contracted.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Parts of it, yeah.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, a portion of it is.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","A portion of it is, so there are pass-through mechanisms for a portion of it.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And distributors like price increases as long as they're measured historically, right?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Scott, I'm not going to speculate on future pricing, okay? I mean that's something I've never done. If you look at over time, okay, let's look at the past rather than looking at the future, over time when there are significant material price increases, we've been able to pass that on to the marketplace. That's what the history has been. I can't speculate in terms of the future when it comes to pricing for obvious reasons.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","No problem. Understand. Hey, was just wondering, piggybacking off of the cash questions, how does the M&A pipeline look? I mean is there any possibility of getting something done this year?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Obviously, we can't talk about anything that's happening. But I can talk about there was a lull in the market in terms of potential \u2013 the activity level in the marketplace. There was a lull for a while, but recently things have picked up a bit. So there are the ups and downs, as you know, and the market is active.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Here's my last question. We're now toward the end of April, and water heaters are a pretty short cycle business. So I'm just wondering is, you made a comment during your remarks that you guys \u2013 or it may have been John, that you guys are expecting the pre-buy effects to impact some of April as well. Are you at a point today based on the most recent data, where the pre-buying maybe now looks more behind you?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'm not sure, Scott, the pre-buy was last year. That was when the pre-buy happened was last year, and it really happened kind of up through middle of April. I think our order rate, I'd tell you in April is about normal. So again, I think we have favorable comps the last half of the year, and we would hope we're going to see completions grow by 100,000 units, 150,000 units. So we'll certainly have better visibility as we get through the second quarter, but we think right now it's reasonable.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right. No, John, that's what I'm saying. I know that the pre-buy was last year.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","What I'm saying is that have you seen in the recent data, where you're now largely done with that comp that the order rates are normalizing and it sounds like you are seeing that.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, but it's very short period, right, because again the pre-buy went through April 15 of last year, so I mean we're looking at a very short period.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Rose from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I had a couple of just quick follow-up questions; most of mine have been answered. I was wondering if you could break out \u2013 you broke out the water treatment and purifier sales increases in China, but I didn't capture the water heater number anywhere. What was the growth in water heaters in China, residential?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We really haven't given that out, but both our electric and instantaneous were up.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Up in mid-single digits, low-single digits?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It depends. I mean gas continues to grow faster than electric, which we expect.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then lastly is on Lochinvar. I didn't hear a growth number out of Lochinvar, maybe I missed it. What did they grow in the quarter?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Lochinvar had an interesting quarter. As we said, they were up about 15% on the boiler business, but they were down significantly on the residential side. And the reason for that was last year they had a pre-buy. Their units were up 44% compared to the prior year, while the industry was only up 14%. This year, their units were down 39% versus the industry as we said was down 16%. So their residential water heater sales were down over $2 million. So when you incorporate that into the boiler growth, they were up about 3% on a net basis, I think 4%, 5% on a gross basis. And why we're still comfortable with the 10% is they have favorable comps the last half of the year and their new boiler products have been very well accepted in the marketplace. So we think this residential piece was just a lumpy kind of quarter-to-quarter issue.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, with a very high buy-in last year.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And that looks like all the questioners that we have in the queue at this time.

You may begin.","Patricia Ackerman","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on our 2015 first quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call including answers to your questions will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","Ajita, I will now turn the call over to you.","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you, Pat and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Our first quarter results set quarterly records. We continued to see the benefits in our performance from an improving economy in the U.S. and I expanding consumer business in China. Here are a few highlights. Our organic growth in both of our segments drove sales 12% higher to a record $619 million. China sales were up 15%.","Our net earnings of $0.65 per share were 30% higher than the adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 recorded in 2014 primarily due to higher sales. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion to return to shareholders. We repurchased approximately 333,000 shares for $21 million during the first quarter. We increased our dividend by 27% in January. Both of these actions are consistent with our stated capital deployment strategy.","Our transition to NAECA III compliant products is on track. This is a very complex project impacting approximately 80% of our residential water heaters. Our team has done a tremendous job of navigating through this very challenging activity.","John will now describe our results in more detail.","John Kita","Thank you, Ajita. Sales in the first quarter of $619 million were 12% higher than the previous year driven by higher sales water heaters and commercial boilers in the U.S. and water heater and water treatment products in China. Net earnings of $58 million were 18% higher than first quarter adjusted earnings in 2014. Net earnings of $0.65 per share improved 20% compared with adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 in 2014.","Sales in our North America segment of $429 million increased 10% over 2014 driven by higher volumes of U.S. water heaters and boilers. We believe a portion of the increase in water heater sales resulted from a pre-buy associated with our announced price increases for both commercial water heaters and NAECA III compliant residential water heaters. The price increases were effective in April.","Lochinvar branded products grew over 10% during the quarter as new products, including our CREST boiler family continued to gain market acceptance. Rest of world segment sales of $196 million increased 13% compared with 2014. China sales increased 15% driven by higher demand for water heaters and water treatment products.","North America operating earnings of $71 million were 20% higher than adjusted segment operating earnings in the previous year and operating margin of 16.6% was significantly above the 15.2% adjusted operating margin one year ago. The favorable impact from higher volumes for residential water heaters and higher margin commercial water heaters and boilers in the U.S. was partially offset by approximately 2.5 million in expected incremental ERP implementation costs.","Rest of world operating earnings of $26 million improved 4% compared with 2014. Higher profits in China were partially offset by an approximately $1 million larger loss in India, which was expected due to the launch of water treatment products. Operating margin of 13.4% down from the previous year, primarily due to the larger loss in India and the launch of air purifiers in China.","Our corporate expenses declined modestly from the prior year adjusted corporate expenses. We borrowed $75 million of 10-year average life fixed rate debt to achieve a better balance of fixed to floating rates in our debt portfolio. The higher rate on the term debt and the higher debt levels in the first quarter of 2015 account for the higher interest expense.","Cash used by continuing operations during the first quarter 2015 of $3 million compares with $12 million provided in 2015. Higher earnings were more than offset by larger outlays for working capital in the 2015 period. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 18% at the end of March 2015. We have cash balances totaling almost $575 million located offshore and our net cash position was approximately $270 million at the end of March.","During the first quarter we repurchase approximately 333,000 shares of common stock for a total of $21 million under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan. We had approximately 2.2 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of March. Depending on factors such as stock price, working capital requirements and alternative investment opportunities, we expect to spend approximately $100 million on share repurchase activity in 2015, resulting in net cash levels around $320 million at the end of 2015 similar to 2014 year-end levels. This is consistent with our stated capital allocation strategy.","We expect our cash flow from operations in 2015 to be between $270 million and $280 million. We expect capital expenditures to between $100 million and a $110 million in 2015 which includes approximately $15 million to support the ERP implementation and approximately $30 million related to capacity expansion in China and in the U.S., to support Lochinvar branded sales.","Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $66 million in 2015. We successfully completed our first ERP go-live milestone in August 2014. We expect the remainder of our North American planned sites to go-live in 2015 and 2016.","ERP implementation expenses were $14 million in 2014 and are projected to be $20 million in 2015. We estimate the incremental ERP cost will occur in the first half of 2015. We estimate our effective tax rate to be between 29% and 30% in 2015. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2015.","This morning we increased our 2015 EPS guidance to between $2.72 to $2.82 per share. The midpoint of our upgraded EPS guidance represents a $0.05 per share increase over our previous guidance and a 14% increase in EPS compared with our 2014 adjusted results.","We expect our earnings per share in the second quarter of 2015 to be above flat with 2014 adjusted second quarter earnings per share due to the following factors; we believe our second quarter residential and commercial water heater volumes will be impacted by the first quarter pre-buy.","We expect ERP costs will be about $4 million higher in the second quarter 2015 as compared to the prior year and we expect the benefits of NAECA 3 pricing will be effective about mid-second quarter.","I'll now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the assumptions in our 2015 outlook and our growth strategy. Ajita?","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you, John. As John mentioned, the midpoint of our updated 2015 guidance implies growth of 14% over last year. The outlook for 2015 includes the following assumptions; first, we continue to expect strong profitable growth in China driven by expected and continued overall water heater market growth, market share gains, improved product mix and significant water treatment product growth. Collectively, we expect these drivers to deliver growth at two times China's GDP growth rate.","Second, we forecast Lochinvar-branded product sales to continue to grow at least 10% keeping pace with the annual growth rates we have achieved since purchasing the business in 2011. This is well ahead of GDP growth in the U.S. as we believe our Lochinvar brand will continue to benefit from the expected transition from lower efficiency non-condensing boilers to high efficiency condensing boilers and new products driven by market leading innovation.","We're starting to see strong acceptance from our newly introduced expansion of the CREST boiler family which targets the 750,000 to 2 million BTU per hour portion of the condensing boiler market segment. We launched this product earlier this year in advance of the 2015, 2016 heating season.","Third, we announced to our US customers an average residential price increase of approximately 20% on NAECA 3 compliant products. We also announced a price increase on our US commercial water heaters, which became effective in April. Our US team has executed superbly through the NAECA 3 transition so far this year and we now expect the commercial water heater industry to modestly grow in 2015 after a strong first quarter.","Fourth, we continue to seek ways to leverage our strong brand and distribution channel in China. Launching an A.O. Smith branded water treatment product line in 2010 was our first foray into a new product category in the region. Growing A.O. Smith-branded water treatment sales from $18 million to $75 million in the last two years continues to prove the power and the value of our A.O. Smith brand and infrastructure in China.","Our experienced Chinese management team continues to leverage these assets to succeed in the very competitive and crowded Chinese marketplace. Total China water treatment sales in 2014 were $90 million, including $15 million of sales which are not branded A.O. Smith.","China Market Monitor or CMM estimates that the point of use residential water treatment category in China will grow at over 40% per year over the next five years and we're excited about the opportunity and pleased with the market share gains that we have achieved through leveraging our brand, our engineering and our distribution strength.","In China, our brand attributes include quality, reliability, safety and trust. These attributes translate well to air purifiers, which along with water treatment products, are among the fastest growing home appliance categories in China as measured by CMM. Partnering with a Japanese manufacturer, we launched the A.O. Smith brand air purifier in China late in the first quarter of 2015. An investment for the future, air purifier sales are expected to be less than $10 million in 2015 with losses of approximately $4 million primarily related to advertising and promotion costs.","Fifth, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity in India and we're committed to the country with the second largest population and the second fastest growing economy in the world and its developing middle class who desire quality of life products. India is an investment for the future and the $7.5 million loss that we expect in India this year is similar to 2014 and includes higher product development and advertising costs related to the launch of water treatment products. We expect overall sales in India to be between $20 million and $25 million in 2015.","We plan to hold an Analyst Day on May 21 at our Lochinvar plant near Nashville. The main focus will be presentations by our business leaders including Kevin Wheeler, Wei Ding, who will travel from China and Bill Vallett. Attendees will also have the option to tour the Lochinvar facility. This next graphic depicts the organic growth potential we see in our business going forward. In fact, we expect North America water heater sales will grow faster than 4% in 2015 as a result of the price increase on our NAECA 3 compliant products and commercial water heaters and result in total company sales growth of approximately 10%.","Our lack of currency exposure to the volatile euro increases our comfort with our growth forecast. Our acquisition strategy has not changed. We remain focused on water heating and water treating companies around the world as well as leveraging our brand and distribution channel in China. The acquisition landscape continues to be expensive as sustained price appreciation in equity markets, lower financing costs and the lack of organic growth for many strategic buyers drive prices higher.","Our teams are energetic, engaged and disciplined. Our capital deployment strategies continue to support a combination of investments for organic growth, acquisitions, share repurchase and dividends. You have seen this chart before and we show this only as a reminder that we will continue to be a financially disciplined acquirer of companies in our stated corporate strategy.","This concludes our prepared remarks and now we're open for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charley Brady with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady","Thanks, good morning.","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning.","Charles D. Brady","I know it's difficult, but any sense as to the magnitude of the pre-buy impact on Q1 Rizzi water heater sales.","Ajita Rajendra","Well, as we look you've probably seen the AHRI data for January and February it was very strong, we think that continued at least for us it did in March so our estimate is the industry was probably up 250,000 to 300,000 units from the prior year, our guess would be a majority of that was pre-buy associated.","Charles D. Brady","Okay, and you are seeing that trend kind of continue into this month?","Ajita Rajendra","I think orders are about where we expected. I mean as we said we expected to come down in the second quarter. So nothing surprising so far, but were only 20 days into the month.","Charles D. Brady","Fair point. Just on China real quick then. I don't know if you called it up, but what was the margin impact on the air purification product launch costs in the quarter?","Ajita Rajendra","The air purification was a loss of about $500,000, so about 4\/10 of a percent I guess.","Charles D. Brady","That\u2019s all I have. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Robert Baird.","Michael P. Halloran","So how much inventory do you think in the North American channel right now of the older model. We talking about a month and a half or so based on when you're, when you expect the pricing to start rolling through mid-2Q?","Ajita Rajendra","Yes. I think that's reasonable. You've almost got a break it down into pieces if you look at the discontinued product, which was over 55 gallon and some of the other products there's a pretty significant inventory build we think in those products. And that's going to kind of spread out over the probably the next nine months.","We are not I would say I don't think we\u2019re uncomfortable with the level of the old product out there I think as we talked about we put people on allocation and so I think we're relatively comfortable I think with the inventory levels except again for that discontinued product which we expected to be up and that started the pre-buy in the fourth quarter and it certainly has continued in the first quarter of those products.","Michael P. Halloran","That's good color there. And then any sense for how the industry from a ability to meet the new orders of the new standard water heaters. Any sense for how the industry itself is adapting any signs of any logistics as supply chain constraints are operational constraints right now?","Ajita Rajendra","We haven't seen anything that we really talked about ourselves I don't think - there's expectations everybody had a long time to prepare for this.","John Kita","From an operational perspective I think we are right on track and where we expected to be at this point.","Michael P. Halloran","That makes sense. About what I would've thought and then lastly you know raise the commercial expectations a little bit here. What do you guys see on the underlying commercial water heater market and what were the factors that drove a price increase being put through for your perspective.","Ajita Rajendra","Well, we did see the commercial industry was strong. It was up where guessing 6,000 to 7,000 units and part of that we think was some pre-buy associated with the price increase. The rest of it is when we talk to our commercial salesman, the commercial market has been very strong. I mean Lochinvar for example had a great quarter their commercial water heaters and commercial boilers were very strong.","They had lower engineering costs so when we look at the margin improvement in North America a good portion of that is due to just Lochinvar commercial mix. So it was very good quarter. So we have not done a good job of forecasting commercial as you know, but there are some times that a strong will see how it continues and that's really what drove us to raise commercial.","Michael P. Halloran","Good I appreciate the time is always. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Bremer with Maxim Group.","William Bremer","Good morning gentlemen.","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning.","William Bremer","Let's go to Lochinvar. You just called out the commercial end of it was very strong. What types of like visibility do you have on Lochinvar and I also want you to comment a little bit on the manufacturing expansion plan for them as well?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, I mean the visibility we have is as I said the commercial continues to be very strong for them and it\u2019s across the board and as you are aware we brought out some new products we extended the CREST product line we brought out new fire tube boiler for the 400 to 850 BTU area both those products have been well received and so we're optimistic and the capacity is for a good reason. I mean when they have been growing 10 plus percent we need to add capacity but also they built their business on innovation and we're adding several new labs et cetera. Engineering labs for them to continue that goal.","John Kita","We are essentially doubling our testing capability. In Lochinvar as part of the expansion.","William Bremer","Okay. Great. And then let's go to the aftermarket there. We start to see aftermarket specifically for the highly condensing boilers pick up year-over-year.","Ajita Rajendra","Well actually was pretty flat in the first quarter and the reason for that as you may recall last year while we talked about the first quarter, that parts business was up quite a bit because of the weather et cetera. So that part of the business has been kind of in that 12% to 13% and it continues grow with the company. So we are very pleased with that part of the business.","William Bremer","And then finally on the air purification, how is that progressing and can you give us a little inside on are there any other avenues that will just slowly gravitate into maybe larger units and possibly commercial and are we to stay with the residential for the time being?","Ajita Rajendra","I think it\u2019s very early in terms of air purifiers, but we see air purifier this is right on strategy from the point of you of leveraging infrastructure and brand in China and air purifiers along with water treatment products, residential water treatment products and residential air purifiers among the fastest growth categories of appliances - home appliances in China. So this is bright in line with our expansion and certainly what we see is that we will expanding that line as it goes. So we are very optimistic but it\u2019s very early to tell we\u2019ve just introduce the product.","William Bremer","Great. Nice quarter, Ajita thank you.","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Graham with Jefferies.","Scott Graham","Hey, good morning all.","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Graham","So could you tell us what the same-store sales growth was in Tier 1 and Tier 2?","John Kita","Scott as we've talked about in the past and I think it's even become more complicated for us to try to measure that as we add stores and close stores. So our people over there are having some struggles calculating that. The bottom line is unit volume was up nicely. I could conjecture and say I think part of it is due to the new stores we\u2019ve add it, but remember for the most part those are being added in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities. And I think same stores were seeing nice improvements. So I think China had a very good first quarter up to 15% and water treatment continues to do very well.","Scott Graham","Okay, fair enough. The price increase in North America is that I know it\u2019s very early, but any signs of has your confidence increased, decreased are you good with this price increase is it holding so for.","John Kita","Scott as I have said in the past, we can\u2019t really comment on prices we could prices up and will have to see what happens.","Scott Graham","Okay, last thing on - I am going to get one question answered here. Okay. On acquisitions and I'm not asking for anything that's overly sensitive for anything, but it sounds to me as if you know we were looking at one deal and that didn't work, and we were looking at maybe the purification and that may be didn't work and JVs. Is this going to be maybe something new? Because it seems like JVs are a very viable option for some capital deployment understanding of course there's going to be some losses in the early periods of the operations but can we see more of this from you guys in the rest of world.","John Kita","I'll start and Ajita can finish. We really don't have a JV in the air purification you're right we looked for air purification acquisitions there have not come up with anything yet so the next step we took as we looked at companies that were there that had good product that didn't have what we have which is the brand and distribution so we under into buy\/sell range but not really to JV buy\/sell range with the manufacture will continue to look for opportunities because we certainly think our brand in our distribution, but we are also going to want to have best technology. So we will continue to do that. So I don\u2019t think necessarily that JVs we are open to JV I mean it certainly something we are open to, but it\u2019s not necessarily wave of the future for us.","Scott Graham","Fair enough.","Ajita Rajendra","But if you look at JVs we\u2019ve done eight years ago approximately which was with Takagi for our Tankless water heaters in North America, which is going very well. But as we look at capital allocation strategy have not changed it all.","Scott Graham","Now understood.","Ajita Rajendra","We talked about Scott at the last call I believe that we were very close to couple opportunities, acquisition opportunities in the fourth quarter and because of price primarily we didn\u2019t end up do in the deal so we will continue we are certainly seeing competition more from strategic now that we have probably in the past and that\u2019s primarily do in our mind to the fact that they are not growing organically and we are not going to chase pricing because we are growing organically.","Scott Graham","Understanding that you're looking everywhere, has the decline in the value of the euro say increased your figure on a potential European acquisition?","John Kita","We are always looking. It's got to be strategic, okay so we continue to look like I said nothing has really changed. From a capital allocation strategy viewpoint. The fact that the euro is down makes potential acquisitions in Europe more attractive, but again it's got to meet our criteria.","Scott Graham","Gotcha, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Samuel Eisner with Goldman Sachs.","Samuel H. Eisner","Good morning everyone.","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning.","John Kita","Good morning.","Samuel H. Eisner","On the pre-buy can you talk a bit about what your utilization rates were in the quarter and how you expect those to fair for the remainder of the year into the second quarter I just want to understand the impact on earnings from the pre-buy this quarter.","John Kita","Well certainly absorption was very favorable in the first quarter because of the magnitude, and I can't give you a dollar number and what the effect will be in the second quarter, but certainly the run rates will be lower in the second order without a doubt and it will have an impact from and of absorption standpoint we were running full bar January, February, March without.","Samuel H. Eisner","Got it. And then on the working capital build this quarter. Can you just talk a bit about what that\u2019s actually going for what the plans are is that primarily for get new product out in China or just what specially that that\u2019s targeted for?","Ajita Rajendra","Yes, I mean if you look back historically our first quarter normally have the little bit DSO. So when we look at DSO we are saying day sales and receivables plus days and inventory minus AP we are exactly where we were last year first quarter at about 37 days that\u2019s up from the fourth quarter and traditionally is if you look at the pieces of it inventory we did built some finished goods inventory without a doubt so that was primarily North America.","Receivables was kind of across the board when you look at the receivable belt from year-end it's a little deceiving because sales were up from November, December and the last two months of this quarter were up. So it really was reasonable that it's up. So nothing surprising whatsoever on the first quarter cash flow and we expect that we're staying with our same level for the year.","Samuel H. Eisner","Got it. And then just lastly on the price increases in commercial are those are ready out in the market, and the reasoning behind the price increases is that just you feel better about the market so you can push a little bit of price or is that from material related on just want to understand the rationale behind it.","John Kita","The price was put out I think late last year for effective for April 1. And there's a whole variety of reasons that go into it. There had been continual increasing costs previous price increases have not necessarily held so it's been out in the marketplace for quite some time and known. So that's why we think there was some pre-build - pre-buy.","Samuel H. Eisner","And then just based on the last comment you anticipate that this price increase will hold if others have not held?","John Kita","You know we're not going to conjecture our future effects of pluses or minuses on price increases.","Samuel H. Eisner","Alright, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning everyone.","John Kita","Good morning.","Robert McCarthy","First on water treatment I think did you suggest a long-term growth assumption in China collectively by 40% over the next five years is that correct?","Ajita Rajendra","That's based on CMM data which is a marketing group in China 40% we certainly saw that last year and we expect to see that this year and their forecast is for the next four or five years that to grow 40% and that's driven primarily because the penetration rate of water treatment products in China is very low. Compared to other Asian countries and obviously we know that there is some water issues et cetera.","Robert McCarthy","In terms of I mean do you think of that execution happens over the next 18 to 24 months and would you expect it even perhaps think about your multiplier or [indiscernible] your shorthand for growth in China could be higher than specifically?","John Kita","Well, I mean we are comfortable with the two times GDP and you know we broken that model out to three buckets and one of the buckets is for example on water treatment and when it grew last year, it grew about $30 million and we had about $600 million of sales that was above 5%. And we think that the reasonable level going forward and that certainly been important when you look at how other companies are doing in China. There is a slowing down, but we've got that growth through those three different buckets that makes us comfortable at two times GDP.","Robert McCarthy","In terms of your growth drivers in China do you ever get nervous about potential with distribution if it could ever be like an inventory drawdown or any kind of volatility that you could anticipate that could kind of stunt your growth rate for a period of time?","John Kita","Well, I mean when we talk about the growth rate we're really talking about on an annual basis. On quarter-to-quarter we can have some build for various reasons, holidays coming up, customers wanting to get their VIP allowance for the quarter et cetera so that can be a variety of reasons on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but I think we look at it on an annual basis and say that we think that's a reasonable estimate.","Robert McCarthy","Switching gears with India, I mean a work flowing and by no means obviously its early days and you are getting lot of traction but what are kind of the qualitative factors you would decide whether maybe India is not a place you want to grow longer-term. What would be the basis for thinking for a retrenchment there?","John Kita","I am going to let Ajita answer that but I'll say the first point I was here will we started China in 1995 and it was a painful seven or eight years, okay, really painful. Pretty heavy losses, but we were committed to the country because we started long-term growth. So I mean that\u2019s the history of China from 1995 to 2003 that's when we broke even. And then I\u2019ll turn it over to Ajita.","Ajita Rajendra","Yes, I think, first of all there's no - we don't have conversations frankly about retrenchment in India because like John said, we are looking at it long-term and really see the long-term potential in the country. I just in fact just got back earlier this week from a trip to India and the economy there is a lot of expectation and consumer confidence because of the new government.","Although nothing has really happened yet, but from our perspective and looking at what we are doing in terms of building our brand and building our distribution points et cetera. You know things are going okay, given where we are in India. Obviously the economy were a little better last year actually the water heater market declined, housing starts have declined et cetera.","But we expect that to come back because of fundamentals in India in terms of population and the drivers growing the middle class in India are pretty solid long-term we really have believe that this is a long-term tremendous opportunity and in fact in addition to water heating in this quarter, late in the quarter we introduced water treatment products also in India.","Robert McCarthy","Okay, and then\u2026","John Kita","The only thing I\u2019ll add Rob is neither one of us are obviously comfortable losing $7.5 million last year and what we talked about this year, so a similar amount now again we expect to see improvement in the water heater this year and we are making that investment in the water treatment which is making the loss for the whole India about the same, but it\u2019s certainly not our intent to live with $7.5 million losses for a long period of time.","Robert McCarthy","What do you think your reasonable cadence to breakeven then two to three years in India or what are we thinking?","John Kita","I mean you've almost got a break it into the pieces and I think we talked about in the last call, if you think about water heating and that lost about $6.5 million last year we had about $15 million of sales, we expect those sales to move up about $5 million this year and that lost because of the higher sales and also more vertically integrating to go down a couple of million bucks. We look at a breakeven in the range of $30 million to $35 million or so for the water heater business. And we hope that certainly in the next two to three years.","Robert McCarthy","Right. Switching gears to commercial. I mean obviously some clear signs of strength there do you think that speaks to kind of North American commercial construction markets picking up or how would you typify what you are seeing?","Ajita Rajendra","When I talked to our salesmen they would say yes, they are seeing compared to last year this time that there is more cranes, there is more building going on. I mean we had a strong commercial business because of the retrofit, because of the move to high efficiency, because of the move to building restaurants and small hotels, but I think you are starting to see more hospitals, education facilities et cetera. So I think we are cautiously optimistic that things are picking up.","Robert McCarthy","And then finally in terms of your revenue growth for the year have you categorized how much you think I think is 10% core how much of that is price?","Ajita Rajendra","No, we haven't.","Robert McCarthy","Okay, all right. Thanks very much for your time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Northland Capital.","Noah Kaye","Good morning and congrats on the quarter. $10 million for air purification for the first year seems like a very good start. Could you ballpark for us what you think the addressable market could be in China for air purification given your existing footprint.","Ajita Rajendra","So we've startled under $10 million in sales and the real key to remember on the air purification market is the highest sales level are in the third and fourth quarter primarily the fourth quarter, so that's still to come. When we look at the air purification market, our best estimate is about $2.5 billion last year and then if you look at our channel which is kind of retail stores and online, we're seeing it\u2019s probably about half of that if you will is sold through that channel.","And then this is where the guessing comes in. We are not going to play on the low-end. We are going to play on the high-end and our best guess is that's probably 40% to 50% of that number. So it's a long way to say and our best guess is probably $500 million maybe is the addressable market for us.","Noah Kaye","And how would you think about growth rate for that portion of that market, is it comparable to water treatment?","Ajita Rajendra","CMM I mean the good thing about the two areas we are in is those are the two fastest expected appliance growth markets for the next four to five years and both of them are kind of in that 40% range, so time will tell. Again part of the advantage why those are growing is the penetration rate is so low.","Noah Kaye","Sure. Part of the reason of course for your success with water treatment has been that you significantly reengineered and improve their product. You have to do that to kind of grow the sales the way that you want to? Are there other measures that you'll have to take can you talk about that a little bit.","Ajita Rajendra","We will certainly have to do that because our brand the equity of our brand is built around new products and being first to market on capabilities within categories that we're in. So we've entered the market with the [ME2] product and we will have to engineer it and come up with a value proposition that is at least somewhat unique to the market and different. So yes, we will have to - we are investing in engineering and figuring out how we do that.","Noah Kaye","And then so I guess the next question would be given that you have these high growth opportunities in water treatment in your purification. As you look at one, two years how much do your water heater sales in China actually have to grow on the percentage growth basis for you to continue to grow to X GDP, how would you think about that?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, I think probably the easiest way for me to answer that is kind of those buckets we\u2019ve talked about and we\u2019ve kind of laid it out that the first bucket is market growth and if you think of our water heater business right now it\u2019s about 75% of our business over in China and CMM has estimated that\u2019s going to grow at 7% and we think that\u2019s reasonable going forward even as housing slows down we think replacement is increasing, we use to talk about 35% replacement above two to three years ago in Tier-1 cities we are now talking about 45% to 50% so that\u2019s one bucket of approximately 5% and the other bucket is market share higher price as we bring out new products with values and features that consumer want has a higher price and then we grow our distribution.","So where we hope to gain market share is in the water treatment and also in the instantaneous side of the market if you will, the gas instantaneous and then that third bucket is the ancillary product lines which is led by water treatment. So if those buckets that we have kind of stressed why we think we are different than other people who are in China.","Ajita Rajendra","Yes, and water treatment and now air purification which we hope will be another category that grows and also one more as we think of the long-term, the newer categories we are growing like water treatment and air purification has a replacement component that\u2019s in a much shorter cycle than water heater, because not the whole thing but the filters. Okay now we haven\u2019t seen the benefit of that yet, but we hope that benefit will also start growing as we go forward.","Noah Kaye","Terrific. Thank you for the answers and congrats again on the quarter.","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammett with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeff Hammett","Hey, good morning guys.","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning.","Patricia Ackerman","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Hammett","Hey, one last one on price. What if you seen from your peers and competitors on pricing actions are they kind of aligning with what you've announced both in res and commercial?","Ajita Rajendra","We can talk about our pricing increase, which we have but really can't comment on the competition or looking forward and anticipate things happening on pricing.","Jeff Hammett","And then just along those lines I mean you talked about your kind of readiness and everything is intact. How are you thinking about kind of profit flow through on those pricing increased based on your input costs and higher cost of manufacture et cetera.","John Kita","I think we\u2019ve kind of set our margins would stay similar on the new products and so that how we are kind of looking at it if you will.","Jeff Hammett","Okay, great. And then finally, you guys in the last presentation looks like you gave some segment margin guidance 16% for North America 13.5% to 14% for rest of world. Are those still intact I didn't see anything in this presentation.","John Kita","No. But as we raised our guidance I think you can look at probably the North America being a little bit higher than that and that's really driven by the commercial side of the market. You know now that we've raised our commercial estimates and we're a big player there and then we look at Lochinvar, and Lochinvar\u2019s a big player in the commercial and that's stronger. I think it's that combination that allows us to say we think we can get a little bit higher in North America and that's why we raised our guidance.","Jeff Hammett","Okay, perfect, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Vencil with Sterne, Agee.","Todd Vencil","Thanks, good morning, guys.","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning.","Todd Vencil","Covered a lot of good ground here bunch of my questions have been knocked out. I did want to ask about the ERP and just to make sure I am squared away on the number you said $20 million of spend this year coming entirely in the first half?","John Kita","No. I'm sorry. So last year we spent $14 million and it was lower in the first half, higher in the second half last year. This year were saying it's going to be about $20 million spread relatively equally over the year which means the first half is about $6 million more than the first half last year. And then pretty flat year-over-year for the second half.","Todd Vencil","Got it, that makes sense. And that\u2019s all - is that all P&L impact or\u2026","John Kita","Yes.","Todd Vencil","That includes. Okay, so that\u2019s all P&L impacted in the $15 million of CapEx on top of that.","John Kita","Right.","Todd Vencil","Okay, that was my question. Thanks a lot.","Ajita Rajendra","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose","Hi, thank you for taking my call. I have just a couple quick ones if we can bang them out. Following up on the debt. Just help me understand the reason behind increasing your debt at $80 million given the free cash flow you have the cash from the balance sheet are you thinking about much larger type acquisitions is this because you have something imminent?","John Kita","No. So David when you look at we have cash overseas, we have debt here of about $250 million I suppose $270 million at the end of the quarter that was almost all floating rate. And so what we said given the attractiveness of long-term rates and just hedging that position we decided to draw down $75 million of long-term debt and pay down some of the short-term debt and it was kind of 35% to 40% fixed to floating and again we've talked about the fact that from a stock buyback standpoint if we buy back $100 million this year, probably about half of that will come from debt because we're obviously generating money in China and offshore. So that was the logic stream for doing it we think we got a very attractive rate of 3.5% tenure money so we're pleased with it.","David L. Rose","Okay, thank you. And then just a couple of last ones with respect to which inventory and inventory now and just so we can have a better understanding the margin profile when that product flows through over the next couple of quarters, can you talk about scrap issues, quality maybe you made some reserves that you setup that\u2019s on the balance sheet?","Ajita Rajendra","We took some in the first quarter some obsolescence as we evaluated the obsolescence and we talked about that, so we had some inefficiencies in the first quarter as well as obsolescence as we are running pilot runs and we had some weather et cetera. So we are not anticipated a significant amount of those issues at all in the second quarter, we hope that portion of it\u2019s pretty much behind that.","David L. Rose","Okay. And then on water treatment, what was the contribution from water treatment in China?","Ajita Rajendra","Water treatment was up about $10 million in sales. It was up over 80%. It's a little deceiving because last year's first quarter was an easy comp, so we think that 40% going forward for the next three quarters is a reasonable number. So if you look at when we talk about water treatment was $18 million two years ago, $43 million I\u2019m sorry three years ago, $43 million, $75 million last year our forecast is in the low $100 million this year, so the growth is what we expect.","David L. Rose","And what was the margin contribution?","Ajita Rajendra","I don\u2019t know for the quarter, what we\u2019ve talked about for the year last year that water treatment made about $2.5 million, we would think we would at least double that this year from a profitability standpoint.","David L. Rose","Okay, great. That's it for me for now. Thank you very much.","Ajita Rajendra","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Giannakouros with Oppenheimer.","Jim Giannakouros","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning.","Jim Giannakouros","Lochinvar, just one follow-up there. Growing 10% plus can you give us more granular look into where you're seeing outside growth by geography you've given us the subcategories of non-res, but is there any particular areas of strength that you are seeing from a geographic perspective?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, the boiler business from a commercial standpoint is across the country so I don't think we're necessarily seeing any geographic. But the growth in Lochinvar is not only commercial boilers, they had a very good first quarter in commercial water heaters and we would say that's 500,000 BTU to say 2 million BTU and so that market also grew very well, so they saw their commercial market grow very nicely. And I haven't heard of any specific geographic region from a residential clearly the Northeast is that, but I think commercial it\u2019s pretty much across the country. And again as I said earlier, education, hospitals et cetera those areas are certainly growing.","Jim Giannakouros","Got it, okay. And then just sticking to the boiler side I know we\u2019ll take a closer look at next month at the facility, but are there any competitive advantages we should be mindful of that are potentially driving share gains among the competitors offering, similar energy efficiency upgrades and obviously the value proposition that comes with? Thanks.","Ajita Rajendra","I think the new products, we certainly feel the new products that have come out from Lochinvar have a clear advantage in the marketplace especially because they are fire-tube products as opposed to the water-tube products that are prevalent in the marketplace. So the new product the FTXL which we introduced early in the year and then subsequently the expansion of the Crestline, we feel have certainly are very attractive and been very well accepted in the marketplace and it\u2019s early. We expect a lot of growth.","John Kita","Yes, and you\u2019ll see the controls I think are there in your lowest controls we think are also have a big competitive advantage.","Jim Giannakouros","Looking forward to it, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Bremer with Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer","Yes, a quick follow-up and hopefully you could clarify something that's puzzling me. The price increases. Both on the residential and the commercial, can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the price increase on the commercial end?","Ajita Rajendra","The price increase on the commercial and really varies by product et cetera in some product lines it low double-digits, but it really ranges byproduct so there's no one set amount.","William D. Bremer","Okay, and then on the water treatment I\u2019m assuming that India would be an option, how much of a change or modification will be needed to what has been produced for the China market to then going to India?","Ajita Rajendra","We are manufacturing the water treatment products for India in India, so they are modified in the sense that the designs are different, China primarily they are hanging on the wall or under counter, India is primarily under counter top products. So the products are different, the technology is similar, but we are manufacturing for in India.","William D. Bremer","Ajita the $30 million to $35 million for the breakeven in India is that exclusively water heaters or does that also include the water treatment aspect of this.","John Kita","That\u2019s the water.","Ajita Rajendra","That\u2019s water heater part of it. That\u2019s the water heater part.","William D. Bremer","Okay thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charley Brady with BMO Capital Markets.","Charley D. Brady","Hey, thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the China air purification. Given that it's kind of a buying or selling you not manufacturing like you are in the water purification is there a meaningful margin differential so is that sort of a business starts really ripping up you know some small base, but just trying get us any meaningful margin back on the ROW margins.","John Kita","Only from the standpoint, Charley, of the losses this year. Where we've said they could be up to $4 million. As we spend a lot of money on SG&A, but our philosophy, and I think you're aware of it but for the entire group, our philosophy is when we look at other alternatives. We're looking for product lines that have a premium product that can have relatively high gross margin. So that when we scale it up we can end up with the bottom line attractive margin. And we think air purification is one of those product lines. And certainly water treatment is.","Ajita Rajendra","Absolutely and you know what we\u2019re looking at is when we get to longer-term steady state, that is not going to be a deterioration of our margins in China. And we feel pretty comfortable about that right now. It's very early, but we feel pretty comfortable that this is a category we can achieve that in the long term.","Charley D. Brady","Great thanks guys.","End of Q&A","Operator","And I am not showing any further question at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management.","Patricia Ackerman","Thank you for joining us this morning. We hope to see many of you at our Analyst Day in May and registration information on our Analyst Day is available on the Investor page of our website aosmith.com.

Our double digit sales growth in 2017 was driven by continued strong demand for our consumer products in China and positive end markets for our boilers and water heaters in North America. Here are a few highlights. Record sales of $3 billion grew nearly 12%. China sales were up 18% in local currency and up 16% in US dollar terms, reaching over $1 billion in 2017. China water treatment sales grew 35% and air purification sales grew 75% to $45 million.","Our global water treatment sales exceeded 300 million in 2017. We are very proud of the global water treatment platform we have built over the last seven years. Beginning in 2011 with about $35 million of water treatment sales in China, we grew significantly to almost $240 million last year. As we experienced rapid organic water treatment growth in China, we added several bolt-on acquisitions in the US and Europe, launched water treatment products in India and Vietnam and added a significant number of water treatment engineers and technologists to our global engineering center. ","As a result of our investments, we project our global water treatment sales to be approximately $400 million in 2018. Record setting adjusted net earnings of $2.17 per share was 17% higher than our earnings per share in 2016. We are delighted to welcome the Hague team to the A. O. Smith family through our acquisition of the US based water softener company in early September. Hague fits squarely in our acquisition strategy to grow our global water treatment platform. ","We are excited about the global opportunities Hague\u2019s innovative and high quality products bring us as well as Hague\u2019s experienced water quality dealer network. We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion of our cash to return to shareholders. We repurchased over 2.5 shares for approximately $139 million. We announced a 29% increase to our dividend earlier this month. The five year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is over 25%. AOS joined the S&P 500 index as of July 2017. We are honored to join this prestigious group of US companies. Our inclusion is a significant milestone in our company's very rich history. ","John will now describe our results in more detail, beginning with slide number 5.","John Kita","Before we discuss the financial results of our fourth quarter and full year, I will provide details of the new tax law impact. Our one-time tax charge in the fourth quarter is estimated to be 82 million or $0.47 per share and is primarily related to the mandatory repatriation tax on undistributed earnings under US tax reform. The one-time charge is expected to be paid over eight years. We project our effective income tax rate in 2018 to be between 22% and 22.5%. ","We expect to repatriate approximately 200 million in the first half of 2018 and use the proceeds to repay floating rate debt. Our capital allocation strategy will remain focused on three pillars. One, to support our growth with capital spending; two, to pursue acquisitions, which expand our core water heating and water treating platforms globally as well as expand our product lines, primarily in China; and three, to return cash to shareholders. We will continue to review opportunities within the three pillars and discuss with our board.","Sales for the year of 3 billion were 12% higher than the previous year. Adjusted net earnings of 378 million increased 16% from 2016. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 increased 17% compared with 2016. Sales in our North America segment of 1.9 billion increased 9% compared with 2016. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of water heaters and boilers and pricing actions related to steel cost increases. ","North America water treatment sales comprised of recently acquired Hague as well as a full year of Aquasana incrementally added approximately 40 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of World segment sales of 1.1 billion increased 16% compared with 2016. China\u2019s sales increased nearly 16%, driven by higher demand for our consumer products in the region, led by water treatment and air purification products and pricing actions, primarily due to higher steel and installations costs. The declining Chinese currency unfavorably impacted the translation of China sales by approximately 18 million and sales growth by 200 basis points. Water heater and water treatment sales in India increased approximately 8 million or over 40% in 2017, compared with 2016.","On slide 9, North America segment earnings of 429 million were 11% higher than segment earnings in 2016. The favorable impact from higher sales of water heaters and boilers and the pricing actions in the US were partially offset by higher steel costs. As a result of lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, 2017 segment margin of 22.5% was higher than the 22.1% generated in 2016. Rest of World earnings of 149 million improved 16% compared with 2016. Higher China sales, including the price increase, were partially offset by higher steel costs, higher fees paid to installers and increased SG&A cost. Expansion of water treatment and air purification product retail outlets in tier 2 and tier 3 cities, higher advertising related to brand building in our newer product categories and higher water treatment product development engineering costs were the primary drivers of higher SG&A in China. Segment margin in 2017 was essentially the same as 2016. ","Our corporate expenses were 2 million higher than in 2016, driven by commissioned water treatment market studies in the US and higher engineering costs at our corporate technology center. Our adjusted effective income tax rate in 2017 was 27.4%. The rate was lower than the 29.4% experienced in 2016, primarily due to lower US state income taxes and higher deductions for stock-based compensation. Comparing the lower adjusted effective tax rate with the effective income tax rate of 28% originally projected benefited 2017 result by $0.02 per share.","Sales for the fourth quarter of 769 million were 10% higher than the same quarter in 2016. Adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter of 105 million increased 26% from the fourth quarter in 2016. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 increased 28% compared with the same quarter in 2016. Sales in our North America segment of 461 million increased 6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of boilers and commercial water heaters and pricing actions related to steel cost increases. We estimate the commercial water heater industry experienced the pre-buy of approximately 5000 electric units in the fourth quarter due to an anticipated regulatory change in early 2018. North America water treatment sales comprised of Aquasana and recently acquired Hague incrementally added approximately 9 million to our North America segment sales.","Rest of World segment sales of 314 million increased 17% compared with the same quarter in 2016. China sales increased 16% driven by pricing actions primarily due to higher steel and installation costs and higher demand for our consumer products in the region. India sales grew over 40% compared with the same period in 2016.","On slide 13, North America segment earnings of 105 million were 17% higher than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2016. The favorable impact from higher sales of boilers and commercial water heaters, pricing actions in the US and lower ERP costs were partially offset by higher steel and other input costs. These factors drove fourth quarter 2017\u2019s segment margin higher to 22.8% compared with 20.5% last year. Rest of World earnings of 51 million improved 33% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Higher China sales, including the price increase were partially offset by higher steel costs and higher fees paid to installers. ","Fourth quarter segment margin was 16.2% compared with 14.2% in the same quarter of 2016, due to improved margin for our water treatment products sold in China, lower selling and advertising costs as a percent of sales as well as improved performance in India. Our corporate expenses were higher in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2016, primarily due to higher spending at our corporate technology center and higher employee incentive costs. Our adjusted effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 25.8%. The rate was lower than the 28.9% experienced during the fourth quarter last year, primarily due to lower US state income taxes and higher deductions for stock based compensation.","Cash provided by operations during 2017 was 326 million and similar to our previous projections compared with 447 million provided during 2016. Higher adjusted earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital, primarily due to the higher than anticipated positive cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as higher inventories in China to reduce the impact from our -- to our new plant this quarter. Over the two year period from 2016 to 2017, we generated operating cash of 773 million, which compares with 612 million during 2014 and 2015. ","Our liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt to capital ratio was 20% at the end of 2017. We have cash balances, totaling 820 million located offshore and our net cash position was approximately 410 million at the end of 2017. We completed the acquisition of Hague, a US based water softener company during the third quarter of $45 million -- for $45 million plus a potential earnout of $2 million. Primarily as a result of continued strong cash flow and escalating PBGC premiums, we made a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of $30 million. The after tax impact to our cash flow was approximately 18 million. During 2017, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of common stock for a total of $139 million. Approximately 2.4 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of December. ","This morning, we announced our 2018 EPS guidance with a range of between $2.50 and $2.58 per share, which includes the benefit related to our lower projected tax rate under US tax reform. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 17% increase in EPS compared with our adjusted 2017 results. Excluding the US Tax Reform benefits from our 2018 guidance midpoint, in other words, using the 2017 adjusted tax rate of 27.4%, our operational performance is expected to improve over 9%. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2018 to be between 475 million and 500 million, which is much higher than the 326 million generated in 2017. ","We expect higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital this year, specifically lower inventory levels. We broke ground in 2016 on the construction of a new water treatment and air purification manufacturing facility in China to support the strong growth of these products in China. Our 2018 capital spending plans of approximately 100 million includes 30 million related to completion of this plan. Total costs for the facility, which is expected to begin production in the second quarter will be about 67 million. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately 80 million in 2018. ","Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately 49 million in 2018, higher than the 47 million in 2017, partially due to higher projected spending at our corporate R&D center. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be between 22% and 22.5% in 2018, lower than previous year's due to US tax reform. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately 135 million in 2018 under a 10b5-1 plan, similar to 2017. We may supplement our 10b5-1 plan with opportunistic share repurchase in 2018. We expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2018 will be approximately 173 million. We increased our dividend earlier this month by 29%. ","I will now turn the call back to Ajita who will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for 2018 and our growth strategy beginning on slide 17. Ajita?","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you, John. We considered several tailwinds and headwinds, as we built our plans for 2018. First, our tailwinds. Both residential and commercial water heater volumes experienced strong growth in 2017. We project US residential water heater industry volumes will increase 250,000 to 300,000 units in 2018 due to continued new construction and expansion of replacement demand. This assumption includes [indiscernible]. Boiler revenues grew 13% in 2017, driven by solid demand for our condensing boilers and new product related market share gains. ","We expect our boiler business to grow approximately 10% in 2018. We improved profitability in India in 2017 due to scale in our water heater and water treatment businesses from losing over $9 million in 2016 to $7.5 million loss in 2017. We met our projections despite uncertainty resulting from the implementation of a national goods and services tax and demonetization in the country in 2016. We project India water heaters will approach breakeven in 2018. ","Improvements for water heaters and water treatment will continue in 2019 and our total India business will be slightly profitable in 2020. The overall loss in India is expected to be $5 million this year. The headwinds include steel prices are rising and are above year ago levels. At current prices, steel will be a headwind to margins this year compared with last year. Following double digit volume growth in 2017, we project US commercial water heater industry volumes will be down 5000 units this year compared with last year due to the pre-buy of electric units in the fourth quarter of last year. ","Our China sales grew 18% in local currency in 2017, easily exceeding $1 billion and surpassing our 15% expected growth rate. China sales in the fourth quarter exceeded our projections by about $20 million. We believe the fourth quarter outperformance was driven by customer orders to qualify for volume incentives as well as larger than expected inventory build by our e-commerce customers for the notable online shopping days in November and December. ","We project the fourth quarter outperformance of $20 million will negatively impact our first quarter and full year 2018 China sales. We believe China will grow about 13% for the full year. If you adjust for the $20 million pull in in quarter four, this is a 17% year-over-year growth rate. Our movement of water treatment and air purification manufacturing into our new plant in China will result in a projected incremental cost of approximately $5 million, the majority of which will occur in the first half of 2018. ","I\u2019m now moving to slide number 18. Combining the impact of the tailwinds and the headwinds, we are optimistic about our growth and bottom line performance for 2018. We project revenue growth will be between 8.5% and 9.5% for the year and EPS between $2.50 and $2.58. We expect North America segment margin to be between 22% and 22.5% and Rest of World segment margins to expand 30 to 40 basis points over 2017. ","Please advance to slide number 19. We have updated the components of our growth model to be consistent with the new disclosure rules, for disaggregation of segment revenue as well as to incorporate recently acquired and organically grown high growth businesses. We combined North America water treatment and India with our strong consumer products business in China and its mid-teens growth rate. This is our high growth category and its sales are 36% of company sales. ","We expect sales of North America water treatment composed of Aquasana and Hague product will reach nearly $100 million of revenue this year. India grew over 40% last year and we are enthusiastic about our distribution now being pan India for both water heaters and water treatment. Based on the investments we have already made and are expected to make in the future, we project this high growth portfolio to grow 14% per year.","As many of you know, our Lochinvar branded products are composed of approximately 60% boilers and 40% water heaters. As such, going forward, our growth model will separate the boiler piece of our company with an assumed growth rate which matches its five year revenue CAGR of 10%. Sales of our North America water heater products remained the largest portion of our company sales at 58%, including our Lochinvar branded water heaters. Given the expected new construction required to support household formation and expand the replacement demand, we project water heater revenue growth at a rate of 4%. ","The weighted average of our growth model continues to be 8%, which is consistent with our 8.5% to 9.5% growth projections for 2018 and is reasonable for the median term timeframe. Especially in these uncertain economic times, we believe our organic growth potential and are stable defensive replacement market, which represents approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volume positively differentiates A. O. Smith from other industrial companies. Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we are open for your questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charlie Brady with SunTrust.","Charlie Brady","Just I guess on the steel costs, I guess I didn\u2019t hear any mention of additional price increases being put through to offset that. Any particular reason why? I mean you guys have been pretty successful doing that in the past.","Ajita Rajendra","Charlie, I think -- this is Ajita. We never comment about future price increases. And in terms of steel prices, it\u2019s tough to predict what's going to happen in the future. As we mentioned in the comments, the steel prices today are a headwind versus what they were last year. And if you look at our past history, over time, we've been able to pass along commodity prices to the marketplace.","Charlie Brady","Could you quantify what the headwind is today from steel?","John Kita","Well, I can tell you this. I mean, steel has gone up about 11% since the beginning of December, it\u2019s gone up hot rolled over 11% and cold rolled over about 8%. So it\u2019s been a significant increase.","Charlie Brady","Yeah. I didn\u2019t hear a whole lot of commentary on US residential water heater sales in the 4Q. Can you just comment a little bit on how that fared?","Ajita Rajendra","Sure. I think as you look at, we pretty much hit our numbers that we expected for the total company and we talked about China sales being up almost $20 million where we did miss what\u2019s on the residential side. The industry was up, I think, for the first two months about 90,000 units. We were up minimally during that time period. When we look at the full year though, I think which is important the way we look at it is our market share in the first three months, first three quarters had improved. In the fourth quarter, because we didn't grow as much as the industry, it came back down. But when you adjust for Sears decline, our market share was right on for the year. And I guess the other comment I\u2019ll make is there's really been no change in distribution over the years. So I mean, we're comfortable with our position. But it did not do as well in the fourth quarter as we expected.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.","Scott Graham","So I want to maybe look at the earnings expectations internally, maybe a little bit more holistically. And I remember way back when you guys had your analyst meeting over a lock in for some time ago, of course, one of the things I think was discussed was an earnings growth number and I don't want to put words in your mouth, but sort of in the 15% to 20% territory. Now that's several years back and the \u2013 of large numbers kind of catches up, but at least the last couple of years, we have had 17% earnings growth with the larger numbers being comped and still getting there. And it appears, this year, we\u2019re looking at sort of 8% to 9% base earnings growth. Could you give us an idea on sort of where maybe the push and pull points are to get that level of base business earnings growth higher and could one of them be share repurchases?","John Kita","Well, I think you're right. We're forecasting a little over 9%. We have exceeded that over the last couple of years. I think there's a couple of factors involved when you look at what -- how 2018 is shaping up is one commercial business has been very strong in the last two or three years, up close to double digits each the last few years. And that certainly is a big contributor to the bottom line. We are actually forecasting it to be down this year because of the pre-buy, so that certainly has an effect on margins. Number two, when you look at, we\u2019ve talked about steel already on the call. I mean, steel has gone up, has gone up almost 10% since December. So that has an effect on margins. And I think the third, again that's why we laid out the headwinds and tailwinds is the new plant coming up in Nanchang, there is some headwind. Now all that being said, we still are comfortable with the 9% and the higher end of our range would be higher than that. So I don't recall the 15% to 20% that was there, but again we look at each year individually.","Scott Graham","Right. I guess John though, my question wasn't why it's 9, my question is more, how it can go higher than 9. What lines on the P&L if you will, what regions or product lines maybe could offer some upside and again our share repurchases an acceleration of the same being contemplated.","John Kita","Well I think we talked about that we're going to buy 135 million plus opportunistically buying more. So theoretically, yes, buying more shares could help the bottom line. I think the upsides we think that exist would be we have higher volumes. Commercial, we're underestimating the volumes we hope. Residential could be stronger. It's been very strong in the last couple of years. And we get some relief from this. So those would be kind of the major areas. China margins, because of the movement of the plant, we're not expecting much growth, but quite frankly, our expectations which we thought about is to grow those margins. So we would hope we\u2019re being conservative on the rest of world margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird.","Mike Halloran","So just an easy quick one. The 13% China growth, is that a constant currency number?","John Kita","We\u2019ve said that\u2019s US dollars and we expect the currency to be flat to maybe RMB, maybe a little bit stronger year-over-year.","Mike Halloran","And then kind of continuing a little on the rest of world margin side. If I think about the puts and takes here, obviously the price cost side you lined out, the 5 million water treatment you lined out, anything unique that you think is going to happen this year relative to last couple of years on advertising, product expansion build out relative to what's normal or and then any other puts and takes on some of the other growth initiatives there this year that we haven't talked about, whether commercial rental, water purification and how some of those numbers kind of line out as we work through the year as well?","John Kita","Well, I\u2019ll take a shot at it. Air purification is probably one of the items on the periphery that are important. I mean, we started the year saying we were going to break even and we lost $5 million, so it did not do what our expectations were in \u201917. So, our anticipation is we will approach breakeven in \u201918. So that's an important qualifier. Bringing the plant up efficiently, so I'll break out the $5 million for you a little that Ajita referenced. The first half of the year, as you can appreciate, we're going to have efficiencies where we have two plants. We're going to be operating two plants for a little bit. We're moving -- we're going to have moved costs, et cetera. ","We have higher depreciation because of the investment, we have higher operating cost, because of the electricity, et cetera. Now our expectation for the last half of the year, we start operating much more efficiently than we have in the past. So that kind of offsets the inefficiencies in the first half, leaving us with the depreciation, the moved cost from the operating costs, which as we go into the future, we think we can offset with the efficiencies, et cetera. So that's certainly a qualifier. I will tell you water treatment had a very good fourth quarter. I mean when you look at the margins of rest of world going up, water treatment accounts for about 100 basis points of that. ","As we have talked about in the third quarter, they had a difficult third quarter comp, while fourth quarter, they reversed that, had a very good fourth quarter. The thing that we're optimistic about when we look at water treatment for the year, their margins were up about a point to a point and a half compared to prior year. I\u2019ll also tell you, we grow more than the market. We're up almost 35%. The market was up 18% to 19%. So as we've talked about in the past, we know the best products in the marketplace, it\u2019s a high growth market and we are very happy with our position in that market.","So those are some of the puts and takes. Obviously, we need the market to continue to grow in China. We haven\u2019t seen a move from electric to gas. That's just as distribution increases. We used to talk about three years ago that electric was 55%, gas was 45%. I would tell you it's about flit now. That gives us a little bit of a headwind. I mean, we're doing extremely well in the gas. We're gaining share, but it's still not at the level that the electric is. So, the bottom line Mike is, there's a lot of putts and takes.","Mike Halloran","And then one more specific puts and takes, just in the context of that. When we're thinking about the original guide, when you guys came in to \u201917, there was hope to maybe better leverage some of the -- essentially continue to grow your spend on advertising and promotions, et cetera, but get better leverage off of it. Is that the thought going into \u201918 at this point?","John Kita","I would say yes, that is the thought going forward. It might get hidden a little bit by the new plant costs, et cetera, but I think Kevin, I and Ajita have talked, that\u2019s clearly one of the objectives is to start leveraging our SG&A as China gets bigger.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","I'm suffering from the flu, so I'm going to try to keep it high level as is my want. First, the capital allocation. Could you just talk about how you're thinking about the state of the balance sheet right now post tax and do some of the changes we've seen in the -- basically where you\u2019re positioned right now, how you see the environment, does that change how you\u2019re looking at M&A or what you pay or where your priorities are there specifically? I think I have a good sense of stack ranking how you're thinking about capital allocation overall, but could you talk a little bit about the M&A environment and challenges, opportunities, how you're thinking about it? Because I think as you\u2019d -- obviously you suffer from a really good problem, which is a strong organic growth outlook overall that you've been seeing, but a pretty high bar for deals. So just talk about what you see about the potential opportunities for M&A in the next couple of years, size, scope, geography, that kind of thing?","John Kita","I'll start with the capital allocation. I'll give Ajita the easier one on M&A. So I mean, I'll just give you a little, I mean, a little background on our capital allocation strategy that hasn't changed. And if you looked seven years ago, we came out, we started our stock repurchase program and we\u2019ve said we're going to do three things. We're going to invest in ourselves and over the last seven years, we have had capital investments of over $550 million. And much of that has been in the form of capacity. We\u2019ve added India plant, we've added two plants in China, we've added on a lot. That's about 50% more than depreciation over that time period and we expect to continue to invest in ourselves.","Number two, we said return cash to shareholders. Over the last seven years, when we started this cash -- stock buyback program, we've returned over $1 billion to shareholders. That's been in the form of about 400 million in dividends which we've raised our dividend 25% a year for the last five to seven years. But we've also done a fair amount to stock buyback. We\u2019ve bought back over $650 million worth at an average price of less than $30 a share. So we think that's been a good investment.","Third, we've done acquisitions and I'll lead into Ajita. Quite frankly, Ajita and I both say, we haven't done the magnitude of the acquisitions we hoped. Six years ago, we bought Lochinvar, which was a home run. In the last two years, we've built out our platform with respect to the water treatment business and that we've added about, I guess, $80 million of organic sales that cost from $150 million or so. So, it's a long way of saying we've had this approach in place. I don't think this approach changes going forward. Those are still the three pillars and we're comfortable with all three of those pillars and we'll continue to do that. ","I don't think tax necessarily changes that. I mean if you look at tax reform, we have about an $82 million cash charge essentially that we're going to pay over eight years and we certainly benefit from tax reform and that we're probably going to generate $30 million to $35 million of cash a year, lower taxes. So it's going to take a while -- two to three years to pay it off, but we certainly in the long term benefit from it and it gives us more firepower.","Ajita Rajendra","And I\u2019d just like to reinforce what John said in terms of our overall capital allocation strategy has not changed. It\u2019s essentially looking, number one, investing in ourselves, looking at appropriate strategic acquisition and then returning cash to shareholders appropriately as John mentioned. In looking at the M&A outlook out there, prices are still high. But as you saw when we did Aquasana, we went -- certainly paid the high multiple, but that was a very strategic acquisition. ","So we're going to be balancing what we do in terms of return, but at the same time, be very disciplined in terms of the financial goals we've laid out and the acquisitions will be very strategic, which is essentially in heating and cleaning water globally and in China, we expand that judiciously in looking at how we can leverage our brand and distribution in new categories that really fit. So that's been our strategy. I don't see any change in that capital allocation strategy or acquisition strategy going forward other than to reinforce, we will be very disciplined and any acquisitions we do will be very strategic.","John Kita","And in theory, I guess I'd say that with a lower tax rate, if multiples don\u2019t adjust, it makes it easier for us, domestic ones to hit our ROIC targets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeff Hammond","Just on the 13% growth you explained that the pull forward, but can you walk through how you're thinking about growth for the traditional water heater business versus air versus water or versus the water treatment.","John Kita","Sure. We would expect that water treatment is -- the market will probably grow 18% to 20%. We would expect water treatment would be 25% and 30%. As I alluded to earlier, we're very comfortable with our position. We would expect air purification to grow 35% to 40%. Again, we\u2019re bringing new products out there, which we think will be beneficial. The electric and gas markets, we would expect quite frankly gas will grow and electric will be somewhat flat because of the transition I talked about earlier. So we'll get some benefit because of the gas position and then some of the other SPUs, like renewable and commercial, we expect to grow nicely. So it's kind of a varied group to get to the 13%.","Jeff Hammond","And then can you just walk through what the loss in India was versus what, I think you said it was going to be approaching breakeven or close to this minus 5 and just the ERP delta, 18 versus 17 as well.","John Kita","Well, I\u2019ll give you the ERP, the ERP \u201917 to \u201916 first was about $6 million less. The ERP delta 17 to 18 will be down a couple of million bucks. So we're at that kind of run rate that we're going to be at above 16 million I guess, somewhere around there. Maybe, we need to clarify the India breakeven, but what we said is in 2016, India lost over $9 million. In 2017, it lost $7.5 million or basically hit exactly what our plan was. Even under fairly difficult conditions, given the GST tax changes and the monetization. So we think India had a good year. Our expectation now is next year, sorry this year, \u201918, we move from that $7.5 million loss to about $5 million. So, a pickup of about $2.5 million of less loss if you will. And then as we move into \u201919, and then \u201920, we expect to be breakeven. We actually expect to be profitable. So we this move down from over 9 to 7.5 to 5 to 2 million to 3 million to a positive by 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","I guess I had a couple of questions on sort of the longer term considerations in the business. And for starters, you talked about the rest of world margins being up maybe 30 to 40 basis points in 2018 and I realize there's a lot of moving parts in there. I guess I want to just tap you for your latest thoughts on where this ultimately could get to by 2020 or some point further down the road on a sort of a raw materials normalized basis.","John Kita","Well I would tell you and we\u2019ve talked about this in the past and Kevin, Agita and I have talked about it, we need to raise rest of world margins. And that\u2019s the objective and quite frankly, the India improvement from 7.5 million to 0 by 2020 improves margin by 60 to 70 basis points, right there. But in addition, China obviously is the largest component there. The objective is to raise margins there. We hope to do it this year, but again, we have that implant tailwind, et cetera, but we hope to do it this year. So I mean I would hope that that 13.75 that we're forecasting this year is conservative, but we'll see. But long term, the objective is definitely to increase rest of world margins.","David MacGregor","It just seems like there's a lot of other things going on in that segment beyond India and China, you\u2019ve got the [indiscernible] Turkey, you\u2019ve got China water treatment. It just seems like a lot of those things, if not all of them are currently a drag on rest of world margins. And so I guess \u2013","John Kita","And we would agree with that. So you take the air purification loss $5 million, the boiler loss $6 million, or $7 million, the commercial water treatment loss, $3 million. So I would agree with you. Our objective is if we can move dollars to breakeven, again that's -- I think what I just, $15 million. That's 1.5% right there based on this year, not where the sales are two years from now.","Ajita Rajendra","And I think, that's a great point, because we are probably always going to have some businesses incubating where we are investing for future growth. It so happens that at this particular point, in the last year, couple of years, we've had more than a normal run rate of businesses intubating. But all of these, as you look at them individually, the ones we mentioned, clearly, are investments for longer term growth, longer term profitable growth. So the opportunity to continue to leverage that reservoirs margin is clearly there.","David MacGregor","Second question again, just kind of a longer term question, but as we talk to distributors, it's pretty clear that within the commercial world, tankless is making some pretty good progress and you've got product in there that you rely on is disproportionately large in terms of its margin contribution lifecycle. And I\u2019m just wondering to what extent you're feeling the pressure in those sort of higher margin contributing categories for products from tankless and ultimately I guess longer term question is, where does A. O. Smith go with regard to tankless, what's the strategy there longer term and do we see a greater commitment to that format over the next two to three years?","John Kita","There's no doubt we think tankless increase. It\u2019s been increasing kind of at double digits. We would still be of the opinion that the majority of it is going to new construction and going into retrofit, et cetera, residential. There is probably some going into commercial, but we don't think it\u2019s a significant amount. And so, but Ajita can talk about our position long term, but it\u2019s clearly growing, but again, it\u2019s still 700,000 units on an industry that was 9.2 million. So we're certainly watching it and we participate in it. We have a very attractive product offering in it, but you're right. We have a lower market share there than we do in the other businesses.","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah. And I think if you look at it from a global perspective in response to your question about our commitment to the technology, clearly, we are very committed to the technology. In fact, if you look at our market in China, we are the leaders in our market in China. And we manufacture everything that we sell and we compete with the same players who are leading in the US. It's just that we got a later start in the US market. Now, in the US market, we source our product from Japan. In China, we make it ourselves and just to put in perspective in terms of numbers of units, John mentioned that the total market here was close to 700,000 units. We sell about 2 million units that we make in China as the leaders in the market.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We do have a follow up from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","I guess conversely, looking at in terms of capital allocation and M&A, I mean you've done a great job, the returns have been strong, you've moved to the S&P 500, the company is a lot bigger, you\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity in China. Part of the attraction is obviously you can definitely leverage your channel in China and bring in a lot of products either through licensing or otherwise if you did some form of JV and I've asked this question of you before, but is that something you're looking at and the related question is, let's not talk about gossip or what you'd be willing to do, but would it make sense over the longer term for you strategically to be part of a larger company and what could it bring in terms of investment, brand, things like that that perhaps you could even execute an even faster, larger growth strategy in China, because you\u2019ve just got a very valuable channel you've been developing there. Not like for your core products, but for these add-ons. Just any thoughts there.","Ajita Rajendra","First of all, I\u2019m not going to speculate in terms of the future, because obviously that doesn\u2019t get us anywhere. But from a strategic perspective, in terms of us being an independent company, we will always be an independent company. Okay. There is no, I mean, in your thoughts in terms of, there is no -- we are not looking at something that you mentioned in terms of combination and things like that. If we're looking at, can we license products, et cetera, everything is open that\u2019s strategic in terms of, if it's the right product that fits our brand name for us to leverage it, we can source that product in many ways. We can do a greenfield, we can do an acquisition, we can license our brand to somebody else. ","We can buy them. So we've looked at all of those types of ways to say, what's the right pace to grow. And as we look at to grow, whenever we get into a new category, it takes $40 million, $50 million to break even because this is a branded consumer products business. So the advertising costs, the promotion costs, the entry costs into retail et cetera are very high. So it's that balance of the right pace to be incubating and growing businesses at the same time, growing our margins and as the businesses have been in for a long time, mature like our electric water heater business. So it\u2019s that balance that we look at all the time, and we leverage to keep the 15% growth rate that we\u2019ve been guiding to for the long-term, while also increasing our margin.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today's conference, Ms. Pat Ackerman, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ma'am, you may begin.","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you, Bridget. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2017 second quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Ajita who will begin his remarks on slide 3.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Our double-digit sales growth in the second quarter was driven continued strong demand for our consumer products in China and positive end markets for our commercial water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and Canada.","Here are a few highlights. Sales grew nearly 11% to $738 million. Excluding the impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar against the Chinese currency, our sales grew 12.5% in the quarter. China sales were up 20% in local currency. A. O. Smith branded water treatment sales grew over 40% in local currency and air purification product revenue quadrupled. Record-setting net earnings of $0.53 per share were 8% higher than our earnings per share in 2016.","We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion of our cash to return to shareholders. Through the first half of 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares for $66 million. We announced a 17% increase to our dividend earlier this year. The five-year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is over 25%.","Many of you are aware that A. O. Smith joined the S&P 500 Index this morning. We are honored to join this prestigious group of U.S. company. Our inclusion is a significant milestone in our company's very rich history and a testament to the 15,000 men and women around the globe who work very hard every day, living our values and contributing to our success. Today marks a significant accomplishment for all of us.","John will now describe our results in more detail, beginning with slide 4.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thanks, Ajita. Sales for the second quarter of $738 million were 11% higher than the previous year. Net earnings in the second quarter of $92 million increased 6% from 2016. Second quarter earnings per share of $0.53 increased 8% compared with 2016. Sales in our North America segment of $471 million increased 9% compared with the second quarter of 2016. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of commercial water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and pricing actions in August 2016 related to steel cost increases and inflationary pressure on other costs. Aquasana, acquired in August of 2016, added $13 million to our North America segment sales.","Rest of World segment sales of $273 million increased 14% compared with 2016. China sales increased 20% in local currency, driven by higher demand for our consumer products in the region, led by water treatment and air purification products, and pricing actions due to higher steel and other costs, which were announced earlier this year.","On slide 6, North America segment earnings of $109 million were 5% higher than segment earnings in the prior year. The favorable impact from higher sales of commercial water heaters and boilers and the pricing actions in the U.S. were partially offset by significantly higher steel costs. Second quarter segment margin declined to 23.2% from 24.1% one year ago due to higher steel costs. The margin on our Aquasana products is lower than the segment average, which also contributed to the margin decline.","Rest of World earnings of $32.5 million were essentially the same as one year ago. Higher China sales, including the price increase, were more than offset by higher steel costs, increased selling, general and administrative expenses and a less profitable sales mix in China.","Advertising to support brand building and expansion of water treatment and air purification retail outlets in Tier 2 and 3 cities were the primary drivers of higher SG&A in China. Currency translation reduced China earnings by approximately $2 million compared with the prior year. As a result of these factors, second quarter segment margin was 11.9% compared with 13.8% last year.","Our corporate expenses were essentially the same as one year ago. Our effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2017 was 27.8%. The rate was lower than the 29.8% experienced during the second quarter last year, primarily due to lower state income taxes and a change in geographic earnings mix. The lower effective tax rate this year compared with the effective rate one year ago benefited 2017 results by $0.01 per share.","Cash provided by operations during the first half of 2017 was $73 million compared with $155 million provided during the prior year. Higher earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital. These factors resulted in lower cash flow in 2017.","Our liquidity position and balance sheet remained strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 19% at the end of the second quarter. We have cash balances totaling $741 million located offshore, and our net cash position was approximately $366 million at the end of the quarter.","During the first half of 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock for a total of $66 million. Approximately 3.6 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of June.","This morning, we increased the midpoint of our 2017 EPS guidance by $0.03 per share with a range of between $2.07 and $2.11 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 13% increase in EPS compared with our 2016 results.","Please turn to slide 9 for several 2017 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2017 to be approximately $375 million, which is lower than the $447 million generated in 2016. We expect higher earnings in 2017, but also larger outlays for working capital due to the higher-than-anticipated cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Over the two-year period from 2016 to 2017, we expect to generate operating cash of approximately $825 million, which compares with $612 million during 2014 to 2015. We broke ground in 2016 on the construction of the new water treatment and air purification manufacturing facility in Nanjing to support the strong growth of these products in China. Our 2017 capital spending plans of approximately $100 million includes $45 million related to this plant.","Total costs for the facility, which is expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2018, will be about $65 million. After this expansion, we expect capital spending in 2018 and beyond to be at levels equal to our depreciation plus amortization. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2017.","As previously discussed, expenses related to our ERP implementation were $25 million in 2016 and are projected to decline to approximately $19 million in 2017. Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2017, slightly higher than the $45 million in 2016, primarily due to higher expenses at our Corporate Technology Center and commissioned water treatment market studies. Take note that our interest expense will be approximately $3 million higher in 2017 as a result of higher rates, share repurchase activities and our acquisition last year.","Our effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 28.5% in 2017, lower than the 29.4% rate in 2016. This assumption is predicated on no change to the current U.S. tax regime. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately $135 million in 2017 under a 10b5-1 plan. We may opportunistically repurchase additional shares up to $65 million. If $135 million of our stock is repurchased, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2017 will be approximately 174.5 million.","I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for 2017 and our growth strategy beginning on slide 10. Ajita.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you, John. We project revenue growth to be between 11.5% and 12.5% in local currency term in 2017, and 10% to 11% in U.S. dollar term. We expect Aquasana sales will be approximately $55 million this year and slightly accretive to earnings. Aquasana sales were up nearly 20% for the first six months of this year compared with last year.","With a full year of Aquasana sales as part of A. O. Smith, we expect our global water treatment product sales will be over $275 million in 2017. We project that Chinese currency will depreciate slightly from current levels against the U.S. dollar, resulting in a 4% or $38 million revenue headwind compared with the average rate in 2016.","Specific to our North America segment, we project the U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will increase approximately 300,000 units in 2017 due to new construction and expansion of replacement demand. We project U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes will be up 5% to 7% with most, if not all, of the growth in electric units.","Lochinvar-branded products grew 5% in the first half of 2017, driven by strong demand for water heaters and solid growth in commercial boilers. We expect double-digit full-year boiler sales growth driven by continued market share gain, new product introduction and energy-efficient product growth. We expect the total portfolio of Lochinvar-branded products to grow 8% into 2017.","In 2017, steel prices continue to move up. We expect steel costs in the third quarter will be the highest year-to-date. We recently announced the price increase of approximately 4% on the majority of our U.S. water heater products, effective late August. These factors lead us to expect our North American segment operating margin will be between 21.75% and 22% despite the headwind from lower Aquasana EBIT margin of nearly 40 basis points.","We have received several questions about the Sears-Amazon announcement last week. We manufacture water heater exclusively for Sears with the Kenmore brand. Based on our conversation with Sears, water heaters are not part of the program with Amazon. Let me repeat that. Based on our conversation with Sears, water heaters are not part of the program with Amazon.","Specific to our Rest of World segment, we are a consumer products company in China, which distinguishes us from most industrial companies operating in China. We grew 23% in local currency in the first half of 2017, led by water treatment and air purification products. With a strong start to the year, partially due to the pre-buy in the first half, we expect China sales will be up low-double digits in the second half of the year and approaching 17% in local currency for the year.","We project improved profitability and operating margins in our Rest of World segment in the second half of the year compared to the first half due to a full-year benefit from the price increase and lower advertising expenses as a percent of sales in China. We made some adjustments to the price increase in China late in the second quarter to broaden its impact.","Improved profitability in India due to the normal seasonality of water heater business will also contribute to higher Rest of World margin in the second half of the year compared to the first half. We expect Rest of World margins will be approximately 14% for the year.","Please advance to slide number 11. Our total company organic growth model continues to assume 8% growth for the foreseeable future. Especially in these uncertain economic times, we believe our organic growth potential and our stable defensive replacement markets, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes, positively differentiates A. O. Smith among other industrial companies.","Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning, all.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Hi, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","John, the steel inflation has gotten a little tamer in recent months. But nevertheless, I'm sure we get your point here. Could you kind of, once again, go over how this rolls into the margin, because it seems like the price increase from last summer, which I think was geared toward offsetting inflation two, three quarters down the line, that something in the spot market, I guess, or the percentage of your spot purchases, has been an offset. Is that a reasonable characterization? But I'm just looking for you to sketch that out for us, because I wouldn't have expected steel inflation to continue to offset the price increase from last summer without some kind of impetus from the spot market. Could you help me with that?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I'll try. I will tell you our steel prices have increased every quarter this year. And clearly compared to the prior years, they're up significantly from the prior year. So when we tear apart, for example, North America second quarter, the pricing could not offset the steel increases last year. I mean, the price increase last year did not offset the steel increases in the second quarter. However, as we talked about in our script, commercial water heaters was extremely strong for us in the quarter, as was commercial boilers. So, those were the contributors on why we had a net positive for the quarter. So, I don't know if that answers it, Scott, or not, but we've had continual increase in steel costs.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Well, you know.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Every quarter this year.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","No. And I get that, but I'm just trying to differentiate between, three quarters ago when we put this price increase out, that was supposed to be an offset. So obviously, something has happened in the spot market. What are your spot purchases in North America? Maybe that would help.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, I'll take that Scott. When we put it in, there was an anticipation that steel prices, and we talked about it on the year-end call that we thought steel prices would level off and maybe decline. We haven't seen that at all, and they've continued to increase. So, I think that's part of the factor on why we're seeing what we're seeing is they continued to increase higher than what we put.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Right, what our assumptions were. Yeah. Internally.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Two other questions, North American residential water heaters not talked about at all in the press release, in your prepared comments. Why was that seemingly softer in the second quarter?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, I'd say they weren't talked about because they were flat to the year, prior year. And you saw that certainly in the April and May data. And I'll tell you what we saw in June, it was the same. So, it was very flat with the prior year. And then, when you look, that's down a couple hundred thousand units from the first quarter. But I'll tell you, overall, we're pleased where the industry is. It's up almost 200,000 when you include tankless year-over-year.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. And I think a part of it is timing because we had a very strong first half.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","First quarter.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","First quarter, sorry. And so, it's just the timing of the cutoff, I think. If you look at the first half, it's about where we expected it to be.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you. Last question is on the Amazon agreement last week. I think that there are some, including myself, speculating that the agreement doesn't end here, that it starts to, at some point down the line, one, two, three years, Amazon moves quickly, so, that's probably more like one to two years, starts to impact the water heater and HVAC markets.","And purely, what would be a hypothetical, if that does happen, it would seem as if Sears would potentially stand to benefit and they're a large customer. But the flip side is that, has Amazon \u2013 has Sears told you about any designs that Amazon might have on private label, which would probably have to be a U.S. manufacturer, which could benefit you or could not benefit you, depending upon \u2013 again, this is speculative, but I'm just wondering what Sears has told you, potentially, on the water heater becoming part of that agreement, but also the potential for private label down the line?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Scott, let me answer the question from a practical perspective, because I don't want to get into too much speculation. The white goods that are distributed by Sears go out of about approximately 200 different DCs around the country. Okay? The water heaters that are distributed by Sears go out of about six DCs around the country. So, the distribution network is nowhere near as close.","The second point is that in most places, a water heater needs a licensed plumber to install it; whereas, a lot of white goods is plug-and-play. So, from a practical perspective, leaving aside the big, bulky, heavy, relatively low-value water heaters, moving these around one at a time just becomes economically not feasible. So, we're not speculating too much or don't see too much of an impact coming from this.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And the private label, is that something that Sears has mentioned that maybe Amazon has spoken with them about within appliances?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","I mean, we private label for Sears under the Kenmore brand.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","We've been doing that for many, many, many years. And...","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Well, I...","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","I don't see that changing.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Certainly, no, I do understand that. But what I was talking about was maybe a new private label brand.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","We have had no indications of that at all.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, I know. This is only a speculative question. I get it. It's hard one, and I appreciate it.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","It would be, in this it will be very difficult to really execute on something like that.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Is a good point. Thank you, Ajita. Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Pat.","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Just on the price increases that relates to steel and the new one that's going through. Are you anticipating that that new pricing will fully offset or is there still a net negative headwind on pricing despite the price increase?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, obviously, it depends where steel goes, but we would expect it will offset.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Well, assuming that steel stays flat from where it is today, it would offset it, correct?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, in terms of the China, the drop or the pull back in advertising expense, is that something that we should expect from a longer-term perspective, or is it a temporary or transitory issue just kind of in the back half of the year, and in 2018, it needs to pick back up again?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","No, I would say, it probably doesn't need to pick up in 2018. You always have a situation where in the first half of the year, and we experienced that in the second quarter, you have some pretty significant trade shows, where we spent, gosh, $2.5 million, $3 million at the appliance and electronics shows in the second quarter at the Aquatech Show, at the Boiler Show, et cetera.","So, we wouldn't \u2013 that's not going to repeat itself in the second half. But obviously, we've said all along, advertising is a key component of our SG&A expense as we maintain the brand and build the brand in some of our water treatment and air purification and combi businesses. But I think given some of those expenses in the first half that won't repeat themselves, we're comfortable advertising being down first half year to second half year.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And just one more for me then. In terms of geographies where you really don't play in right now, you've talked previously about potential areas you can go into and the other areas where it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Can you kind of update on opportunities to expand beyond where you are geographically today?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. This is Ajita. We're building a business in Vietnam, which is primarily water treatment, and there's potential for water heater to follow; wherein India, we are exporting into South America and other markets. So, from the point of view \u2013 and also we have now in addition to the U.S. exports, which have been established and been there a while, we have two other low-cost country manufacturing locations which we can export from; primarily India and also China, although China capacity is a little more limited \u2013 available for export. From that perspective, you could see us exporting from our current manufacturing bases to other countries. In terms of setting up factories in other countries, we don't see anything in the near future just because the scale isn't there to support a manufacturing location.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just back on the Rest of World margins, can you just talk about the \u2013 I mean, it seems like first half, you were running sub-12% and you're saying 14% for the year. So, maybe just bridge us first half to second half on kind of getting there.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Sure. Well, let's talk about the second quarter first, so you understand what happened, because sales were off and not much dropped to the bottom line. What we had is about two-thirds of our sales increase came from water treatment and air purification. We spent pretty significantly on SG&A and grew the distribution and advertising. So, their profits, even though on two-thirds of the profits \u2013 two-thirds of the sales were about flat. Our most profitable major SBU, water heaters, was actually flat in the second quarter which, quite frankly, we expected because of the pre-buy that happened in the first quarter.","But we didn't expect is that profits would actually be down and it was a combination of conversion costs, but also some mix. We alluded to mix in the press release and what it was, was some of the high-end electric, fully featured was a smaller percent in the total for the quarter compared to the prior year.","So then, we also spent on a new product that we're bringing out, the point of use softener, we spent about $1 million on that, had a loss of $1 million. So, what happened is the higher sales that we got from commercial, that we got from combi, that we got from parts was \u2013 parts business is doing very well, kind of offset those losses, so we ended up neutral.","Now, when we look to the second half of the year versus the first half of the year, what we have is we're going to get the full benefit of the half-year price increase. And as we alluded to in Ajita's comments, we expanded that price increase in June. And so, we expect to get significantly more price the second half of the year than the first half of the year. If you recall, we basically got nothing in January \u2013 I mean, in the first quarter from a price standpoint.","And then, two, as we said, SG&A, we expect advertising will be down second half compared to the first half, et cetera. So, that's kind of the major pieces of the bridge from the first half to the second half as well as what happened to the margin in the second quarter.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, Lochinvar, I think you said, Ajita, is up 5% year-to-date. I think you're still saying 8% for the full year. So, what's kind of second half visibility for that step-up?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","I think we're seeing the boiler business pick up some of the things we talked about in the first quarter in terms of lots of quoting activity, but the projects being kind of slow. We see that picking up. We are picking up market share, because we were up in the first half. And best information we have is that the market was about flat. And we have some really interesting new products coming out. So, combination of all of that gives us confidence in terms of continuing that growth trend in the second half.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the color, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alvaro Lacayo with Gabelli & Company. Your line is open.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Good morning, everyone.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Just two quick questions regarding pricing. In North America, the 4%, that's going to be across all the product lines, just wondering, or if it's going to be only specific to certain areas? And then, in China, with the price adjustment that was mentioned on the call, if you can maybe just provide a little more color in terms of is it from a magnitude standpoint or is it going to be extended across other products? And then, I didn't really hear a size, so in terms of how much that price increase or how it'll impact in the second half, that'd be great.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","So, I'll start with the China. The China, we did expand it to encompass more products, so it included commercial, it included combi. We also adjusted some of the prices on some of the existing products that we raised in the first quarter. So, to give you a percentage that kind of varies by SBU, I couldn't even give you an average right now. But we did expand it and we also added to some of the existing increases we had in the first quarter.","With respect to North America, it would cover the majority of the products, but we did not raise it on things such as tankless and specialty water heaters, such as heat pump, et cetera. So, it was not an increase on that. And as you know, some of our customers have a pass-through for steel, so it didn't affect those.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global. Your line is open.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Thank you. Just a couple follow-up questions. First, on the commercial side of the business, I think you guys in the Q&A early on gave some color as to what you saw in the residential market in June. I was wondering if you could provide that same color for the commercial market. And then also remind us, sort of between gas and electric, what your relative market share is on the commercial side and, I guess, how that electric side has been progressing post that efficiency standard change?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, I'll tell you the first part, which is commercial, June was very strong for us and, we assume, for the market. So, if you look at the first two months of commercial, it was kind of a net flat, but we saw a very strong, and quite frankly, we were up in the first two months even though the market was flat, and then we saw a very strong June. So, that's with respect to commercial water heaters. And as Ajita alluded to, on the boiler side, if you look at our commercial boiler business, it was actually up high teens.","The residential boilers were down, partly because of a difficult comp last year, and also as we bring out our new product, getting the heat exchangers is going a little slower than we thought. But we had a very strong commercial boiler business in the second quarter. So, commercial right now, and I know there's mixed signals out there, the Dodge Index is good, the Architectural Index is good, but they're starting to say adjustments could slow in the second half of the year, but we're certainly not seeing it.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. And just one point of clarification on the residential comp, we brought on a large new customer last year. So, there was a buy-in.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Understood. And then just a follow-up with respect to China. You mentioned sort of the base water heater business was flattish in Q2, likely the result of the pre-buy you saw in Q1, so that's fairly understandable. Have you started to see, three, four weeks into the third quarter, have you started to see that base water heater business, from a volume standpoint, begin to rebound?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","One, I don't know and two, I'm not sure we'd really comment if we knew. I mean, I think I'll say we're tracking where we thought where we're going to be in July.","Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scatter (sic) [Boenning & Scattergood]. Your line is open.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Great. Thank you. I appreciate all the color earlier on the new arrangement with the Sears-Amazon, but wanted to just actually touch on the other shift in channel strategy that you mentioned on the last call, which is the new arrangement with Lowe's. And if you can give us any color there on how that's progressed in terms of sell-through, any competitive update there in terms of how that's impacted the wholesale side, if at all. Just any update there would be great.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","That whole changeover is on track. It's gone about as expected. And all the stores have the product and we haven't seen any major shifts. It's kind of as expected, on track.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. We're comfortable the inventory levels are where they should be.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Right.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","So, that's a positive. So, they've been able to sell out the old, if you will. And so, the inventory levels are where we want them to be, if you will.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Okay. And no sign that there's any impact on the wholesale side in terms of losing the purity there of being a wholesale brand and so forth?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","No.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Okay. And then, my other quick question was on air purification in China. Really, seems like that is gaining some pretty significant steam here. I know it's a small base, but at this pace, it could be material pretty quickly. So, can you give us an update there in terms of sizing that and whether you envision that now becoming a more significant material contributor to the overall picture in China?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I guess, I'd say it's tracking where we thought. Last year, we sold about $25 million. This year, we expect to sell about $45 million. We did say it was 4 times and that's true, but last year, it was $2.5 million in the second quarter. So, it was about $10 million in the second quarter this year, which is \u2013 that's not the prime season. The prime seasons are the fourth quarter and the first quarter.","I would tell you, and Ajita may disagree, but the estimates for the growth are not as good as what they are for the water treatment. I think most of them are kind of \u2013 estimates are high teens, versus water treatment, clearly, it's 30%-plus. But air purification, we're trying to get a position in the marketplace that we've spent on advertising, et cetera, and to build the brand, and trying to develop products that we think can differentiate it. So, I'd say we're tracking where we thought we were going to be.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. I think, in terms of just looking out into the future and the potential, it does certainly have the potential to be a much larger business than it is today. But it is a seasonal business. There's about half the year that it sells. There's robust sales, and then during the summertime it isn't as much. Whereas water treatment in comparison, is a year-round product, and just because of the reasonably low household penetration of water treatment products, frankly both products, we see lots of room for both of those businesses to grow.","Ryan Michael Connors - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Got it. Well, thanks for your time.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you. Robert Aurand on for David today. Quick question on the pricing in North America, you say it's going to do effect in late August this year. First, I believe, was August 1st last year. How should we think about that gap in terms of profitability here in early 3Q?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I'll try to answer. There is a gap between August and September. We wouldn't expect there would be much pre-buy. It'll happen mostly within the quarter because we'll try to limit it to a month or so. So, we wouldn't expect there will be much pre-buy effect on the quarter. But yeah, there is a gap in the pricing of modeling.","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then, looking at China, we had maybe heard that some of the domestic manufacturers there are getting more aggressive in the high end of the market. Are you seeing that? And if so, what kind of impact might that have on ASP realizations there?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Your statement is true, but it's not a new phenomenon. It's always been that way. So, from the perspective of any change, we really don't see a change. I've always said China is one of the most competitive markets in the world, because you have every manufacturer in the world there and fighting for space. So, we don't really see a change. It is very competitive.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","And I think our competitive advantage of having built up that infrastructure from an engineering standpoint and being first to market with products and with features that the consumer wants, that's still very much in agreement.","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","Right.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","And so, the engineering, the advertising, the brand building, all of that that supports our premium brand position is intact and we keep strengthening it.","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Larry De Maria with William Blair. Your line is open.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks and good morning. As far as the air treatment and water purification, and Rest of World, which is obviously mostly China, can you remind us maybe the profitability either in the quarter or on an annual basis and if they're losing money this year and if they can swing to positive next year as we continue to grow like this given those mid-teens and 30%-plus growth rates you talked about, until we should swing positive next year? Can you just discuss the profitability of those businesses?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Sure. I'll start with air purification, we lost about $5 million last year. We'll lose probably about $2 million this year, but I think our run rate at the end of the year will be breakeven. So, we expect to be breakeven for the year, next year, or profitable in air purification. Water treatment, we are profitable and have been. I think that the litany of our water treatment is a good example of how we try to leverage the high gross margins that we have in this product to ultimately get them to profitability. So when we started the water treatment, we probably lost $10 million, then we lost $6 million, then we made $3 million. And last year, we were at about low-double-digit margins. So, it's a nicely profitable business for us, not at the average for the business, but certainly progressing that way.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","That's great. And can you just size that business for us as well, like you do for the treatment business?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, I think we said that water treatment will be about $185 million or so in China with the A. O. Smith brand.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","And the $275 million I referred to was worldwide.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. It was worldwide.","Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got you. Okay. Very good.

O. Smith Corp.","Thank you.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","And my question was around the \u2013 Ajita, you talked about the retail expansion in the release, you've talked about like Tier 2 and Tier 3, especially on the water treatment side. Could you update us on the retail stores you have in China today? And I don't know if you're doing anything different specific to water treatment, air purification on the retail side?","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","Go ahead.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, to give you an idea, we're over 9,000 stores in the water heater, so about 9,400, 9,500. We would be over 7,000 stores. We've grown that pretty dramatically this year, probably about 900 units or so this year in the water treatment. So, we're over 7,000. In air purification, we're probably at about 3,000 stores or so. Now, again, those last two would probably have a higher percent online.","But from a store standpoint, we're continuing to do what we've always done is we'll be the first to tell you there are some underperforming stores. We evaluate those stores quarterly. And ultimately, if we're not comfortable with the forecast of being able to get them to a reasonable level, we'll shut them. And we'll continue to prune stores minus and add stores. So, I think it's a consistent philosophy we've had for the last several years.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","And also, in terms of the new categories getting into the stores, it's always an evaluation of the cost of getting in, which is training the people, getting the merchandising, the fixturing and all of that for a new category versus what we expect in terms of revenue and profitability. So, that balance and evaluation that we make whenever you're going to a new store versus not. So, that whole process is an ongoing process.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And was there any specific portion to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities? I mean, that's what, I think, you specified in the release here in the quarter.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I think that's where the area of expansion is. That's where the growth in new housing, I'd say, is occurring. And so, we've been moving into that for the last couple of years.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Got it. And just a follow-on on the Aquasana headwind, I think you mentioned, for this year, it's going to be about like 40 bps. It seems like that's a little bit less than 50 bps on the last quarterly call you mentioned. So, things are progressing well, I guess, on the Aquasana side. Can you give us some color, like how the cost-saving synergies, which you have talked about, are coming through?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. Well, I think we've said approximately 50 bps.","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Less than.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Less than 50 bps. I'd say, I think it's progressing well. Year-to-date, we're up 20% in sales. And the cost synergies that we forecast, I'd say, are probably a little bit ahead.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, and...","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O. Smith Corp.","The revenue synergy is probably slightly behind.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah, right.","Ajita G. Rajendra - A. O.

China sales were up 16% with gas tankers and water treatment products growing faster than the business as a whole. Our adjusted earnings of $0.59 per share were 9% higher than the $0.54 per share recorded last year and were primarily driven by higher sales, which more offset $6 million in incremental ERP expenses. We continue to allocate a portion of our capital to returning cash to our shareholders. We repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for $87 million this year through September 30th.

Sales for the third quarter of $582 million were 8.5% higher than the previous year driven by higher sales of water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and water heaters and water treatment products in China. Adjusted earnings of $53.5 million improved 6% from 2013. Adjusted earnings in 2014 excluded after-tax non-operating pension costs of $2.9 million. Adjusted earnings in 2013 excluded after-tax non-operating pension costs of $3.2 million and after-tax restructuring and impairment expenses of $1 million. Adjusted earnings $0.59 per share improved 9% compared with $0.54 per share last year. The effective income tax rate associated with third quarter adjusted earnings in 2014 was 27.9% compared with 25.7% for the same period last year.","The rate last year benefited from several non-recurring items. Consistent with previous disclosure, we expect the effective income tax rate for 2014 adjusted earnings will be between 28% and 29% with the GAAP effective income tax rate almost 1 percentage point lower. A reconciliation from GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS is included at the end of this presentation and covers the previously discussed adjustments.","Sales in our North America segment of $392.4 million increased 6% over last year driven by higher volumes of U.S. residential water heaters and commercial boilers and a price increase in May. Rest of World segment sales of $198.5 million increased 13% compared with last year. Sales in China increased 16% driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products and higher customer inventory levels in advance of the fall holiday.","North America adjusted operating earnings of $56.3 million were 1% lower than last year and adjusted operating margins of 14.3% was lower as well. The favorable impact from higher volumes and prices in the U.S. were offset by higher steel costs and an incremental $6 million in plant ERP implementation cost.","Rest of World operating earnings of $30 million improved 12% compared with last year driven primarily by higher sales. Operating margin of 15.1% declined slightly from one year ago as a result of higher selling and advertising cost as a percent of sales in China.","Our adjusted corporate expenses were $10.6 million, a decline from the prior year primarily due to higher expenses related to management incentive programs in 2013. Cash provided by operations of $164 million through September 2014 was lower than the $188 million provided last year. Higher earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital in the 2014 period. We are expecting operating cash flow for the full year 2014 to be between $225 million and $235 million. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 16% at the end of September 2014. We have sizable cash balances totaling nearly $525 million located offshore, and our net cash position was almost $270 million, both as of September 2014.","During the first nine months of 2014, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock for a total of $87 million under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan. Considering the additional 1.5 million shares authorized in April by our board, we had approximately 840,000 shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of September. Depending on factors, such as stock price, working capital requirements, and alternative investment opportunities, we expect to repurchase approximately 490,000 shares of the remaining authorized shares in 2014, pending approximately a $110 million in the full year. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we expect to end the year with approximately $275 million in net cash.","This morning, we announced an increase to our adjusted earnings guidance of $2.37 to $2.41 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance represents a 16% increase in after-tax earnings compared with our 2013 results. Non-operating pension costs are expected to be $0.14 per share in 2014, slightly above the $0.13 per share in 2013. Recall that our pension plan will sunset on December 31, 2014 for almost all beneficiaries. We expect this to result in a considerable reduction to our pension costs for 2015 and beyond. Our GAAP EPS guidance for 2014 is $2.23 to $2.27 per share.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the assumptions in our 2014 outlook and our growth strategy. Ajita?","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you, John. As John mentioned, the midpoint of our updated 2014 guidance implies growth of 16% in adjusted earnings per share over last year. Our outlook for 2014 includes the following assumptions.","First, we continue to see strong growth in China and we expect over 17% growth in the region in 2014.","Second, we expect Lochinvar-branded sales to grow approximately 10% in 2014, well ahead of GDP growth in the U.S. as our Lochinvar brand is expected to continue to benefit from the transition from lower efficiency non-condensing boilers to high efficiency condensing boilers. We are encouraged by the acceptance in the market of the newer higher efficiency products in the Lochinvar portfolio. Specifically, we are seeing the CREST boiler being increasingly specified in projects. Additionally, we have received very positive feedback from the market associated with our recently announced FTXL boiler, which was launched late in the third quarter.","Third, we are cautiously optimistic about the developing recovery in U.S. housing and the strengthening demand for commercial water heaters driven by replacement and retrofit activity.","Fourth, we successfully implemented a mid-single-digit price increase for wholesale water heaters in May related to higher steel prices and inflation of other costs.","Fifth, as we have discussed in the past, 2014 will be negatively impacted by approximately $10 million of incremental ERP implementation expense. The fourth quarter will be impacted by $3 million to $4 million of incremental cost and this is in line with our past guidance.","I would like to dive into our growth model in a little more detail, first China. As many of you know, we are a consumer product business in China. We have three growth drivers underpinning this business which give us confidence to project an annual growth rate of two times GDP for the foreseeable future, first is overall market growth.","EMM which is a retail channel research firm that we have quoted many times in the past, predicts water heater market growth to be 7% in China this year. With continued urbanization, growth in the middle class and the developing replacement and upgrade markets, we expect strong market growth to continue for quite some time.","The second growth driver is market share gains and increases in average price. We have a strong market position by value in the electric wall-hung category. Our position in gas tankless while a leader is less than 20% by value and we see opportunity to continue to gain more share with our well accepted quiet model. Increases in average price are also part of this growth driver. Our commitment to engineering resources will continue to result in new products with features and benefits in which consumers see value and for which they\u2019re willing to pay an incrementally higher price.","The third growth driver is fast growing ancillary product categories, the most significant example of which is water treatment. A. O. Smith branded water treatment grew $25 million in 2013, which added 5 percentage points of growth to our overall China business in 2013. This year we expect water treatment to grow to almost $90 million with the A. O. Smith branded portion totaling approximately $70 million. CMM projects, Point of View\u2019s water treatment products in China to grow 40% per year over the next five years. Combining these three growth drivers gives us high confidence that we will continue to grow at two times China\u2019s GDP rate into the future.","Certainly China is part of our strong organic growth profile, but it\u2019s not the whole story. As demonstrated by achieving year-over-year organic growth of 7% or more over the last eight quarter, we believe our organic profitable growth profile of 8% per year for the foreseeable future differentiates A. O. Smith from its peers. A solid and expanding replacement demand and minimal exposure to Europe underpins the faster growing pieces of our business. And these are; 15% growth expectation for China, which is 30% of our business, 10% growth expectation for [locking] of our branded products, which is 12% of our business and the remaining 58% of the business, which is almost exclusively North America water heater, is reasonably expected to grow at 4%.","The weighted average of these three pieces comes to 8%. And we are comfortable that this organic growth projection -- we\u2019re comfortable with this organic growth projection for the foreseeable future.","Our acquisition strategy has not changed. We remain focused on water heating and water treating companies around the world, as well as leveraging our brand and distribution channel in China. The acquisition landscape continues to be competitive as sustained price appreciation in equity markets overall and higher leverage allowed by banks in their loans to private equity firm drives sellers\u2019 expectations higher.","Our teams are energetic and engaged. Our capital deployment strategies continue to support a combination of investments for organic growth, acquisition, share repurchase and dividend.","You have seen this slide before. We show this only as a reminder that we will continue to be a financially disciplined acquirer of companies in our stated corporate strategy.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we are opened for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc","Hi, just a couple of questions. First, can you talk a little bit about the inventory situation that you called out with respect to China, sounds like things maybe at a little built up here over the last couple of months. And is that more of a normal factor is this something unexpected I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to understand?","John Kita","I think Matt as you go into the fall holiday; it\u2019s not unusual for them -- for our customers to build up some inventory. I think it happened last year\u2019s third quarter and this year it\u2019s a little bit more of a pickup than last year\u2019s third quarter. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything significantly out of the ordinary.","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc","And can you just revisit -- and I apologize if you said this in your prepared remarks, it is my last question. In terms of commercial water heater market volume what you expect for 2014 was embedded in your guidance and then similarly for residential in North America?","John Kita","Sure. When we look at 2014 commercial it\u2019s been relatively strong year-to-date. The third quarter we\u2019re thinking was pretty flat to up maybe a little bit. We\u2019re estimating that fourth quarter will be flat with the prior year which gets you to 164,000 to 165,000 units. Last year is pretty much tracking where we sat, we said beginning of the year we were estimating 9 million units, we haven\u2019t come off that. And as you know that\u2019s up 4%, 5% from the prior year.","Matt Summerville - KeyBanc","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Hey, good morning. I don\u2019t want to read anything into it, because I don\u2019t think that there needs to be right into it, but the China full year sales guide kind of suppose fourth quarter of up \u201812, just wondering off of -- particularly off of the previous question. Is there anything we should be reading into that or is that just some of that inventory order change or the change in dynamic of orders for the fourth quarter versus that third quarter build?","Ajita Rajendra","Yes. I think it could be impacted by a little bit of the inventory build. We would certainly expect the fourth quarter to be up double-digits. Quarterly growth can be lumpy due to variety of reasons including promotional activity inventory levels and previous year\u2019s comparisons. So, we\u2019re still very comfortable projecting two times GDP going forward and we think fourth quarter will be double-digit.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Okay. Thank you. John, I think it was you who said last quarter that the company was kind of looking to sort of freeze the cash balance and use the excess, the overage of free cash flow more for share repurchases. And certainly we have seen a pick-up in share purchases this year but now you\u2019re talking about cash balance that has actually declined for the first time in a while in the third quarter and will decline again in the fourth quarter. Again, just trying to read tea leaves here, are we now\u2026","John Kita","","Scott, what we said is we are going to try to keep our net cash balance for the year relatively constant with the prior year. Last year, it was $290 million. We would expect this year, it will be $275 million to $280 million. So I would read anything into it. That resulted though in us buying back $110 million or so of stock. And so that was really the focus as to keep the net cash balance relatively stable but we can only estimate it so close.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Right, and I get that. But I guess my question is my extension of that John is, are we seeing that the pace of 2014 share repurchases is kind of in the absence of acquisitions what we should see after 2014?","John Kita","Well, we haven\u2019t said what we\u2019re going to do after 2014 but we did say, in 2014 we want to keep that net cash balance about constant and that we still think acquisitions are potentially the best value added opportunity for shareholders. But until we get that acquisition, we were comfortable proceeding in 2014 the way we did. So, as we look at our plan, and come out in the first quarter I mean in January of next year, we\u2019ll evaluate where we are for 2015 at that time.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","All right. Thank you. And last question, more for you Ajita. As you can see, I really have no questions operationally. The question I have is more about share -- I am sorry, acquisitions to finish off John\u2019s point. Is there anything you could tell us to give us some type of temperature check on where this process is, it\u2019s been a long time coming, we understand asset prices are higher, private equity a little bit looser with the cash but it\u2019s been sometime and is there any way for -- is the temperature hotter now than it was in the second quarter or the first part of the year and if so why? Cold you give us some type of breadcrumb here on, where -- how hot the water is on the M&A side?","Ajita Rajendra","Like I said in the past, the activity level is high. If I look at last few months, it\u2019s been as high as it has been in the past. And the timing of this is very difficult to judge obviously; companies come in the market and we don\u2019t control that timing. We do also target companies and it depends on how those conversations go. So, it\u2019s very difficult to predict that as you know. But from our perspective and our strategy, nothing has changed. We\u2019re looking for the right type of acquisition and we\u2019ve laid out the criteria that we have and we are being very disciplined about sticking to that criteria. And as John said, we believe long-term the best value that we could bring our shareholders is making the right acquisition.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Right. You have shared with us on that though that you have walked away from situations, be it price for or for extended due diligence reasons. So I guess my -- I am wondering again looking for these breadcrumbs again, Ajita, just wondering if we are closer to the altar on anything now than we were at the beginning of the year?","John Kita","Scott you know I can\u2019t comment on that.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Well, I was hoping you could, other companies do in fact. But if -- I know you guys do keep it a little bit closer to the best, but that\u2019s all I had. I was just hoping for a little bit more on this because it\u2019s been as you know more than three years running?","John Kita","I understand.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Northland Capital. Your line is open.","Noah Kaye - Northland Capital","Thank you, Ajita and John and congratulations on another strong quarter. If I could touch on China that 16% growth -- you\u2019ve given some good granularity, let me put a little more detail on how to think about where the growth is taking place. Can you break it down a little bit in terms of the mix and water heaters the replacements versus new housing demand? And then also touch on as you have in the past the online versus the retail mix?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, I\u2019ll say our online continues to be very strong. Last year it was $15 million for the full year. We originally estimated it would double, but by the end of the third quarter we were over $30 million. So we expect that to run pretty close to $40 million for the year. So that continues to do very well.","The replacement versus new housing, I can only give you anecdotal kind of based on our survey. Our people would say the replacement is picking up, where they would have used a number of 35% or so of the market one or two years ago. They are now saying it\u2019s approaching 50% specifically in the tier one steady. So, and I said anecdotal, that\u2019s our survey data. As you know there isn\u2019t good HRI and housing completion data like there is in the U.S. where we can be more specific and confident in that replacement new ratio, so that\u2019s about the best I can do.","Noah Kaye - Northland Capital","Sure. I understand. And margin in China were again very much lower, again really strong and you\u2019ve guided I think previously to a much lower EBIT rate for the year. Is there a reason I think for the fourth quarter to expect some meaningful additional expenses in China and Rest of World that would kind of bring it back down or are we continuing to track above that as we look for the fourth quarter?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, the third quarter beyond us, the margins did surprise us a little bit. We have said SG&A would be up from the second quarter and it was, and it was up a couple of points we talked about. However gross margin because of some mix et cetera was also up. So we weren\u2019t anticipating the gross margin mix positive that happened.","When we look at the fourth quarter, SG&A will continue to be up, I mean it is traditional we talked about it last meeting about advertising being up in the second half of the year and we except that to continue. We do also as we look at India from a sales standpoint some things have come up. India was tracking a little bit behind last year and then we mutually agreed to wind down our crow banding relationship with our largest distributor in India in the third quarter due to some channel conflict issues.","So absent those sales, we\u2019re expected to be up 20 percentage here, but unfortunately we\u2019re going to be down about $4 million with that customer mostly in the fourth quarter. So that will have some affect on margins, but again we still think we\u2019ll be up, Rest of World year-over-year fourth quarter margins will be up.","So, India has taken a little bit of a detour, we pass them long-term. We still think it\u2019s a good place to be. We think we\u2019ll be able to replace those sales as we go forward. And the core business is still seeing some growth.","Noah Kaye - Northland Capital","Great. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll jump back.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of William Bremer with Maxim Group. Your line is open.","William Bremer - Maxim Group","Good morning, good morning.","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning.","William Bremer - Maxim Group","Nice quarter. Let\u2019s go in for Lochinvar, can we get a sense on their revenue growth this quarter and I know you\u2019re guiding for 10% for the year, but can you help us get a little more granular in terms of their operating margin and going into the winter season now more specifically on their aftermarket?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, as you know as we get in for the third and fourth quarter their aftermarket does pick up and we would expect that to be the case again. It might be monotonous, but they were up about 10% again this quarter and they continue to do everything that they said they will do. Their margins are very comparable to last year even when they have higher engineering and selling, so they continue to perform very well. For the year we expect them to be up about 10% with comparable margins again given that they\u2019ve put a lot in engineering this year and a lot in selling, I think they\u2019re doing extremely well.","William Bremer - Maxim Group","Can you talk about specifically their expansion plans and not just here domestically, but potentially internationally?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, we\u2019ve talked about the new products; the FT XL will come out late in the third quarter. We expect it to be well received. Good electronics and they will be more efficient than the competition in that space. They have some other product line expansion planned for next year that we think will also be beneficial. China I think we talked about in the last meeting, the condensing is moving slower maybe than what we\u2019re anticipating. But we think there is some potential opportunities as we develop products for maybe the non-condensing in China that\u2019s going to take most of next year to develop those products. But we\u2019re still optimistic I would say on China long-term for the boiler business, but probably the condensing is going to take a little longer than we originally expected.","William Bremer - Maxim Group","Okay. And then let\u2019s go into India a little bit. Can we discuss what your strategy is now going forward and are you starting to think about bringing in the water treatment portion to this and I mean what\u2019s the strategy going forward for India at this point?","Ajita Rajendra","I think the strategy has not changed at all. I think this relationship that we had with this customer, we expected at some point would that we\u2019d go our different ways because of some of the channel contract that was built in. It came a little faster than we anticipated, but that\u2019s kind of what built into our longer-term plan. Without that customer, we\u2019ll still grow at 16% to 20% in India this year. The economy we feel is improving. The economy has been slow but it is improving. And the longer term strategy in terms of building our brand, building it with water heaters and then expanding it into water treatment has not changed.","William Bremer - Maxim Group","Okay Ajita, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Samuel Eisner with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Samuel Eisner - Goldman Sachs","Yes, thanks very much. And good morning everyone.","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning.","Samuel Eisner - Goldman Sachs","Just going back to some of the comments that John was making before on the rest of world profitability, it sounds as though that gross margin was a bit better than you expected, you said because of mix and then et cetera. I\u2019m just wondering if you could expand on really what is driving the profitability in rest of world and if you could even call out what the profitability on water treatment was that\u2019d be very helpful.","John Kita","Well water treatment, I guess all I can really say about water treatment on an annual basis is last year we lost about $3 million in water treatment and we have talked about a $2 million or so profit this year. And everything we\u2019re seeing that still on track. And I think that\u2019s relatively equally spread across the four quarters. So, there is nothing unusual there. And I\u2019m not sure the rest -- it truly was a mix in China. So, China had extremely good quarter, better than we would have said, we would have projected because of that gross margin improvement. And that was really mix, some of the customers carry higher margins and those had higher sales in the quarter.","Samuel Eisner - Goldman Sachs","And then if you look at your guidance for the year, I believe that implies around $0.60 in the fourth quarter. So, you just reported $0.59 quarter, should we be thinking about your business as essentially flat on a sequential basis, is it accelerating or was it slowing throughout the course of the quarter, just I want to help understand what that\u2019s really implying for the fourth quarter.","John Kita","Well, you\u2019re right. The midpoint is $0.60 and that\u2019s a 15% increase over last year. So, that\u2019s a positive. As we look at the businesses, we look at as I mentioned that we expect commercial to be relatively flat year-over-year. So, we don\u2019t expect to get benefit from that. We do expect Lochinvar to continue to be up, that will be beneficial. And then as I have said, China, we expect to be up double-digit, but we could have some margin changes there, because we\u2019re not expecting the repeat of the gross margin improvement but we are committing to doing additional SG&A.","And then as we talked about India\u2019s profit will be down because of -- when I said we lost about $4 million with that customer, as you can understand since the fourth quarter is where 60% of our sales are much of that loss will be apples-and-apples to the fourth quarter of last year. We\u2019ve said India is going to lose $5 million; it will probably lose a little bit over $5 million with this adjustment. But I think I go back to Ajita\u2019s statement, when you look at our organic relative 8%, we\u2019re comfortable with that going forward and on a quarter-to-quarter basis you can have some internals, but we\u2019re certainly comfortable, we have a growing business which will add growing profitability.","Ajita Rajendra","And also when you compared to last year, it\u2019s about a 50% improvement over last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Samuel Eisner - Goldman Sachs","I understood. And then if you just look over the course of the quarter if I just look at July, August and September, did you see any deviation in the rate of growth either in Rest of World or within the U.S. for your business? Just trying to understand if exactly are accelerating or decelerating or basically saying flat throughout the course of the current quarter that you just reported?","John Kita","Well, it\u2019s always dangerous to look month-to-month, but I\u2019ll say that the resi and commercial are relatively strong in September. But again, I\u2019d be careful taking going too much with that, because it\u2019s in very month-to-month, but it was clearly stronger and China I think will just continue to be consistently that increase. So I wouldn\u2019t to say I anything bowing down...","Ajita Rajendra","Yes. And I would just reinforce that it\u2019s so difficult to see it month-by-month. I mean if you look at the AHRI data for August, I\u2019m sorry July and August it was relatively flat to up a little bit. But based on our September, we expect September to be high. But again, overall the quarter is pretty good.","Samuel Eisner - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll hop in queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning.","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning.","Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets","Just can we talk about on the price increase that you had in May. Are you now or did you -- are you recovering the steel costs now and have you seen any continued escalation in the material costs?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, as you\u2019re aware, steel costs are up, as well as inflation was up for things like healthcare et cetera and that\u2019s really what drove the price increase. And that was the factor for it. And steel prices as you know have stayed high and even increased over the year as things have gone on. So I mean it is what it is. Steel has stayed up there.","Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets","Right. So is it fair to say then it\u2019s a little bit more of a margin headwind or does another price increase come through at some point this year?","Ajita Rajendra","We can\u2019t talk about future price increases for sure. Clearly steel was up pretty dramatically especially when you look at last year to this year, it was up pretty dramatically. I mean the CRU numbers are out there that say it was up significantly.","Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, thanks. And just on your -- I\u2019m assuming there is no change to your expectation for how things starts in the U.S. given that your resi unit volumes about the same?","John Kita","Right. We\u2019re still at that million or so in completions, I think about 900,000 or so, so really no changes in our assumptions there. And as I said, the resi volumes are pretty much tracking where we thought they would be.","Ajita Rajendra","And we\u2019ve been pretty consistent with that right from the beginning of the year.","Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets","Right. Just one more for me then on China, can you give us some granularity on the growth rate you\u2019re seeing in the Tier 1, Tier 2 cities versus some other smaller Tier 3 Tier 4? Is there a large bifurcation for the growth rates between those tier cities?","John Kita","Well, I guess I\u2019d say Tier 2 continues to grow and become over 40% I think of our sales. We\u2019re just right now I would say and Ajita you may know better than I do kind of looking at parallel trading Tier 3 and Tier 4 and then certainly as we go out into the future that\u2019s an area we\u2019re going to focus on. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re significantly out there right now. We\u2019re still in that 6,000 plus distribution outlets in total.","Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets","Right. And I think some of the smaller cities are also being penetrated by the online sales.","John Kita","Right. But certainly as you look, we do look as part of our growth going forward. I think Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities will play a part in there without a go.","Charles Brady - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","David Rose - Wedbush Securities","Good morning. Since most of my high level questions have been answered, I do have a couple of others. One is, if you could break out the inventory a little bit for us in terms of where you think it might be more concerning for you in China in terms of -- is it price point, is it Tier 1 or Tier 2 where do you think you maybe most inflated and why? And then if you could on that just also provide us a little bit more color on the consumable piece for the water treatment business, I know it\u2019s relatively small, but maybe just a little bit of update on that? Thank you.","John Kita","I\u2019ll take the last one first. I don\u2019t think there is anything really new in the consumable. We\u2019re probably looking at $2 million to $3 million. I think I might have said 3 to 4 last quarter, but I had incorrect number, it\u2019s probably closer to $2 million to $3 million. We do think as we\u2019ve talked about we\u2019ve tried to do some things. Our recent release in July makes all the filters proprietary now use that term a little bit loosely because you have to be able to enforce it, but we certainly think in the future that consumables will play a bigger part and we\u2019re doing everything we can to try to maintain that proprietary filters in our systems. So that\u2019s clearly something we look at. And as we go forward, we think it will become a bigger part of our business. And as we go through our planning phase, we might have a better feel for that. But as we talked about those four or five filters in each -- our old system and they have to be replaced at different time lines.","Number two, the inventory, really not much and again, I don\u2019t want to overemphasize the inventory. With the holidays, you would normally have a build up in the third quarter. It was a little bit more than last year, could have a minor effect on the fourth quarter. But again, we still expect growth in the fourth quarter to be up double-digit. And really nothing distinct about that inventory growth; it\u2019s with our major customers which you would expect.","David Rose - Wedbush Securities","Okay. And then one more if I may, can India be breakeven next year? And what if so, what does it take for you to be breakeven?","John Kita","I\u2019ll take a shot at it. We said that it\u2019ll lose $5 million this year, we certainly have every intention and we think we will improve the profitability of the water heater next year. We talked about last year, we were doing some vertical integration, bringing more of it in-house; we expect to have that done towards the end of this year. So, we will see some improvement. I\u2019m not sure given the loss of this customer that we can get all the way to breakeven, but we certainly anticipate we\u2019re going to have improvement in the water heater business next year. I think the wildcard will be water treatment for evaluating how we roll that out and clearly when you have a new role like that, that has some expenses associated with it. So, I think we\u2019ll be in a better position to kind of talk about India when we do our year end review.","David Rose - Wedbush Securities","Okay, great.

With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Executive Chairman; Kevin Wheeler, Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Kevin's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on slide 3.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Here are a few comments about our third quarter. We achieved sales of $754 million, net earnings of $0.61 per share or 13% higher than our earnings per share in 2017. We continued to review our capital allocation and dedicated portion of our cash to return to shareholders. We repurchased 1.7 million shares for approximately $106 million through the first nine months of the year. We plan to continue buying back our shares at a previously stated $135 million annual pace using a 10b5-1 plan. We expect to opportunistically buy back up to $65 million worth of shares in the open market in 2018.","We announced a 22% increase to our dividend in October. This is the second increase this year. The five-year compounded annual growth rate of our dividend is about 30%. We repatriated nearly $300 million during the first nine months of 2018 using the proceeds to repurchase our shares and pay down floating rate debt. Our A.O. Smith-branded water treatment products are now in 1,700 Lowe's stores nationwide.","John will now describe our results in more detail beginning on slide 4.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Sales for the third quarter of $754 million were 1% higher than the same quarter in 2017. Net earnings in the third quarter of $105 million increased 12% from the third quarter in 2017. Third quarter earnings per share of $0.61 increased 13% compared with the same quarter in 2017. Sales in our North American segment of $487 million were flat compared with the third quarter of 2017. Pricing actions in 2018 on water heaters and boilers related to higher steel and freight costs were more than offset by lower water heater volumes.","North America water treatment sales comprised of Aquasana, Hague and our recently-launched water treatment products at Lowe's, incrementally added $9 million to our North America segment sales. Rest of World segment sales of $274 million increased 1% compared with the same quarter in 2017. China sales growth was 2.5% in local currency. Higher sales of water treatment products and air purifiers in China were partially offset by a decline in electric water heaters compared with the prior year. Currency translation reduced sales by approximately $6 million compared with the third quarter 2017.","On slide 6, North America segment earnings of $106 million were 4% lower than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2017. The unfavorable impact from lower sales of water heaters and higher steel and freight costs were partially offset by pricing actions. Spending associated with the launch of water treatment products at Lowe's amounted to approximately $2 million. As a result of these factors, North-American segment margin of 21.7% was lower than last year.","Rest of World earnings of $39 million increased nearly 16% compared with third quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of lower expenses associated with employee incentive programs and smaller losses in India. As a result, third quarter segment margin of 14.3% was significantly higher than one year ago.","Our corporate expenses were higher than last year as a result of several miscellaneous items. Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2018 was 20.5%. The rate was lower than the 28.8% experienced during the third quarter last year, primarily due to lower federal income taxes related to tax reform. The lower effective income tax rate benefited third quarter 2018 earnings by $0.06 per share.","Cash provided by operations during the first nine months of 2018 was $289 million compared with $150 million provided during the same period in 2017. Higher earnings and a smaller investment in working capital were the primary drivers of higher cash flow compared with last year.","Our liquidity position and balance sheet remained strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 10% at the end of the third quarter. We have cash balances totaling $618 million located offshore. And our net cash position was approximately $425 million at the end of September.","During the first nine months of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares of common stock for a total of $106 million. Approximately 3.2 million shares remained on the existing Board authorization at the end of September.","Primarily as a result of lower U.S. and China water heater sales than previously forecasted, we reduced our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance by approximately $0.02 per share with a range of between $2.57 and $2.60 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance represents a 19% increase in EPS compared with our adjusted 2017 results. Our EPS guidance excludes $0.03 per share of plant closing costs.","Please turn to slide 9 for several 2018 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2018 to be approximately $475 million, which is significantly higher than the $326 million generated in 2017. We expect higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital this year. Our 2018 capital spending plans are approximately $85 million. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $75 million in 2018.","Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $48 million in 2018, slightly higher than the $47 million in 2017, partially due to higher projected spending at our Corporate Technology Center. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 21% in 2018, lower than the previous year due to the U.S. tax reform.","We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately $135 million in 2018 under a 10b5-1 plan and to supplement our 10b5-1 plan with opportunistic share repurchase up to $65 million. We expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2018 will be approximately 172.5 million.","Kevin Wheeler will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for the remainder of 2018 and our growth strategy beginning on September on slide 10.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Okay. Thank you, John. Our outlook for 2018 includes the following assumptions. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will increase 250,000 to 300,000 units in 2018. This assumption is lower than our July forecast. Based on our shipments in September, we believe the industry will be down approximately 100,000 units in the second half of the year. This assumption includes tankless units.","Similarly, we revised our forecast for U.S. commercial water heater volumes. Based on year-to-date shipments and a difficult fourth quarter comparison, we now forecast a 5% decline in volumes. As a result of significantly higher steel prices and inflation and freight and other costs, we announced a price increase effective in early June, which average approximately 10% on the majority of our U.S. water heater products.","Given recent significant depreciation of the China currency, we now project a full year translation benefit of approximately $23 million compared with sales in 2017 which is $10 million lower than our July forecasts. The translation benefit to earnings is approximately $3 million for the year. Our projection assumes that China currency will appreciate slightly from current levels during the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting in a translation detriment of approximately $12 million to sales and $2 million to earnings in the fourth quarter compared with the rates in 2017. We expect the losses in India to decline from $7.5 million loss in 2017 to approximately $5 million loss in 2018.","For the full year, we expect sales in China in local currency to grow approximately 3%. Sales continue to be negatively impacted by a slowdown in housing sales, which we believe is primarily driven by a slowdown in the China economy, increasing consumer anxiety surrounding international trade issues.","We launched our water treatment product portfolio in over 1,700 Lowe's stores last month. The launch was mixed. We fulfilled 100% of water filtration systems and replacement filters on time. However, we had issues as we attempted to double the manufacturing capacity of our water softener plant simultaneously with ramping up volumes to load our new customer. We project $14 million of sales to Lowe's in 2018.","Please advance to slide 11. We project revenue growth will be approximately 7% in U.S. dollar terms for the year. The midpoint of our revised EPS guidance range is 19% higher than last year. We expect North America adjusted segment margin for the year to be approximately 22.5%. We project weaker performance in the Rest of World segment, primarily as a result of our lower China growth forecasts. For the full year, we expect Rest of World margins to be approximately 13%.","We're in the middle of our 2019 planning process. Preliminarily, we project 2019 China sales growth in local currency to be 3% compared with 2018, as inventory levels remain elevated into next year with slower housing growth. Given the depreciation of the China currency, we expect a $50 million headwind to sales and over $7 million to earnings, if the currency rate stays where it is.","Combining our China projections with a full year of price for North America water heaters, a full year of Lowe's water treatment business and the remaining businesses growing similarly to the recent past, we project organic growth in 2019 of 5.5% to 7% in local currency and 4% to 5.5% in U.S. dollar terms. We plan to update this revenue guidance on our January 2019 conference call.","We continue to have confidence in our business model in China for the long term. The investments we have made in our premium brand, broad distribution and innovative products over the past 20 years has resulted in a reputation for reliability and safety and driven significant growth. We are proud of the profitability and the high return on the assets that we have achieved in China.","When the housing market recovers and consumer confidence returns, we believe once again we will grow double digits. In the meantime, we are taking appropriate steps to protect our profitability and we'll continue to bring innovative products to market. The fundamentals of our global business model, market leadership, 85% replacement market in U.S. water heaters and boilers, strong cash flow and organic growth, coupled with the optionality of our balance sheet bodes well for us to successfully navigate through and thrive in these volatile times.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are open for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from Doug Clark of Goldman Sachs. Doug, your line is open.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. My first one, just looking at China, lower growth for this year and then also kind of lower growth again for next year. I'm curious, and you didn't really mention just competitively and even this morning, a competitor actually had a fairly nice kind of year-on-year growth in water heaters. So, I'm wondering if there's anything kind of competitively that you think has changed recently, and then also if you could comment on just how inventory levels sit today. It sounds like that might be a little bit of a headwind heading into next year as well. Thanks.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I'll start, Kevin. Our market share has been basically held steady year-to-date so in the water heater business. And so, we saw the industry declining actually some in the third quarter. So, I'm not sure which competitor you're talking about. But our market share has held steady for the year-to-date.","Inventories are up about the same percent from second to third quarter, as they were last year from second quarter to third quarter. That's not unusual because we're entering our highest-selling season, which is the fourth quarter. I will tell you, though. Inventory levels are still elevated as we talk, and we'll kind of evaluate as the fourth quarter happens with respect to the online selling holidays, et cetera.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then, my follow-up. I'm just curious on the traction with the formaldehyde product that I believe you launched in 3Q in Rest of World.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","The new products were received very well by the Chinese consumer, growing about 40% growth rate. They have done very well during the summer months. And during the winter months, the leaching of formaldehyde will decline a bit. So, we'll see a sales drop in Q4. But overall, the products were received well. We believe formaldehyde has a benefit to the consumer, and we look forward to next year as we get into the summer months and growing that particular business with our Chinese consumer.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And your next question comes from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Matt, your line is open.","Matt J. Summerville - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. A couple of questions. Can you just provide a little more granularity around China in the third quarter? What did the water heater business actually do on a year-over-year basis water treatment? And then, I just want to understand, was the air purification business overall up 40% year-over-year? I want to make sure we have that number correctly. John, if you can just go through...","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. Air purification was up 40%, but it's off a very low level. So, I think it was up about $3 million. And as Kevin said, it was really the formaldehyde sales, which quite frankly we saw declining a little bit as we got into the last month because you're getting out of the summer months. But air purification was up about $3 million. Water treatment, we said, was up over 20%. Then, you had the two negatives, were the currency of $6 million. And then, electric water heaters were down. And that's how you ended up flat.","Matt J. Summerville - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Got it. And then, I guess, relative to the inventory position you guys described coming out of the second quarter in China, have you made any progress to-date in drawing down those inventories? Or do you sort of need to wait for the online season to really kick in in the back part of the year before you're able to do that?","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. I'll tell you, our days on hand were down in the third quarter. However, that's really not a great measurement, considering the volatility. We used the \u2013 a 90-day forward forecast, and we have some seasonality that could be misleading. So, we're using a variety of inventory measures by customer, by product category, by percentage increase, offline, online. And so, overall, inventories are elevated. We look for a stronger fourth quarter, and we'll continue to evaluate our sales through the busy season, Singles' Day and other promotions 12-12. And we'll determine, if necessary, if we need to take additional actions on promotions or any kind of a bundling activity.","Matt J. Summerville - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jeff, your line is open.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for the color on 2018. Just \u2013 maybe just hitting on the comment about China and the lower growth rate into 2019 but confidence back to double digit. Just as you think about that 15% long-term growth rate and some of the maturity in water heaters growth in that market, how are you thinking about kind of potentially revising that long-term growth rate?","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, I'll tell you, the \u2013 long term, we firmly believe that the U.S. and China economies are intertwined in that the trade issues and so forth that we're facing today and some of the slowdown in the economy will get resolved. There is certainly a growing middle class that will continue. Right now, they're saving money rather than spending due to some of the uncertainty. But going forward, we expect to \u2013 for the economy to grow certainly double digits as we go forward as the consumer confidence comes back. And as far as rating part of the business?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. I think, Jeff, when we modeled, we've done some modeling out. And basically, we think China can get back to low-double digits once the economy recovers and housing starts growing. And when you look at that weighted average models there, you end up with about a 7% growth going forward. We just felt it's not appropriate to pull that out at this point because we are entering a period here where housing has been down.","Now, as Kevin said, China and the U.S. need each other. We've talked to a lot of consultants. I mean, there is a possibility this thing gets resolved at the G20. If it doesn't, I think the thought process is sometime early-to-mid next year it does get resolved. And so, we certainly think, as Kevin said, you have a growing middle class. You have the urbanization going on. You have household formation. And right now, the consumer is saving. We've got that from some of our banks because their confidence is down. But we do think, going forward, certainly a 7% or so once we get through this hiccup, if you will, is achievable \u2013 total company.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay then.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","And I would just add, again, our premium brand, our broad distribution, the innovation that we bring to market, as the economy turns around, we feel good that we can leverage those going forward into the future.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, just help me with the 4Q bridge. I think year-to-date, you're up 6.6%. You're saying 7% growth for the year. Maybe I'm confused with some of the moving pieces on currency. But how should we think about 4Q core growth rate in North America and China?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, so in North America, we would tell you we're forecasting the industry to be up over 150,000 sequentially. So, we didn't really talk about residential. But in our mind, what happened is July and August were kind of proceeding as we expected. And then, quite frankly, September was down quite a bit. And so, we think the quarter was down close to 125,000 units.","Now, when we look at October, we look at our order rate, we look at our shipments, sequentially we're getting back to where we thought we would be. So, we're forecasting the fourth quarter to be up about 50,000 to 75,000 over the prior year, but up 150,000 to 175,000 over the third quarter. So, I think that's \u2013 we'll certainly see health on both commercial and residential as we move to third quarter to fourth quarter.","Quite frankly, on China, we're forecasting it to be relatively flat, up a little bit year-over-year but that's \u2013 in the fourth quarter. That's really driven by the fact that you may recall last year's fourth quarter was up 25% almost from the prior year. So, we have a very difficult comp there. So, then water treatment continues to grow in the quarter. And Lochinvar we think will be sequentially relatively flat, but that's a good fourth quarter for them. So, I don't know if that helps.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah. That's perfect. And then, just last one on the inventory destocking. I mean, it seems like you're not going to make a whole lot of progress this year destocking. When do you think that destock, as you model it out, when do you think that destocking or what are you assuming when that destocking is kind of out of the way?","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","I think that primarily will be driven by the economy in its recovery. So, as we look at it, right now, we're continuing to drive some inventories down, use the promotions that we talked about in Q4. And again, as the economy returns, when that is, we're not 100% sure, but that will be the primary driver for us to drive some of our inventories down.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Scott, your line is now open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I just want to make sure I understood one of your statements there, John. Is this the official day when you, as a company, take down your 8% organic goal to 7%? Is that what you're saying?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I mean, Scott, what I said is we did the modeling and if China grows at 10%, what we certainly think is doable, then the growth model is 7%. And quite frankly when, from where we are, we think that's a reasonable objective, obviously. And you've talked about it in the past. You have law of large numbers. We now have a $1.1 billion business, so growing at 15% becomes difficult. And so I would tell you, as we look forward, once the China economy recovers, we think that 7% is achievable.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right. But then, I think you all \u2013 that's very helpful, John. Thank you. I think then I also heard you say that, in these sort of more turbulent times, be it some things going on in the U.S. which I want to ask you about as well as China, that your organic guidance for this year is kind of what you expect during that period. Is that, am I putting words in your mouth?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I'm not sure the question. So, this year, what we've said is 7%. And I think when we look at next year, organically in local currency, we're saying our best estimate, by the way it's preliminary, is 5.5% to 7% and then imputed in there is China growing at about 3%. And what we would think happens is China starts growing a little bit more as the year goes on next year as some of these trade issues become addressed.","I will tell you. We were all in China two weeks ago. And you don't have to do anything but pick up the paper and turn on the TV to see that there's discussions about the trade. And the consumer confidence levels we see are down. But again, if you look at China's 1.2 billion people, it's got a growing middle class and they say they're saving now instead of spending, that will turn. So, as we look into next year, China is not as much as the model but North America is more as we have the price increase, we have the addition of Lowe's and we think boilers continue to grow at 10%.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Got you. On North America, what I want to maybe triangulate toward is maybe some type of an idea on the volumes. It looks to me as if when we consider the pricing realizations that you're getting that the organic volumes were \u2013 in North America in total were sort of close to down low-single digit. And if that assumption is correct particularly on \u2013 well, frankly both sides, the water heater side which is just as replacement-oriented in commercial as it is in residential, why would we see a number that weak this quarter? Was there destocking in North America?","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","I would tell you that, when we looked at Q2, it was very strong. And then, as we got into Q3, as we talked about, it was much weaker. And what it indicated to us that there was a larger pre-buy than we anticipated. So, in Q3, we had an adjustment there. We were probably a bit too optimistic. But again, we had a really poor September. We see October coming out and rebounding very well.","And I will tell you, I've been in this industry about 30 years and there is always a difficulty in predicting how a price increase is going to be implemented and how it's going to be executed in which the balance between the quarters and this proved out to be very similar. But as you look at it going forward into Q4, we think that adjustment has been made. We look for solid growth in Q4 and any of the gap, I think we can attribute to a larger pre-buy than we initially thought.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","And I think the other thing, Scott, is we still are forecasting the industry to be up 250,000 to 300,000, and you're working with completions that are probably up 50,000. So, I mean, we're still having a strong industry for the year. When you talk about replacements being up 200,000, completions being up 50,000 plus because we're saying 250,000 to 300,000, so we- as Kevin said, we are probably a little optimistic as we saw in the first couple of quarters. But these volumes can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Charley Brady of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Charley, your line is open.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, guys and Pat.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I just \u2013 on China, on the margin in Q3, you commented you had some lower employee incentive. I see on the guidance you got out for 2019. Can you give us a sense, I mean, we've permanently taken some costs out of there because you obviously \u2013 the expansion rate has probably slowed or this was sort of a kind of a one-off aberration in Q3 that the margin really popped up there?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, so the way \u2013 Charley, what we looked at is China was fairly optimistic at the midyear point that they were going to be able to meet their objective, which would have called for bonus somewhat similar to the prior year. But as we got through the quarter \u2013 through the third quarter, it became obvious that they were not going to. So, there was an adjustment down at the accrual that they had made in the third quarter. I think you have to look at it kind of year-to-date, to kind of look at the margins, et cetera, because there was some benefit in the third quarter because of what we had booked in the first and second quarter.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Can you quantify what that reversal would have been? I guess, I'm trying to get to what a normalized \u2013 given the volume rate in Q3 in China, what a normalized margin would have been for Rest of World.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah. It was close to a $5 million reversal of the accrual, if you will. So where we stand now at the end of the third quarter is where you should be which is three quarters of what you expect to pay.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much. And I guess, on the \u2013 as we look to the U.S. market in water treatment, you've rolled out in the Lowe's, you commented there was some disruption there as you tried to ramp up capacity. Can you just expand upon that a little bit and where have sales been pushed from 3Q into 4Q or even into 2019?","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","The disruption that we talked about was we had to double our capacity at our Hague facility in Columbus. That \u2013 for the most part, the equipment came in. Everything was going according to plan. But we did have some labor issues up there. So, we were unable to really produce the quantity that we needed for Lowe's. We are \u2013 expect to be back on track but we're close to on track now. And we \u2013 you're looking at \u2013 as I mentioned in the remarks that we'll sell about $14 million to Lowe's, which we anticipated $14 million to $15 million. So, there'll be no disruption there. But there's one that it just took a little bit longer for us to ramp up and to get the inventory in the stores and into their distribution centers.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for that. And then, just continuing on the water track, that's an area, in terms of M&A perspective, you made a few acquisitions in there, you're kind of building up a platform, you got the Lowe's distribution. I mean, can you just talk about kind of opportunities you see \u2013 the additional opportunities you see in the water market in North America to make that a bigger piece of North America?","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","From \u2013 on the water treatment side, I think we've demonstrated that there are opportunities as we've entered this particular business segment. If you look back several years, we didn't even have a water treatment business. And through acquisitions in China and then recently with the acquisition of Aquasana and Hague, we've been building that portfolio. It certainly widens our lens for the ability to look for acquisitions that will complement the other parts of the business. So, the answer, is it our lenses is wider? Absolutely. I'll be continuing to look for opportunities that complement our business and also enhance our capabilities? The answer is yes. And we'll continue to look for those and we'll \u2013 again, we have to look for the right business, the right return and the right fit for our company. But certainly, there are opportunities out there for our business to expand in water treatment and to acquire additional companies going forward.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Halloran from Baird. Michael, your line is open.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Good morning.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","So, just one for me, back to the Rest of World margin questions. I certainly understand the dynamic around incentive comp. But as you look forward to next year and you guys see a lower growth rate, how does that impact your variable spending process? Because, obviously, a lot of the margin \u2013 lack of margin leverage in that segment has come from the magnitude of growth opportunities, promotional opportunities and all those things to drive the top line growth. Does that calculus change at all as you move into next year at a slower growth rate?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I mean, certainly, Mike, we're \u2013 for example, we're putting in a hiring freeze right now from an SG&A standpoint primarily. We're accelerating the closure of \u2013 our store closures, the nonproductive stores. And, yes, we are very \u2013 going to take a very hard look at our direct selling and our advertising budgets as we go into next year to rightsize it until the market recovers, which we expect it will.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks. That's what I needed. Appreciate it.","Operator","And your next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. David, your line is open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Hi. Good morning.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I'm just wondering, you may have covered this and I may have just missed it. But within the China water heaters, did you talk about units versus ASPs?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","I think they're pretty similar, Pat, right?","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yeah.","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Yes. The decline is pretty similar, yeah.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then, you talked a few points here in the call this morning about just the weaker consumer, the weaker sentiment, the weaker consumer confidence over there. I mean, I guess I'm not all that familiar with the Chinese consumer. But it seems like, in America when that happens, the consumer typically trades down. So, are you seeing them trade down over there? And if that's the case, I'm just wondering, does that bring you more in conflict with sort of mid-price point product and from a competitive standpoint, does this sort of mandate or require you to kind of extend your line structure down market and just adjust for that?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, I'd say we're not necessarily seeing trade-down, but I don't think you necessarily see the trade-up that you had been seeing. We've talked about in, on previous calls that especially on the online market, we're bringing out, I'll call them, some mid-priced products that are more in the sweet spot. I mean, what happened is, if you think of the, I'll call it the RMB 3,000 to RMB 5,000, we were in that spot for some of our category and then we raised prices a year ago and moved out of that category.","So now, we're bringing back some products to attack the high end of that market, which we think will help us from a sales next year. But I would say we haven't seen trading down. But I think, as you said, if consumer confidence wanes, you probably don't see them trading up. I think what we're really seeing is they're saving rather than spending. That's it, point.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Right. And just second question just if the 8% is now 7% and kind of the growth across the model maybe slowing here a little bit. As you think about kind of the next platform for growth, and it certainly sounds like there's a lot of potential in water treatment. Congratulations by the way on the progress with sort of the listings at Lowe's. But do you start looking at tankless water heaters a little differently now and start thinking about maybe making a bigger commitment to that category? Thanks.","Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp.","Well, tankless today, in the U.S., represents about 8% of the total market. And I would tell you that we have made a commitment to the tankless category and new products and in bringing them out both with rack systems on commercial and so forth. So, the way we look at it is we are in the hot water business. And so, we provide hot water solutions to our various customers in various channels. And tankless is a component of it, which is growing, and tank is also a component of it. And again, trying to provide the best solution for that consumer is our goal. Not so much guiding towards one technology or the other.","So overall, we'll continue to invest in tankless technology and bring new products out that we need to compete, as well as on the tank side of the business. So, for us again, I would go it's more of a solving a consumer's hot water issue rather than it is more from a tankless perspective because we look at both of those as products that we need to have to be competitive in the market long term.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And your final question comes from Alvaro Lacayo from Gabelli. Alvaro, your line is open.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Good morning. Just two questions. One, the small question I didn't quite hear what the growth rate for the quarter was for Lochinvar and separately for boilers. And then secondly, bigger picture, I wanted to hear some updated thoughts on how you guys are seeing the replacement cycle in residential water heaters in the U.S. and sort of how you're seeing it and how it's incorporated \u2013 in what level it's incorporated in the long-term growth rate that you guys are seeing, whether it be 7% or 8% or however you guys are seeing it shape up?","John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp.","So, Lochinvar for the quarter was a little bit of a mixed bag there. Condensing boilers did very well. They were up about 7% to 8%. Their non-condensing boilers were down year-over-year about $3 million and that maps directly to their China distributor whose sales were down $3 million compared to last year's third quarter, and we believe that was driven by tariffs. And then, when you look at the residential water heater \u2013 I mean, the water heater portion of the business, that was also down. So, they were up almost 2%. When we look at the full year and we look at the whole product portfolio of Lochinvar, we expect them to be up over 9% for the year.","The second question was kind of, how do we look at the water heater going forward? We've done a fair amount of modeling of water heater. I assume you're \u2013 what you're really talking about is the drop in the industry from 2007 to 2011. We've done a lot of modeling work and gotten some replacement data. And as we've talked in the past, the replacement is about 14 to 14.5 years. But it's a very elongated bell curve. It goes from 5 all the way out to plus-20. In fact, over half of them are replaced in over 15 years.","So, when we incorporate that and then you look at \u2013 so it's going to be spread over a wide period of time. And then, when you incorporate the housing stock, which is about 120 million houses and we're talking about an industry of 9.5 million units, we think that we'll be very muted at that. And BRG has some estimates of the water heater industry through 2021, and I think those estimates are 3-plus-percent. So, in that \u2013 when we were talking about the 7%, we think that 4% growth is very reasonable.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Ackerman.","Patricia K. Ackerman - A. O. Smith Corp.","Thank you very much for joining us today, and have a good day.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Pat Ackerman, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.","Patricia K. Ackerman","Thank you, Danielle. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2013 conference call. With me participating in the call are Paul Jones, Executive Chairman; Ajita Rajendra, Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we are providing non-GAAP measures including adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted segment operating earnings that exclude certain items, as well as non-operating pension costs consisting of interest costs, expected return on planned assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and curtailments. Prior year results are provided on a comparable basis.","Ajita, I will now turn the call over to you.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We continued to see the benefits in our performance from the housing recovery in the U.S. and our expanding consumer business in China. Here are a few highlights from a very strong quarter. Our organic growth drove sales 13% higher to $549 million. Sales of A. O. Smith branded products in China grew 35%. Our adjusted earnings of $0.52 per share were 33% higher than the $0.39 per share recorded last year. Incremental margins associated with higher volumes of water heaters and boilers were the key drivers of the higher earnings.","Based on our solid performance, strong balance sheet, and expected 2013 free cash flow of approximately $100 million, our board increased the allocation of shares available for repurchase by 2 million shares.","John will now describe our results in more detail.","John J. Kita","Thank you, Ajita. Sales in the second quarter of $549 million were 13% higher than the previous year, driven by higher volumes of residential water heaters in the U.S. and higher sales of A. O. Smith branded products in China. Adjusted earnings of $48 million improved 34% from our second quarter performance last year. As previously announced, we transferred the majority of our residential water heater production from our Fergus, Ontario plant to other North American facilities during the second quarter. As a result of the capacity rationalization, we incurred a pretax restructuring and impairment charge of $4.2 million in the second quarter related to employee severance costs and impairment of assets. Additional restructuring charges related to equipment relocation costs are expected to total approximately $2.5 million for the remainder of the year. We project net pretax savings of $3 million to $4 million in 2013 and approximately $10 million in 2014.","Adjusted earnings in 2013 excluded after-tax non-operating pension costs of $3 million, and after-tax restructuring and impairment costs of $3.1 million. Adjusted earnings in 2012 excluded after-tax pension costs of $1 million. Adjusted earnings of $0.52 per share improved 33% compared with $0.39 per share last year. Adjusted EPS in the current period excluded non-operating pension costs of $0.03 per share, and restructuring costs of $0.04 per share. Adjusted EPS in 2012 excluded non-operating pension costs of $0.01 per share.","Sales in our North American segment of $389 million increased 6% over last year. This segment includes our U.S. and Canadian water heater and boiler operations. Higher volumes of residential water heaters in the U.S., as well as higher boiler volumes more than offset lower volumes of commercial water heaters in the U.S.","The results for our China, India and European water heating businesses and our water treatment business in Asia are captured in our Rest of World segment. Segment sales of $170 million increased 33% compared with last year, driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products in China.","We are encouraged by the market acceptance of our newer A. O. Smith branded products in China. We continue to innovate our product lines with features and benefits which provide value to our customers and differentiate our brand. We introduced our eighth upgrade to our electric water heater offering in the second quarter and the products have been well received. Other recent innovations include an ultra-quiet gas tankless water heater product line and water treatment products which have longer-lasting filters and waste less water. The return on our investment in engineering and innovation is one of the success factors of our business in China.","North American adjusted operating earnings of $63 million were 20% higher and adjusted operating margin of 16.1% was 1.8 percentage points higher than last year. Improved performance was due to higher incremental margins associated with increased volumes of water heaters and boilers in the U.S., as well as improved pricing associated with a price increase effective in the second quarter of last year and lower material costs. Rest of World adjusted operating earnings of $22 million improved 82% compared with last year. Higher sales and improved mix of A. O. Smith branded projects in China and smaller losses at our non-A. O. Smith branded water treatment business drove operating margins higher.","Our adjusted corporate expenses were $13.3 million, an increase from the prior year primarily due to lower interest income, as well as expenses related to our acquisition activity and higher stock-based compensation costs related to shorter amortization periods.","Cash provided by continuing operations was $106 million in the first half of 2013 compared with $30 million last year, primarily driven by higher earnings from operations, and a smaller investment in working capital. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio declined to 14%. We have sizable cash balances located offshore and our net cash position was over $250 million at the end of the second quarter.","We project our cash flow from continuing operations for 2013 to be between $240 million and $260 million. Our capital expenditures are expected to be $80 million to $90 million, which includes approximately $40 million for capacity expansion in China and India to meet growing demand for our water heaters in those regions. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be between $55 million and $60 million this year.","I will now turn the call back to Ajita who will summarize our outlook and acquisition strategy. Ajita?","Ajita G. Rajendra","Thanks, John. Our outlook for 2013 includes the following assumptions. First, we expect that sales growth of A. O. Smith branded products in China will be approximately 18% in 2013, largely driven by products with new features and benefits that provide incremental value to our customers. We also have seen a positive impact in sales coming from online purchases, and we expect online sales to more than double in 2013 from $5 million last year. You can infer from our 18% revenue growth assumption for the year, that we expect our growth in China will slow to low-double digits in the second half of the year. We believe that tighter housing regulations implemented earlier this year will have the government's desired impact and slow new home occupancy. And we also have a difficult year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter due to record fourth quarter sales in 2012.","Second, we expect our Lochinvar brand to continue to benefit from the transition from lower efficiency, non-condensing boilers to higher efficiency condensing boilers. Lochinvar branded condensing boilers continue to offer a compelling payback in the form of energy savings, and we have built a reputation for innovation and product quality. As a result, we expect Lochinvar branded sales to grow 10% in 2013, well ahead of GDP growth in the U.S.","Third, we are cautiously optimistic about the developing recovery in the U.S. housing and the overall economy in the U.S. We expect residential water heater volumes in the U.S. to be 400,000 units higher than last year, based on an increase in housing completions, as well as in replacement units. Even though the industry experienced strong commercial volumes in the first half of 2013, which we believe was partially due to a pre-buy related to a Northern California regulatory change, we expect commercial volumes to be up about 4% for the full year.","Our outlook for the U.S. water heater business has improved from 3 months ago, and based on that, we have increased our 2013 adjusted EPS guidance to be between $1.84 and $1.90 per share. The midpoint of our new range represents a 20% increase over 2012 adjusted EPS of $1.56 per share.","This guidance does not include the restructuring and impairment expenses associated with the planned rationalization, the settlement with a former supplier, non-operating pension costs or future acquisitions.","Our GAAP EPS guidance is now expected to be $1.62 to $1.68 per share due to the impact from the restructuring and impairment expenses, partially offset by the settlement income, neither of which were in our GAAP guidance at the beginning of the year.","Strong performance in our North American segment also prompted us to update our high-level 2015 aspirations for our organic business. Based on our expectations for EBIT margins driven by new construction and 10% revenue growth in our Lochinvar branded products through 2015, we are reviving our North American segment margin expectation to approximately 15.5% from the previously recorded 14.5%.","This revision incorporates expenses related to the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning system of approximately $11 million in 2015. Expenses related to the ERP system are projected to be approximately $5 million this year and $15 million in 2014. We expect significant benefits from the system after its planned implementation is completed in North America by late 2015.","We continue to expect organic growth of 7% per year through 2015, resulting in revenues of $2.4 billion to $2.45 billion. Our Rest of World segment margin expectation continues to be 13% by 2015. Our earnings aspirations for our existing portfolio of businesses are now expected to be approximately $2.25 per share by 2015 versus the previously disclosed $2.15 per share.","As you can see, this continues to be an exciting and transformative time for our company. We have cash and borrowing capacity for additional acquisitions, and our pipeline of acquisitions supporting our stated growth strategy to expand our global footprint in water heating and water treatment solution is active. Based on our core competencies, our strategic focus for growth is simple: hot water and clean water. We are pursuing actionable acquisitions in these 2 areas around the world. We are also pursuing acquisitions which expand our core product lines. We are particularly keen on products and technologies that offer energy and water efficiency gains. And finally, we are considering water-related adjacencies which can leverage our distribution, water heating know-how and brand to provide value to our shareholders.","We expect our businesses to generate approximately $100 million of free cash flow in 2013. As a result, our board increased our authorization to repurchase shares resulting in approximately 2.5 million shares available. We may repurchase shares through a combination of opportunistic open market purchases, stock trades and 10b5-1 automatic trading plans. We believe our free cash flow borrowing capacity and existing cash of over $450 million are adequate to support the repurchase program, as well as our active acquisition strategy.","You have seen this last chart before, we show this only as a reminder that we will be a financially disciplined acquirer. You should know that while we came close to completing a handful of acquisitions over the past 12 months, we have walked away for various reasons. In the end, we held fast to our financial criteria. Our transactions will be focused on value creation and creating returns for our shareholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we are open for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Charley Brady from BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just want to clarify on the China growth. Your comments here, when you mentioned A. O. Smith branded products, I mean, there's not a meaningful percentage of non-A. O. Smith, right? I mean, there's nothing into that wording?","John J. Kita","Well, we've been consistently using that, Charley, for about the last year. What we're excluding is the small piece of non-branded water treatment business, primarily, is what's being excluded from that.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Has the water treatment business in China, is that above breakeven now?","John J. Kita","On a total basis, it's approaching breakeven. I mean, we had a great quarter in the A. O. Smith branded piece that more than doubled year-over-year, and the sales were over $10 million in the quarter. So it's a -- it had a great quarter, the new products seem to be catching hold.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The 35% growth in China is pretty robust growth. And I'm guessing -- and obviously, it's not being repeated in the second half. I'm just trying to understand, I mean what -- that was pretty outsized growth. Was it a function of new product introductions, so we're stocking the channel? Or exactly, what drove such a strong performance in China?","John J. Kita","I mean, it was across the board. We brought out the new series 8 electric, that was very, very well received. Our super quiet instantaneous product has been extremely well received. As I said previously, our water treatments sit very well during the quarter. And then even some of our energy efficient like heat pump, which is coming off a small base was up significantly. So it was really across the board. But a lot of it was driven by new products. There might have been some stocking of inventory, the best we can tell it wasn't significant, but bringing out the new series 8, there certainly could have been some. But no, it was a fantastic quarter.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And just one more, I'll hop back in the queue. On the -- in North America, $3.6 million non-operating pension costs, is that -- does that continue into the second half?","John J. Kita","Yes, that's -- we talked about that at the beginning of the year, and that's what we said it was -- the run rate for the year would be, so pension costs were up about $17 million year-over-year, and we talked about why, but yes, we would expect that'll be the same number over the last half of the year, each quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","First and foremost, I was wondering, given the volatility in the underlying commodity prices that we've seen, have -- has the company been able to capitalize on this given its strong balance sheet?","John J. Kita","From what standpoint, I'm not sure the question...","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Have you been able to utilize, say, forward contracts and lock in some prices in copper and steel?","John J. Kita","Well, the whole problem is, there is not a very liquid market in steel. Copper, we're a small user of it, so yes, we do have a few forward contracts. We've explored looking at steel contracts, but it's still in its infancy. And because the markets are not very liquid, the pricing isn't very efficient, but we continue to look at that.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Right. Okay. Now some of the other industrials companies that I cover do perform some steel activity. Let's go to the boilers, if I may. Can you give us the contribution for Lochinvar for the quarter?","John J. Kita","Well, we don't separate out that. But I will say that Lochinvar has exceeded the 10% growth year-to-date, and their margins are up year-over-year. So the new products they brought out, which we haven't talked about in update, they brought out a larger craft condensing boiler last year. They have expanded that up to 5 million BTU. That's been very well received in the marketplace. So that's contributing to their very nice growth.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","How's Lochinvar's bookings or backlog look at this time?","John J. Kita","Well, the backlog looks strong and what it should be at this time of the year. Overall, the Lochinvar acquisition is meeting or beating expectations. And it's right on track for our 2015 expectation.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Very nice. And then just one housekeeping, if I may. On the corporate expense line, $14.5 million, a little higher than what I was anticipating. Can you tell me if there was some onetime items in there that I might have missed? Or what's a good run rate going forward?","John J. Kita","Well, I think that a good run rate is $12 million to $12.5 million a quarter. We talked about in the notes here that we did have some, I'll call them, onetime or unusual related to acquisition activity that was relatively sizable in the quarter. But I think a reasonable run rate is that $12 million to $12.5 million.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","And same question on the tax rate going forward.","John J. Kita","Yes, I think a tax rate of 31% plus or minus is a reasonable rate.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So I was wondering, you had positive pricing in this quarter. And with steel maybe starting to turn the corner a little bit, I was wondering if that -- if pricing -- I know you're anniversary-ing the year ago. But is a price increase now back on the table in the markets? Have you guys in the next...","Ajita G. Rajendra","This is Ajita. When it comes to pricing, you know that we don't really talk about anything that going forward. And over time, we've been able to balance out commodity prices with pricing in the marketplace, there are ups and downs. But over time, it balances out.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Well, fair enough. And then from what I'm -- if we would have not increased prices from here, it would seem that with the anniversary-ing of the price, that pricing essentially should be neutral in the second half, right?","Ajita G. Rajendra","I can't really comment anymore on prices, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Fair enough, fair enough. I wanted to ask about the acquisition pipeline. And obviously, it's now been 2 years and counting since we've had something of size. I know you walked away from a number of deals. Would you -- with the share repurchase being increased I'm just kind of wondering, is that a signal that you continue to be, maybe, frustrated with some of the pricing that's out there?","Ajita G. Rajendra","No. I think that we continue to look for acquisitions that fit our strategy. And it goes back to the fact that we are going to be very disciplined in terms of the financial and strategic criteria that we put out, and we're not going to compromise on it. And we've looked -- it's active, we are looking, you can see by some of the increase in corporate expenses that we've gone quite far down the line on some of them. But if it didn't seem right, feel right, and didn't fit strategically, we walked away from it. So it doesn't change anything from a strategic viewpoint, our outlook viewpoint, in terms of how acquisitions fit into our long-term strategy.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Of course. Okay, 2 others. Could you give us same-store sales in Tier 1, 2 and 3? At least give us some color on that for China?","John J. Kita","Same-store sales for both were up very nicely, both Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3. So that continues to be pretty much across-the-board. It was not in any specific region per se.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And last question probably also for you, John. What have been the ERP expenses in the first half of the year, and with the $5 million for '13 and $15 million for '14, when would we start to be able to exact some type of a return on that?","John J. Kita","Well, as we said in there, we expect -- we've incurred about $2 million in the first half of the year, so $2 million, first half or so on, and $3 million in the second half of the year. 2014 will be the largest year because that's when we'll be starting the implementations, et cetera. We expect to start, as we talked about in the press release, getting benefits late 2015, but at a run rate, annual run rate, in 2016. North America, we expect to have down late in 2015.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sanjay Shrestha from Lazard Capital Markets.","Aditya Satghare - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","It's Aditya Satghare here. Two questions. First, just a follow-up on China here. How should we think about the benefit from the store footprint optimization so far this year?","John J. Kita","Well, we mentioned that we expect the stores to be in the 5,000 to 5,500 range. They were up a little bit in the second quarter as we opened some in Tier 2 and Tier 3, more Tier 2 and Tier 3. I think we are seeing some benefits as we talked about late last year when some of the inefficient stores were being closed either by us or by our partners. So I think that has provided some value. And again, we -- both us and our partners continue to look at that very closely to make sure the stores make sense.","Aditya Satghare - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Got it. And the second question is on the Lochinvar. So how -- I mean, can you sort of give us some more color on the potential to take the Lochinvar product line outside the U.S. and into particularly China, right? And give us any update on the potential in that market?","Ajita G. Rajendra","The potential to take that product to China is very high. It's going to take some time. The market really hasn't developed in terms of import those types of products. But it's happening. And like anything else in China, it's happening at a very fast pace. So we expect that there'll be a low level of sales later this year going into the first quarter of next year starting out. And for it to start increasing from there. So it's going to take time to build up, but certainly, long-term, there's tremendous potential for that product line and those types of products in China.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Summerville from KeyBanc.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Couple of questions. Just, John, another one on the share repurchase. Is the objective simply to offset incentive comp-related stuff from options, et cetera, or is the objective to lower the share count over time?","John J. Kita","I'd say it's a combination. We've said that we will, at the minimum, buy back the comp-related, et cetera. But also, in this situation there's an opportunity as we look out over a period of time to reduce the share count. So I think that it could be a combination of both, but we've said, at a minimum, there will be the incentive-related.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just with this ERP, the numbers that you shared with us, John, is that what you're budgeting or what you actually expect to incur from an expense standpoint? I've never seen a company-wide ERP implementation that's been anywhere near budget.","John J. Kita","Well, that's the expense portion of it. We obviously have a capital portion of it also. And that, also, will be in our numbers obviously. So we spent some time with our systems integrator, and we know what you're saying, but our intent is going to be to come on budget.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So how much of the system costs will end up getting capitalized then?","John J. Kita","Well, traditionally, it's about 50% to 60%, and we think that'll be the case here.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then you mentioned launching, I believe in Q2, the series 8 electric wall-hung product. What is the ASP differential on that versus the seventh generation?","John J. Kita","My understanding is, it was up about 5%.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And help me understand. So the 8 comes out, there is some level of sell-in to the channel. What happens with the series 7 that are already on the shelves? And I -- help explain how that shift occurs and who ends up, at the end of the day, paying for it?","Ajita G. Rajendra","What -- this is Ajita. It's kind of a running transition. We don't bring back inventory. It's a running transition that happens at retail where when they run out of series 7, they go into series 8, and they have promotions behind it, et cetera. The other thing that we are now doing much more of is using the older models for our Internet sales. So that, that way we balance out and make sure that we can have a very robust online business that doesn't interfere with our retail business. And so that's another area which we are balancing out and utilizing the older models to manage.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then with respect to Tier 1, 2 versus 3, 4, however, you bucket it. How would you describe same-store units, not same-store revenue, but same-store units?","John J. Kita","Both were up, units.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you give any more granularity there, were unit volumes up...","John J. Kita","No. We really haven't gotten into unit basis because there's so much price mix-type issues. So we've been pretty much talking about dollars, if you will. But units were up at both locations.","Ajita G. Rajendra","But I think one thing we can say is that, latter part of last year, and last year, we saw the major cities slow down. Now the major cities are coming back up and we are seeing the growth across the board in the large cities also, the mega cities like Beijing and Shanghai.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And that sort of gets to my question, Ajita, what would you attribute that shift or that re-acceleration to? Is it simply your product refresh or are you seeing household formations accelerate, consumer sentiment accelerate upwards? Help me understand what has caused that transition.","Ajita G. Rajendra","I think it's, as John said earlier, it's a combination of all those reasons that he mentioned. The new products, our product set, the market, people feeling a little better, part of it. I think that there was a certain amount government -- the government brought in restrictions in housing at the end of last year. And so there was a little bit of a peak in terms of buying at the end of last year. So as people get in, that would have pushed some volume into the first quarter of this year because there was a higher level of activity of people actually buying apartments to get ahead of those restrictions and regulations. So I think it's a combination of all those things that have made the market pretty strong in the first half.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And those restrictions kick in when, Ajita?","John J. Kita","Well, the restrictions were early this year. And in fact, and what we've been told is the decorating aspect normally trails 3 to 6 months after the actual closing, if you will. And so that's -- the comment our people have made to us is certainly the second quarter was helped by that. Clearly though, it's also being helped by the higher price associated with some of the new products. I mean, whether it's series 8, whether it's the super quiet that carries a fairly decent premium, or whether it's the water treatment products that are out there. They all carry higher selling prices, if you will, than their predecessors.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful color. Where are you guys right now in terms of store count? And what is the net add\/closure target for the year?","John J. Kita","We're at -- we have said we'll be about between 5,000 and 5,500. We're about 5,450 at the end of the second quarter. I think that's a plus of a couple of hundred units, I think, for the year. And again, those are primarily Tier 2 and Tier 3. We would expect to be in that range. So 5,000 to 5,500.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then with -- John, with interest rates moving up, what is the funded status of your pension at the end of the second quarter?","John J. Kita","At the end of the second quarter, our best estimate is we've moved nicely from about low 80s to about 90% funded at the end of the second quarter. So as we've talked, we have a glide path in place. And we've done some things to de-risk a little bit, if you will. But there's been a big improvement over the first half of the year.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just, sorry, one more question. You mentioned $100 million free cash flow. You have $240 million to $260 million operating, $85 million or $90 million, whatever the number is, in CapEx. How does that math work, am I missing something?","John J. Kita","No. We have dividends. We take out dividends. We have some share repurchases...","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, so that's free cash -- all right, that's free cash after dividends and share buyback. I got it. Okay, perfect.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Rose from Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I think most of my questions have been answered, but maybe just a couple last ones. Is it possible to bucket some of the margin improvement in North America business by price mix and raw materials?","John J. Kita","I'm sorry. I didn't see the first part of it.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","If you can bucket the margin improvement that...","John J. Kita","No. We normally don't disclose that information.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, I know it's not something you just...","John J. Kita","All 3 were certainly contributors and relatively comparable.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So John, I know it's not something you disclose often. But if you can provide a little bit of color in terms of what expectations should be on a go-forward basis with steel prices and how we should think about the offset. Typically, there isn't an offset when steel prices go down that passes on. So you don't always get the gain immediately or the hit immediately. So how should we think about that falling through in the next couple of quarters?","John J. Kita","I won't be specific on steel, but I'll say traditionally, if you look at the commercial market and the residential market, it's traditionally about 52% to 53% first half of the year, 47% to 48% the second half of the year. And that's been pretty consistent over the last 7 years. And you look at -- much of that is affected in the third quarter. So I mean, as we would expect and historically, the third quarter margins get impacted by volume. There's been a slight increase in steel, so it could be affected by that also. But that's what our expectations would be.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And your tone going into Q2 was, as always, fairly conservative. And so there are some, I think, pleasant surprises in the margin side. I think one of the issues you had addressed in terms of potential headwinds was some operating inefficiencies in the closure of the Canadian operations. Did you see that -- those inefficiencies in the quarter?","John J. Kita","We had some, but not as high as expected. Both our Canadian and our U.S. plants performed better than what we would have expected, so we did have some inefficiencies but not as much as expected.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And anything else operationally that exceeded your targets, better cost or quality, some other metrics that you can provide for us?","John J. Kita","No. But I'll say that the operations are performing very well. And what we've consistently said that incremental volume is going to be very beneficial to us. And we saw the first 2 quarters of 2013 were the highest quarters we've seen since 2008. And so I think it kind of supports what we've been saying as we get help from the housing recovery and commercial construction, those will be beneficial and we saw that in the first half of the year.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And then last. I'm assuming that the mix shift impact or the pull-forward in the commercial boilers wasn't as significant as you had thought?","John J. Kita","I'm not sure how to answer that. I'll say that the commercial market's been interesting. The April numbers were very good. May and June numbers are up, not out; but our May was pretty good. But our June was lower, and significantly lower than the prior year because basically, last year's June was the highest month of the whole year. So we've talked about we get some of this lumpiness, if you will, month-by-month. But we -- so June was lower, not necessarily lower than expectations, but it was lower.","Operator","And our next question comes from Samuel Eisner from Goldman Sachs.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I have a couple of questions again on the -- just the pre-buy that you guys called out. Is there a way to kind of parse out how much the benefit was, say, in the second quarter and also in the first quarter? And in particular on the margin line, how much of a mix benefit you got from the pre-buy?","John J. Kita","Well, we certainly, we talked about -- you're talking about the pre-buy associated with Northern California, I assume?","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes.","John J. Kita","Yes. We certainly saw that benefit in the first quarter. We had estimated the industry units, I think, were up 4,000, 5,000 units, so we estimated half of that was associated with the pre-buy. That certainly helped us in the second and the first quarter. And it was not a significant effect I don't think on really the second quarter.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then in China, you mentioned that store openings are running a little bit faster than I think you were anticipating. Are the new stores that are being opened in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, are those stores being opened by Suning and Gome, or those some your specialty stores? Just help me understand a little bit, who is actually building these new stores?","John J. Kita","I think the net increase was primarily our specialty stores, primarily. Suning and Gome are kind of floating, they've been closing some and opening some for a net, not much but increase. But I think for the most part, it's been specialty stores. And we've said one of the advantages to us is we have a much smaller footprint. We can much easier open it up in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities than our partners who have to build a 5- or 6-store operation, if you will.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. No, that's definitely helpful. And then just lastly, in terms of the guide here, so if I look at the second half, basically you guys are flat for the second half over last year. So I'm just curious if you can maybe just go through a walk there. That kind of help me understand for the second half of '13 versus second half of '12, is everything just the same or are there some puts and takes there that are different, just help me understand that a little better.","John J. Kita","Well, I would say we're up a little bit from last year's second half. And certainly, the first half was a great first half, helped by volume. And we're stepping back and taking a look. I mean, there's some potential headwinds that we're trying to understand with respect to the housing recovery. Obviously, recent housing starts weren't great, interest rates up. So -- I mean, we're taking a relatively positive view. I think last year's second half was about $0.82 or $0.83. And right now, our midpoint would be about $0.87. So again, there's some potential headwinds we're just stepping back and taking a look at. But obviously we've just had a great first half of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Kelly from Sidoti.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","You talked about a lot of the success in China being related to new product growth. Could you put a number or a percentage contribution from new products this quarter?","John J. Kita","I really can't. I don't really have that data. But obviously, that was a big benefit, is that the 4 major areas where we saw growth were in electric, wall-hung and that clearly benefited from the series 8. The instantaneous side was up significantly and I can tell you the super quiet was a big component of that. The water treatment, as I said, more than doubled and a big component of that was -- that's the combination, I think. The marketplace is much more accepting, understanding now the need for water treatment. But also, we have a unique distinct product which I think has been very well received. So I can't give you a number, but clearly, those 3 were big contributors.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. Was it a quarter of your growth, half of your growth? Any help as far as the percentage.","John J. Kita","I just really don't know. Okay. We don't break it down that way, so I can't really.","Ajita G. Rajendra","And part of it is because, introducing new products and the new products replacing the older products, that's the normal cycle of doing business in China in the consumer business. So it's not -- so the frequent introduction of new products usually with features and benefits that command a higher price is the norm, in terms of business. So the new products come in, they essentially replace the old products and depending on what we add to the new products, they are usually at higher prices.","John J. Kita","So when we came out with new features, for example, on the electric series 8 new features and new cosmetics, and we're able to have a price increase associated with that. And as Ajita said, that's been the norm, how we've been operating for the last 10 years in that country.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Great. Any idea after 2Q, after the product launches, what your share in China is?","John J. Kita","We're forecasting about 25%, so we've seen some share increase.","Robert J. Kelly - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Great. And just one final one. You talked about the strength in North America. Where are you at utilization-wise in North America?","John J. Kita","We still have significant capacity. You have an industry that in 2006 was 9.6 million units. This year, it's going to be, we're estimating 8.4 million units, so there's still certainly a reasonable capacity. But it's time for us to have to...","Ajita G. Rajendra","And part of what we've been doing during that time is, as you've seen, we've maintained our margins during the time when the volume has dropped. And we've been working really hard at making sure we are improving our processes and becoming really efficient. And you can see the impact of that with the incremental volume which is coming at a very healthy margin.","Operator","And our next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Yes. Just 2 quick follow-ups. In terms of Lochinvar, deploying it in China, what is sort of like the ramp-up of installing that type of unit there? There was a huge ramp up here domestically in terms of the underlying certifications to get installed for that type of component here. Is it going to take longer there? And my second question is an update on India. Just given the volatility of the rupee and what you're seeing there, I do realize the CapEx going forward, but if you could give us some color on how things are progressing there as well?","Ajita G. Rajendra","I think it's going to be -- the ramp-up in China is going to be slow. Like I said that the -- this is the Lochinvar product. It's going to take a while for the product to build up and for the market to be really accepting of this type of product.","John J. Kita","And as we've kind of said, we have to put the infrastructure in place to be able to train, install, aftermarket, et cetera. And also we talked about the licensing requirements there are a little more strict than they are other places. So that's taking a little longer than we expected. But as Ajita said earlier, and we have to bring in new product, a new idea to the marketplace. But they're certainly interested in energy efficiency and we think down the road, it'll be a plus.","Ajita G. Rajendra","The longer term potential is certainly there; it's going to take some time to build up. India on the other hand, the devaluation of the rupee is certainly hurting us. The economy isn't as robust as we had expected. But from a unit volume viewpoint, the business is growing and we are very happy with the growth that they're seeing there.","John J. Kita","And as we have said, Bill, 80% of sales are in the second half of the year, so kind of stay tuned.","Operator","And I am showing no further questions.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Patricia Ackerman, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please proceed.","Patricia Ackerman","Thank you, James. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on our 2017 third results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning\u2019s press release.","Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Ajita, who will begin his remarks on Slide 3.","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. A double digit sales growth in the third quarter was driven by continued strong demand for our consumer products in China and positive end markets for our boilers and residential water heaters in North America.","Here are few highlights. Sales grew 10% to $750 million. Currency fluctuations had a negligible impact to sales in the third quarter. China sales were up nearly 13%. A. O. Smith branded water treatment sales grew 31% year-to-date and air purification product revenue doubled.","So record setting earnings at $0.54 per share were 15% higher than our third quarter earnings per share in 2016. We are delighted to work on the Hague team to the A. O. Smith family, through our acquisition of the U.S. based water softener company in early September. Hague fits squarely in our acquisition strategy to grow our global water treatment platform. We are excited about the global opportunities, Hague's innovative and high quality products bring us as well as Hague\u2019s experience water quality dealer network.","We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion of our cash to return to shareholders. Through the first nine months of 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares for $103 million. We announced a 17% increase to our dividend earlier this year. The five year compound annual growth rate of our dividend is over 25%.","A. O. Smith joined the S&P 500 Index in July. We are honored to join this prestigious group of U.S. Company. Our inclusion is a significant milestone in our company\u2019s rich 143 year history.","John will now describe our results in more details beginning with Slide number 4.","John Kita","Sales for the third quarter of $750 million were 10% higher than the previous year. Net earnings in the third quarter of $94 million increased 13% from 2016. Third quarter earnings per share of $0.54 increased 15% compared to 2016. Sales in our North America segment of $486 million increased 8% compared to the third quarter of 2016.","The increase in sales was primarily due to increase sales of boilers, higher volumes of residential water heaters and pricing actions related to steel cost increases.","North American water treatment sales comprised with weaker Hague as well as full quarter of Aquasana incrementally added approximately 8 million to our North America segment sales.","Rest of world segment sales of $270 million increased 12% compared with 2016. China sales increased 13%, driven by higher demand for our consumer products in the region, led by water treatment and air purification products, and pricing actions primarily due to higher steel and installation cost.","On Slide 6, North America operating earnings of $110 million were 10% higher than segment earnings in the prior year. The same from higher sales of boilers and residential water heaters and the pricing action in the U.S. were partially offset by higher steel cost. These factors drove third quarter 2017 segment margins higher to 22.7% compared with 22.3% last year.","Rest of world earnings of $34 million improved 9% compared with one year ago. Higher China sales including pricing action were partially offset by higher steel cost, higher fees paid to installers and increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Cost associated with the expansion of retail outlets in tier two and tier three cities had sell the company\u2019s water treatment and air purification products and higher water treatment product development engineering parts was primary dives the higher SG&A in China.","Third quarter segment margin was 4.5% compared to 4.9% last year due to these factors. Our corporate expenses were lower than one year ago. Our effected income tax rate in the third quarter 2017 was 28.8%, the rate was more than the 20.7% experienced during the third quarter last year, primarily due to lower state income taxes.","The lower effective tax rate compared with the effective rate a year ago benefited 2017 results by $0.01 per share.","Cash provided by operations during the first nine months of 2017 was $150 million compared with $264 million provided during the prior year. Higher earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remain strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 21% at the end of the third quarter. We have cash balances totaling $768 million located offshore, and our net cash position was approximately $318 million at the end of the quarter.","We completed the acquisition of Hague, a U.S. based water softener company during third quarter for $44.5 million plus a potential earn out of up to $2 million. Primarily, as a result of continued strong cash flow and escalating PBGC premiums, we made a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of $30 million in the third quarter. The after-tax impact to our cash flow is approximately $18 million.","During the first nine months of 2017, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock for total of $103 million. Approximately 3 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of September.","This morning, we increased the mid-point of our 2017 EPS guidance by $0.04 per share with the range of between $2.12 and $2.14 per share. The mid-point of our EPS guidance represents at 15% increase in EPS compared with our 2016 results. ","Please turn to Slide 9 for several 2017 options. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2017 to be approximately $325 million, which is lower than the $447 million generated in 2016. We expect higher earnings in 2017 but also larger outlays for working capital due to the higher than anticipated cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Over the two-year period from 2016 to 2017, we expect to generate operating cash flow of approximately $775 million, which compares with $612 million during 2014 to 2015. We programmed in 2016 on a construction of a new water treatment and air purification manufacturing facility in Nanjing to support the strong growth of these products in China. Our 2017 capital spending plans of approximately $100 million include $38 million related to this plant.","Total cost for the facility, which is expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2018 will be about $67 million. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2017.","As previously discussed, expenses related to our ERP implementation were $25 million in 2016, and are projected to decline to approximately $18 million in 2017.","Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $47 million in 2017, slightly higher than the $45 million in 2016, primarily due to higher expenses that our Corporate Technology Center and commissioned water treatment market studies.","Take note that our interest expense will be approximately $3 million higher in 2017 as a result of higher rates, share repurchase activities and our acquisition of Aquasana and Hague. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 28% in 2017, lower than the 29.4% rate in 2016, primarily due to lower state income taxes.","The President\u2019s recently proposed tax plan and by Tax Reform Act to top of mind. We believe A. O. Smith could benefit significantly from cash reform. Approximately 60% to 65% of our total profits are derived in the U.S. We estimate the net impact form the combination of the proposed lower federal tax rate of 20%, the elimination of the manufactures tax credit and the smaller federal benefit from our state tax deduction would result in an approximately 40 million less federal income tax or over $0.20 per share based on 2017 earnings.","Depending on the final tax reform plan, we couldn\u2019t hear one-time income tax expense associated with the repaid creation and measurement of differed taxes. We expect to repurchase our shares in the amount of approximately 135 million in 2017, under a 10b5-1 plan. We expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2017 will be approximately $174.6 million.","I will now turn the call back to Ajita who will summarize our guidance, the business assumptions for 2017, and our growth strategy beginning on Slide 10. Ajita?","Ajita Rajendra","Thank you, John. We project revenue growth to be between 11% to 12% for the year. We expect Aquasana and Hague sales could be nearly $60 million this year and slightly accretive to earnings. Aquasana sales were up nearly 18% in the first nine months of this year compared to last year.","Including North America water filter and softener sales, we expected on global, water treatment product sales will be approximately $300 million in 2017.","We project full year depreciation of the Chinese currency will be 2% from 2016, resulting in a $20 million headwind to sales.","Specific to our North America segment, we project U.S. residential water heater industry volume will increase over 300,000 units in 2017 due to new construction and expansion of replacement demand. This assumption includes tankless units.","We project U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes will be approximately 10% higher this year, primarily due to strong demand for electric units as well as an anticipated pre-buy in advance of regulatory change driven price increase effective January 1.","Lochinvar branded products grew 17% in the third quarter and 9% in the first nine months of 2017, driven by solid demand for boilers and new product related market share gain. We expect the total portfolio of Lochinvar branded products to grow over 8% in 2017.","As a result of rising steel costs, we increased prices by approximately 4% on the majority of our U.S. water heater products effective in late August. These factors lead us to expect our North American segment operating margin to be similar to 2016 margin of 22.1%, despite a 40 basis point headwind to operating margin from North America water treatment.","Specific to our rest of world segment, our China sales grew 13% in the third quarter and we expect over 15% growth in local currency for the full year. We expect improved profitability in India due to scale in our water heater business. ","We expect improvement in China margins in the fourth quarter resulting in full year margin of approximately 15% and flat to last year. As a result, we now expect rest of world segment operating margins will be similar to last year.","Our total company organic growth model continues to assume 8% growth for the foreseeable future. Especially in these uncertain economic times, we believe our organic growth potential and our stable defensive replacement markets which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes positively differentiates A. O. Smith amongst other industrial companies. ","Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisition that adds shareholder value, as well as allow us to return cash to shareholder.","That concludes our prepared remarks and now we are available for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matt Summerville from Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open.","Matt Summerville","Thanks, good morning. I want to ask you a couple questions on China. You mentioned some year-to-date numbers in treatment and purification, I was wondering if you could give a little more detail specific to the third quarter how those products performed and then what your outlook is for the full year while also commenting on the performance in the legacy water heater business in China during Q3? Thank you.","John Kita","So, water treatment was up about 13% in the quarter and it\u2019s up in local currency year-to-date about 35%. And we would expect for the year is going to be after that range of 30 or so in local currency. Air purification was up 75% in the quarter is more than double year-to-date and we would expect it to be more than double for the year. Didn\u2019t touch, what was your last \u2013 was it something else.","Matt Summerville","Yeah, the performance system in the legacy water heater business in China in Q3.","John Kita","Q3, when I look at electric and gas, it was probably up about 7% or 8%.","Matt Summerville","Got it and then just one final question, you mentioned added spend in China associated with bringing water treatment, air purification in the Tier 2, Tier 3, can you may be talk about where you\u2019re at with the distributions of that product, how many outlets you are in currently, how many you would anticipate and how that\u2019s going to evolve over the next year or so. And then to some less spend back off a bit in Q4 is that why we should see margins snap back pretty meaningfully at least relative to where they have been in the last couple of quarters in Rest of World?","John Kita","Yeah, sure. For example, yeah, water treatment margins were down about 6 points in the third quarter and that acquainted almost all the decline in the margins for the quarter and that was truly engineering and also investment in new retail outlets. We are at about 7000 \u2013 we\u2019re in 7000 stores approximately and then we have on important some special zones et cetera. I guess Ajita will comment, we think that growth will slow as we look to the next couple of years because we have been building it all pretty aggressively over the last two years.","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah, I think if we went back two years ago, we would have said the rate of our build out would have been slower and I think we\u2019re just going to faster because we see the opportunity longer term.","John Kita","Yeah, we had about 1,500 stores, almost 2000 outlets if you will over the last two years.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charley Brady from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.","Charley Brady ","Hi, thanks. I just want to jump down a little bit on Rest of World margins because the guidance clearly implies a pretty big step up in the Q4 margin and I get them with the overall guidance it\u2019s what coming out of China, but is that just a function of this engineering cost that is going into water treatment or essentially you took a big hit and that\u2019s kind of largely done or certainly declining a lot or ","Ajita Rajendra","So when we look at the fourth quarter, that\u2019s always our highest volume quarter. We would expect that to be the highest volume this year also. So we are going to get contributions. We would expect SG&A will be down a couple of points and that is the combination of the engineering cost not being high, as high and the SG&A not being as high as a percent with advertising being lower. We have talked over the years that those spends could be lumpy and they clearly were in the second and third quarter and we are comfortable they will be lower in the fourth quarter. So I think you are right. We have a fairly aggressive fourth quarter but with the higher volumes, we think we will get a little favorable mix from new \u2013 introduction of a new electric unit and then lower SG&A, we are comfortable with the estimate.","Charley Brady","Oaky and then just on North America, on the top line growth is sort of I guess implied in the guidance. Did you \u2013 you mentioned a pre-buy that you expect that \u2013 that is why it\u2019s kind of little bit maybe stronger growth in Q4 because you are pulling some stuff forward or is that just underlying stronger margin obviously Lochinvar is doing pretty good?","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah, and we expect Lochinvar to be up. We expect residential to be up nicely in the fourth quarter. So those two and then we do expect some pre buy from the regulatory changes that\u2019s happening on the electric units on the commercial. So it\u2019s a combination of all three zones that\u2019s why we think sales will be up nicely in the fourth quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from Samuel Eisner from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Samuel Eisner ","Hi, it\u2019s Sam Eisner here, guys how are you?","Ajita Rajendra","Hi, Sam.","Samuel Eisner ","Just on the \u2013 just going back by the last question on the pre-buy, was there any pre-buy benefit this quarter that you guys saw that you can define them and then also given the Lochinvar performance in the quarter, is there anything in particular going on there that you guys want to comment about?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, we don\u2019t think there was any pre-buy, I mean I will tell you in September residential was strong, but I mean the price increase that already been put in by August 1, so \u2013 I mean by I guess September 1. So any pre-buy we think would have happened in August if you will, so no. But September residential was strong and Lochinvar had a greater quarter, I mean their boiler business was up 25%. You break that into three pieces, their residential was up over 30, their condensing which is the big commercial boiler was up high single digit and then their non-condensing which we have talked about historically is their smaller business, but that was almost double and that\u2019s the reflection of a new product that they brought out, 2.5.million to 5 million BTU. They did have a large order in China well about $3 million during the quarter and so that clearly helped that to add a 3 or 4 points of growth. And that\u2019s from a distributor. We are also selling that product in China through our A.O. Smith operation. We expect that product will sell $15 million this year and with 12 or 13 of it in China. So Lochinvar just had a very good quarter, they grew margins, they grew sales significantly and we are very pleased year-to-date they are up about 9% and we are certainly comfortable with the 8% growth that we talked about earlier in the year portfolio.","John Kita","And also Sam I think that the results, especially this quarter, but it\u2019s being building, as reinforced us the global demand for that Lochinvar product and the global opportunity that we have in leveraging the product and capability with our existing distribution and presence in various country.","Samuel Eisner","Got it, that\u2019s helpful and maybe looking over on the Rest of World segment, the 13% growth that you guys are seeing is certainly a little bit below the kind of 15% rate that you guys have called out in your kind of long term, long term view. Is that something that we should be nervous about, you think that\u2019s kind of transitory and then maybe a second part of that on the Tier 2 and Tier 3 spending. Should that continue into fourth quarter and 2018? Thanks.","John Kita","Well, I guess I will say and Ajita you can add, I mean we have never said that we are going to have quarterly growth of right up 15% and what we have talked about with our model, as we think on an annual basis they can grow 15%, as the matter of fact and year-to-date, I mean U.S. dollars they are up about 15%. So we are comfortable they are going to achieve that 15 plus percent in local currency for the year and it\u2019s going to be lumpy I mean it\u2019s not going to be 15% every quarter. We are looking at annual basis. So we are very comfortable. With respect to the spend, yeah, we did have some higher spend, specifically in water treatment and even some in the air purification in the third quarter. We think that will be less in the fourth quarter and that we are looking at our plan right now, I mean as Ajita said I think the role out of stores will slow as we look into \u201918 and \u201919 I mean so we will be looking hard at SG&A.","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah, I think not much to add, am just reinforcing the fact that we are very comfortable with the 15% annual growth in China in local currency which is what we\u2019ve always said. And it is going lumpy especially China is driven a lot by different selling holidays and things like that, that make the spending and the sales from year-to-year can vary from one quarter to the other. So from that perspective, each quarter may seem lumpy, but for the year on an annual basis we are very comfortable with the guidance that we have given.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open","Jeff Hammond ","Hi, good morning guys.","Ajita Rajendra","Good morning.","Jeff Hammond ","Just to be clear Ajita, on the acquisitions, I think the presentation has 40 million of incremental growth, you said 60, is that all in and the 40s the acquired growth or just help me there.","Ajita Rajendra","With what 60 is the full year Hague and Aquasana and that\u2019s about our incremental of about 40 over the prior year because we didn\u2019t have Hague and we only had Aquasana of course from August of \u201916. So the incremental was 40 and the total water treatment in North America this year will 60.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. And then on cash flow, looks like you took cash flow from ups down 50 million, anything going on there? I think you cited kind of timing in 4Q, but we would have known there anything you know working capital supply chain that\u2019s driving that?","Ajita Rajendra","Well, the biggest issue is the pension contribution, so that\u2019s 20 plus, about $20 million of that. We did not have that in our estimate. Probably the other most significant item is, we are probably building more inventory for our water treatment move that\u2019s going to occur in the first quarter and late second quarter then what we had planned and so that certainly benefactor but nothing out of the ordinary. We\u2019re still very comfortable with our days\u2019 sales outstanding and et cetera.","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah, and some of that build is demand driven because I mean the business is continues to grow very well and so we\u2019re anticipating that. In that transition we want to make sure that we don\u2019t lose out in any other revenue.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Graham","Yeah, hi. Good morning. Last question on \u2013 only one question on rest of world I promise. At some point, the 15% number is going be difficult to reach given essentially the size of the business, world large number or want have you. Do you think we\u2019re a year or two away for maybe kind of thinking that\u2019s maybe a low teens growth business rather than 15% which obviously there will be nothing wrong with that but I\u2019m just trying to gauge your thinking internally?","Ajita Rajendra","I am comfortable with were we are now and the outlook that we have. And what you say from periodical perspective, we are going to be order of magnitude a billion dollar business which says it $150 million of new revenue every year, okay. So for the foreseeable future, we are comfortable. As soon as we see that is something that we say what we\u2019re going to have to turn that down a little, we will let you know. We will make sure that we communicate that to our investors. ","Scott Graham","Okay. Thanks.","John Kita","Clear predict Scott, continue growth on water treatment and air purification, those markets are expected to grow significantly. See I am still toss about 30% growth in water treatment, I mean we have a pretty significant franchise now when you add the consumables, and you add our businesses in China, it\u2019s over $200 million.","Scott Graham","So that is kind of what I\u2019m saying. Yes. Okay. That\u2019s fine, but if you go for the intermediate term right?","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah and also it is part of the strategy as we\u2019ve talked about is to get into new categories, to leverage our brand and distribution getting into new categories. So we\u2019re not counting on just the same portfolio businesses to bring us that incremental growth every year, okay. So we balance that in terms of the right time to get into it and to leverage the infrastructure that we have in China.","Scott Graham","Understood. I just \u2013 my second question is really about the U.S. business, both the results were pretty good. And as we look across the residential construction numbers over the last five months, which certainly is not a primary driver, but is a driver of the market. Those numbers have really been very strong sort of 15% last five or six months and we also \u2013 it looks like field might actually come down a little bit in the fourth quarter at least quarters you guys here, just sort of wondering how you are looking at the North American sales and operating margin sort of trajectory. And I know that you are going to probably not go far past, if any the fourth quarter, but it just looks like that the backdrop for North America sales and operating margin looks pretty good the next couple of quarters, would you agree with that, can you comment on that?","John Kita","Well I guess I said we didn\u2019t see strong, we\u2019ve seen relatively strong growth in residential, it\u2019s probably about 300,000 units. Now, again that\u2019s on base of 8.7 million units. So that\u2019s what 3% or 4% and we have seen that the last three quarters with that some of that in the fourth quarter. Commercial been strong, it\u2019ll be up \u2013 it was up by I think year-to-date probably about 7% or so. And that looks like that continuing. I would tell you it appears steel has leveled off but we haven\u2019t seen a decline, we say it\u2019s leveled off which would be a plus because it gone up so much dramatically which is the benefit as it does kind of stabilize.You know again continuous go margin, so yeah I think we\u2019re optimistic as we look in the fourth quarter in next year from a North America standpoint. Ajita if you have any?","Ajita Rajendra","No, I think that summarizes well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lawrence DeMaria from William Blair. Your line is open. ","Lawrence DeMaria","Hi, thanks, good morning. I have two questions, but first, just to clarify, it looks like we needed $16 million, $17 million increase in EBIT sequentially to get the rest of world record margins you\u2019re projecting. Sounds like the bridge is a reduction engineering around 6 million and then the rest is volume and slower growth in SG&A, is that right just to clarify, are we getting that right?","John Kita","I won\u2019t say engineering going down $6 million is right. We think that SG&A will be down at couple of points. We will get the benefit of price again even in China last raw material costs have stabilized, so we think we will get some benefit net price compared to material. And then we\u2019re going to have some volume that\u2019s also going to contribute. So those are the major pieces then you throw in a little bit of favorable mix from the new electric units. Those are the kind of the pieces that get up there.","Lawrence DeMaria","Okay. Thank you. And then secondly, staying in the rest of the world, how do you think about incremental margins going forward? Should we start to think about moving over 20% without any exception of the fourth quarter which would be good as the smaller businesses get scale and you are leverage infrastructure you referenced, can we look at over 20% incremental annual base now in rest of world, do have not scale there?","John Kita","I am not sure, you said two different numbers, you said a 20% and then you said 20% incremental.","Lawrence DeMaria","Over 20% incremental on an annual basis going forward since you are leveraging infrastructure and getting scale in those businesses?","John Kita","Well, I\u2019ll take a shot at it. We clearly want our rest of world margins, we think it\u2019s a combination of India becoming more profitable, Turkey be capital I should say, reducing the loss in India and ultimately getting to a breakeven with the same statement for Turkey. And then yeah it\u2019s our intention to leverage China\u2019s SG&A and volume as we going forward. We have not put out any specific objective but certainly it\u2019s our objective to try to go rest of the world margins.","Ajita Rajendra","And so incremental margins will be better than the average certainly but we have not put out the number.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Aurand from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Robert Aurand","Hi, thank you. Robert Aurand downfor Dave McGregor, today. Stock in China by your water heater business and what extent increased competition from the domestic manufacturers is impacting your results?","John Kita","Look, you know it\u2019s always been competitive as continually top, it\u2019s always been competitive. We\u2019ve seen in the market I\u2019ll say the electric not growing as fast which we assumed would happened because there is more distribution of gas in the city. So if you would asked us probably three years ago, we would have said electric was 55% in the market and gas was 45%, it\u2019s probably close to a flip now.","Not sure if it\u2019s going to go much further but that happens. We don\u2019t have a stronger position but we\u2019re \u2013 we have a good position in gas and we\u2019re leading in electric. So I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s much the competition as the dynamics in the marketplace, but all that being said, water heater growth this year is going to be nice for us and it\u2019s led by gas.","Ajita Rajendra","You know just to add a little more color to that, the changes John talked about have not happened overnight evolutionary type changes that are happening. From going back to your question on the competitive environment, yeah I\u2019ve always said China \u2013 the market in China is very, very competitive. You got all of the major players in the world there and they\u2019re all bringing in new products and being in a very competitive branded consumer appliance business. So none of that has changed, it\u2019s always been very competitive.","Robert Aurand","Okay. Thank you. And just one more question on China, I mean just new flow throughout the year that there are really trying to kind of cool down, the real stay market in the major cities there, aren\u2019t get a property bubble, I mean what extent does that impact your results over there, do you guys think about that impacting you moving forward?","John Kita","Well real estate is still the primary investment for the Chinese. The recent data does show that sales of property have slowed. It\u2019s kind of a one or two month, we don\u2019t that\u2019s a limp or not. We don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not really tracking as closely build, what we\u2019re tracking is sales, because that\u2019s what ultimately leads. The good news outside for us going forward is we think replacement is becoming a bigger component which just makes the sense the really good news about water heater in ultimately failed and with that you have a replacement market. And as you know here in the States, the replacement market is you know that 9 million build about 7-8 of this replacement. So we are nowhere near that in China but it\u2019s developing. So I think as we look forward, we still think we are going to be able to growth from the water heater segment and we have some of the best products in both electric and gas which differentiates us. Is that answers your question or not.","Ajita Rajendra","And I think if you look at it from a longer term macro perspective, you know China is just completed or completing this week the latest communist party congress and you know you take headline coming out of that it\u2019s a continuation of the policies which drives urbanization, drives more consumption based growth and those things form a macro perspective also help us and really reinforce our strategy.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Cohen from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Andrew Cohen","Hi, great quarter as always. Most of my questions have been answered but just a couple of small ones on water treatment. When this plans comes online in second quarter, is that going to materially affect margins or is it going to be roughly the same cost basis?","John Kita","Well, I mean, we will, we\u2019re going through our planning process right now. It\u2019s certainly will pass initially probably the first and second quarter. I mean but we are moving a significant operation, the good news is we are not moving it far but we\u2019re going to have moving certainly in the first and second quarter. The new plans offering higher depreciation for the year, we have \u2013 ultimately we\u2019ll have some inefficiencies the first half of the year. But the good news is ultimately we think it\u2019s going to be a much more efficient plan. So there could there could hiccups early in 2018 and we\u2019ll talk about that when we get into through our planning process and possible talk more on year end. But I think for the full year that we\u2019ll have some marginal effect but not significant.","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah, we\u2019ll be able to define it more three months from now. But just the team in China is very \u2013 they are used to doing this because they are constantly expanding building new factories and moving operations into new factories. And as John said that entails obviously in the new factory potentially higher depreciation which we will see in this factory. But at the same time, you know we\u2019ve designed this to have fairly significant operational benefits in terms of productivity. So we see both.","John Kita","And we\u2019ll expect to see that later in 2018 and certainly when we get into 2019 that\u2019s you know real benefit.","Andrew Cohen","Great. Second question it\u2019s probably fairly small but the Hague acquisition, is this portfolio also going to be sold over in rest of world or is it pretty much just a U.S. based set of products.","John Kita","Yeah, that was one of the things that attracted us to Hague as we have looked at water softer manufactures, we\u2019ve been OEM in over there and we look necessarily successful and we looked for manufacturers and of all the way. And quite frankly we feel agents for that. And they can make a compact unit which is important for the China market and they started selling those in I guess about March, April. And you know it\u2019s been a nice sales, I think the sales probably in six months have been a million bucks sales over in China and it\u2019s of the Hague water heaters and in U.S. water softener. So new we are optimistic that they can really provide us the benefit in China.","Ajita Rajendra","And these are Hague, you know water softener is made by Hague, branded A. O. Smith selling in China.","John Kita","Yeah. So it\u2019s not something we are saying, we anticipate doing, it\u2019s happening now.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Graham","Yeah, hi. I just \u2013 John, I was cut off before but the overwriting point that I was making was that residential construction has been very strong and residential water heater shipments have been just sort of okay. Is that gap seems to be pretty wide right now suggesting that the next couple of quarters could be fairly strong, are you hearing that from your guys is what I am asking?","John Kita","I haven\u2019t been but again Scott just over, I understand better what you think. And it goes back to 9 million units, 7.8 of that is replacement. So completions you know are 1.2 and maybe up a little bit, but on the margin that might add 50,000 to 100,000 units. You know what I mean? So but I have not, I don\u2019t know that you have but I think that\u2019s partly what\u2019s driving that is you have that base of 7.8 million units and that\u2019s probably growing some this year because if you get 9 million units, you know and completions are up of 100,000 to 150,000 and the rest is replacement. So that\u2019s why I was trying to say.","Ajita Rajendra","And I guess I make another comment Scott, which is you know not a quantifiable comment obviously but it may try and touch what you are saying. You know we just couple of weeks ago faced a ASA meeting which is the annual meeting where we have all of our distributors and you know there was you know people were pretty optimistic. I can\u2019t quantify that but you know people felt good about where things where.","Scott Graham","Okay, well thanks on that. So I guess my other question would be, you know I am sorry for the rest of word double up here but you know the weakness in the margin off of the spending I mean I don\u2019t remember the last time you called out and need to increase your tier two and tier three spending. So I guess my question is kind of twofold, number one, I understand the markets are completive, but has there been some competitive uptick in either water treatment or air purification that\u2019s required this additional spending? Number two, the dynamic of you know the water heater distribution points versus treatment and purification is different which is requiring an incremental investment, can you talk about that a little bit?","John Kita","Well, I guess I\u2019ll take the first one is where the market share lead the water treatment. And we have the best products and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in R&D to support that position. And I won\u2019t say that competitive environment for water treatment has changed, we want to build out our distribution. You know we talk about tier two and tier three cities not only do we want to see there that helps us from online position because somebody got to fulfill that and it\u2019s distribution locations we talk about. So when we\u2019re growing the retail, it\u2019s primarily I\u2019ll say our specialty stores and water treatment.","Air purification, we are not the market share leader, we think we have some new products that we\u2019re going to be bringing out next year that we think will be beneficial. And so we\u2019re investing in R&D and also going out that portfolio.","I think one think I want to mention is yes, rest of world, China did not meet the margins that we talked about beginning of the year, but when we are done with the year, we expect them to growth 15% organically and there is about 15% EBIT return. So I don\u2019t want to give the impression, they are not having a good year, they are having a good year maybe not what we expected and where the spend being more than what we thought and then raw material cost have hurt us. So as we look at the year, I having a good year and I don\u2019t think there is anything you need from a competitive or strategic standpoint that\u2019s really changing our things.","Ajita Rajendra","And I think that summarized it well. And you know as we \u2013 you know the advertising and things like that in a branded consumer clients business that\u2019s a \u2013 those are things we need to do especially when we get into new categories and we just had some research come back that our brand is getting better and better known and very well known in these new categories. And as John said when it comes to water treatment which we feel has a huge, huge long term potential in China, we\u2019re the market share leader.","So we feel pretty good about that. From a competitive situation, it\u2019s like I said earlier to a question earlier in the presentation, it\u2019s a very competitive market and it continuous to be that. And I don\u2019t see any material change either up or down from a competitive perspective.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Hammond","Hey, just a quick call. Actually you mentioned some inflection in international in China, and that seems to be an area that was taken along when a struggle. So what\u2019s really change there, are you starting to see an inflection where you can start to penetrate internationally? Thanks.","Ajita Rajendra","Yeah, I think the key difference then Jeff you got a good memory, we are going back to the activation but we felt that\u2019s the time we did the acquisition. But that there would be a market for the condensing boilers in China that there was a market that is growing. What\u2019s taken time is that we didn\u2019t see that condensing boiler demand grow in China but what we did is continued demand for the lower efficiency non-condensing type products in China. Lots of reasons for that, low energy cost, I mean lots of reason for that. So we literally designed some products which are very conducive for the Chinese market and fit the market needs in China and we are actually selling those products two different ways in China. We are selling them a blocking wall manufactured products, branded blocking wall in China through one set of distribution. And then we also manufacturing those products in China and selling them under the A. O. Smith brand name.","So \u2013 and both those are being very successful. So it is a change it\u2019s that we\u2019ve recognized that there was market for the non-condensing products, design some products for the Chinese market and we brought them out saying the last 12-15 months and they have been very successful. So we are very happy about that.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay, thanks Ajita.","Operator","And at this time, I am showing no further questions.","Patricia Ackerman","Thank you for joining us today. Please take note that we will participate in several conferences in the fourth quarter.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Pat Ackerman, VP investor Relations and Treasurer. You may begin.","Patricia K. Ackerman","Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2013 conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we are providing non-GAAP measures, adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted segment operating earnings that exclude certain items, as well as non-operating pension costs consisting of interest costs, expected return on planned assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and curtailments. Prior year results are provided on a comparable basis. Ajita, I will now turn the call over to you.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We continue to see the benefits in our performance from the housing recovery in the U.S. and our expanding consumer business in China.","Here are a few highlights from our very strong quarter. Our organic growth drove sales 16% higher to $536 million. Sales of A. O. Smith-branded products in China grew 35%. Our adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share were 46% higher than the $0.37 per share recorded last year. Incremental margins associated with higher volumes of water heaters and boilers drove earnings higher. We celebrated the grand opening of our second water heater plant in China, which increases capacity in the region by 50% when the new plant is fully utilized. We also moved production of our fast-growing gas tankless products to the new plant during the quarter.","John will now describe our results in more detail.","John J. Kita","Thank you, Ajita. Sales in the third quarter of $536 million were 16% higher than the previous year, driven by higher volumes of water heaters and boilers in the U.S. and higher sales of A. O. Smith-branded products in China. Adjusted earnings of $50 million improved 48% from our third quarter performance last year.","As previously announced, we transferred our residential water heater productions from our Fergus, Ontario plant to other North American facilities this year. As a result of the capacity rationalization, we incurred a pretax restructuring and impairment charge of $1.3 million in the third quarter and we expect a similar amount in the fourth quarter.","Adjusted earnings in 2013 excluded after-tax non-operating pension costs of $3.2 million and after-tax restructuring and impairment costs of $1 million. Adjusted earnings in 2012 excluded after-tax pension costs of $800,000 and an after-tax gain of approximately $3.7 million related to an estimate of an earn-out associated with an acquisition. Third quarter earnings and adjusted earnings include approximately $3 million of higher income tax benefits than previously estimated, primarily related to manufacturing and research and development activities. Approximately $1.8 million of the tax benefit related to the 2012 tax year.","Adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share improved 46% compared with $0.37 per share last year. Adjusted EPS in the current period excluded non-operating pension costs of $0.03 per share and restructuring and impairment charges of $0.01 per share. Adjusted EPS in 2012 excluded non-operating pension costs of $0.01 per share and the change to the earn-out estimate was a gain of $0.04 per share.","Sales in our North America segment of $370 million increased 10% over last year, driven by higher sales of residential and commercial water heaters and commercial boilers in the U.S. In addition, the third quarter last year was negatively impacted by a pull-forward of water heater volumes in advance of a June 2012 price increase.","Rest of World segment sales of $175 million increased 31% compared with last year, driven by increased demand for water heaters and water treatment products in China and market acceptance of our newer, higher-value A. O. Smith-branded products in China. We continue to innovate our product lines with features and benefits which provide value to our customers and differentiate our brand. We introduced our eighth upgrade to our electric water heater offering in the second quarter and the products have been well received. Other recent innovations include an ultra-quiet gas tankless water heater product line and water treatment products which have longer-lasting filters and waste less water. The return on investment in engineering and innovation is one of our key success factors in China. We also believe our customers held higher inventory in advance of the autumn holiday in October, resulting in a benefit to sales of approximately $10 million.","North America adjusted operating earnings of $57 million were 25% higher than last year, and adjusted operating margin of 15.3% improved almost 2 percentage points. Higher incremental margins associated with increased volumes of water heaters and boilers in the U.S. were the primary drivers of the margin expansion.","Rest of World adjusted operating earnings of $27 million improved over 100% compared with last year. Higher sales and improved mix of A. O. Smith-branded products in China and smaller losses in our non-A. O. Smith-branded water treatment business drove operating earnings higher. Segment operating margins of 15.4% improved significantly compared with last year as a result of higher volumes, better mix and lower selling and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in China. Our adjusted corporate expenses were $14.3 million, an increase with the prior year primarily due to lower interest income, as well as higher expenses related to management incentive programs and higher stock-based compensation costs related to shorter amortization periods.","Cash provided by continuing operations was $190 million in the first 9 months of 2013 compared with $101 million last year, primarily driven by higher earnings from operations and a smaller investment in working capital. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 15% at the end of September. We have sizable cash balances located offshore, and our net cash position was approximately $250 million at the end of the third quarter.","As mentioned last quarter, our free cash flow generation for the year is expected to be approximately $100 million, and our board increased our authorization to repurchase shares resulting an authority at that time to repurchase approximately 2.5 million shares. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1,240,000 shares of common stock at an average cost of $42.48 per share under a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan. The 10b5-1 plan remains in place.","We expect our cash flow from continuing operations for the full year 2013 to be approximately $250 million. Our capital expenditures are expected to be $90 million to $100 million, which includes approximately $40 million for capacity expansion in China and India to meet growing demand for our water heaters in those regions, as well as approximately $20 million related to our ERP implementation. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be between $55 million and $60 million this year.","I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize our outlook and acquisition strategy.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Thank you, John. Our outlook for 2013 includes the following assumptions: first, we see strong growth in our A. O. Smith-branded products in China, which are expected to add approximately $100 million to revenue this year. The team continues to serve our customers and introduce new higher-value products with richer features and benefits that enhance our premium brand. Growth this year is expected to top 20%, which is well ahead of our original 2x GDP projection.","Second, we expect our Lochinvar brand to continue to benefit from the transition from lower efficiency, non-condensing boilers to higher efficiency, condensing boiler, as well as strong market acceptance of new products like our Lochinvar CREST condensing products, boiler -- condensing boiler product line. Lochinvar-branded condensing boilers continue to offer a compelling payback in the form of energy savings, and we have built a reputation for innovation and outstanding product quality. As a result, we expect Lochinvar-branded sales to grow at least 10% in 2013, well ahead of GDP growth in the U.S.","Third, we are cautiously optimistic about the developing recovery in U.S. housing. We expect residential water heater volumes in the U.S. to be 400,000 units higher than last year based on an increase in housing completion, as well as growth in replacement units. And we continue to be pleasantly surprised by the strength of the commercial water heater industry. We now expect commercial industry units will approach 157,000 for 2013 or 6% higher than last year.","Our performance in the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter give us confidence to increase our 2013 adjusted EPS guidance to be between $2 and $2.04 per share. The midpoint of our new range represents the nearly 30% increase over 2012 adjusted EPS of $1.56 per share.","Our guidance implies a relatively strong fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter last year when the benefit from Superstorm Sandy is considered. And our guidance is comparable to the third quarter we just completed when adjusted for income tax benefits, higher China volume and lower China advertising and selling costs. This guidance does not include the restructuring and impairment expenses associated with the planned rationalization, the settlement with a former supplier, non-operating pension costs or future acquisitions.","Our GAAP EPS guidance is now expected to be $1.78 to $1.82 per share due to the impact from the restructuring and impairment expenses, partially offset by the settlement income, neither of which were in our GAAP guidance at the beginning of the year.","This continues to be an exciting and transformative time for our company. We have cash and borrowing capacity for additional acquisitions, and our pipeline of acquisitions supporting our stated growth strategy to expand our global footprint in water heating and water treatment solution is very active.","You have seen this slide before, and we show it only as a reminder that we will be a financially disciplined acquirer of companies that fit our stated corporate strategy. You should know that while we came close to completing a few acquisitions over the past 12 to 18 months, we walked away for various reasons. In the end, we held fast to our financial criteria and are focused on creating value and return for our shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we are open for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Summerville.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. Ajita, as we think about product mix kind of going forward, how would you characterize this quarter? Do you feel like your product mix is maxing out? Does it get -- is there room for it to get better from here? Or is the next step sort of less favorable from a mix standpoint?","Ajita G. Rajendra","Let me ask -- answer that in a couple of different ways. I don't think they are maxed out on mix by any means, and that's because if you take -- let's look a different parts of the world. If you look at China, we are constantly adding new products with features and benefits that command higher prices. And obviously, what we try to do is to improve our margins with those new products. But that process will continue. We've been doing that in China for many years. It's part of our growth strategy and it's been very successful. And we certainly invest behind the engineering and new product development capability to be able to continue to do that. If we look at other parts of the world, as the housing recovery takes hold and our volumes go up, we've always said that the incremental margins come at pretty high -- the incremental margins are pretty good. So I think all of those circumstances are in play and we don't see that maxing out by any means. Now one thing that John did mention that, as we look at our margins in China in the last quarter, SG&A expenses were a little lower than normal, and that's something we don't expect to continue.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then you mentioned or one of you mentioned, you thought this kind of buy ahead of the October holiday in China was $10 million. Is this a period in 2013 different than any other year? Would you normally see some sort of buy ahead relative to this holiday period? What's kind of \"normal\" for that business?","John J. Kita","The way we looked at it, Matt, is we looked at the inventory levels of our major customers September 30 of this year compared to September 30 of last year, and they were higher by X number of units which equated to about $10 million. There is always probably some buy ahead when you're entering the October holidays, early October holidays. But based on that is why we're saying we think it was $10 million more than the prior year.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then where would you say the government -- the Chinese government position stands today with respect to trying to cool housing activities, speculation, household formation? What is their position, because that was something you guys were concerned about or at least cautious on -- at the beginning of the year?","John J. Kita","Well, as we've talked about in the past, they're walking kind of a fine line. They're trying to move to a consumer economy which will certainly benefit us, as that's our place in the Chinese market. They seem to have not necessarily implemented some of those taxes, et cetera, that we talked about early in the year with respect to capital gains, et cetera. So that did not take place. So time will kind of tell, going forward, where they are. But again, they clearly have to move to a consumer economy which we think will be benefiting to us because it will generate helpful information.","Ajita G. Rajendra","And I think also, when you -- everyone saw the news last week, late last week, that their third quarter projection of GDP was a little higher than expected, and we hope that all of this leads to -- and as John mentioned, moving towards a more consumption-based economy, will be helpful to us in the future.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mr. William Bremer with Maxim.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Ajita, John and Pat, very nice quarter. Given that, historically, this is one of your lighter quarters, if I recall, in terms of volume, very nicely done. Let's go into Lochinvar. Can you give me an idea what the contribution was for the quarter? More importantly, how was their operating margins? And I guess, lastly, their aftermarket exposure, how's that been growing?","John J. Kita","We don't break them amount. But I can say, as we've said in there, that they grew over 10%. They're running at close to a 12% year-to-date positive run rate compared to the prior year in volume. Their margins are growing, and so they continue to perform very well. On the aftermarket side, we haven't seen any significant increase, it's been holding in at kind of the levels they've had in the past. So as we've talked about, they continue to do very well.","Ajita G. Rajendra","I think one...","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Is it safe to say the margins were up year-over-year?","John J. Kita","Yes.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Bill, one comment on the cyclicality. In the past, the third quarter used to be our slowest quarter. But that has changed somewhat because the third quarter is Lochinvar's strongest quarter. So that's kind of impacted a little bit.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay, excellent. Can you give us a little sense on how the underlying steel prices have affected your COGs?","John J. Kita","Steel has been down year-over-year, so it's had a positive effect. As you know, part of that is a direct pass-through. As we go into the fourth quarter, our expectation is that will be the highest cost quarter of the year. As you know, steel has been going up, so it's been a marginal benefit for the year.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Do we still assume a tax rate in the range of a 30% to 32%?","John J. Kita","Yes, I think a reasonable expectation for the fourth quarter would be around that 30% for adjusted.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, can you just give us an update? I know that India is quite small right now, but just -- there's been a lot of volatility in that regions. Everyone salivates over the potential there. Can you give us an update of what's occurring there for you guys?","John J. Kita","Year-to-date sales are up 5%, and when you take into effect the currency has depreciated about 10%, your top line, apples-and-apples, would be up about 15%. As we've said at beginning of the year, we were hoping for them to break even. They will not, and the biggest factor has been the currency. They still outsource a fair amount of their product from China, and that's had a negative impact. Certainly, consumer confidence, given what's happened to the currency, has not been real strong in India, and that's a concern. But we expect, for the year, they're going to be up about 10%. Again, when you incorporate the currency, that's closer to 20%. So it's progressing, probably not as quickly as what we had hoped. But again, we can't do anything about the currency.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charley Brady with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just back on the China growth and then the -- kind of the pull forward from the holiday, I understand you look at inventory levels year-over-year and they are up $10 million or so. But I guess what I'm trying to say, if you look a year prior to that, were inventory running -- levels are running kind of flat going into the holiday season, and for some reason, this year, they kind of popped up? Because I'm trying to understand, the holiday happens every year, unless for some reason, it's moving around one quarter to the next because of the calendar. Is there something that's different this year versus prior years?","John J. Kita","Well, we didn't go back 2 years. We didn't have that data. But again, last year, all we could calculate it on is, last year, the inventory level was X. This year, it was $10 million higher and it was specifically a couple of customers. So that's how we came up with the number as an estimate of what the pre-buy, if you will, is compared to the prior year. So they're carrying higher inventory levels than last year by approximately $10 million. And that all really occurred kind of in the third quarter, up until -- at the end of the second quarter, levels were pretty comparable. So that's how we backed into it. And again, it's only an estimate.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And -- right. And you're saying, it's at a relatively limited number of customers. So on an apples-to-apples -- so you obviously have greater distribution in China than you did 12, 18 months ago. It's like [ph] 4 months ago. It's normalized for that as well?","John J. Kita","Yes, it's just looking at really the top 5 or 6 customers.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And just looking on North America, you kind of alluded to the seasonality shift a little bit with Lochinvar now stronger in Q3. But even that said, Q4 tends to be a pretty good quarter, and I guess given what you did in Q3 and the environment looking a little bit stronger, I guess I'm trying to -- it seems like the guidance might be looking a little lighter than what the environment might call for in terms of North America's strengths. So can you just kind of understand where your guidance is coming from? What you're thinking about going into Q4 from North American outlook?","John J. Kita","Yes, the real uncertainty is that we're estimating, again, based on our internal data that the industry's third quarter for residential and commercial will be the strongest third quarter in the last 5 or 6 years during the third quarter. So we had a very strong third quarter. As you are aware, we increased our level saying that the industry -- our estimate will be 8.5% for residential versus 8.1%, so that's up 400,000. If you look at completions, they're are only up 200,000. So that's coming from replacement. So our -- I won't say our concern, our unknown was the third quarter a lumpy plus that might not happen in the fourth quarter. So you're right. Traditionally, the third quarter would be nowhere near as strong in the fourth quarter, but this year's third quarter was very, very strong.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Robert Baird.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So just kind of want to understand how we think about margin sequentially in Rest of World going from this quarter to next quarter. Obviously, you guys talked about some of the higher SG&A -- sorry, lower SG&A in the third quarter selling promotional stuff. But when you think about some of the puts and takes here, I think you guys are expecting some lower volume because of the pre-buy. How does the factory moves impact that? I know that's something we talked about. But the margins are really strong this quarter, but you're expecting some headwind from that. And the reason I ask is, when you look at some of the guidance, the core guidance implies something potentially meaningfully lower than where you guys ended up in the third quarter here. Still to a very healthy level, but I just kind of want to understand the puts and takes sequentially and how you're getting to that.","John J. Kita","Yes, the takes we look at it is, we have not changed our fourth quarter volume assumptions from what we said at the end of the second quarter. So the fourth quarter is what we originally thought. We said it'd be a tough comparison because last year, there was a pre-buy, we think, to meet incentives, volume incentives. So at the end of last quarter, we said we'd be up 18% for the year. Now we said we're going to be over 20%. But you're right, volume sequentially, we would expect to be down from the third to the fourth quarter. That will have an impact. The SG&A, we would say, would also have an impact. Third quarter is traditionally the lowest for advertising. Fourth quarter is higher. We also changed our advertising agency, which might have helped us a little bit in the third quarter from a cost standpoint. And the third is, the plant really was just operating at the end of the quarter. And we do expect that will have -- as we've talked about publicly, until we get to higher capacity levels, it's going to have a little bit of margin drag, just if nothing else, from the additional depreciation, et cetera. So I think you put all those together and you look at it for the whole year, we'll be up over 20%, and there will be a significant margin improvement in Rest of World year-over-year.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Absolutely. Just wanted to make sure I understood the sequentials there. And then, how are you guys thinking about U.S. inventory levels at this point kind of broadly across the channels?","Ajita G. Rajendra","The U.S. inventory levels are okay. I mean, no major positives or negatives.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That makes sense. And then on the buyback side, you have the 10b5-1 in place. Any thoughts of being more aggressive from a buyback standpoint outside of offsetting dilution?","John J. Kita","Well, we did more this quarter than offset dilution. We bought, as we said, 1.24 million shares, so that's much more than dilution, and it was $53 million worth or something. We said, historically, we have 4 capital allocation options: grow organically, which we're doing this year by investing on our plants; acquisitions which we're actively looking at; dividends, which we raised last 2 quarters ago, 20%; and stock buyback. We bought over 3.7 million shares over the last 2 years. We bought a fair amount, as I said, this last quarter, and it's clearly an option for us.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sanjay Shrestha with Lazard Capital.","Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. So when we think about India, right, given the currency dynamics, so if you take the currency out, is India now running at breakeven, or India actually now taking money, or where are we?","John J. Kita","Well, I guess I would say, if the currency was back when we started this whole thing in the 45-plus range, I would say, we would probably be operating pretty close to breakeven. It really is the currency has been the biggest impact. When you look at what we said our volumes would be compared to when we started, I think we're pretty much on track. But the currency certainly has had a negative impact when you look at how much we're buying from China.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Sanjay, also, let me jump in on that. Because clearly, when we look -- if you look our -- at the results coming out of India, we are disappointed. But the disappointment is driven entirely by the economy and what's happening with the economy. If you look at our own brand and our product, the volume is increasing, and more importantly, we are gaining market share. So all of that is very positive. We still feel that India is a very, very good long-term bet. And so we are continuing to invest. And even though the devaluation of the rupee is hurting us right now, it also is a great time to invest in the country in rupees in terms of advertising and brand building and things like that. So we are continuing to do all of that because again, we feel that it's a terrific long-term bet.","Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I agree 100%. So few more questions for me. So when I now, even taking out this whole pre-buy in China, right, so what is our sort of the same-store sales growth here in Tier 1 cities versus Tier 2 cities? And how many new stores did we add during the quarter? And can you give us that breakdown for China?","John J. Kita","Well we ended the year at about 5,200 stores, I think. Midyear, we were at about 5,400 stores. And now, we're at close to 5,700 stores. So there has been a nice growth in distribution. It's primarily in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. We did see sales increase in both Tier 1 and Tier 2 across the board. So I mean, the bottom line is, China had a great quarter.","Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","For sure. For sure. So one last question then. Guys, I know you're not going to give me sort of the clear answer on this, but maybe more sort of philosophically now, right, is with your stock having done what it's done, cash generation potential of the company, but market is also getting better, right. So are you now running into a bit more of a problem of finding things that are a better bargain buy out there and everybody is looking for a higher multiple? And has that changed your overall acquisition philosophy or for that matter, given the pipeline that might have been there 12 months ago and that it didn't cuts [ph] right now, can you talk about that a little bit, if there's any change in the philosophy of how you guys are looking at this?","John J. Kita","Well, I'll start out from the financial side and Ajita can add. But we have not changed our discipline on what our requirements are. And so yes, stuff has maybe gotten a little bit more expensive, but it all does come down to what sort of synergies, et cetera, we can provide, value added. And I would say the pipeline is relatively similar to what it's been a year ago. Some came out, and some came in and some have come back. And so we're actively looking. But again, we've said, we'll hold to our financial criteria, and we have.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Yes, I think that's well put, and I can't add much more to that other than, from a strategy viewpoint, there's been no change in our thinking in terms of -- in thinking vis-\u00e0-vis acquisitions. The 10b5-1 plan that we put in place is because of the cash generation that we're doing. And it doesn't change our outlook and philosophy vis-\u00e0-vis growing by acquisition.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Connors with Janney Montgomery Scott.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I had a couple of questions. First off, I wanted to revisit the topic from the prior quarter. You had talked about a pre-buy in the first half at that time and that had impacted commercial volumes, but then you still expected kind of low- to mid-single digit growth in the commercial side talking U.S. here. Obviously, you were able to deliver excellent results even with that sort of caution on commercial. Can you talk about that, how that played out, whether you still maintain the same kind of goals on the commercial side for the back half?","John J. Kita","Well, we've continually raised our estimates on commercial, and we just have much more difficulty kind of estimating that. I think last quarter, we set 154,000 units compared to last year's, I think, 147,000. And now, because of a very strong third quarter in commercial, we're going back to the drawing board and we've raised it to 157,000 units. So again, it's just very hard for us to estimate that. There's -- obviously is some discretionary because, I mean, everybody you talk to, there's not a significant amount of commercial building going on. But we had -- it was a very strong third quarter.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then also, just to talk about the components of your growth in China for a moment. I mean, obviously, it's no secret that part of your growth has been driven by market share gain in addition to the growth of the underlying market. But yet, now you look and you're so dominant in that high-end $400-plus category. How do you see those 2 factors contributing to your growth rate going forward, market share improvement versus underlying organic growth in the market itself?","John J. Kita","Well, we certainly think we'll continue to gain market share. And specifically, as we've said in the instantaneous side of the market where we've come out with the super quiet product, that's been a big contributor to our market share going from the low 20s to the 25%. Electric units all grew very nicely because of the series 8 we came out with, and so that had a very good quarter also. And then quite frankly, our water treatment, when we talked about it, was little less than $20 million last year. We expect that to double on the A. O. Smith brand this year. So that's doing extremely well. And then you throw in some of the ancillary product lines, like heat pump is very doing well, commercial is doing very well. So as we've said, we've grown a lot of different ways in China. It hasn't been dependent only on distribution. It's been growing distribution, growing market share, coming up with higher value products. We think the replacement market is coming and will continue to come. So we've done it in a lot of different ways, and we think that will continue.","Ajita G. Rajendra","And also, just to add to that, John mentioned the replacement marker for water heaters. But also as we grow our water treatment business, the water treatment product has a replacement component to it in terms of filter. So that's something. Now we are not going to see that for a couple of years, but that's something that also we hope will start building out in the future. So as we look at China long term, we continue to be very bullish about the opportunities in China.","John J. Kita","And why we said the consumerism is so important is the Chinese, based on all the surveys we see, provide premium brands that are providing value. And we think moving to the consumer economy, they're going to have to be able to increase income to make it affordable and then they'll prefer the premium brand. So we think that will be a positive going forward for us.","Ryan M. Connors - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then just one last one for me. You alluded in the press release to, in the U.S., replacement demand being a driver. And kind of a big picture question, I know it's something difficult to quantify, but we're coming on about a decade now since the U.S. went through its housing construction bubble, and presumably, some of those products are now reaching the end of their useful life. Do you see that replacement market as kind of evolving into a growth market over the next few years? And is there any way you can kind of frame that, and if not, quantify it?","John J. Kita","Well, we've looked back and looked at the data, and I think, the data I looked at was '96 to '98, the industry averaged X. '99 to 2001, it averaged 300,000 plus. And then you go the next 3 years after that, that averaged another 300,000 plus. So you're right. In the 12-year replacement, which again is on average, is right in that sweet spot. So it would be our hope that some of that replacement would start growing. What we don't know is on the past, you had discretionary, and that's probably come down. Now we hope, given the economy coming back and the wealth factor, et cetera, for housing, maybe that'll get back to where it was before. But yes, we've said there's some potential from the replacement side because it's right in that middle part. And this is probably the first year we've seen it because up until now, it's been -- replacement has been pretty flat, which is a positive, but we'd like to get some growth out of it also.","Operator","Our next question comes from Samuel Eisner with Goldman Sachs.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Had a few questions on China. I know that we're kind of talking about this pretty exclusively here. But the pre-buy was about $10 million this quarter. That means you grew effectively organically about 23.5%. I was just curious what the difference there is between price and mix and volume? Is there any way to kind of parse that out?","John J. Kita","I don't have the specific detail, but it was all 3. I mean, units were up, i.e., volume was up and the average price per unit was up. And so -- and we did grow our distribution, so it was all 3.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the distribution this quarter, it seems like you added about 300 stores and those are about Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Are you gaining the same amount of sell-through in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities as the Tier 1? And maybe just help us understand maybe how many stores you need to get the same amount of store growth out of a Tier 2 city versus the Tier 1 city?","John J. Kita","In round numbers, 40% of our stores are in Tier 1 and about 60% of our sales. So no, we don't get the same sell-through that you would in a Tier 1 as you would a Tier 2 and 3.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And then on the selling expense this quarter, is there any way to understand how much that was actually down in terms of actual dollars, or in terms of how much you've benefited the margin in terms of basis points?","John J. Kita","Roughly a couple percent.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple percent.","John J. Kita","It benefited the margin.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Couple of percentage points to the margin?","John J. Kita","Right.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And then lastly on, again, just sticking with the Rest of World segment. You called out the non-branded A. O. Smith business was actually doing a little bit better. Are we at breakeven in that business, or just maybe directionally, were [ph] just the losses there are [ph] declining? Just some greater clarity there would be better.","John J. Kita","Yes, the loss are declining. When you take out the amortization we have associated with the acquisition, it would be breakeven to slightly positive. So it's made good headway in 2013. More throughput, right? I mean, it's making the products for the A. O. Smith brand and you have much more throughput going through the plant, et cetera.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mr. Scott Graham with Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I really only have 2 questions for you. Number one is that, if steel is starting to rise, are there pricing plans for the first part of next year or even the fourth quarter of this?","Ajita G. Rajendra","Scott, we -- when it comes to looking out into the future, obviously, we don't talk about pricing at all.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Would you say, historically, that the incremental cost of steel where we are today versus earlier this year has prompted a price increase historically?","Ajita G. Rajendra","Let me put it -- let me answer the question a different way. In the past, over time, we've been able to pass cost increases out into the market, but it takes time and we do it over time. In the past, we've been able to do that.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. Along the same lines, this is the third part of question one, sorry, but did wholesale sales increase faster than retail sales this quarter?","John J. Kita","Yes.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. So the other question is simple. On the Fergus benefits, how much have we seen and kind of how much is still to go through the P&L, even if you want to tell us on a percent basis?","Ajita G. Rajendra","John, do you want to...","John J. Kita","I'm sorry, can you ask the question again? Fergus for this year?","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Sure, sure. Just wanted to know how much of the Fergus operational benefits you've received so far in the third quarter, what you expect maybe in the second half of the year in total and what's still to come?","John J. Kita","Well, what we've kind of said is that we had -- Fergus this year will benefit approximately $4 million. And we've said that our expectation is, next year, for a full year, that it'll be a $10 million, so about an incremental $6 million. And we're kind of at that run rate now. We're running at, whatever that is, $750,000 a quarter. So it's -- we're pretty well complete and it's gone about as well as we could've hoped.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Yes, the whole transition and the move from an operational execution perspective had gone very well according to plan. And from a customer perspective, it's gone very well. There have been no issues in terms of deliveries or anything like that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mr. David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I think most of them has been answered. I can follow up on a couple. First on the SG&A side, for China in particular. I think in the first quarter, if I'm not mistaken, SG&A was a little bit lower again, and then you ramped it up in Q2, you lowered in Q3. I mean, how much abilities -- and I know -- I understand you want to really focus on growing the market share, but you're getting a lot of market share. You mentioned the change in the advertising agency. I'm assuming you're getting some better pricing out of that. So can you reduce your SG&A? Are you prepared to keep it lower on a longer-term rate as a percentage of sales instead of just ramping it up or maintaining it?","John J. Kita","Well, I think what we've said is we could, but we probably won't, because what we have in our brand we feel is something special. And so we cannot re-create that brand position today, so we're going to make sure we can maintain it. So we spend a fair amount in advertising, and I think we will continue to. Now a lot of the selling is somewhat variable because that's, as we open new distribution sites, et cetera, and new stores, we have to put in the displays and the employees, et cetera. So a decent portion of the selling is somewhat variable there. So on the margin, yes, there's some room, but we're committed to continuing to invest in the brand.","Ajita G. Rajendra","And also, when you look at the growth in China, a lot of it is coming from new people coming into the market, okay, as people get into the demographic where they buy these type of products. And we have to constantly keep the advertising and promotion and programs communicating to them, the benefits of buying our product, why it's a premium brand and all the rest of it as you would with a typical consumer advertising strategy. So we see that as continuing, and it's a major part of the growth plan for China.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes, that's helpful. And you had called out Internet sales in the last quarter. Do you want to call them out now? What were they, and how much did they grow in China?","John J. Kita","We're very comfortable they'll more than double. In fact, they're close to almost doubling by the end of the third quarter going from 5 to, I think, the number was close to 9 or something, 9 or 10. So they're on track and doing what we expected.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is -- do you think that's part of the inventory increase from your customers, too?","John J. Kita","No.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Or is it just so small?","John J. Kita","Yes, I don't think we can tell.","Ajita G. Rajendra","No.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, can you give us an update on the progress of the ERP?","John J. Kita","ERP is progressing right on schedule. We have the team assembled, and we're very comfortable with the adviser we're working with and it's right on track.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Any small drag you saw on this quarter, and how should we think about the impact in Q4?","John J. Kita","Well, I mean, what we've said is the impact will be about $5 million this year, and that is primarily in the second half of the year because that's when we started it. And we said next year that it'll grow to probably about $15 million as you end up expensing more, et cetera. And so that will be primarily, I'll say, mostly the second half of next year because you're still capitalizing some stuff in the first half of the year. But right now, we're on track.","Ajita G. Rajendra","Yes, we are more than halfway through the blueprint stage and nothing has popped out that would make us change the forecast and the outlook that John just mentioned.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A couple of things. First, Ajita, is there any update on bringing Lochinvar's residential and commercial products into China? What, ultimately, timing might look like, how that may or may not ramp up over the next year or so?","Ajita G. Rajendra","It's moving along on track. We -- in the next few months, we'll be introducing some products. It's going on track. It's not -- as we always said, that is going to -- it's a longer-term program because the market for that product hasn't quite developed. But we do see it developing. And so the more program is moving ahead.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","What types of products will you be introducing? And is that a '13 or early '14 thing?","Ajita G. Rajendra","It's an early '14. I mean, it's an early '14 thing. And initially, it'll be residential type combi boilers. Combi meaning it heats water and heat the environment.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then as we think about just the U.S. commercial business, I mean, I know we're only a few weeks into October, but are you already seeing the implied slowdown in that business that your guidance or your 157,000 would have built in, assuming that the industry data is going to come through very nicely for August and September in Q3? And I guess, you talk about not having all that great of visibility into, I guess, the out-the-door demand. I guess, Ajita, what are you watching for then in terms of warning signs that either this pent-up replacement demand or this drive towards energy efficiency, that that's closer to an end as opposed to a beginning?","Ajita G. Rajendra","Yes, we have not seen any slowdown, okay? The market has surprised us in its strength. And like John mentioned earlier, we've increased our outlook in terms of the commercial market in total going up to 157,000 units.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And what do you think the market did in Q3?","John J. Kita","Well, our GAAP says the market was probably up maybe 5% year-over-year. I mean, we're forecasting in our numbers that Q4 is going to be up slightly from Q3, and that's similar to what it was last year. So that's kind of where we're forecasting it, and time will tell.","Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Hey John, can you actually give the same view on the residential market like you did commercial there?","John J. Kita","Residential, we would expect, is going to be up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. We do not think it'll be as strong as last year because last year was helped by Sandy. But we do think sequentially, it'll be up. But again, I think we'd reiterated a couple of times, and this is typical, Lochinvar will be down sequentially from the third quarter to fourth quarter, exactly as they were last year.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Charley Brady with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just wanted to get back on the M&A pipeline. You guys touched on it a little bit. But can you give us a sense, in that pipeline size-wide, maybe kind of a range of what the deal pipeline looks like? Is there just -- is there one large, large deal? Is there a lot of small, medium stuff?","Ajita G. Rajendra","Charley, we are -- like we've said in the past, we are looking at things that -- it's yes and yes, there are smaller programs -- there are smaller opportunities and larger opportunities. And it's really difficult to comment on it before it happens, because like we've said, these things can happen or not, and you don't really know until you've signed the deal.","Operator","At this time, I'm not showing any further questions. I would like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks.","Patricia K. Ackerman","Thank you very much for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Patricia Ackerman. You may begin.","Patricia Ackerman","Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2019 earnings call.","With me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chief Executive Officer; John Kita, our retiring Chief Financial Officer; and Chuck Lauber, our incoming Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Kevin\u2019s remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning\u2019s press release.","In order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures, adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share for 2018 that exclude the restructuring and impairment costs associated with our plant closure in Renton, Washington. Reconciliation from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and also on our website. As a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin, who will begin our prepared remarks on slide four.","Kevin Wheeler","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentleman.","Our first quarter results met our expectations and are aligned with our previously communicated projection for China of over year-over-year sales, as a result of a channel inventory build in the first quarter of 2018.","Company sales of $748 million declined 5% from the prior year. Earnings per share of $0.53 declined 12% from the prior year. We repurchased approximately 900,000 of our shares for approximately $46 million. We are pleased to announce the acquisition of Water-Right, one of the strongest names in residential and commercial water treatment solutions, earlier this month. Please advance to slide five for more details on this strategic acquisition.","Water treatment solution providers, Water-Right squarely supports our growth trajectory in water treatment and enables us to expand beyond our strong presence in the direct-to-consumer and retail channels with Water-Right\u2019s capabilities in the wholesale and water quality dealer channels.","The water treatment category in the U.S. is evolving from a taste and odor market to a health and safety market as families become more aware of contaminants in their drinking water. Water-Right brings us additional solutions for residential and commercial applications. Water-Right\u2019s product portfolio and channel access strengthens A. O. Smith\u2019s ability to serve customers seeking drinking water safety at any stage of their life, from school and college age where portability and refillable bottles are prevalent, through first apartment to home ownership when whole house products are desired.","The purchase price of a $107 million represents a trailing EBITDA multiple of approximately 9 times, after the expected tax benefit related to a Section 338(h)(10) election. Water-Right meets our return on invested capital objective in the first full year. We expect Water-Right to add approximately $45 million of revenue in 2019. The positive impact to earnings in 2019 is expected to be minimal to the interest and purchase accounting and one-time costs.","At this time, I would like to thank and acknowledge John Kita, who is on his last earnings call before retiring from A. O. Smith after about 30 years. We have transformed to a pure play water company during his tenure as CFO. And John was integral in communicating the potential of A. O. Smith to investors. We wish John well in his retirement.","John Kita","Thank you, Kevin.","We have been working diligently the last several months on my CFO transition to Chuck Lauber. Combining his background and 19 years of experience with A. O. Smith with the strong internal financial and accounting team, I am confident that transition will be seamless.","Chuck will now describe our results in more detail, beginning on slide six.","Chuck Lauber","Thank you, John.","Sales for the first quarter of $748 million were 5% lower than same quarter in 2018. Adjusted earnings in the first quarter of $89.3 million, declined 14% from the first quarter in 2018.","On slide seven, first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.53 were 12% lower than the same quarter in 2018.","Sales in our North America segment of $522 million increased 4% compared with the first quarter of 2018. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of boilers and water treatment products and our mid-2018 water heating price actions related to steel and freight cost increases, which were partially offset by lower residential water heater volumes.","Rest of the World segment sales of $232 million declined 21% compared with the same quarter in 2018. China sales were down 18% in local currency, primarily related to channel inventory build which occurred in the first quarter of 2018 and did not repeat in 2019. Our China results essentially met the forecast we stated at our January earnings call. The weaker Chinese currency unfavorably impacted translated sales by approximately $13 million. India sales grew approximately 30% in constant currency, compared with the same period in 2018.","On slide nine, North America segment earnings of $116 million were 3% higher than segment earnings in the same quarter in 2018. Favorable impact from higher sales of boilers and the mid-2019 pricing actions were partially offset by higher steel and other input costs as well as the unfavorable impact from lower residential water heater volumes. Weakness in the North America water treatment business as a result of tariff related cost increases and lower than expected volumes drove first quarter 2019 segment margin slightly lower to 22.2% compared with the adjustment segment margin of 22.5% last year.","Rest of the World earnings of $12 million declined 66% compared with the first quarter of 2018. The impact to profits from lower China sales more than offset the benefits to profits from lower advertising.","First Quarter headcount reduction programs were offset by severance costs. Our targeted 10% headcount reduction was largely completed at the end of March. Weaker China currency translation negatively impacted earnings by approximately $1 million. As a result of these factors, segment margin declined significantly from the same quarter since 2018.","Our corporate expenses were higher in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2018, primarily due to higher stock-based compensation. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 20% was lower than last year\u2019s tax rate, as a result of a onetime adjustment due to refinement and estimated tax due to U.S. tax reform.","Cash provided by operations during the first quarter of $22 million was lower than $43 million in the same period of 2018. Lower earnings and lower accounts payable balances resulted in lower cash flow from operations. Our liquidity and balance sheet remained strong. Our debt to capital ratio was 14% at the end of the first quarter. We have cash balances totaling $633 million located offshore and our net cash position was $349 million at the end of March.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 900,000 shares of common stock for a total of $46 million. Approximately 5.1 million shares remained on our existing repurchase authority at the end of March.","This morning, we updated our 2019 guidance to a range of between $2.69 and $2.75 per share with no change to the midpoint, which represents a 4% increase in EPS compared with our adjusted 2018 results.","We expect improved performance in China in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, but project lower China sales than in the same period in 2018 due to the second quarter 2018 inventory build. As a result, we expect our 2019 second quarter earnings per share will be slightly lower than the second quarter last year.","We forecast the stronger second half in 2019 compared with the first half due to China performing better in the second half on a constant currency basis impacted by normal seasonality and selling holidays, new product launches, and cost benefits from lower advertising and headcount reductions. Growth as well as typical seasonality of boilers which are normally higher in the second half of the year, improvement in North America water treatment and India profitable in the second half due to volume growth, typical seasonality and improved operating performance.","We project significantly improved second half year-over-year performance as a result of stronger water heater volumes as the third quarter 2018 is an easy comparison due to the price increase pull forward in Q2 2018, stronger boiler volumes due to tariff-related loss sales and supplier bottlenecks in the third quarter of 2018 also provides a favorable comparison, improved profitability in North America water treatment due to the absence of one-time product launch cost and softener production inefficiencies, and larger profits in India.","We expect our cash flow from operations in 2019 to be between $500 million and $525 million, which is higher than the $450 million generated in 2018. We expect higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital this year. Our 2019 capital spending plans are approximately $85 million, and our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $75 million in 2019.","Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $49 million in 2019, slightly higher than last year due to inflation. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 21.5% in 2019. We expect to purchase our shares in amount of $200 million -- approximately $200 million in 2019; we expect our average diluted outstanding shares in 2019 will be approximately a 168 million.","I will now turn the call back to Kevin who will summarize our guidance and business assumptions for 2019, beginning on slide 13.","Kevin Wheeler","Thanks, Chuck.","Our outlook for 2019 includes the following assumptions. We project U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will increase between 100,000 and a 150,000 units in 2019 due to continued new construction and expansion of replacement demand as well as continued growth in tankless units. Commercial industry water heater volumes are expected to be up 1%. Based on a strong first quarter, we expect our boiler sales to grow approximately 10% in 2019. We improved profitability in India in 2018 due to scale and our water heater and water treatment businesses from losing over $7 million in 2017 to under a $5 million loss in 2018. The overall loss in India is expected to be $2 million to $3 million in 2019. We project India water heater EBIT will be positive in 2019 and improvements to continue for our water treatment in 2019, and that overall in India, we will be profitable in 2020.","Our forecast for the Chinese currency in 2019 is essentially level with where it is today, weaker than last year. All the negative FX impact is expected in the first half of 2019. As previously discussed, we believe 2018 Chinese sales increased at least 5%, due to the customer inventory build in the first half 2018. We are assuming continued weakness in the Chinese economy and relatively flat consumer demand for the full-year in 2019. Without the impact of the 2018 channel inventory build, we are projecting full-year sales to be down approximately 6% to 8% in local currency terms, the majority of which will occur in the first half of this year. Combined with our expected 1 point of unfavorable currency translation, our 2019 China sales projection is a decline of 7% to 9%.","Please advance to slide 14. We see continued momentum in North America, with our water heater, boiler and water treatment products, collectively expected to grow up to 9% in 2019, including approximately $45 million in Water-Right sales. Our profitability improvement and sales growth in India is also encouraging. Our business model in China is solid for the long-term opportunity, and we continue to forecast low-teen margins for the full year.","We have near-term challenges to navigate through as the China economy remains weak. We project revenue growth will be between 2.5% and 3.5% for the year in U.S. dollars and 3% to 4% in local currency. EPS is projected to be between $2.69 and $2.75. We expect North America segment margin to be between 23% and 23.25%, and Rest of World segment margins to be between 11.75% to 12%.","Our stable defense replacement markets, which we believe represent 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes, positively differentiates A. O. Smith from other industrial companies. We have a strong balance sheet, poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that add shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alvaro Lacayo of G.research. Your line is open.","Alvaro Lacayo","Good morning. And congrats John on a very successful tenure as CFO.","John Kita","Thank you.","Alvaro Lacayo","I wanted -- my first question was around focus on North America, the volume in water heaters and water treatment volumes that you called out as being -- I guess water treatment soft and I believe residential water heater shipment was negative. The shipment data shows that through February, it looks like shipments were positive, think about 3%. Maybe if you could just give me some color around what March looked like and maybe some commentary around what that means for your performance in the quarter. And then, with water treatment, if you provide some color on the magnitude of the price increases and maybe just some commentary around competitive response, and what was the delta between the volume that you were expecting versus what you saw?","Kevin Wheeler","Okay. This is Kevin. Let\u2019s talk about North America water heaters first. You\u2019re right. Through the first couple months, the market was up about 50,000 units. But, as we saw in March, based on our March shipments, we\u2019re actually estimating that the industry will be marginally down to flat. And so, we still feel the forecast of 100,000 to 150,000 is valid, but we gave back we believe some of the units in March.","What that does for us is, we had a little bit of a share decline, and that\u2019s mainly just due to order patterns and how our distributors order. We don\u2019t see anything of a material issue going forward. So, we project our full-year market share will remain flat. And we expect that the industry will grow as we have previously forecasted.","Now, with regards to -- you mentioned water treatment and pricing, I\u2019m not sure -- if you could clarify, that would be helpful.","Alvaro Lacayo","I think, the comment was that volume was a little bit lower than anticipated due to cost base, price increases from reacting to the tariffs. I was just wondering what kind of a price increase you implemented, and then how the volume is -- the delta between the expectation and the actual on the volumes for water treatment.","Chuck Lauber","Yes. This is Chuck, Alvaro. Really not pricing, it\u2019s really just volume. So, we\u2019re a little disappointed with our first quarter for water treatment. So, our volumes are a little off. We started a little slow with one of our major customers but we feel pretty good about the momentum that we have gone into the rest of the year. The tariff-related costs are just recovered some of those, but we still have tariff-related costs and some of the filtration products that we have coming out of China. And on the water treatment side, we\u2019ve got some inefficiencies we had in Q1 that really we believe are behind us. So, as we look at the North America water treatment business, Q1 is really the low point for us for the year, and we just see that number improving throughout the year. So, we see increased volume as we go throughout the year and we also see that the efficiencies in our softener production are overcome, and we see improvement in March, we see improvement in April. So, the momentum is good in our North America water treatment.","Alvaro Lacayo","Thanks for the color. And then, just on Rest of World, are there any further actions from a cost reduction standpoint? And I appreciate the comment around the severance offsetting some of the headcount benefits in Q1. But, if you could tell me, maybe from a magnitude perspective, how much fixed cost reduction to expect from a year-on-year perspective going forward?","Chuck Lauber","So, if we look at -- and we\u2019re talking China, right. So, China, so we did get the headcount reduction cost behind us. So, we only see improvement on the headcount going forward. When we\u2019re looking at magnitude -- and if you\u2019re looking at a percentage of SG&A, and most of the savings are cost and the advertising side that really are more building than they are direction promotion type costs. But, I will take it as a percentage of SG&A, and we\u2019re probably mid single digits as a percentage of SG&A when you\u2019re looking at cost reduction year-over-year.","Kevin Wheeler","I just want to add a little bit to that. Again, we\u2019ve taken the steps and we\u2019ve talked about this our call a few times that we want to right size the business for the market that we\u2019re participating in today. We believe we\u2019ve taken the steps. But, you should all know that we continue to monitor the market. And if additional actions are required from us, we\u2019ll make those decisions as we go forward throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Drew Haroldson","Good morning. This is Drew Haroldson on for Matt Summerville. I have just a couple of questions. First, do you believe that the inventory channel correction in China will be largely complete at the end of the second quarter, or if not, when would you expect that pressure to alleviate?","Chuck Lauber","Yes. This is Chuck, Drew. Yes. So, we -- the inventory in China is -- it built last year really, we saw that build in the first half of the year and larger percentage was in the first quarter than in the second quarter. For the last three or four quarters, it\u2019s been pretty stable. Our assumption, when we kind of look at forward on the year is that it\u2019d be flat to down. But, we don\u2019t see a lot of decrease in that in our forecast for the rest of the year.","Drew Haroldson","Got it. And then, just as a quick follow-up. Can you talk about the cadence throughout the quarter in China? It seems as though, some data points pointed to a better overall sentiment in March versus January and February. Did you also see that in your business?","Kevin Wheeler","Yes. We -- that\u2019s gone up and down quite frankly. If you look at just the macro environment, we would tell you, it still remains a challenge. Consumer demand is weak, but we are seeing some stabilization and some -- I don\u2019t want to say improvement, but certainly just stable consumer demand. So, we are seeing some of those signs. But, I would tell you that we need to see more than just a few months. And so, as we\u2019re looking at it, going forward, that\u2019s why we project it relatively flat. And so, we see more of a positive sign with some of the government possible stimulus packages and some of the other things that could help consumer demand if the tariff issue gets resolved. But, we are seeing some, but I would tell you, we need to see a few more months before we\u2019re willing to say that there\u2019s a positive momentum in China.","Chuck Lauber","Yes. This is Chuck. So, I mean, the first quarter is always difficult in China because of the spring festival, and it\u2019s a bit harder to get a handle on what the market is doing. So, as you kind of go into the second quarter, hopefully we\u2019ll see a little bit better feel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Hammond","Hi. Good morning, guys. So, just on China. I think first quarter, you gave us some good color on kind of how first quarter was going to shape up. And I think you said you still expect decline. But, can you just maybe give us a finer point on the magnitude of the year-on-year decline you expect in China in 2Q and what kind of decremental margins you\u2019d expect?","Chuck Lauber","So, for Q1, we gave the guidance that Q1 would be down roughly $50 million. And last January, we talked a bit about the inventory build happening in 2018, predominantly in the first quarter, but did happen throughout the first half of the year. I mean, we don\u2019t know our channel inventory numbers precisely. But, when we kind of take a step back and look at it, we would kind of gauge the Q2 impact to be made roughly half of that of Q1. So, the volume, we\u2019re saying 50 in Q1. So, we would take that in Q2 as roughly half.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. Then, the decrementals tied to that, because I think you had pretty high decrementals?","Chuck Lauber","No. It kind of would be similar to the first quarter. We had that ass kind of a 50% to operating earnings. ","Jeff Hammond","Okay. And then, how do you get to -- I mean, it just seems like a very backend-loaded year. How do you get to the margin assumptions for Rest of World? Like, what needs to happen in the second half to kind of get to that high 11% to 12% range?","Kevin Wheeler","Yes. I mean, what really kicks in a bit is some of the cost reduction programs that we talked about. We really don\u2019t see the headcount reductions until we start entering into the second quarter. So we see that -- we would see -- we\u2019re really being hurt by volume obviously in this first 2 quarters, and we\u2019re talking about the numbers Q1 and Q2. And we expect that to flatten out, so the back half, the China -- from our sales perspective, we expect to be better. And then India, so we\u2019ve got improvement in India. When you look at kind of how India lays out for the year, it\u2019s very seasonal. They\u2019re clearly -- their strength is in the back half of the year. So, really when you look at India, all of our losses accumulate in the first 2 quarters, and we\u2019re profitable in the back half the year, when we look at our projection, which is a pretty big swing quarter -- half-over-half.","Operator","Our next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","Just first of all, first question, really on China, and you had talked in the past about rolling out some mid-price point water heaters in China. So I guess, I\u2019d just start off by just asking if you could talk about the early experience with that rollout? And what did that represent as a positive offset within the Chinese growth compare? And what was the impact of cannibalization on the premium product?","Kevin Wheeler","Well, let\u2019s just start out with the rollout. And we\u2019ve been rolling out midpoint products now for the last several months, and we\u2019ll continue to roll them out into the remaining half of the second quarter and third quarter this year. And I want to get specific because at the end, on the gas side, we are filling our line with the 0 cold water. We are in those mid-price point products, which are important because we vacated those gaps on the offline but we also supports our online sales.","On the electric side, our wall-hung business, we\u2019ll introduce a mid-price steel jacket model. We\u2019re also going to upgrade one of our high end models with several features, with regulators and displays and slimline-type tank design. Water treatment, we will introduce 2 new high end products as well. One more of a DIY easy filter replacement. The other is boiling water with the tap -- luxury tap. So we have mid-price point products, and we also have new high end products that we are launching almost simultaneously, and they are -- right now, we\u2019re seeing improvement in our online sales. We are seeing some improvement in our mid-price point range.","Now, I\u2019d tell you that this is early and each product takes some time to get out through certification. But the steps we\u2019re taking, we feel really good about our new product, we feel they\u2019re having the impact, and they will have the impact over the rest of this year. And as far as cannibalization, we have a high end part of the market, which we continue to do well in on the water heater side of it, that\u2019s tankless and electric wall hung. I would tell you, people aren\u2019t probably trading up, but we don\u2019t see a lot of trading down. Water treatment\u2019s a little bit different story, but we do see some trading down going on there, so maybe a little bit of cannibalization. But overall, the product offering is meeting our expectations, and it\u2019s just a matter of getting them out into our distributors, into our distribution to have the full impact throughout 2019.","Chuck Lauber","Yes. And this is Chuck. And I talked a little bit about cost reduction but I just want to emphasize that we haven\u2019t cut back on R&D or our new product development or launching new products. So we\u2019re very upbeat and excited about the products that are coming out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scott, if your telephone is muted, please unmute.","Scott Graham","Hi. Good morning. And John, I wanted to just extend congratulations to you. You had a terrific run here at the company","John Kita","Thanks, Scott.","Scott Graham","I wanted to maybe first ask about the organic for the year or better yet, as you\u2019re calling it, sales in local currency, which I understand now means inclusive of Water-Right. It looks to me as if your organic expectation for the company is now 1.5% to 2.5%, is that -- am I calculating that right?","Chuck Lauber","We are just taking a look at that, Scott.","Patricia Ackerman","So, we said Water-Right sales would be $45 million this year.","Scott Graham","So, I think, it\u2019s about 1.5%?","Kevin Wheeler","It\u2019s about 1.5%. Yes. That\u2019s correct.","Scott Graham","Okay. All right. The China water heater market, I know in the past you guys have had a pretty good beat on knowing what that market is running at, in total, not just your channel. Do you have an idea where that is right now? It was kind of -- I think you guys were kind of saying it was a little bit negative last quarter. Do you know where it is now?","Chuck Lauber","What we look at from data, from our third-party -- this is Chuck, again. It\u2019s -- the ABC data that we use through the third-party, and it doesn\u2019t include our specialty stores, just the retail. What they\u2019re showing down for electric and gas is roughly in that 9% to 10% range for the first quarter. So they got the market down in that level with online and are performing a bit better, of course. Online is up a bit and offline down more than online\u2019s up.","Scott Graham","Would you then say that\u2019s a deterioration from last quarter, right? From what you see?","Chuck Lauber","Yes, we would say that. Last quarter was running less than that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy of Stephens. Your line is open.","Robert McCarthy","Congratulations, John, on a great career. What I would say is the following, I guess the first thing I\u2019d like you to just go through. Could you -- could you all talk about in the context of some of these acquisitions kind of how you perceive the total addressable market for water treatment in North America? And where you want to play? Maybe if you could give us a sense of the total addressable market, some of the growth drivers and where you see the ability to create value for the company and where you want to play?","Kevin Wheeler","Let\u2019s just talk about Water-Right and then I\u2019ll tug back into our other acquisitions. And we\u2019ve talked about Water-Right fits squarely in our strategy particularly from a residential and commercial point-of-view and some dealer network. But if you go back, you look at our strategy. Water-Right really complements our prior two acquisitions. Aquasana was our first acquisition and that provided carbon products and also provided a solid direct-to-consumer platform. That filled out 2 of our channels that we wanted to participate out of the 5. We also then acquired Hague, and there\u2019s a large water softening market out there, and Hague\u2019s innovative water softening products helped fill out that product portfolio for us. It also helped us enter into the water quality dealer network as well. And if you remember, we took those 2 acquisitions, we are able to put them together and offer a full package, which helped us in improving our big box retail position. Now as you go forward here, where does Water-Right fit in? Water-Right fits in that residential and commercial problem water area. And they bring new products that help fill out that part of our business. They will -- they also brought a stronger dealer network, which now -- we\u2019ve more than doubled our water quality dealer network, and by the way that was with minimal overlap. And they also helped us enter into the wholesale side of the business.","More of the specialty wholesale side of the business as well. So when you put all 3 of these acquisitions together, they complement the 5 channels, which are residential and light commercial that we want to participate in. And as we go forward, our -- we firmly believe that the water quality in the United States, in North America will continue to deteriorate over time and that each one of these product or channel categories and the products that we offer will add value to those specific -- our customers that are purchasing through those channels.","So going forward, we are very bullish on our water treatment business. We still believe that it\u2019s in its early stages as people become more aware of their -- the quality of the water throughout the United States and so forth. So those all tied together and having a filtration carbon, having a water softening, having RO system, now moving through now being able to leverage our commercial network that we have throughout the United States with water heaters and boilers that\u2019s another key component. And we believe you wrap this up completely, this will provide -- we had talked about at least high single digits growth going forward and improved profitability, as we continue to build out and implement our strategy -- our water treatment strategy across North America.","Chuck Lauber","This is Chuck. And just circling back to the total addressable market. I mean we estimate the North America market to be around $2 billion as a total addressable market. So, as Kevin said, we like the trends, and it\u2019s a large market that we think has a lot of potential as it evolves.","Robert McCarthy","Great. And then maybe if you could expand your comments with respect to China and the water treatment trends you\u2019re seeing there in terms of growth? And then touch on air purification as well. Just give us the latest state-of-play of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the market dynamics there in terms of growth?","Chuck Lauber","Yes. Water treatment continues to be a bright spot for us in China. It didn\u2019t pop in the numbers this quarter, and the reason why is because we\u2019ve talked about that inventory build last year. So if we look at kind of our water treatment business in China, we\u2019re looking at -- so for the quarter, we were down probably low single digits. Just slightly down on our sales. Now that the sellout was still kind of a bright spot when you look at what the sellout was and what we see in the marketplace. When we look at our year for water treatment, we see about 8% year-over-year growth, and we see consumables that are continuing to grow. So we\u2019re very happy with the consumable business. It\u2019s about a $30 million base last year, growing at about 30%. And it grew at 30% Q1, and we expect it to grow at 30% for the year. So water treatment continues to be a good product for us.","Kevin Wheeler","And then, I would just add that this is not a -- water treatment is not a product that\u2019s tied to new construction, it\u2019s really tied to health and safety. And those are primary with the Chinese consumer, particularly with children. So we expect that to continue to grow and to have value for many, many years to come.","Chuck Lauber","I think you touched on -- you mentioned air purification. We really have moved into more of a formaldehyde product as we go into air purification. I think we\u2019re kind of really just entering into that time of the season. So the summertime is when you really see formaldehyde in China being more of an issue. So we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve got some new products that we\u2019ve launched there. We\u2019ve got fresh air product that is well mounted, that we\u2019re excited about coming into the market. Last year, our sales probably in the -- down a bit obviously, but probably in the $25 million range. And this year, we expect with our formaldehyde product to grow a bit, probably grow up to maybe $30 million. This is what our projection is. So we see a little bit of a positive there, but it really predicates a bit on what happens this summer in the formaldehyde.","Kevin Wheeler","We still believe air purification, based on what we know today, has a place in our portfolio. And we\u2019re also having a few new products there into more of the mid-price range to help the -- boost sales as well and address some of the consumers that we haven\u2019t been able to with our higher end products. So overall, air purification remains part of our portfolio, and we believe it will -- may not be as we\u2019ve talked in the past, may not be that 30% to 40% growth, but we still believe it\u2019s solid double digits going forward.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets . Your line is open.","Jeff Hammond","Just a follow-up on water treatment. I just want to level set kind of how big do we think that business is in 2019, now that you\u2019ve included Water-Right? And what\u2019s kind of the core growth all in for water treatment? And does that change at all given the slow start?","Chuck Lauber","So, Jeff, I think you\u2019re talking about just North America piece, right?","Jeff Hammond","Yes, North America.","Chuck Lauber","Yes. So, the Water-Right adds about $45 million. So we\u2019re looking at this year, the North America water treatment approaching $155 million of revenues and approaching a 10% operating margin return. And we would expect -- as we go forward, we would expect to have an expansion on the operating margin probably in the 200 to 300 basis points. When we look at kind of the growth rate. We kind of -- you break it down, and you\u2019ve got different growth rates probably for filtration products and get -- versus softeners. But overall, we would say, we\u2019d be approaching high single-digit growth rates going forward. So when we kind of roll it all in and you look at 2020 and you\u2019ve got a full year of Water-Right, we would be approaching $190 million, $200 million as we get into 2020. And we\u2019re looking at continue to expand margins and a nice growth rate for the North America piece.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Graham","Hi. Good morning, again. I got cut off at the knees there. I\u2019m not sure...","Kevin Wheeler","Scott, that was John.","Scott Graham","Yes. I actually thought it was you, Kevin. So help -- if you could help me understand the lows? It looks to me like -- you tell me if I\u2019m wrong on this, but you are maybe a little bit off track on where the lows water treatment selling lands in 2019. Kind of what happened there? And may be why?","Kevin Wheeler","Well, I want to go back to we launched in August of last year, and we talked about on a couple of calls. We started out a little bit slower than we expected. We had some capacity issues in our Combi\u2019s facility. And so we just got off to a slow start. But as Chuck mentioned early on in the call, we\u2019re seeing month-on-month growth in the space, and our capacity issues are clearly behind us right now, and our efficiencies continue to improve as we continue to build scale. So are we behind a little bit? Yes, we are. Do we think we have the programs and the foundation set to go forward? And the answer is, yes. And like you said, we\u2019re starting to see that. We talked about having a good margin, we\u2019re off to a nice start in April. So it\u2019s -- moving forward, it\u2019s just going to be more timing, and we\u2019ll eventually get to the numbers that we talked. It would just be at a little bit slower rate.","Scott Graham","Got you. And before I get cut off, so I do have another question. Going back to China, I have not in a long time heard as many new product launches being teed up for the rest of the year, and it\u2019s definitely exciting. It does also, however, beg the question of mix. Historically, I think you have always hoped to get Rest of World margin into the 15% range. I -- just trying to understand kind of how -- what you\u2019re thinking now with longer term on Rest of World margin with a lot of new price coming in that are undoubtedly going to be lower margin in China than your core water heater offering. Could you maybe talk around that a little bit?","Kevin Wheeler","Well, let\u2019s just start with that, we have introduced a number of new products, particularly the mid-price. And if you remember, we were just trying to fill some gaps that we created through a price increase. But also, online is becoming more prevalent, and that just doesn\u2019t have the same type of price point. So we need to make sure that we have the products to compete to guard the volume and the share that we have. Now our margins -- I would tell you, our -- byproduct are not going lower. Now our price points are, but we are -- the reason we are introducing new products, we\u2019re taking steps to drive cost out and diminish that price cost ratio. So, margins are going to remain solid, as they have been. Our average selling price is going to drop a bit. But overall -- and by the way, just to go back, we may not have talked about all these new products that we\u2019ve launched, but we\u2019ve been very consistent over the last decade of introducing many, many products at a time. And of course, the number of products are going to get larger as you enter new categories. So this is not -- it\u2019s a little bit out of our behavior because of the mid-price points, but the rest of them are just normal business -- being in a consumer business, and plants business, we\u2019re always introducing new products every 12 to 18 months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Cohen of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Andrew Cohen","Hi. You kind of touched on some of the -- but I\u2019m curious -- I mean, you seem to have gone in China into some tangential lines of business recently, and I\u2019m wondering, if this is a one-off, or if you are trying to become more of a broad range scope of products in that market?","Kevin Wheeler","I would tell you our strategy, let me just articulate that. We\u2019re always looking at new product categories to grow. In China there is a growth market, has a lot of opportunity but we have high criteria for our product launches. One, they have to be able to leverage our brand and our distribution, that\u2019s number one. And number 2, we don\u2019t enter any product category that we don\u2019t believe we can add significant value to the product category going forward. So if you look at your purification, we felt we could bring added value formaldehyde and so forth. But we\u2019re also going to continue. We\u2019re always incubating products. We\u2019re incubating Combi boilers today. We\u2019re incubating air purification. We have a very nice growing commercial water treatment business that\u2019s moving toward profitability. So yes, we\u2019re going to enter new product categories but they\u2019re always going to be within our core and being able to leverage what we\u2019ve been able to develop and build, which is our branded distribution over the last 20 years.","Andrew Cohen","Does that include -- like you\u2019ve got now Hague and Water-Right which are North American products. Are you looking for how those fit into the Rest of World market, or kind of...","Kevin Wheeler","I would tell you right now, we already are selling the water softeners that are from Hague. We\u2019ve been doing that over last couple of years, right? In fact that\u2019s how we started our -- we need to know the Hague business as they were customer -- or we were a customer of theirs from China. So yes, but that fits again squarely into being into the bathroom, being into the kitchen with our brand and our distribution it\u2019s not a large part of the market but it\u2019s one that it\u2019s a natural synergy from the companies and the products we have, both in North America and it can go both ways back to China which it does in reverse osmosis.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your lines open.","David MacGregor","Yes. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I may get cut off again. So, let me just give you 2 or 3 questions in a row there. First of all, I guess, pricing your anniversarying the second half or the midyear 2018 price increase, do you have additional pricing actions in place to carry the third quarter compare? And secondly, I guess replacement demand from 2007 to 2009, industry sales were down about 20%, as I recall. And so I\u2019m interested in how you think about North American replacement demand against that historical pattern. How much of a drag, if any, is replacement demand on the overall growth? And then if I could just through a third in. I guess just on boilers. Can you talk us through, quickly how severe weather-driven spike in sales has impacted subsequent quarters\u2019 growth? And do you feel you may have pulled forward some growth there?","Kevin Wheeler","That was quite a list, thank you. I\u2019m going to take the first one, if pricing -- and we don\u2019t comment on pricing as we go forward. As we talked about that was implemented last year, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s anniversarying right now. We are constantly always reviewing our cost positions and so forth, but we don\u2019t comment on future pricing actions. And as far as the replacement demand, I\u2019m glad you asked that because it\u2019s an important point that we get many times on the road with regards to \u201cI think you\u2019re going toward, hey, is there a cliff coming because of what happened in 2007, 2008?\u201d And what we\u2019ve articulated last few years so have done quite a bit of research and study. We went back to 1970 and really laid out our replacement market in a number of different ways and what we have concluded quite frankly is yes, so we have a bell curve but it\u2019s an elongated bell curve. It goes anywhere from 5 years to 20-plus years. And then if you look at the overall replacement market, our replacement market is really 14x what\u2019s the available housing out there, which is $120 million. When you put that all together, and our assessment that we may have some blips here and there, but there is no cliff at all affect. It\u2019s going to just kind of level out over the years as it always has and continue we believe at a similar replacement pace that we\u2019ve seen over the last 5 or 10 years. And as far as boilers...","Chuck Lauber","Yes. And back to your question on boilers in Lochinvar and the -- or the seasonal weather, the cold weather I think was your question. I mean what we saw mostly was residential products, we don\u2019t believe that that\u2019s going to impact kind of the normal seasonality of the boiler business for the back half of the year.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Alvaro Lacayo of G.research. Your line is open.","Alvaro Lacayo","My follow-up is just the North American water treatment market. If you could break down the $2 billion or so in sales that you gave as an addressable market, if you could break it down by channel, and I think you\u2019ve called out retail, direct-to-consumer, wholesale and water quality dealer. And then maybe you can give some commentary around how many stores you\u2019re actually at Lowe\u2019s or if you reach sort of the total amount of stores that you intend -- that you plan to reach? And then on the wholesale dealer channel, is that all incremental to you guys and how big is that?","Kevin Wheeler","Okay. We\u2019ll give you some approximations here. When you talk about the overall water treatment market by channel, about 40% to 50% of it is dealers, about -- again 15%, and these are approximate, 15% to 20% is on the wholesale side of the business. 15% is retail and 10% is basically other.","Chuck Lauber","Yes. I mean, that\u2019s why we\u2019re really pleased to have Water-Right joint because the largest part of the market is in that dealer wholesale piece and they bring us a bit of a footprint there that\u2019s going to be very helpful to us.","Kevin Wheeler","And going back to how much is that going to be incremental, it\u2019s surprisingly the number of dealers that we brought on with the Water-Right acquisition and we lay them on top of the dealers we have in Hague, there was very, very little overlap. So, most of it is going to be incremental. And by the way, it\u2019s going to cover some areas that we were not in and give us a broader national footprint as we continue to grow that over the next few years.","Alvaro Lacayo","And with Lowe\u2019s, are you fully launched there, or is there more stores in the pipeline? And just to give us an idea, how many stores you\u2019re in?","Kevin Wheeler","For the most part, yes. We are fully launched, and we are just moving forward with our store displays and generating consumer demand for our products. I would not expect any real meaningful loading, if you will, going forward.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Patricia Ackerman, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Ms. Ackerman, you may begin.","Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Danielle. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on our 2016 second quarter results conference call. With me participating in the call are Ajita Rajendra, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Kita, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin with Ajita's remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the comments that will be made during this conference call, including answers to your questions, will constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters that we have described in this morning's press release.","Also in respect of others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.","I will now turn the call over to Ajita who will begin with his remarks on slide three.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The second quarter of 2016 was another excellent quarter for A. O. Smith., setting second quarter records for sales and earnings. We continue to see healthy end markets for our consumer products in China and commercial water heaters and boilers in the U.S.","Here are a few highlights. Sales grew 2% to a record $667 million. Excluding the impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar against the Chinese and Canadian currencies, our sales grew 4% in the second quarter. China sales were up 16% in local currency. Record second quarter net earnings of $0.98 per share was 24% higher than our earnings per share during the same period last year.","We continue to review our capital allocation and dedicate a portion to return to shareholders. During the first half of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares for $82 million. We increased our dividend by 26% six months ago.","John will now describe our results in more detail beginning with slide four.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Ajita. Sales for the second quarter of $667 million were 2% higher than the previous year. Net earnings of $87.1 million improved 23% from 2015. Earnings per share of $0.98 improved 24% over last year.","Sales in our North America segment of $433 million declined 2% compared with the second quarter 2015. The decline in sales was primarily due to lower volumes of residential water heaters in the U.S. This was partially offset by price increases implemented in 2015 in the U.S. related to a regulatory change and in Canada throughout 2015 related to Canadian dollar weakness, as well as higher volumes of boilers and commercial water heaters in the U.S.","The Rest of World segment sales of $240 million increased 8% compared with 2015. China sales increased 16% in local currency driven by higher demand for water heaters and A. O. Smith branded water treatment products. On slide six, North America operating earnings of $104 million were 21% higher than segment operating earnings in the previous year, and operating margin of 24.1% was significantly above the 19.4% operating margin one year ago.","Higher prices in the U.S. and Canada and significantly lower material costs contributed to the improved segment financial performance. The positive impact to profits from higher U.S. commercial volumes essentially offset lower U.S. residential water heater volume. Rest of World operating earnings of $33 million improved 7% compared with 2015. Higher China sales were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses in China and larger losses in India.","Segment operating earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $2 million due to China currency translation. Higher selling cost in China to support expansion in tier 2 and tier 3 cities and our e-commerce platform, as well as higher advertising costs to promote our water treatment and air purification products in China were the primary drivers of higher segment SG&A expenses.","Second quarter segment operating margin of 13.8% was slightly lower than one year ago. Our corporate expenses were flat in the second quarter compared with the year ago period. Our effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2016 was 29.8%, lower than the 31.1% recorded in the prior year quarter, and benefited from the early adoption of a new accounting standard for share-based compensation.","Cash provided by operations during the first half of the year were $155 million compared with $61 million during the same period last year, driven primarily by higher earnings and lower outlays for working capital in the 2016 period. Our liquidity position and balance sheet remained strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 16% at the end of the second quarter. We have cash balances totaling over $665 million located offshore. And our net cash position was approximately $385 million at the end of June.","During the first half of the year, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for a total of $82 million. We had approximately 1.5 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authority at the end of the second quarter. This morning, we announced an increase in the midpoint of our 2016 EPS guidance in a range between $3.58 and $3.64 per share. The midpoint of our EPS guidance represents a 14% increase in EPS compared with our 2015 results.","Please turn to slide nine for several 2016 assumptions. We expect our cash flow from operations in 2016 to be approximately $340 million, which is similar to 2015. We expect higher earnings will be offset by higher outlays for working capital this year compared with 2015. Due to the strong growth of our water treatment business in China, we will reach the capacity of our existing leased facility in the next few years.","Our 2016 capital spending plans of $105 million to $115 million for the total year include approximately $20 million related to construction of a new water treatment manufacturing and air purification assembly facility in China. Total cost for the facility, which is expected to be completed in 2018, will be approximately $65 million. In addition, we will complete capacity expansion at two North America plants in 2016 at a cost of approximately $7 million.","Our 2016 capital spending plan also includes approximately $10 million to support the ERP implementation. Our depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2016. We successfully completed three ERP go-live milestones since 2014. We expect to have converted the vast majority of our North America plant sites by the end of 2016.","Expenses related to our ERP implementation were about $16 million in 2015 and are projected to be approximately $25 million in 2016, higher than the previous year due to the large number of scheduled go-live events in 2016. We had expenses of approximately $9.5 million in the first half of 2016, which was comparable to 2015.","Our corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $47 million in 2016, higher than the $43 million in 2015, primarily due to higher expenses at our Corporate Technology Center and expected lower interest rate than last year on cash deposits in China. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 30% in 2016, slightly higher than the 2015 rate.","We expect to continue to repurchase shares at a value equal to our free cash flow after dividend or approximately $175 million in 2016. This is consistent with our stated policy to maintain our net cash balance at approximately $350 million. As a result, we expect our average diluted outstanding shares for the year will be slightly greater than 88 million. Primarily as a result of continued strong cash flow and escalating PBGC premiums, we expect to make a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of $30 million in the third quarter. The after-tax impact to our cash flow is approximately $18.5 million.","I will now turn the call back to Ajita, who will summarize the business assumptions and our 2016 outlook and our growth strategy beginning on slide 10. Ajita?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John. We expect that our businesses will collectively grow approximately 8% to 8.5% in local currency and approximately 6% to 6.5% in U.S. dollars in 2016. The assumptions for currency underlying our organic growth forecasts are at current rates, with the exception of continued depreciation of the China currency rate to RMB6.80 per $1 in the fourth quarter.","Specific to our North America segment, our announced 5% to 8% price increase on wholesale U.S. water heaters will take effect on August 1. We expect steel prices to remain firm, as they are up over $250 a ton since the beginning of the year. Partially offset by the August 1 price increase, steel will have a progressively negative impact on North America margin in the second half of the year.","We expect U.S. residential water heater industry volumes will remain constant in 2016 at 2015 levels of 8.9 million units, including tankless. This forecast is lower than our earlier projection as the industry volumes in the first half of the year were lower than we expected. We continue to see a noteworthy trend emerge in the commercial water heater industry.","The majority of the growth in commercial industry units so far in 2016 has been in the 55 gallon to 90-gallon electric category. You may recall similarly sized electric residential units were discontinued by NAECA III. Driven by continued growth in the small electric category, we expect U.S. commercial water heater industry volume will grow 35,000 units to 40,000 units in 2016 after strong growth in 2015.","Lochinvar boiler sales increased 10% in the first half of the year and were partially offset by lower residential water heater volume, which experienced difficult comps to 2015. The net result was an increase in Lochinvar-branded product sales in the first half of the year, up 2%. Based on the first half of the year, we expect Lochinvar-branded sales will grow approximately 6% for the total year, implying that we expect sales in the second half of the year for Lochinvar will grow about 10%.","We expect the historical transition from lower efficiency, non-condensing boilers to higher efficiency, condensing boilers to continue. This long-term trend, coupled with new product introduction and normalization of residential water heater volume, gives us confidence to project a 10% growth rate for Lochinvar-branded sales in 2017 and beyond.","As John previously noted, our ERP implementation costs are expected to be $9 million higher than in 2015. The additional cost in the second half of 2016 will negatively impact North America margin by more than 50 basis points compared with the first half of 2016. These factors, in addition to the assumptions John discussed earlier, lead to our expectation that our North America segment operating margin will be between 21.5% and 22% in 2016.","Some assumptions specific to our Rest of World segment. We are a consumer products company in China which distinguishes us from most industrial companies operating in China. In local currency, our sales in China have grown by 18% in 2014, 16% in 2015 and 16% in the first half of this year, despite a softer China economy. We have various growth drivers underpinning our China business which give us confidence to project an annual growth rate of approximately 15% in local currency for 2016.","These drivers include overall water heater market growth driven by household formation and an emerging replacement market, geographic expansion, market share gains, growth in water treatment and air purification products, and improved product mix. We expect Rest of World segment operating margin in 2016 to be similar to last year's margin of 13%.","I'm moving on to slide 11 now. Especially in these volatile and uncertain economic times, we believe our long-term annual 8% organic growth potential and our stable defensive replacement market, which we believe represent approximately 85% of North America water heater and boiler volumes, positively differentiates AOS among other industrial companies. Coupled with growth and stability, we have a strong balance sheet poised to take advantage of strategic acquisitions that adds shareholder value as well as allow us to return cash to shareholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, we are available for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is open.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. I guess the first question I would have is maybe you could just amplify your comments around the price increases that you're going to be pushing through in August and kind of your thoughts about the cadence of volumes for the back half of the year in the North American business. How we should be thinking about that?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, North America volumes, I guess, first half of the year to second half of the year we would actually expect to be relatively similar. The third quarter is traditionally quite a bit lighter than the fourth quarter but this year, well, we think in all it would be lightly less because of the price increases, et cetera. So, that's how we would kind of view the North America volumes. Obviously, very favorable comps compared to the last half of the year 2015, the opposite of what we had in the first half. So, that certainly will result in an increase of year-over-year. With respect to the price increase, we talked about it. I think we put out an 8-K and we said it's effective H1. Obviously, there can be some pre-buys, so it might ultimately be a little bit later in the quarter, but that's effective H1.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","You would expect some kind of modest pre-buy in association with that?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think that's typically what happened.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then my follow-up question I think would be just stepping back, obviously, continued commitment to share repurchase. Stock continues to work. You guys continue to perform. But, I guess, not the concern, but I guess the \u2013 what's out there remains capital allocation for doing just kind of a very high potential deal in M&A. And could you talk about the opportunity set there because it seems like it's perpetually very challenged?","I mean, Lochinvar was obviously immediately a home run. But you've got a good, strong balance sheet. You've got a very high stock price. You've got opportunities to redeploy the capital aside from share repurchase. Could you talk about the capital allocation front? And are we any closer to something a little more dynamic in terms of a strategic deal right now?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'll start and then, Ajita, you can -","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Kind of fill in. We've taken the position that, with our current balance sheet, we have enough in our war chest to do transactions. So, we've said we're going to leave our net cash position about $350 million. And we'll split that up between dividends and stock repurchase. And we've also said that we're going to be disciplined. We've said all along our preference would be to do a deal. We think that's the best value we can provide to shareholders if we do the right deal. And we've said we'll be disciplined. And, quite frankly, there are opportunities out there. And as long as you can get synergies \u2013 and we're holding steadfast. We need to get proper returns to return our cost of capital. So both Ajita and I want to do deals but we want to do the right deal.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I think -","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","What's your theoretical constraint on a deal? Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you, Ajita.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. Go ahead.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Well, what's your theoretical \u2013 how much could you deploy on a deal given \u2013 what's your walk and chew gum number in terms of being able to deploy and then what's your existing cash generation and your comfortable leverage ratio?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We said we'd be comfortable getting up to 35%. That's the capital. So, that leaves you quite a real bit of room there. You have a $600-some million offshore that we could also do. So, I think, realistically, we certainly have over $1 billion of available capacity.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, just to add on to a little bit of what John said. We are very comfortable with having the ability to do a large or a number of acquisitions up to about $1 billion. And what we've also said in terms of our capital allocation strategy is that we're not going to add to our cash reserves. And as we generate cash, we're going to be buying back stock approximately equal to our cash flow, so \u2013 to our free cash flow. So, I think, we are very comfortable with that position. And, again, as John said, there are opportunities out there. But we are going to be strategic and disciplined in terms of our approach.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Charlie Brady from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys, and Pat.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Just on the North America margin outlook second half over first half, it looks like to get to you at the high-end of that range you've laid out for North America \u2013 it's about 160 basis point, 170 basis point year-over-year second half versus first half decline. Is that entirely due to your commentary about steel pricing or steel cost rather being a greater headwind as you go through the year or are there other some factors going on in there?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think, there's a couple of things going on. Number one is ERP spending is higher in the last half of the year than the first half. So, we've said that will affect margins by over 50 basis points compared to the first half of the year. And I think the other biggest factor is what you alluded to. Steel is going to be effective July 1. The price increase will be effective some time probably mid-quarter. And then, also, anytime you put a price increase like this, it's customary for our industry to commit pricing to some projects. So, the entire pricing might not get in until later this year, early next year. So, I think, steel, certainly is the biggest factor.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So, you've got a lag on the pricing versus steel cost going up and you've probably got some pre-buy which skews the volume a little earlier?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Price hit. Got it. Okay. That's all for me. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Mike (sic) [David].","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Just with respect to the residential water heater business, can you just discuss any differences you're seeing in growth patterns between wholesale and retail?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll start. Wholesale is growing a little bit better than retail. There might have been some \u2013 and I'd say the opposite happened last year. I think retail probably grew a little bit more than wholesale. So, I think, you have that flip-back going on. But I don't think it's dramatic either way, if you will.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The ratios really haven't changed much.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, right, not significantly.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And just further to that point is are you seeing disparity within your retailer mix that would raise concerns or is it pretty even?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. Not really. I mean I talked to our salespeople last couple days and where there is disparity is there is some geographic mix. I mean the Southeast is very strong. The Midwest isn't as strong. So, I mean, you have some of those things going on. I think that the comments they made to me as much were the market's steady. I'm not going to tell you it's robust, but they also said it's not weak. And our forecast of flat to last year results in us taking down our unit volumes by about 100,000 to 150,000, but in total that's less than 2% of the market. So, it kind of is what it is.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Right. Second question just on China. Your best assessment of China's market unit growth rate in second quarter and what are you assuming for the second half in your EPS guidance?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Unit growth, I don't have \u2013 oh, yes, I mean, it depends what sector you're talking about. So, water treatment was up 30%, very strong. Our instantaneous gas very strong. We're still a little bit on the Combi Boiler and the commercial a little bit behind. And the electric is up.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So it's -","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And the mix in the first half is in local currency about a 16% increase.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And there is some pricing in there because average unit prices have gone up, as we've talked about, because with the new products we try to make sure that, with enhanced features and benefits, we are driving unit prices up. So the 16% is a combination of a little bit of pricing and unit volumes going up.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, I mean, I think if you look at the last half, we're probably \u2013 given our 15% and we're up 16%. We're a little bit lower than the last half of the year, but that's just difficult comps quarter-to-quarter. So we kind of look at it on an annual basis.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. I guess just to that point, within that 15% second half, are you expecting a slightly better category and maybe just changes in terms of share and pricing or just if you could deconstruct that for us?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I think it's pretty much the same thing. As water treatment continues to do very well, we would hope commercial will come back a little bit more in the second half of the year. We're introducing a new product there. But all in all, I don't see anything dramatically moving.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. We have new products. We have Series 10 coming out in electric. We have an enhanced portfolio of air purification products. And that's a seasonal product, so that when it gets to the fourth quarter, December, January, is where you see the high volumes there. So, overall, pretty much continuation of the same.","One thing I want to add in terms of \u2013 just to add some color to your question. When it comes to water treatment, which is probably the business segment that's growing the fastest, the penetration of that product in households in China is very low. It's single-digit. And that's part of what's driving this 30%-plus growth rate in the marketplace. And we have a high share position. And we continue to grow. So we are very bullish about the opportunities in that segment also.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, I guess if you look at that first half margin for Rest of World, it looks about 13% and we're expecting the last half and the full year to be 13%. So, we'll come in relatively similar.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Right. Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group. Your line is open.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Good morning, gentlemen, and Pat.","Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Bill.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Can we touch base a little bit on Lochinvar here? In your slide deck, you said that product sales growth of about 6% but yet your commentary was voicing first half of this year 10% and second half 10%. This is predominantly a North American play. I'm just trying to get a sense on how is it progressing and have we started to consider bringing this internationally.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'll try to clarify the numbers. Maybe we didn't clarify them quite correctly. So, we really split it into, I'll say, two segments. One is I call their core business, which is the boiler business \u2013 residential, commercial boilers. And we said year-to-date that was up about 10%, okay. But they do have, as you know, a standard commercial and a residential business, and that residential business the first half of the year was down 18%.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Residential water heater.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Residential water heaters. So what we said is, for the first half of the year, the total Lochinvar was up 2%.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Okay. Got you.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Then we went to the second half of the year and we said the run rate, we think, will be at about a 10% run rate for the second half of the year, again, led by boilers, which will be up double-digits. And residential will again have some drape but not as much. So, what we've said is, that gets us to kind of that 6% for the year, less than we expected. And, quite frankly, we just didn't build in the residential volatility that we saw. We had a very strong residential last year and we're seeing it come back.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. And that's a key point there too because the residential water heater business for Lochinvar was very strong in the first half of last year. So they had tough comp. And so, we see it getting back on track in the second half.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The other thing I'll say is as we look at our boiler business, we appear to be getting market share. So we're very pleased with that.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Okay. The aftermarket there, has that been picking up as well?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Up by 6%, up a little bit. Not dramatic.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Okay. And finally, steel prices. The Q is not out yet. Just wondering. Do you take this opportunity or where are you in terms of positioning yourself? I know about the price increase, but more in essence on hedging tactics going forward.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we talked about it. We've done some hedges on steel. It's not a very liquid market. And we have put some hedges in place that really didn't have much effect at all on the second quarter. And it's just difficult given the liquidity to do much. You have to have a \u2013 to be a buyer, you have to have a seller. And it's not a liquid market. It's developing. But we have put some hedges in place.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alvaro Lacayo from Gabelli Company. Your line is open.","Alvaro Lacayo - G.research LLC","Good morning, everyone.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Alvaro Lacayo - G.research LLC","Just a quick \u2013 just some more clarity around a flat volume for residential water heater expectation. If you could just comment on the clarity you have into the market and maybe some commentary around sell-in versus sell-out. And you mentioned there is some pre-buy. Have you already seen some evidence of that?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I guess, what I would say and we haven't been very clairvoyant on that, but I would say that when I talked to our salespeople, they think that inventory levels are reasonable. And they'll actually be a little elevated obviously at the end of July because of the pre-buy which we expected. But all in all, inventory levels are reasonable. I think the myth was probably that the inventory levels were just much higher last year than we expected.","I mean, Ajita talked in the first conference call that contract is pre-bought. That normally doesn't happen. We've actually seen some NAECA II products sold online recently. So, there's still some out there. But as our people look and talk to their customers, I think, I'd be repeating myself, but it's steady. Our completions are moving the way that was expected. And I think we're relatively comfortable with flat second half of the year compared to first half of the year. And we'll see.","Alvaro Lacayo - G.research LLC","Okay. And then, secondly, just the organic growth assumption on Q2 versus Q1, it's down a little bit. Is that just the reflection of maybe a little bit lower volume on the residential water heater or are there other elements at play here?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think, it's two things. We've changed our assumptions for currency from the first quarter. And that probably caused us $10 million, $12 million. I mean, the RMB has moved faster than what we thought. And so, we're assuming right now RMB6.7 kind of in the third quarter, RMB6.8 the fourth quarter. And that's up from our original assumptions. And I think the other adjustment would be the residential volumes.","Alvaro Lacayo - G.research LLC","Got it. And the acceleration in the back half of Lochinvar is just purely comps related from the residential water unit?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, not clearly. But I guess I'd say what happens is we don't have as much drag from residential, but the boiler business continues to do what it's been doing. Like I said the first half of the year up 10% and we expect the second half of the year to be up more than 10%. And then you throw in, yes, it does have favorable comps just like our North America water heater business does, so yes.","Alvaro Lacayo - G.research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","HI. Good morning.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, the expectation that you guys have for the full year residential water heater business, now, I'm not privy, I don't have it in my hands the tankless side. But it would suggest that the water heater side residential your expectation for the second half \u2013 year-end volumes are up more than 10%, which seems reasonable given the comparisons and what have you. I guess my question is, is that we're kind of \u2013 this has been a pretty long de-stock following the pre-buy, looking in your earlier comments. And what I'm wondering here is we're at like 7.8 million units trailing 12 months. That's a number we haven't seen since, well, three years ago. So, I'm wondering if there's anything else that you think is going on in the channels that might have gotten us to this level. They seem to be leaner than lean, but is there more going on in your view?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I guess what I would say is, repeating myself, it turned out that the volumes were much higher in the pre-buy starting in 2014 and 2015. I think when we step back, Scott, we still look at \u2013 we had a run rate in this industry 2010 to 2012 about 8.1 million units. We're up to this year and last year we're staying about 8.9 million units when you include tankless in there. And completions have probably added probably 400,000. So, we've had some replacement growth in there. And I think our people are comfortable with the estimates we have in the last half of the year but -","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the pre-buy \u2013 as John said, the pre-buy was greater than we thought. And the feedback we are getting from the marketplace is there are now distributors. There are run rates. They're saying, hey, things are okay.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's fine. So, there's really no change in your view that there is this still large amount of pent-up demand because the residential water heater volumes have still a ways to go catch-up-wise from how wicked bad it was last cycle. So, you're still thinking that the under-build on starts in particular still suggests that there is a significant amount of units of pent-up demand. Do you still \u2013 you're holding to that?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Long-term, yeah.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes, agreed.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Long-term, yeah. In terms of current run rate, things are okay. But long-term the fact is if you go, do the math in terms of the overbuild before the recession and the housing starts since then, there's a deficit in housing. And like I've spoken before, we don't think it's going to come back quickly but it will come back in terms of steady growth over the long haul. And, frankly, we prefer that.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Yeah. Got it. My second question is very simple. It's on the Rest of World margins which have been kind of like you get volume leverage and then you spend it and you \u2013 this is my phrase, not yours. You kind of manage the earnings of that business really well. I guess, the question is, at what point does Rest of World spending start to comp a little bit more easily and Rest of World margin actually starts to benefit from the volume leverage that you're generating?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think you're right. We have been investing. And the level of investment in new businesses in the last few months has been a little higher than what we've done in the past. We still have air purification, which is an investment. We've gotten into commercial water treatment, which is an investment. We are investing in e-commerce business, which is growing at warp speed. I mean, it is just growing very fast. And we're also investing in terms of going into second tier and third tier cities, the smaller cities. So, we do have a lot going on right now. But longer-term, you should see an increasing leverage, an increasing profitability coming out of the China business as we continue to grow. And what we are doing now are investments to make sure that we are fueling that growth out into the future.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got you.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Because we continue to believe that our brand and distribution in China and our footprint in China has significant upside potential as we expand our categories and continue to grow in the categories we're in.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Just to emphasize, I think, China is having a great year. So, one, it doesn't affect their margins, but their currency has affected their absolute profits by $6 million to $7 million. And we've chosen to invest in two businesses specifically that Ajita talked about, air purification, which will probably lose an additional $3 million over last year and commercial water heating, which will probably lose $3 million over last year because we weren't in it. But we think, long-term, both those businesses can be very attractive.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You meant commercial water treatment?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, commercial water treatment, yeah.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. That's all I had.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sam Eisner from Goldman & Sachs (sic) [Goldman Sachs]. Your line is open.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Thanks and good morning, everyone.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. So, if I look at your trailing 12 months operating profits in North America and the margins there, you're at roughly 22.5%. That's up from this time last year, on LTM basis up at 17%. So, this is now four quarters in a row where you generated north of 20% EBIT margins within North America. I was wondering if you could parse out how much would be isolated just the raw material tailwind. How much that really has been to you, guys? Because obviously now we're starting to lap some of those savings. So, I was wondering if you could just isolate how big the steel tailwind has been for you guys on an LTM basis.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't have that data. I mean, you've got things going on, commercial up and down during that time period. Clearly, steel was beneficial for us over the last three quarters, I'd say. But I don't have any data that would parse that out.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You have Symphony cost going plus and minus during \u2013 I mean not just the SAP cost going plus or minus. So, there's a lot of variables. But certainly steel was beneficial to us in the last three quarters.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And the timing differences too.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And you've probably seen changes in there -","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think changes, timing differences, so there are lots of puts and takes in that.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And maybe to ask a forward-looking question. You've given some margin targets for the remainder of 2016. You gave us kind of the organic growth medium-term algorithm. But is there a way to think about what the medium-term algorithm would be for margin profiles for North America and Rest of World?","Going back to the last question, should we expect some type of harvest mode for Rest of World at some point in the future? Is a 22% trailing 12-month operating margin in North America the right way that we should think about the long-term profitability of that segment? Perhaps you could just put some parameters around the way that we should think about kind of the medium-term algorithm for you, guys.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I guess I'll say it this way. We haven't done our 2017 plan yet. I think the full year of 21.5% to 22% is a reasonable starting point to look at. Again, by that time, the entire price increase will be in, et cetera. Symphony, we'll get some inventory SAP. We get some benefits. By the way, internally, we call SAP Symphony. That's why I keep using that word. We'll get some benefits from that next year. So, again, we really haven't done our plan to really determine. But I don't think that's an unreasonable starting off point.","Rest of World, it just depends on some of these businesses that we've talked about that have had some issues, if you will, partly because they're starting out such as commercial water treatment. I won't call it an issue. We're getting in to do business. We've got to make an investment. Air purifiers, we're getting into new business. We've got to make the investment.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Actually, when it comes to volume and when it comes to the growth of both those businesses, I'm very pleased about how it's going.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But we haven't put out any long-term aspirations for Rest of World except that Ajita and I are both in agreement that we ultimately have to grow those margins. And we do that by leveraging SG&A. We do that by improving performance in India. And we do that in performing some of these businesses that we've investing in.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then I realize that your price increase is just about to take effect in a few days here but I was curious with your wholesale customers what the conversations have been up until this point. Is anybody pushing back on that? Are you seeing that they are willing to accept 5% to 8%? Maybe you can give us some kind of clarity on what expected realization off that 5% to 8% would ultimately be? Thanks.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't know about you, Ajita, I have not heard any negative feedbacks. Obviously, steel is up. Cold rolled is up $300 a ton from the beginning of the year. Hot rolled is up $200 a ton from the end of the year. So it's been significant increases in steel.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think our distributors expected it and it's very little conversation.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Maczka from BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets","Can we just do a clarification on the ERP spend expectations for the year? So on a full year basis we'll be $9 million higher this year than last year. Is Q4 a very heavy spend quarter in the back half, a heavier spend quarter and any sense yet on how much that declines into next year?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So, yes, I'll try to clarify it. First half of the year we spent about $9.5 million. That was very similar to last year's first half of the year. Okay. The second half of the year then we'll spend a delta of $15 million, $15.5 million. That's going to be about $9 million more than the prior year. And I would tell you we will be spending that $15 million or $16 million a little bit heavier in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. So, does that clarify it this year?","Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets","It sure does.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So, then, when you go into 2017, our expectation \u2013 and, again, we haven't done our planning process, but I would think a reasonable run rate is going to be closer to $15 million versus the $25 million. Now, with one caveat, we have not made a decision on what we're doing internationally. I think we've talked on this call that China has a good ERP system. So, at this point, we'll see where we go. It probably is not necessary to put SAP into China. And with that caveat, I would say we think a reasonable run rate would be $15 million. And that kind of covers the amortization, that covers the hosting cost, that covers the service, and those sorts of things.","Kevin Richard Maczka - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, John. Very helpful. Thank you.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bhupender Bohra from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","First question on China here. We have seen like year-to-date now the organic sales growth about like 16%. Could you give us like the second quarter the core water heater sales as well as the water treatment and air purifier?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Air purifier was not much. It was up probably $1 million, but that's off a very low base because I think that the two big quarters for air purifiers are the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So, it was up. It's doing well. Ajita talked about a new project we've introduced. We'll see how successful it is in the \u2013 that's the first point. It's going to be significant is in the fourth quarter. I would say, in local currency, electric was up. Gas was up more than that. And water treatment was up 30%.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Do you have numbers for water heater, like electric and gas, on an organic basis?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Combination, you think, Pat, probably 5%, 6%, 7%? I guess the two combined.","Patricia K. Ackerman - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations","Yes. Right.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So, somewhat in line with the market growth, what you've been -","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think we're very consistent when we look at our market share. And if you're getting at our first growth situation where we talk about the market growing at 7%, the data we've got in our appliances, of which water heaters are a part of that, grew a little bit more than 7%. And certainly all the share data we see we are maintaining share in electric and gaining share in gas.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And other indicators we look at like residential square footage of residential sales, home sales is up nicely, 20%-plus. There's no direct correlation we see, but we track those numbers because all of those impact what our demand is going to be.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Everything we see in China, the move to the consumer-driven economy, retail sales numbers, consumption, all seem in place. And then we've said many times on this call, we're a consumer products company in China.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And the other question was around North America commercial products, commercial water heaters. Maybe, Ajita, you talked about the shift and we have seen that in the air dryer numbers here from the residential electric to the commercial electric here. How should we think about like from all-in perspective and when does that anniversary, because we're seeing growth rates of like 70% or 60% like month-over-month here at least the last two months, three months here?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it anniversaries probably at the end of the quarter. But I should emphasize there's two things that could be happening. One is residential clients could be buying commercial units, but there were also smaller commercial customers who, gas stations, et cetera, that very easily could have been buying residential products and can't now. But you're right, almost all of the growth has been in that 55-gallon to less than 90 gallons and that probably continues through the first quarter of next year.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Okay. And I believe you guys actually introduced a new product in that particular channel here on the commercial side. I think Pat was talking about it earlier this year. How is that doing from market share perspective, especially on the commercial side?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We were late getting into that segment on the commercial side. And we have products in there now. And they're doing well.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Okay. And lastly on the North America residential here, I've done some channel checks here. Like people, some of the wholesalers have been talking about some good traction in the tankless water heater because of the NAECA III regulation kind of made, as you said, like an 80% changes to your SKUs. So, have you heard anything on that? It's a pretty small category, about 0.5 million in North America. Have you seen some more traction in that category and any thinking about the medium-term growth in that particular category?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, it's grown 500,000 last year. It will probably be 550,000 or so this year. As we've talked about in the past, it's more new rather than retrofit because it's more expensive. I will also tell you that tankless unit is more expensive than our tank unit. And so, there is some growth in it. We don't expect it to be enormous. We have a product in that category. So we're covered in that category either way.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, either way. So, this year, if you look at the first part of this year, tankless has gained market share faster. I mean, tankless has gained. It's growing faster than the tank types. From our perspective, we are actually gaining market share in the tankless. So, either way, from our perspective, yes, you've got both categories. We are covered in both categories and somewhat indifferent as to which grows faster.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Okay. And any reason behind why year-to-date it has grown faster than the tank?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think a lot of it is driven by NAECA III and the fact that you had that significant buy-in last year of the tank type.","Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Okay. Got it. That's all I have. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Just on China, a couple questions. One, can you just talk a little bit more about your investment in commercial water treatment? What you think the opportunity is, growth rates long-term? And then also, Ajita, you mentioned e-commerce growing dramatically. What's driving that market? How big is that business for you? What do you see as the growth rates?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll answer the last one.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You take the first one. The last year, we sold about $140 million in e-commerce. We're up year-to-date very nicely. Our expectation is we'll be over $180 million this year. I can't say what's driving it as much as obviously the Chinese consumer is very willing to buy online. And all the statistics show that that they're more willing to do that than the U.S. consumer, et cetera. And it's an opportunity for us because we have good distributions. So, when they buy online, we have the capability to install the product, and we're doing that. So, our management team saw this in China, saw this about four years or five years ago and started putting in the infrastructure. And we're doing advertising on the net, et cetera. So, we think we're in very good position with respect to that category.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And we've added significant amount of people and skill sets in terms of being able to sell our products online, merchandise our products online, do the search engine optimization, so that our products pop up and people do the searches. And interesting statistic, more than 75% of online sales are done through your smartphone, okay, in China. So, that takes another skill set in terms of how you market and merchandise your products on the smartphone because obviously the amount of information you can put on the screen is so much less. But so, we are building all those skill sets and this channel is growing very fast. It's another channel that allows us to reach new customers and especially customers in smaller cities. So, I mean the fast growth is really something that we like and we are leveraging it as quickly as we can.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The answer to your first question on water treatment, we entered that market \u2013 commercial water treatment, we entered that market this year. It's a little bit different model. It's a lease model and typically it's a five-year type lease. So, unfortunately, you don't get the benefit of the sales upfront. You obviously don't \u2013 you only have one-fifth of cost, but you do have all the SG&A, et cetera, to get in there. So, that's going to be a little bit of a drag, but we think it's a natural extension of -","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. And it's an annuity based.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Our capabilities to -","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Once you're in, the lease goes on and so annuity ends. The products will last longer than the amortization.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. So, we think it's just a natural extension of our residential water treatment business.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Your line is open.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Just a couple more in the interest of time. I mean, have you sized, just in terms of annual numbers for 2016 for your water treatment business here, purification business. You've given us some numbers in the past. And then now given the growth rates we've seen, whether you can give us those updated numbers? And then, I have a follow-up on India.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, last year, in our branded business we sold about $110 million. We would expect to be close to 30%, although again, you have currency playing issues there. But we are certainly expecting to be in that $135 million to $140 million range, I would say, for our business for water treatment. And that's after a fair amount of currency drag. You throw in, in Vietnam, we'll sell $3 million or so this year. India we'll probably sell about $3 million this year. And Turkey we'll sell $5 million to $6 million this year. And then, our base legacy business that we bought will sell about $15 million. So, water treatment is starting to get to a reasonable scale, and we think there's potential in that area.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Air purification is still, what, $10 million to $15 million, what are we talking about?","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, air purification last year was $10 million and we said that we expect it to double this year.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, $20 million-ish. And then just in terms of \u2013 you did cite the losses in India. Could you speak to them? And is there any kind of gut check there around the level of investment, the market, et cetera, or maybe you can just give us some metrics around the growth opportunity there, an update?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that our comps have been a little higher because we are expanding into more cities in water treatment. And that's costing us more. And also one of the things that's happened in India is that it's been a very, very hot summer. And so the water heater sales volume \u2013 the whole market is lower than we anticipated when we went into the year. So, it's a combination of those two that \u2013 where our expenses have been a little higher than we anticipated.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We have put in a new management team. And I think we're impressed internally in the last six months or a year. And there's certainly a marketing focus. And we're making the investment in the water treatment because as we talked about it in the past we think it's a larger category than water heater.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And can you size what you think the revenues will be this year and what the loss will be or have you probably -","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. I think we've said that last year revenues were about $15 million to $16 million. This year, it will be about $20 million. And we said last year we lost $9 million. And we'll probably lose a little bit more than that this year.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So, there's no major change to those assumptions?","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. Nothing from what we've said earlier in the year.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Well, we're up against the hour. We'll leave it there.","John J. Kita - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good. Thank you.","Ajita G. Rajendra - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's Q&A session.
